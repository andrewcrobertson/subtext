1
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,549
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,726
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,940
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,446
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:42,579
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,294
What is the most resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,923
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,758
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,136
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--

10
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,513
An idea.

11
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,308
Resilient. Highly contagious.

12
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,478
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

13
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,192
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

14
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,610
Right in there somewhere.

15
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,320
For someone like you to steal?

16
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,448
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

17
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,034
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

18
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,452
It's called extraction.

19
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,164
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

20
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,834
...from even the most skilled extractor.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,168
How can you do that?

22
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,171
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

23
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,050
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

24
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,137
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

25
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,639
...your defense is never down.

26
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,477
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

27
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,981
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

28
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,483
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,570
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

30
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,072
...I need to know what's in that safe.

31
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,701
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

32
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,208
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

33
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,712
He knows.

34
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,216
What's going on up there?

35
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,065
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

36
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,817
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

37
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,486
The information is in the safe.

38
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,821
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

39
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,241
What's she doing here?

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,038
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

41
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,249
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

42
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,345
If I jumped, would I survive?

43
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,100
With a clean dive, perhaps.

44
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,935
Mal, what are you doing here?

45
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,312
I thought you might be missing me.

46
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,772
You know that I am.

47
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,776
But I can't trust you anymore.

48
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,903
So what?

49
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,657
Looks like Arthur's taste.

50
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,452
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

51
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,872
Please, have a seat.

52
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,048
Tell me...

53
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,009
...do the children miss me?

54
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,056
You can't imagine.

55
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,312
What are you doing?

56
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,022
Just getting some fresh air.

57
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,190
Stay where you are, Mal.

58
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,748
Goddamn it.

59
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,186
Turn around.

60
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,396
The gun, Dom.

61
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,781
Please.

62
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,254
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

63
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,091
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

64
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,471
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

65
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,978
I want to know the name
of your employer.

66
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,859
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

67
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,486
That depends
on what you're threatening.

68
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,573
Killing him would just wake him up.

69
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,491
But pain...

70
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,330
Pain is in the mind.

71
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,252
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

72
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,767
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

73
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,353
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

74
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,538
He was close. Very close.

75
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,429
Stop him!

76
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,415
This isn't gonna work.
Wake him up.

77
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,188
He won't wake.

78
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,944
- Give him the kick.
- What?

79
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,529
Dunk him.

80
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,450
He's out.

81
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,790
You came prepared?

82
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,794
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

83
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,174
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

84
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,885
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

85
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,012
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

86
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,182
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

87
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,143
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

88
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,979
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

89
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,316
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

90
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,361
- Question is, Why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

91
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,490
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

92
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,368
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

93
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,079
But your deception was obvious.

94
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,374
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

95
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,795
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

96
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,089
We won't last two days.

97
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,217
Cobb?

98
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,554
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

99
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,474
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

100
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,731
I've always hated this carpet.

101
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,235
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

102
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,073
But very definitely made of wool.

103
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,617
Right now...

104
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,079
...I'm lying on polyester.

105
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,796
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

106
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,925
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

107
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,428
I'm still dreaming.

108
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,936
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

109
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,446
Dream within a dream?
I'm impressed.

110
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,201
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

111
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,620
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

112
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,205
We're not in your dream.

113
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,956
We're in mine.

114
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,968
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

115
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,471
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

116
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,765
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

117
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,016
That's enough.

118
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,644
You. What the hell was all that?

119
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,022
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

120
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,984
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

121
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,986
He's not gonna check every compartment.

122
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,780
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

123
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,699
Listen. Every man for himself.

124
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,066
Yes, hello?

125
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,903
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.</i>

126
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,032
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing?

127
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,409
<i>- Good.
- Okay, I guess.</i>

128
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,330
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

129
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?</i>

130
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:47,048
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

131
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,549
<i>Why?</i>

132
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:54,430
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

133
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,600
<i>Grandma says you're
never coming back.</i>

134
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,144
<i>Phillipa, is that you?</i>

135
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,439
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

136
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,316
<i>She's shaking her head.</i>

137
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,946
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

138
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>Daddy?</i>

139
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,783
Yeah, James?

140
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,618
<i>Is Mummy with you?</i>

141
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,456
James, we talked about this.

142
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,085
Mommy's not here anymore.

143
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,379
<i>Where?</i>

144
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,758
<i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye-bye.</i>

145
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,970
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

146
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,137
And you be good, you be--

147
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,858
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

148
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,200
Hey, are you okay?

149
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,244
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

150
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,830
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

151
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,250
Look, I'm... sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

152
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,004
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

153
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,673
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

154
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,300
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

155
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,219
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

156
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,639
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

157
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,684
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

158
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,105
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

159
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,481
Stateside.

160
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,191
Send my regards.

161
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,076
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

162
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,039
So I offer you the satisfaction.

163
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,545
It's not the way I deal with things.

164
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,685
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

165
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,563
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

166
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,081
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

167
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,085
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

168
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,462
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

169
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,506
...why can't you plant one there instead?

170
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,758
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

171
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,261
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

172
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,429
Elephants.

173
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,766
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

174
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,936
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

175
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,314
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

176
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,945
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

177
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,781
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

178
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,991
Then you do have a choice.

179
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,952
Then I choose to leave, sir.

180
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,542
Tell the crew where you want to go.

181
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,881
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

182
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,137
How would you like to go home?

183
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,224
To America. To your children.

184
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,978
You can't fix that. No one can.

185
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,398
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

186
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,029
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

187
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,741
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

188
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,662
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

189
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,583
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

190
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,045
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

191
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,424
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

192
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,762
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

193
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,848
...I'd need a guarantee.

194
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,268
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

195
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,353
But I can.

196
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:16,525
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

197
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,779
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

198
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,532
...waiting to die alone?

199
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,915
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

200
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,883
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

201
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,387
This can't be done.

202
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,849
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

203
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,559
You don't know that.

204
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,729
I've done it before.

205
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,106
Who'd you do it to?

206
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,364
Why are we going to Paris?

207
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,659
We're gonna need a new architect.

208
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,636
You never did like your office, did you?

209
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,474
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

210
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,603
Is it safe for you to be here?

211
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,232
Extradition between France
and the United States...

212
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,609
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

213
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,529
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

214
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:48,200
Look, I... brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

215
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,953
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

216
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,123
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

217
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,126
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

218
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,794
I never taught you to be a thief.

219
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,171
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

220
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
But after what happened...

221
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,385
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

222
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,017
What are you doing here, Dom?

223
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,521
I think I found a way home.

224
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:21,275
It's a job for some very,
very powerful people.

225
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,904
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

226
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,990
But I need your help.

227
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,994
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

228
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,039
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

229
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,665
- Money.
- Not just money.

230
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,167
You remember.

231
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,587
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

232
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,505
...things that never existed...

233
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,884
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

234
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:52,222
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

235
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,350
They don't actually come into the dream.

236
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,811
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

237
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,188
Design it yourself.

238
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,359
Mal won't let me.

239
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,700
Come back to reality, Dom.

240
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,621
- Please.
- Reality.

241
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,540
Those kids, your grandchildren...

242
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,711
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

243
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,048
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

244
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,219
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

245
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,308
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

246
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,523
I've got somebody better.

247
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,732
<i>Ariadne?</i>

248
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,862
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

249
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,364
Pleased to meet you.

250
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:55,202
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

251
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,412
A work placement?

252
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,080
Not exactly.

253
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,581
I have a test for you.

254
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,418
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

255
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,212
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

256
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,590
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

257
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:16,348
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

258
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,435
Stop.

259
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,063
Again.

260
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,525
Stop.

261
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,780
You're gonna have to do better than that.

262
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,044
That's more like it.

263
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,151
<i>They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.</i>

264
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,986
<i>Now, that's when we're awake.</i>

265
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,156
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

266
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,324
Such as?

267
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,495
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

268
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,499
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

269
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,667
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

270
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,086
Genuine inspiration, right?

271
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,590
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

272
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:36,386
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

273
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,973
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

274
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,851
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

275
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,395
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

276
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,189
Now, this is where I need you.

277
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,733
You create the world of the dream.

278
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,280
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

279
00:26:55,447 --> 00:27:00,118
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

280
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,747
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

281
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,626
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

282
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,504
Let me ask you a question.

283
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,049
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

284
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,261
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

285
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,470
I guess, yeah.

286
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,222
So how did we end up here?

287
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,683
Well, we just came from the...

288
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,311
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

289
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,814
Where are you right now?

290
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,277
We're dreaming?

291
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,904
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

292
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,032
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

293
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
If it's just a dream,
then why are you--?

294
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,867
Because it's never
just a dream, is it?

295
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,329
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

296
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,706
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

297
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,585
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

298
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,878
...and then wake up.

299
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,963
How did architects become involved?

300
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,883
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

301
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,302
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

302
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,308
Five minutes? What--? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

303
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,727
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

304
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,730
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

305
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,275
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

306
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,071
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

307
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,913
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

308
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,748
Almost everything else is here too.

309
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,834
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

310
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,169
- Yours?
- Yes.

311
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,880
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

312
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,716
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

313
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,802
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

314
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,846
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

315
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,306
How else do you do it?

316
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,477
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

317
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,356
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

318
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,317
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

319
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,527
Well...

320
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:43,198
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

321
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,200
...but it's more about the feel of it.

322
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,830
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

323
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,748
It's something, isn't it?

324
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,125
Yes, it is.

325
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,609
Why are they all looking at me?

326
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,279
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

327
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,742
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

328
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,951
Converge?

329
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,204
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

330
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,040
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

331
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,043
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

332
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,128
Just you.

333
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,345
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

334
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,810
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

335
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,646
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

336
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,701
Very impressive.

337
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:47,966
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

338
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,468
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

339
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,055
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

340
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
You draw from stuff you know, right?

341
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:00,437
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

342
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,731
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

343
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,401
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

344
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,653
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

345
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,822
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

346
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,949
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

347
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,660
Hey, get off of her.
Back up. Back up.

348
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,454
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

349
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,581
- Let go! Let me go!
- Mal!

350
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,167
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

351
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,127
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

352
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,795
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

353
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,426
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

354
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,804
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

355
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,723
There was still time on the clock.

356
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,434
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

357
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,186
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

358
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,812
A totem, it's a small personal--

359
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,523
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

360
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:47,158
She's a real charmer.

361
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,320
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

362
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,240
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

363
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,868
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

364
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,286
- Like a coin?
- No.

365
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:03,124
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

366
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,128
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

367
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,466
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

368
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,468
That way,
when you look at your totem...

369
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,763
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

370
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,479
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

371
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,191
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

372
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:32,320
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

373
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,830
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

374
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,501
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

375
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,838
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

376
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,298
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

377
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,593
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

378
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,345
It's a necessary risk.

379
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,016
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

380
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,184
We need a forger.

381
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,446
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

382
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,031
You never know.

383
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,034
I'm gonna get you a drink.

384
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,537
You're buying.

385
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,337
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

386
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,465
How's your handwriting?

387
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,467
- It's versatile.
- Good.

388
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,885
Thank you very much.

389
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,887
Inception.

390
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,973
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me--

391
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,435
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

392
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,897
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

393
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:52,275
Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

394
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,152
He is good at what he does, right?

395
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,404
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

396
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
Not like you.

397
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,742
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

398
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,454
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

399
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:08,249
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

400
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,753
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

401
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,922
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

402
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,759
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

403
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,470
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

404
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,849
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

405
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,435
Right there you have
various political motivations...

406
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,604
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

407
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,606
But all of that stuff, it's...

408
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,651
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

409
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,320
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

410
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,072
Which is what?

411
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,449
The relationship with the father.

412
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,328
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

413
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,581
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

414
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,168
He... formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

415
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,628
Why don't you take me there?

416
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,881
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

417
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,508
Cobol Engineering.

418
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,010
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

419
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,721
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

420
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,517
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say... half an hour?

421
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,686
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

422
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,565
All right.

423
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,568
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

424
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,194
My God, it's you, isn't it?

425
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,824
No, it isn't you.

426
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,409
Not dreaming now, are you?

427
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,204
Get him!

428
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,846
There!

429
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,118
One <i>café.</i>

430
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,714
One <i>café.</i>

431
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,217
One <i>café.</i>

432
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,273
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

433
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,987
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

434
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,450
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

435
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,618
Different tail.

436
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,087
Cobb said you'd be back.

437
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,758
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

438
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,593
It's just...

439
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,430
...pure creation.

440
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,099
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

441
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,268
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

442
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,980
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

443
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,565
What kind of tricks?

444
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:04,235
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

445
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,323
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

446
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,657
The infinite staircase.

447
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,329
See?

448
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,543
Paradox.

449
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,128
So a closed loop like that...

450
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,381
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

451
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,508
But how big do these levels have to be?

452
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,845
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

453
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,432
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

454
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,017
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

455
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,518
And the better the maze...

456
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,354
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

457
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,814
Exactly.

458
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,693
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- You wait, they'll turn ugly.

459
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,197
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

460
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,449
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

461
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,119
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

462
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,705
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

463
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,956
Why?

464
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,375
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

465
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,087
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

466
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,423
- They're still together?
- No.

467
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,176
No, she's dead.

468
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,889
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

469
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,894
What was she like in real life?

470
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,938
She was lovely.

471
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,152
<i>- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.</i>

472
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,446
To formulate compounds for a job?

473
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,990
And to go into the field with us.

474
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,409
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

475
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,288
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

476
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,582
- Which are?
- Great depth.

477
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,002
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

478
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,798
Three.

479
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,552
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

480
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,681
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

481
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,517
A powerful sedative.

482
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,563
- How many team members?
- Five.

483
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,439
Six.

484
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,361
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

485
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,614
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

486
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,159
This time, it seems there is.

487
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,830
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

488
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,124
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

489
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,172
Perhaps you will not want to see.

490
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,718
After you.

491
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,022
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

492
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,982
They come every day to share the dream.

493
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,571
You see? Very stable.

494
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:03,331
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

495
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,665
In dream time?

496
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,502
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

497
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,964
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

498
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,927
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

499
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,012
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

500
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,058
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

501
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,520
They come to be woken up.

502
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,816
The dream has become their reality.

503
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,111
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

504
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,032
Let's see what you can do.

505
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,628
You know how to find me.

506
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,216
You know what you have to do.

507
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,555
Sharp, no?

508
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,949
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

509
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,245
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

510
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:36,424
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

511
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,467
What's your problem
with this Mr. Fischer?

512
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,261
That's not your concern.

513
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:45,016
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

514
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,767
You asked me for inception.

515
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,313
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

516
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,442
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

517
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,485
This idea will define him.

518
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,487
It may come to change...

519
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,948
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

520
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,453
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

521
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,705
And we can no longer compete.

522
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:11,334
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

523
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,878
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

524
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,632
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

525
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,343
That's where we come in.

526
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,804
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

527
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,682
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

528
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,352
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

529
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,730
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

530
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:37,068
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

531
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,488
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

532
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:45,159
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

533
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,704
I'm not smelling settlement here.
Take them down.

534
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,997
Mr. Browning...

535
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:54,001
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

536
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:01,008
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

537
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,593
Not sure that's necessary.

538
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,429
No, no, no. I think we should.

539
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,285
How is he?

540
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,872
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but--

541
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:37,545
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--

542
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,881
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

543
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,885
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

544
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,847
Leave that.

545
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,893
Here.

546
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,565
Must be a cherished memory of his.

547
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:03,237
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

548
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,072
Robert...

549
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,827
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

550
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,289
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative--
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

551
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,086
<i>The vultures are circling.</i>

552
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,674
<i>And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</i>

553
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,260
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

554
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:31,265
<i>...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</i>

555
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:35,269
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

556
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,689
<i>And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.</i>

557
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,691
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

558
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,361
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

559
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,447
So he gives himself the idea.

560
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:50,868
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

561
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,455
Eames, I am impressed.

562
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:58,167
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

563
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,524
Were you going under on your own?

564
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,194
No, no, I was just... running
some experiments.

565
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,321
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

566
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,157
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.

567
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,492
Here, let me take a look.

568
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,995
So you're learning?

569
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,666
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

570
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,669
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was...

571
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,004
It was Mal's, actually. This...

572
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,467
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

573
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,554
Just spin and spin.

574
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,015
Arthur told me she passed away.

575
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,019
How are the mazes coming along?

576
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,064
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

577
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,691
...that we are trying to access.

578
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:09,321
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

579
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,449
You know, I-- Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

580
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,371
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

581
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,706
Why is that so important?

582
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,874
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

583
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,377
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

584
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,214
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

585
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,800
You can't keep her out, can you?

586
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,219
- Right.
- You can't build...

587
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,723
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

588
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,058
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

589
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,061
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

590
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,439
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

591
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,566
No one said it's getting worse.

592
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,070
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

593
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,990
Why can't you go home?

594
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,120
Because they think I killed her.

595
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,626
- Thank you.
- For what?

596
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,086
For not asking whether I did.

597
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,422
"I will split up my father's empire."

598
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,801
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

599
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,763
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

600
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,475
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

601
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:23,437
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

602
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,023
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

603
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,777
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

604
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,696
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

605
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,450
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

606
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,120
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

607
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:44,208
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

608
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,128
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

609
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,130
All right, well, try this...

610
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,052
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

611
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,512
That might work.

612
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,848
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

613
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,975
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

614
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,104
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

615
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,397
Specificity?

616
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,399
Inception's not about being specific.

617
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,528
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

618
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,824
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

619
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,077
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

620
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:24,915
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

621
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,419
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

622
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,004
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

623
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,343
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

624
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,678
Sedation.

625
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,681
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

626
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,768
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

627
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,281
Good night.

628
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,075
<i>The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...</i>

629
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,202
<i>...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...</i>

630
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,582
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

631
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,877
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

632
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,589
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

633
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,883
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20--

634
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,927
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

635
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,764
It's a week, the first level down.

636
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,309
Six months the second level down,
and the third level--

637
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,894
That's 10 years.

638
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,732
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

639
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,275
Depends on the dream.

640
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,736
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

641
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,239
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

642
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,201
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

643
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,078
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

644
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,917
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

645
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,295
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

646
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,671
That's the clever part.

647
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,091
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

648
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:03,096
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

649
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,599
<i>Or tipping.</i>

650
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,437
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

651
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,483
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

652
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:25,869
<i>He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.</i>

653
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,038
<i>Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?</i>

654
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,458
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need--

655
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,544
We need at least a good 10 hours.

656
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,045
Sydney to Los Angeles.

657
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,634
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

658
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,970
He must be flying private, then.

659
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,640
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

660
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,059
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

661
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,686
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

662
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:54,064
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

663
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,734
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

664
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,486
I bought the airline.

665
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,823
It seemed neater.

666
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,244
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

667
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,039
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

668
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,214
You know how to find me.

669
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,134
You know what you have to do.

670
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,433
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

671
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,353
Of course I do.

672
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,940
You said you had a dream.

673
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,654
That we'd grow old together.

674
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,782
And we can.

675
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,415
You shouldn't be here.

676
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,631
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

677
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,009
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

678
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,974
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

679
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,278
Why do you do this to yourself?

680
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,365
It's the only way I can still dream.

681
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,327
Why is it so important to dream?

682
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,497
In my dreams, we're still together.

683
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,596
These aren't just dreams.

684
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,435
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

685
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,644
I know I did.

686
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,816
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

687
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,986
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

688
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,739
They're memories that I have to change.

689
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,451
Well, what's down there that you regret?

690
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,996
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

691
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,048
This is your house?

692
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,176
Mine and Mal's, yes.

693
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,053
Where is she?

694
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,722
She's already gone.

695
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,020
That's my son, James.

696
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:23,273
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

697
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,776
That's Phillipa.

698
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,195
I thought about calling out to them...

699
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,114
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

700
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:36,953
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

701
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,956
Right now or never, Cobb.

702
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,213
Then I start to panic.

703
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,091
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

704
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,260
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

705
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,930
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

706
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,140
But the moment's past.

707
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,729
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

708
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,774
As I'm about to call out to them...

709
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:07,901
...they run away.

710
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,907
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

711
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,451
The real world.

712
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,494
What are you doing here?

713
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,454
My name is--

714
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,916
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

715
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,510
I'm just trying to understand.

716
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,804
How could you understand?

717
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,141
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

718
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,312
To be half of a whole?

719
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,106
No.

720
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,568
I'll tell you a riddle.

721
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,322
You're waiting for a train.

722
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,534
A train that will take you far away.

723
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,872
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

724
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,167
...but you don't know for sure.

725
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,252
But it doesn't matter.

726
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,632
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

727
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,550
Because you'll be together.

728
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,679
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

729
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,266
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

730
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,768
What happened here?

731
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,522
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

732
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,025
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

733
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,403
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

734
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,031
I'll come back for you. I promise.

735
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:41,638
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

736
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,641
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

737
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,810
It's time.

738
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,397
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

739
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,732
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

740
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,152
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

741
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,779
All right.

742
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,408
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

743
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,744
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

744
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,457
And it doesn't have to be me...

745
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,919
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

746
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,427
Get us another seat on the plane.

747
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,517
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

748
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,354
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

749
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,232
Complete the job en route...

750
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,860
...I make one phone call from the plane...

751
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,946
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

752
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,171
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, absolutely.

753
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,922
Thank you.

754
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,834
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

755
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,878
Would you care for a drink?

756
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,338
Oh. Water, please.

757
01:02:39,286 --> 01:02:40,840
Same, please.

758
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,928
Thank you.

759
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,971
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

760
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:50,725
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

761
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,394
Yes, he...

762
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,355
He was my father.

763
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,818
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

764
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,447
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

765
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,949
Hey.

766
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,992
To your father.

767
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,829
May he rest in peace?

768
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,608
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

769
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,818
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

770
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,111
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

771
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,239
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

772
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:43,963
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.

773
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,231
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.

774
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,525
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

775
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,322
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

776
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,242
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

777
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,910
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

778
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,913
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?

779
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,209
Great.

780
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,632
Come on.

781
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,354
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

782
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,231
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

783
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,524
I'm afraid that it doesn't--

784
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,035
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

785
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,829
What the hell is going on?

786
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,793
This wasn't in the design.

787
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,087
Cobb?

788
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,380
Cobb?

789
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,474
Get him!

790
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,607
Are you all right?

791
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,942
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

792
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,028
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

793
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,446
Saito?

794
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,467
Get Fischer in the back room now.

795
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,470
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

796
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,389
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

797
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,307
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

798
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,893
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

799
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,020
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

800
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,814
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

801
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,649
Why the hell were we ambushed?

802
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,235
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

803
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,947
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

804
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,326
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

805
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,120
It should've shown in the research.

806
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,080
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

807
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,581
Don't tell me to calm down!

808
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,668
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

809
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,920
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

810
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,424
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

811
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,676
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

812
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,678
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

813
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:19,887
Put him out his misery.

814
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,890
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

815
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,184
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

816
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,228
No. It won't wake him up.

817
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:31,023
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

818
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,442
Not from this.

819
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,153
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

820
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,447
Right. So, what happens when we die?

821
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,449
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

822
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,160
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

823
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,580
- What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

824
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,958
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

825
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,044
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

826
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,088
Which, in our case, is just you.

827
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,966
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

828
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,552
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?

829
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,930
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

830
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,307
Let's get him upstairs.

831
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,393
Great.

832
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,896
Thank you.

833
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,816
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

834
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,443
And if we get killed...

835
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,863
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg?

836
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,580
Someone got first aid?

837
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,294
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

838
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:36,422
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

839
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,925
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

840
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,093
You knew about this
and went along with it?

841
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,303
I trusted him.

842
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,388
When? When he promised you
half his share?

843
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,808
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

844
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,061
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

845
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:53,648
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

846
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,733
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

847
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,946
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

848
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,448
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

849
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,076
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

850
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,119
I am sitting this one out on this level.

851
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,705
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

852
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,124
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

853
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:16,045
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

854
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,424
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

855
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,470
Downwards is the only way forwards.

856
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,139
Get ready.

857
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,475
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

858
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,400
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

859
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,486
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

860
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,947
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

861
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,157
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

862
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:47,952
I don't know any safe.

863
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,997
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

864
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,000
Tell us what it is.

865
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,586
I don't know.

866
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,676
We have it on good authority
you do know.

867
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,178
Yeah? Whose authority?

868
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,183
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

869
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:15,187
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

870
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,736
Useful?

871
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,529
Maybe.

872
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,781
You're on. You've got an hour.

873
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,199
An hour?

874
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,786
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

875
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,539
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

876
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,876
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

877
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,881
- What's that?
- Good authority.

878
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:47,803
Uncle Peter.

879
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,640
Just make them stop.

880
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,267
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

881
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:56,103
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

882
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,731
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

883
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,819
You have one hour. Start talking.

884
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,031
You all right?

885
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,242
You okay?

886
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,583
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

887
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,753
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

888
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,755
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

889
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,675
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

890
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,594
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

891
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,598
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

892
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,267
No, he never gave me any combination.

893
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,147
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

894
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,524
Well, what, then?

895
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,235
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

896
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:48,322
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

897
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,953
We didn't have very many...
meaningful experiences together.

898
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,163
Perhaps after your mother died.

899
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,544
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

900
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,175
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

901
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,678
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

902
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,556
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

903
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,560
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

904
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,313
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

905
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,732
And if he dies?

906
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,359
Worst-case scenario?

907
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:28,237
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

908
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,491
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

909
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,326
I appreciate that, Saito.

910
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,581
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

911
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,791
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

912
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,712
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

913
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:46,505
Filled with regret?

914
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,049
Waiting to die alone.

915
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:50,843
No.

916
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,012
I'll come back.

917
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,515
And we'll be young men together again.

918
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,522
Breathe.

919
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,734
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

920
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,819
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

921
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,865
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

922
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,533
All right. What is in the safe?

923
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,786
Something for you.

924
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,540
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

925
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,377
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

926
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,754
That's an alternate.

927
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,298
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

928
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,092
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

929
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,971
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

930
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,599
Destroying my whole inheritance?

931
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,437
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

932
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,275
He loved you, Robert.

933
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,486
In his own way.

934
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,446
In his own way.

935
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,282
At the end...

936
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,744
...he called me in to his deathbed.

937
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,080
He could barely speak.

938
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,418
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

939
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,548
He pulled me close.

940
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,302
And I could only make out...

941
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,596
...one word.

942
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,269
"Disappointed."

943
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,109
When were you in limbo?

944
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:35,197
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

945
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,741
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

946
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:42,079
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

947
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:46,292
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

948
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,878
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

949
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,838
...we're also going deeper into you.

950
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,967
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

951
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,431
We were working together.

952
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,268
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

953
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,728
I kept pushing things.

954
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:09,565
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

955
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:14,945
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

956
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,823
...that we could get trapped so deep...

957
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,994
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

958
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,122
<i>...we lost sight of what was real.</i>

959
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,756
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

960
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,384
<i>We did that for years.</i>

961
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,512
<i>We built our own world.</i>

962
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,557
How long were you stuck there?

963
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,852
Something like 50 years.

964
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,398
Jesus.

965
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,027
How could you stand it?

966
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,947
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

967
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,158
<i>The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.</i>

968
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:05,704
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

969
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,289
And what about for her?

970
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:14,672
<i>She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.</i>

971
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:21,303
<i>A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</i>

972
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,725
Limbo became her reality.

973
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,895
What happened when you woke up?

974
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:34,066
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

975
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,655
<i>...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?</i>

976
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,326
<i>I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.</i>

977
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,955
Eventually, she told me the truth.

978
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:51,750
<i>She was possessed by an idea.</i>

979
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:57,631
<i>This one very simple idea
that changed everything.</i>

980
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,260
That our world wasn't real.

981
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:06,432
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

982
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,351
...that in order to get back home...

983
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,396
...we had to kill ourselves.

984
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,489
<i>- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...</i>

985
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,659
<i>...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.</i>

986
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,536
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

987
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:28,954
I can tell the difference.

988
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,457
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

989
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,333
You don't know you're dreaming!

990
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,711
<i>She was certain
there was nothing I could do...</i>

991
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,715
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

992
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,721
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

993
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:52,394
<i>She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.</i>

994
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,256
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

995
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,677
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

996
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:30,307
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

997
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,184
No, I'm not.

998
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,436
Now, you listen to me.

999
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,274
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1000
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,360
Now, just step back inside.

1001
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,279
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1002
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,365
We've talked enough.

1003
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,119
- Ma|.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1004
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,996
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1005
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,044
We're gonna talk about this.

1006
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,088
All right?

1007
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:06,343
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1008
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,305
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1009
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,225
Take a second, think about our children.

1010
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,144
Think about James.

1011
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,521
Think about Phillipa, now.

1012
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,607
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1013
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,069
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1014
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,865
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1015
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,244
How you've threatened to kill me.

1016
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,666
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1017
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,585
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?

1018
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,629
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1019
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,841
We're going home to our real children.

1020
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,636
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1021
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,096
You're waiting for a train.

1022
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:55,184
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1023
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,352
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1024
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,356
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1025
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,734
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1026
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:07,112
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1027
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:11,116
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1028
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,701
Jesus Christ!

1029
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,958
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1030
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,296
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1031
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:25,714
<i>So I ran.</i>

1032
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,801
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1033
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:40,812
James! Phillipa!
Come on in! Come on!

1034
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,147
All right, let's go.

1035
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:46,485
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1036
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,906
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1037
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:54,368
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1038
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:58,163
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1039
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:03,335
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1040
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,337
But you don't have to do that alone.

1041
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,756
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1042
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:13,512
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1043
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,102
We have to move.

1044
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,687
Time's up.

1045
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,606
All right. I don't know any combination.

1046
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,859
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively?

1047
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,989
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1048
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:35,033
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1049
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,452
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1050
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,871
I said, right now! Right now!

1051
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,917
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1052
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,798
You'll have to do better than that.

1053
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:53,302
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1054
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:01,810
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1055
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,567
What'd you get?

1056
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,528
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1057
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:12,738
This helps us how?

1058
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,991
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1059
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,287
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1060
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:23,999
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1061
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:27,753
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1062
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:03,872
Damn it.

1063
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,042
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1064
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:26,812
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1065
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,982
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1066
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,485
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1067
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,655
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1068
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,157
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1069
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,827
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1070
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,662
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1071
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,374
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1072
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,668
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1073
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:52,170
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1074
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,841
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1075
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,009
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1076
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,303
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1077
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,681
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1078
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,891
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1079
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,519
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1080
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:15,444
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1081
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,905
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1082
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,866
- You ready?
- Ready!

1083
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,201
Sweet dreams.

1084
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,287
Am I boring you?

1085
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,791
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1086
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,296
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1087
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,424
There goes Mr. Charles.

1088
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,764
Mr. Fischer, right?

1089
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:48,435
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--

1090
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:52,564
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1091
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,943
In case you get bored.

1092
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,575
Must've blown you off.

1093
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,453
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1094
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:13,084
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1095
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,341
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500--

1096
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,634
About $500, right?

1097
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,762
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1098
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,889
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1099
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,768
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1100
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,269
And why don't you approve?

1101
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,438
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1102
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,774
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1103
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,860
Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

1104
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,779
So now you've noticed how much time...

1105
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,615
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1106
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,118
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1107
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,704
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

1108
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,332
You look a bit perkier.

1109
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,834
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1110
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,592
Turbulence on the plane?

1111
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,469
No, it's much closer.

1112
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,304
That's Yusuf's driving.

1113
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,107
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1114
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,359
Rod Green from marketing.

1115
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,152
But that's not true at all, is it?

1116
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,700
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1117
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,868
I'm the head of your security down here.

1118
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,080
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1119
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,583
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1120
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:38,253
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1121
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,466
Security...?

1122
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,054
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1123
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:52,851
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1124
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,894
Subconscious security.

1125
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,188
You're talking about dreams?

1126
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:00,191
Are you talking about... extraction?

1127
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,652
I am here to protect you.

1128
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,627
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1129
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:22,172
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1130
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,966
You're not safe here.

1131
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,385
They're coming for you.

1132
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,781
Strange weather, isn't it?

1133
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:53,745
You feel that?

1134
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:56,915
What's happening?

1135
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:00,335
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1136
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,380
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1137
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,591
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1138
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,475
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1139
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:18,186
We should probably get out of here.

1140
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:37,038
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1141
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:41,209
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1142
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,546
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1143
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,594
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1144
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:55,849
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1145
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:57,976
Yeah, I...

1146
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,645
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1147
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:06,025
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1148
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,033
- You're not real?
- No.

1149
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,579
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1150
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,831
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1151
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,917
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1152
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:26,337
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1153
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,465
Yeah.

1154
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:29,716
Okay.

1155
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:31,843
Okay.

1156
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,681
Can you get me out of here?

1157
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,185
Right away. Follow me.

1158
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:55,742
Hold on a second.

1159
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,540
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1160
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,959
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1161
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,712
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1162
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,716
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1163
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:27,065
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1164
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,317
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1165
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,987
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1166
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,322
...you may not wake up.

1167
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:39,744
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1168
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,748
You remember the training.

1169
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,292
Remember what I said to you.

1170
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,336
Give me the gun.

1171
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,767
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1172
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,611
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1173
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,615
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1174
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:20,618
There was... a lot of gunfire.

1175
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,413
There was rain.

1176
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:25,540
Uncle Peter.

1177
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,460
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1178
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,758
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1179
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,011
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1180
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,471
It had something to do with...

1181
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,975
Something to do with a safe.

1182
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,227
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1183
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,105
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1184
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:50,982
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1185
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:53,568
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1186
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:56,487
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1187
01:32:56,654 --> 01:33:00,241
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1188
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,035
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1189
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:05,955
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1190
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,833
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1191
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,795
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1192
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,716
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1193
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,719
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1194
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,220
Five.

1195
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,641
Five, two-- It was something,
it was a long number.

1196
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,893
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1197
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,102
Yep.

1198
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:32,315
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1199
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,777
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1200
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,071
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1201
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:42,200
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1202
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,536
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1203
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,122
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1204
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,542
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1205
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,546
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in free fall.

1206
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,883
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1207
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,766
They're with me. Go on.

1208
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,125
Mr. Charles.

1209
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,253
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1210
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,505
They were trying to put you under.

1211
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,007
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1212
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,760
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1213
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,805
Hey. I see you've changed.

1214
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:47,598
I'm sorry?

1215
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:51,978
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1216
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,732
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1217
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,318
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1218
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,362
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1219
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,489
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1220
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:06,993
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1221
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,293
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1222
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,880
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1223
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,506
And you saw them torture him?

1224
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,891
The kidnappers are working for you?

1225
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,310
Robert.

1226
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:36,314
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1227
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,985
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1228
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,488
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1229
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,825
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1230
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,662
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1231
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,790
That's his last insult.

1232
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,585
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1233
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,547
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1234
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:12,600
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1235
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:17,063
But he's wrong.

1236
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:20,441
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1237
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,027
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1238
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:25,321
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1239
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,241
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1240
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,870
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1241
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:39,502
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1242
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,213
All right.

1243
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,470
- He's out.
- Wait.

1244
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,722
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1245
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,224
We're going into Fischer's.

1246
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,060
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1247
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,563
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1248
01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:00,314
That's right.

1249
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,567
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1250
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,069
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1251
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:08,239
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1252
01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:14,662
You good?

1253
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,166
Hey. You ready?

1254
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,920
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1255
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:36,809
Cobb?

1256
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,937
Cobb? What's down there?

1257
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:45,902
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1258
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,945
I mean, what's down there for you?

1259
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,312
Did you see that?

1260
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,624
Eames, this is your dream.

1261
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,919
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1262
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,879
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1263
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:54,507
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1264
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:57,218
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1265
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:58,928
I could do it.

1266
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:01,806
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1267
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:06,143
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1268
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,146
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1269
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:13,484
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1270
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:14,944
You're not coming in?

1271
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,446
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1272
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,658
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1273
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:22,993
Come on, Fischer!

1274
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:21,719
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1275
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,429
Move!

1276
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,056
Go!

1277
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:42,281
Sod it.

1278
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,127
I hope you're ready.

1279
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:05,638
No, it's too soon.

1280
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,354
Cobb, do you hear that?

1281
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,107
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1282
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:20,110
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1283
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:21,695
So, what do we do?

1284
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,280
We move fast.

1285
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,996
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1286
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,251
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1287
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,295
- Hey!
- That's him!

1288
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:40,673
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1289
01:43:40,839 --> 01:43:44,134
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1290
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:47,137
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1291
01:43:58,357 --> 01:43:59,984
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1292
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,653
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1293
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,405
Eames?

1294
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:28,762
Did Eames add any features?

1295
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,389
I don't think I should tell you.

1296
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:32,850
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1297
01:44:33,308 --> 01:44:34,560
He added an air-duct system...

1298
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:36,478
- ...that can cut through the maze.
- Good. Explain it to them.

1299
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:13,724
Paradox.

1300
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:25,671
- What was that?
- The kick.

1301
01:46:26,296 --> 01:46:28,173
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1302
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:30,050
Yeah, we missed it.

1303
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,426
Man.

1304
01:46:31,593 --> 01:46:35,889
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach?

1305
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,227
<i>Well, what the hell do we do now?</i>

1306
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,229
We finish the job before the next kick.

1307
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,481
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1308
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,799
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

1309
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:12,801
<i>If you need help, hang up...</i>

1310
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:16,346
How do I drop you without gravity?

1311
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,518
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1312
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:46,585
You okay?

1313
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,927
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1314
01:47:55,093 --> 01:47:56,637
Go, go, go!

1315
01:47:58,805 --> 01:47:59,973
There's something wrong.

1316
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,476
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1317
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,938
Just buy us more time, all right?

1318
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:07,940
- Come on!
- On my way.

1319
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:09,816
Come on! Move!

1320
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:35,527
All right.

1321
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:50,500
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1322
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:54,171
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1323
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,590
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1324
01:49:58,216 --> 01:50:01,553
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1325
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,098
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1326
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,126
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1327
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:35,128
There's an entire army headed your way.

1328
01:51:01,947 --> 01:51:03,323
I'm in.

1329
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,746
There he is.

1330
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:55,041
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1331
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,795
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1332
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:05,677
Cobb.

1333
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:08,847
No, she is not real.

1334
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:10,682
How do you know that?

1335
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:14,478
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1336
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:20,025
Hello.

1337
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:27,908
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1338
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:14,704
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1339
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:19,000
I couldn't shoot her.

1340
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:23,046
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1341
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:24,256
It's all over.

1342
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:27,634
So that's it, then? We failed?

1343
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,428
We're done. I'm sorry.

1344
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:36,935
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1345
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:41,565
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1346
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:43,775
Let's set the charges.

1347
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,112
No, there's still another way.

1348
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:51,825
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1349
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:54,828
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1350
01:53:55,954 --> 01:53:57,080
And we will find him.

1351
01:53:57,247 --> 01:54:01,167
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1352
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:04,254
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1353
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:06,965
Look, you get him in there.

1354
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:10,010
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1355
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,971
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1356
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,935
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1357
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,229
Saito will never make it, will he?

1358
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:25,734
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1359
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,820
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1360
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:32,240
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1361
01:54:36,453 --> 01:54:38,663
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1362
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,040
Mel's gonna be down there.

1363
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:42,626
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1364
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:46,713
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1365
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,049
She wants me back down there with her.

1366
01:55:15,825 --> 01:55:16,826
All right?

1367
01:55:24,084 --> 01:55:26,753
- This is your world?
- It was.

1368
01:55:27,545 --> 01:55:29,506
And this is where she'll be.

1369
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:31,257
Come on.

1370
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:20,723
Saito. Saito.

1371
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:25,145
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1372
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:28,731
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1373
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,569
Don't be silly.

1374
01:57:05,059 --> 01:57:07,103
You built all this? This is incredible.

1375
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,606
We built for years.

1376
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:12,650
Then we started in on the memories.

1377
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,117
This way.

1378
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:04,869
This was our neighbourhood.

1379
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:07,372
Places from our past.

1380
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:09,332
That was our first apartment.

1381
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:11,709
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1382
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,420
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1383
01:58:14,587 --> 01:58:17,382
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1384
01:58:17,549 --> 01:58:19,842
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1385
01:58:20,009 --> 01:58:21,594
What is that?

1386
01:58:23,137 --> 01:58:24,889
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1387
01:58:25,056 --> 01:58:27,517
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1388
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:28,851
Come on.

1389
01:58:29,018 --> 01:58:32,355
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1390
01:58:32,522 --> 01:58:35,483
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1391
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,067
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1392
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:20,903
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1393
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,488
What?

1394
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:24,574
I'm gonna improvise.

1395
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:29,412
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1396
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:46,387
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1397
01:59:47,221 --> 01:59:48,765
Highly contagious.

1398
01:59:48,931 --> 01:59:52,268
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1399
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:55,313
It can grow to define...

1400
01:59:56,356 --> 01:59:57,940
...or destroy you.

1401
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:03,821
The smallest idea, such as:

1402
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:06,783
"Your world is not real."

1403
02:00:07,075 --> 02:00:10,828
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1404
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:16,584
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1405
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:18,544
Do you think he is?

1406
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:23,257
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1407
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,885
I know what's real, Mal.

1408
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,264
No creeping doubts?

1409
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:33,601
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1410
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:35,228
Chased around the globe...

1411
02:00:35,395 --> 02:00:38,064
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1412
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:40,858
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1413
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:43,986
Admit it.

1414
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:48,116
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1415
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:49,826
So choose.

1416
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:53,329
Choose to be here. Choose me.

1417
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:21,357
You know what I have to do.

1418
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:24,193
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1419
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:27,071
Because you left us.

1420
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,031
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1421
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:31,242
You're confused.

1422
02:01:32,368 --> 02:01:34,412
Our children are here.

1423
02:01:35,204 --> 02:01:38,458
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1424
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:41,711
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1425
02:01:55,349 --> 02:01:57,351
Up above?

1426
02:01:58,227 --> 02:02:01,898
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1427
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:03,775
Watch.

1428
02:02:04,275 --> 02:02:05,985
James? Phillipa?

1429
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:08,571
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1430
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:11,240
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1431
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:13,284
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1432
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:15,995
What if I'm what's real?

1433
02:02:17,205 --> 02:02:19,415
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1434
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,252
But what do you believe?

1435
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:25,421
What do you feel?

1436
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:29,008
Guilt.

1437
02:02:30,218 --> 02:02:32,428
I feel guilt, Mal.

1438
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:36,933
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1439
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:41,354
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1440
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:44,065
...reminding me of the truth.

1441
02:02:44,565 --> 02:02:45,858
What truth?

1442
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:53,533
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1443
02:02:56,911 --> 02:03:00,039
You planted the idea in my mind?

1444
02:03:01,541 --> 02:03:03,042
What is she talking about?

1445
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:09,215
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1446
02:03:10,258 --> 02:03:13,219
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1447
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:15,471
We were lost in here.

1448
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:21,018
<i>I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.</i>

1449
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:29,902
<i>She had locked something away,
something deep inside.</i>

1450
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:34,824
<i>A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</i>

1451
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:37,910
And she couldn't break free.

1452
02:03:40,621 --> 02:03:43,332
<i>So I decided to search for it.</i>

1453
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:48,796
<i>I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.</i>

1454
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:50,840
<i>And I broke in...</i>

1455
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:53,593
<i>...and I planted an idea.</i>

1456
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:58,097
<i>A simple little idea
that would change everything.</i>

1457
02:04:03,352 --> 02:04:05,688
<i>That her world wasn't real.</i>

1458
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:21,704
That death was the only escape.

1459
02:04:29,128 --> 02:04:30,880
You're waiting for a train.

1460
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,927
A train that'll take you far away.

1461
02:04:37,094 --> 02:04:40,097
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1462
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:43,225
...but you can't know for sure.

1463
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:45,937
Yet it doesn't matter.

1464
02:04:47,396 --> 02:04:50,566
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1465
02:04:54,904 --> 02:04:58,950
<i>But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...</i>

1466
02:04:59,116 --> 02:05:01,535
<i>...that even after she woke...</i>

1467
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:06,916
That even after
you came back to reality...

1468
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:12,797
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1469
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:17,969
That death was the only escape.

1470
02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:20,805
Mal, no! Jesus!

1471
02:05:20,972 --> 02:05:24,684
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1472
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:26,268
You betrayed me.

1473
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:30,773
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1474
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:33,985
We can still be together, right here...

1475
02:05:34,151 --> 02:05:36,612
...in the world we built together.

1476
02:06:57,443 --> 02:06:59,779
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1477
02:07:00,654 --> 02:07:01,947
You can't have him.

1478
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:06,410
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1479
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:12,708
Fischer is on the porch.

1480
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:15,878
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1481
02:07:16,045 --> 02:07:18,714
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1482
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:37,441
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1483
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:41,278
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1484
02:07:43,864 --> 02:07:46,575
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1485
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:50,246
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1486
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:55,334
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1487
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:58,921
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1488
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:00,422
No.

1489
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:03,008
I wish.

1490
02:08:04,593 --> 02:08:07,096
I wish more than anything, but...

1491
02:08:08,222 --> 02:08:10,933
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1492
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,644
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1493
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,771
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1494
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:17,773
Look at you.

1495
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:23,946
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1496
02:08:24,405 --> 02:08:27,032
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1497
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:30,286
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1498
02:08:30,452 --> 02:08:32,121
Does this feel real?

1499
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,126
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1500
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:47,428
No, no, no!

1501
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,806
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1502
02:09:35,643 --> 02:09:37,519
I was dis--

1503
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,565
I was dis-- Disa--

1504
02:09:42,441 --> 02:09:44,985
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--

1505
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:53,077
I know you were disappointed...

1506
02:09:53,869 --> 02:09:55,246
...I couldn't be you.

1507
02:09:55,663 --> 02:09:57,164
No.

1508
02:09:57,665 --> 02:09:58,874
No, no, no.

1509
02:09:59,917 --> 02:10:01,919
I was disappointed...

1510
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:05,589
...that you tried.

1511
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:30,531
What?

1512
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,083
Come on, come on.

1513
02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:12,823
Dad?

1514
02:11:51,153 --> 02:11:54,239
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1515
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:10,506
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1516
02:12:10,672 --> 02:12:12,341
I will!

1517
02:12:52,506 --> 02:12:55,259
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1518
02:12:55,426 --> 02:12:56,552
Yes.

1519
02:12:56,718 --> 02:12:59,763
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1520
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:03,976
But we did.

1521
02:13:05,894 --> 02:13:08,272
<i>We did. You don't remember?</i>

1522
02:13:12,943 --> 02:13:15,779
I miss you more than I can bear...

1523
02:13:18,157 --> 02:13:20,159
...but we had our time together.

1524
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:23,579
And I have to let you go.

1525
02:13:25,664 --> 02:13:27,458
I have to let you go.

1526
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:20,010
I'm sorry, Robert.

1527
02:14:47,663 --> 02:14:51,333
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1528
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:54,461
...not just to live for him.

1529
02:14:56,046 --> 02:14:58,590
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1530
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:09,601
What happened?

1531
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:11,770
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1532
02:15:11,937 --> 02:15:13,188
No, to find Saito.

1533
02:15:15,482 --> 02:15:17,234
He'll be lost.

1534
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:21,613
No, he'll be all right.

1535
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,590
Have you come to kill me?

1536
02:15:43,885 --> 02:15:46,346
I'm waiting for someone.

1537
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:53,562
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1538
02:15:56,315 --> 02:15:57,733
Cobb?

1539
02:15:59,651 --> 02:16:01,403
Impossible.

1540
02:16:01,945 --> 02:16:04,573
We were young men together.

1541
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:08,493
I'm an old man.

1542
02:16:09,745 --> 02:16:11,788
Filled with regret.

1543
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,628
Waiting to die alone.

1544
02:16:20,797 --> 02:16:22,966
I've come back for you.

1545
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,098
To remind you of something.

1546
02:16:33,393 --> 02:16:35,771
Something you once knew.

1547
02:16:38,607 --> 02:16:40,859
That this world is not real.

1548
02:16:45,781 --> 02:16:50,285
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1549
02:16:51,119 --> 02:16:53,872
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1550
02:16:59,961 --> 02:17:01,296
Come back...

1551
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,219
...so we can be
young men together again.

1552
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:12,974
Come back with me.

1553
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:17,479
Come back.

1554
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,949
Hot towel, sir?

1555
02:17:29,574 --> 02:17:32,452
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1556
02:17:32,619 --> 02:17:34,913
Do you need immigration forms?

1557
02:17:36,998 --> 02:17:38,333
Thank you.

1558
02:17:38,834 --> 02:17:40,460
Hot towel, sir?

1559
02:17:41,461 --> 02:17:44,464
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1560
02:18:55,827 --> 02:18:56,912
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1561
02:18:58,038 --> 02:18:59,664
Thank you, sir.

1562
02:19:43,708 --> 02:19:45,085
Welcome.

1563
02:19:45,544 --> 02:19:46,962
This way.

1564
02:20:08,149 --> 02:20:11,611
James? Phillipa?

1565
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:16,616
Look who's here.

1566
02:20:22,205 --> 02:20:23,290
Hey.

1567
02:20:24,374 --> 02:20:27,085
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1568
02:20:27,252 --> 02:20:29,504
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1569
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:32,215
Look what I've been building!

1570
02:20:32,382 --> 02:20:36,094
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

1571
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:39,139
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1572
02:20:39,306 --> 02:20:41,850
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
