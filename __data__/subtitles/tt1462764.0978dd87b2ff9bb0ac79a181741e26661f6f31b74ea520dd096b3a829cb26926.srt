1
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,843
On your feet!

2
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:14,135
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:16,468
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,135
You were alone?

5
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,593
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,260
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,343
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,593
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,093
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,843
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

11
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,301
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,801
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,551
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,510
You lost.

15
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:56,843
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:58,468
What? What?

17
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,510
Hey!

18
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,635
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

19
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,176
A moment. Please!

20
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,468
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

21
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,593
Colonel. I found it!

22
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:10,051
Do as he says. Open it.

23
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,426
Doctor.

24
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,468
The Lance of Long in us.

25
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,301
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

26
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:32,426
The Holy Lance.

27
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,801
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

28
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:46,051
Colonel, we need to talk.

29
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,260
No time, Doctor.

30
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,801
The train to Berlin is waiting.

31
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,385
Search the woods!

32
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,510
Take the dogs.

33
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:54,718
Do you think that spy was alone?

34
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,843
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

35
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,135
On the double!

36
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,301
Looks like they're
leaving without you guys.

37
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,718
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:31,468
Story.

39
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,510
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,676
Well...

41
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,093
it all started...

42
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,760
once upon a time,
when this village...

43
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:47,426
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together...

44
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:50,843
and follow this sweaty little pied piper
named Adolf...

45
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,093
No.

46
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,635
This man was with the American.

47
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,468
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:38,343
What have I done?

49
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,260
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:54,885
Careful. This is the
Führer's special relic!

51
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,718
Stay seated.

52
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,926
So...

53
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,676
you are a birdwatcher?

54
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,301
Yes. Because of the bombing,

55
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:41,176
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

56
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,843
We caught your accomplice.

57
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,510
The American.

58
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,135
Oh, my!

59
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,510
Get off of me!

60
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,385
There's one reason you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

61
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,551
Who sent you?

62
00:08:58,718 --> 00:08:59,926
What was your mission?

63
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,135
Please, Colonel, no. I beg you.

64
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,551
My name is Basil Shaw.

65
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,510
I'm a professor at Oxford.

66
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,301
An archeologist.

67
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:17,926
There you are.

68
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,135
There is a problem.

69
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,426
I must speak to the Colonel.

70
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:28,676
It's urgent.

71
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,010
I have a daughter. I beg you.

72
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:36,385
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

73
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:42,635
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

74
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:09,301
We were told that the Lance of Long in us
could be found at the fortress.

75
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,218
We were looking for it.

76
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,176
Why?

77
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:15,718
Because of its power?

78
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:19,551
It has no power.

79
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,801
My friend and I were
trying to save history.

80
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,926
I must speak with the Colonel.

81
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:31,260
It's about the Lance.

82
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,343
I only had a moment to look at it.

83
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:21,260
Of course, my training is in physics,

84
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,718
For God's sake, spit it out!

85
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,801
The Lance...

86
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,926
It's a fake.

87
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,510
It's a fake.

88
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,885
A fake?

89
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:37,676
The blade is an alloy.

90
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,260
Fifty years old,

91
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:41,551
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

92
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
We're dead.

93
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:47,801
Twelfth century. Thirteenth century.

94
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,135
Ramesses II.

95
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,260
None of this stuff is fake.

96
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,593
I gotta stop this train.

97
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,490
There is another relic on this train.

98
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,843
One with real power.

99
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,510
What are you talking about?

100
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,510
The Antikythera.

101
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:07,885
The Antikythera?!

102
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,051
Enough about that old dial!

103
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:12,468
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

104
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:14,260
and his mind!

105
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,801
Let me explain.

106
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,301
The Antikythera's
power is not supernatural.

107
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,551
It is mathematics.

108
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:27,760
Whoever harnesses it...

109
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:31,426
will not be King...

110
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,135
nor Emperor...

111
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,718
or Führer.

112
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,051
He will be God.

113
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,051
Too many Nazis.

114
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,468
And how do you propose we tell him this?

115
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:09,218
My Führer,

116
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,551
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

117
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,051
But here is...

118
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:17,218
half of something you've never heard of.

119
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:19,718
Tell me,

120
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,635
have you ever met Hitler?!!

121
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,301
A saboteur aboard.

122
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,801
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

123
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,385
That way!

124
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,301
What are you doing here?!

125
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,551
What the hell?

126
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,343
Indy?

127
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:26,468
Baz?

128
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
You're alive!

129
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,385
So far.

130
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,468
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

131
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:36,676
What sort of a man hides in a hedge
while his friend is facing death?

132
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:53,551
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

133
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:56,760
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

134
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:58,843
Did you at least find the Lance?

135
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,135
- "At least"?
- Well, have you got it?

136
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:02,510
It's a fake.

137
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,635
What?

138
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:05,510
A reproduction.

139
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Who are you?

140
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:14,635
Indy?

141
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:24,843
The Antikythera.

142
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,718
Archimedes' Dial.

143
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,260
Bring it.

144
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,093
Hurry up, Baz.

145
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,426
Give me that.

146
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,676
Come on.

147
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,843
Get up, Baz.

148
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,301
Follow me.

149
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,260
Towards the gun?

150
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,676
Away from the Nazis!

151
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,051
Those are Nazis!

152
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,593
Get down! Down! Down!

153
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,010
This way. Come on!

154
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:12,635
I can't do that!

155
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:14,593
You wanna stop for a little lie-down?

156
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:19,760
They have the Antikythera!

157
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
Easy.

158
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,301
Tunnel!

159
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,426
Got you! No!

160
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,051
Indy!

161
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,301
Get the gun!

162
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,843
Shoot him!

163
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:11,843
Not me!

164
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,010
Sorry.

165
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:35,343
To the victor go the spoils.

166
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,010
Drop the gun.

167
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:12,260
Give me the Antikythera.

168
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,718
Indy!

169
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,635
Hey!

170
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,885
- Here!
- They can't hear you, Baz.

171
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,801
We gotta jump!

172
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:45,385
What about my dicky knee?

173
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,301
Baz!

174
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,218
Baz!

175
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,093
Baz!

176
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,135
- Indy!
- Baz!

177
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:07,843
Go! Move! Move it!

178
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,510
Bit rum to go home empty-handed
after all that.

179
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:14,343
"Empty-handed"?

180
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,801
Not exactly.

181
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:19,718
Archimedes' Dial.

182
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:20,926
Well, half of it.

183
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,301
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

184
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:31,218
Larry! Turn it down!

185
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,510
Turn it down!

186
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:35,510
Hey, Larry!

187
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Larry!

188
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:53,676
Larry!

189
00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:55,385
- Hi, Mr. Jones.
- Where's Larry?

190
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,426
Who is this guy?

191
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:58,676
It's the old guy next door.

192
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,510
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

193
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:03,051
- "It's 8:00 in the morning."
- We talked about this, Larry.

194
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:04,176
Yeah, but that was...

195
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,760
- a workday, Mr. Jones.
- This is a workday too, Larry!

196
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,343
Turn on the news.

197
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:10,801
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

198
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,218
Moon day?

199
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,510
Thanks.

200
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,718
All you really need to remember...

201
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:26,468
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized...

202
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:30,593
by this complex blue-line pattern.

203
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Okay?

204
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:36,260
I assigned pages 131 through 171...

205
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,051
in Winford for today.

206
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:39,718
Anybody do the reading?

207
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,176
Anyone?

208
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,843
Gosh, this is on the test.

209
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,260
Okay.

210
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,468
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

211
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:57,885
In 213 BC...

212
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,093
Roman forces led by Marcellus...

213
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:03,093
laid siege to the city of Syracuse.

214
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,926
"Syracuse."

215
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:09,010
Not the Syracuse in New York, Tonya.

216
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,718
The one in Sicily.

217
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,885
Amongst the defenders of the city...

218
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:17,176
was its most famous resident, who was...

219
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,051
Come on, guys. This is on the final.

220
00:25:21,718 --> 00:25:23,385
Archimedes.

221
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,301
Archimedes.

222
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:26,760
Archimedes, who was a...

223
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,051
A mathematician.

224
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,385
A mathematician.

225
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:32,135
But more than that, an inventor...

226
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,801
a brilliant engineer...

227
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,343
who conceived of a way to harness
the energy of the Mediterranean sun...

228
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,218
on concave mirrors and focus it...

229
00:25:42,385 --> 00:25:45,010
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

230
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:48,635
Who devised giant iron claws...

231
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,426
that could snatch hostiles from the sea.

232
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,843
But how do we know it really happened?

233
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,010
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence...

234
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:05,468
- is there of these inventions?
- The Antikythera.

235
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,051
- The Antikythera.
- For starters.

236
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:11,218
They're here! They're downtown!

237
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:14,510
The astronauts.

238
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,968
Giant parade this morning will be seen...

239
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:20,260
by about two and a half million people
lining the sidewalks...

240
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,718
He's coming. He's come. See?

241
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,301
Oh, here he comes.

242
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:28,343
Hide the cake.

243
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,093
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

244
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,385
For over a decade now...

245
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,010
our colleague Dr. Jones has been
a loyal servant of Hunter.

246
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,010
A token of our gratitude.

247
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,343
Wow.

248
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,551
Thanks for putting up with me.

249
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,010
Here.

250
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,551
Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
and Buzz Aldrin...

251
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:28,676
will not be able to avoid the spotlight.

252
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:32,551
At 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
a grateful nation will pay homage...

253
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:35,343
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago...

254
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,051
climaxed by a dinner in Los Angeles...

255
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,468
What would the ancients say?

256
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,760
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

257
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,635
If they knew we walked on the moon?

258
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,385
Speaking as an ancient...

259
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,051
going to the moon is like going to Reno.

260
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,510
Middle of nowhere...

261
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,176
and no blackjack.

262
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,760
You don't recognize me, do you?

263
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,176
Whatever I did, I apologize.

264
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,176
It's Helena.

265
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,801
Helena Shaw.

266
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:06,843
Wombat?

267
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:08,635
Wow, I haven't heard that in a while.

268
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:10,926
- You got tall.
- I did.

269
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,426
It's fair to say.

270
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,593
I'm celebrating.

271
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:18,885
- I'm retiring.
- Oh.

272
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,268
Wow.
Well, in that case, what are we drinking?

273
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,093
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

274
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,593
Put that away.

275
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,551
I was asking how you broke your ankle.

276
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,385
None of your business.

277
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:46,468
Are you Mr. Schmidt?

278
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,635
"Doctor" Schmidt. He's in there.

279
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:51,593
And he don't eat anything on wheels,
so put it on a table.

280
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:54,343
When I was a little boy...

281
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,051
I always imagined...

282
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:59,885
that one day man would walk on the moon.

283
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:01,510
And by golly...

284
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,843
Quite a celebration out there.

285
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:14,760
The man you're servin'...

286
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,218
he's the one who put those astronauts
on the moon.

287
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:18,625
Built the rockets they rode in.

288
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,135
Congratulations.

289
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,510
Where are you from?

290
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,301
The Bronx, sir.

291
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:26,426
No, no. I mean originally, your people.

292
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,510
Do you know?

293
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,843
I was born by Yankee Stadium, sir.

294
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,301
And you fought for your country?

295
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,676
320th Battalion.

296
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,218
Set up balloons to stop the planes
bombing Normandy.

297
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,510
And are you enjoying your victory?

298
00:29:58,468 --> 00:29:59,588
Will there be anything else?

299
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,176
You didn't win the war.

300
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:06,010
Hitler lost it.

301
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:12,551
Yeah.

302
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:16,426
My field agent, she found Shaw.

303
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:18,551
Yeah, I'm comin'.

304
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,718
Let's go, Hauke.

305
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,385
Where are we here?

306
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:27,385
Oxford. In the garden.

307
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,510
He was an original.

308
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:34,343
I just graduated.

309
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:35,468
In Archeology.

310
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,551
Archeology. Wow.

311
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:40,343
Apple didn't fall far.

312
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:43,218
Well, now I'm researching a doctorate.

313
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,426
What's your subject?

314
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:48,218
The Archimedes Dial.

315
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,301
The Antikythera.

316
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,551
What do you know about that?

317
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:56,426
Well, for starters...

318
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:00,010
in 1902, Greek sponge divers found
a wrecked Roman warship...

319
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,468
huge, off the coast of Greece.

320
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,843
Below deck, sealed in wax...

321
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,510
was a clock-like mechanism...

322
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:08,510
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

323
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:12,635
Nothing approximating its complexity
appears in the world for 1,000 years.

324
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,885
- You've done your homework.
- Well, not me.

325
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:19,093
Dad. He had all these journals,
reams of notes about it.

326
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,093
He was obsessed till the end.

327
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,926
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

328
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:31,468
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

329
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:35,541
Well, that was a long time ago.

330
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,051
And it was only half the Dial.

331
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,861
- Archimedes...
- Archimedes broke the Dial in two...

332
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,027
- ...disassembled it.
- ...and then hid...

333
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:42,194
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

334
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:43,468
I know. Look.

335
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,593
You don't remember the last time I saw you,
do you?

336
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:49,176
Remember what?

337
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,343
These are the Alps.

338
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,301
Yeah, I see.

339
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:55,343
And this is the route
that your train took...

340
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:57,468
- from the Nazi stronghold in '44.
- Right.

341
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:59,426
It went through this mountain pass...

342
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,051
and then here.

343
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,468
- Here, it's the only river on the route.
- Right.

344
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:04,676
Under a bridge.

345
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,218
It's down there. It's got to be.

346
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,801
- And nobody knows except us.
- "Us"?

347
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,593
Well, I mean, you.

348
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,301
And me. So, yeah.

349
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:14,301
- Us.
- Us.

350
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,801
And what were you thinking exactly?

351
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:20,385
Well, that maybe...

352
00:32:22,218 --> 00:32:23,676
we could go there.

353
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:24,885
And?

354
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:26,218
And find it.

355
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:28,718
And I'd become...

356
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:31,510
famous.

357
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:32,968
Oh, well, not famous.

358
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:34,135
Renowned. Feted.

359
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:36,343
A feted archeologist.

360
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:38,260
And you, a final triumph!

361
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,426
Indiana Jones!

362
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:41,510
Out with a bang! Back in the saddle!

363
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:46,051
I'm not selling this, am I?

364
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,676
Wombat...

365
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,676
why are you chasing the thing...

366
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:57,510
that drove your father crazy?

367
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:04,885
Wouldn't you?

368
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:24,051
I got it.

369
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:25,218
Parade's comin' soon.

370
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,385
So, what we got?

371
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,343
She's in there, third
floor, with an old guy.

372
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,593
Who is he, a Russian?

373
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:34,676
No, a professor. Dr. Henry Jones.

374
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,010
Klaber!

375
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:39,426
Klaber, get back here! You're not an agent!

376
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,801
Goddammit!
Go.

377
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,593
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

378
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,510
This way.

379
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,676
Basil became obsessed
by this German theory.

380
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,551
Conjecture, really.

381
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:52,468
Archimedes had figured out...

382
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,801
that the movements of
the moon and planets...

383
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,885
weren't perfect.

384
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,676
There were irregularities
in their rotations.

385
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:04,135
He thought these irregularities might...

386
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:07,676
explain fluctuations in temperature, tides.

387
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,135
Storms, even.

388
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:15,385
So, he set about building a device
to predict them.

389
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:20,968
But then, he stumbled upon a method
to predict even larger...

390
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:22,676
disturbances.

391
00:35:24,593 --> 00:35:26,010
Larger disturbances?

392
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:28,843
Your father thought this thing could...

393
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,801
predict fissures in time.

394
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,343
Hauke, if you don't...

395
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,801
Found 'em.

396
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:03,468
Hello.

397
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,760
Are you looking for...

398
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,176
Dr. Jones?

399
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,051
Excuse me, can I help you?

400
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:14,676
No, thank you.

401
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,468
Just a routine investigation, ma'am.

402
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,010
Are you the police?

403
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:21,468
It'll just be a few moments.

404
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:23,468
- Professor Plimpton.
- Ma'am.

405
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:24,801
- Professor Plimpton!
- Ma'am!

406
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:30,343
Drop your weapon.

407
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,630
What the hell are you doin'?

408
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,885
What the doctor tells me, Miss Mason.

409
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,135
Mandy?

410
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:42,760
Yeah, no witnesses.

411
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,218
Jesus. What the hell?

412
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,801
Your father wrote so many letters
about the Dial, I stopped reading 'em.

413
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,593
You really don't remember the last time
I was at your house?

414
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,510
I took that from him then.

415
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:05,801
I thought he'd stopped thinking about it.

416
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:09,843
But your father was convinced this thing
was real and dangerous.

417
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,010
Do not shoot.

418
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:15,801
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

419
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,135
the Grafikos...

420
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,500
The tablet containing directions
to the rest of the Dial.

421
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:20,819
And if they found the Grafikos...

422
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:22,527
they might acquire the other half
of the Dial...

423
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:23,551
and put the two together.

424
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:26,375
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

425
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:31,760
How did you know he asked me to destroy it?

426
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,093
What?

427
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,635
You do remember that night.

428
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,801
- I was 12 years old, Indy.
- You knew we didn't drop it in a river.

429
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:40,718
Baz didn't tell you that.

430
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,885
- See, listen. I didn't...
- No, he never lied.

431
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:45,760
- No. You...
- What was all that crap about the map?

432
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,330
No, you've had too many whiskeys.

433
00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:48,923
What are you doing, Wombat?

434
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,176
Stay where you are.

435
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:52,635
Don't move.

436
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:54,819
- Who are these people?
- We need to get out of here.

437
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:55,718
Are they with you?

438
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,051
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

439
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,426
Miss Shaw, stop!

440
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Helena!

441
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:10,051
Stop!

442
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,801
Sorry.

443
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:13,801
Helena!

444
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:15,801
Dr. Jones. It's over.

445
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,260
Who are you people?

446
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,510
What do you want?

447
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,510
Stop!

448
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,301
Helena Shaw!

449
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,861
She's on the roof. Find another way up.

450
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:26,885
Dr. Jones!

451
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,950
Dr. Jones, we're not gonna hurt you.

452
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:57,926
- Move. We gotta follow 'em.
- Go. Hurry up.

453
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:26,468
Fan out!

454
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,027
- Let's go. Move, move, move! Pack it up!
- Come on. Get everything.

455
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:43,135
Found her!

456
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,843
- Operator.
- I need the police.

457
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:16,343
Hunter College. People are dead.

458
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:17,510
- Please...
- Hang up, fella.

459
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:24,468
Stand up.

460
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:30,968
Okay, okay.

461
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,843
She's gone. You blew it...

462
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,260
you trigger-happy cracker.

463
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:00,885
- She had it in her hand.
- We got the professor.

464
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:05,593
Here's the file on Jones.

465
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Yes.

466
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,051
Who are you?

467
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,593
That's my question.

468
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,593
You're CIA.

469
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,510
Oh, not me, man.

470
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:43,635
I don't take government jobs.

471
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,801
Okay.

472
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,343
How are you acquainted with Miss Shaw?

473
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,010
She's my goddaughter.

474
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:52,343
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

475
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,635
Why did you meet with her today?
To give her the Dial?

476
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,510
Lady, it's an ancient hunk of gears.

477
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,510
Half a hunk.

478
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:02,343
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

479
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

480
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,581
Where do you think you're going?

481
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:08,051
I got a parade going on.

482
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:09,698
And a demonstration coming down here.

483
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:10,885
Hey! Hey, hey!

484
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:12,593
- Hey...
- Shut up.

485
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,176
I can't go this way. Gotta go back.

486
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,885
Hell no! What is wrong with you, man?

487
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:23,676
Damn it!
Let's go on foot.

488
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:24,843
You heard her.

489
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:27,736
What the hell were you thinking?

490
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,240
- Walk! Come on.
- What is your problem?

491
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,861
- You don't look when you're backin' up?
- Take care of that guy.

492
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:31,718
Who's gonna pay for that?

493
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:33,051
Easy, fella. Easy.

494
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:33,968
Keep movin'.

495
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,843
Can't you see my cab? It's yellow.

496
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,490
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man. I don't...

497
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,843
Peace now! Peace now!

498
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:47,135
Stop the war! Stop the fighting!

499
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,051
- Where are we going, Mason?
- This way.

500
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,635
- Hell no, we won't go.
- Shut up.

501
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,260
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no!

502
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:57,135
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

503
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:58,301
We won't go!

504
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:00,718
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

505
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,718
- Hell no...
- Shut up!

506
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:04,093
Hell yeah!

507
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:14,885
Hell no...

508
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:26,843
Hey!

509
00:43:27,593 --> 00:43:29,551
Officer! Help me!

510
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:31,843
Officer, there was a shooting...

511
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:34,011
- All right, all right.
- ...this morning at Hunter.

512
00:43:34,051 --> 00:43:35,718
People are dead. God damn it.

513
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:39,301
- Some rogue maniacs broke in and...
- Sir, you need to calm it down.

514
00:43:39,468 --> 00:43:40,593
Please listen to me.

515
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,885
There was a shooting
this morning, and the...

516
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:46,510
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

517
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,718
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

518
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:04,260
- Watch out!
- What's he doin'?

519
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:26,135
You did it!

520
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:54,426
Move, out the way!

521
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:03,551
Watch out!

522
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:06,885
Move! Quickly!

523
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,635
Move! Move!

524
00:45:33,135 --> 00:45:34,468
Go, go, go!

525
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:57,760
Come on. That's ridiculous. It's a horse.

526
00:45:57,926 --> 00:45:58,926
Come on!

527
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,135
- Hey, mister.
- Move! Out of the way!

528
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:04,301
Hold my horse.

529
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:05,510
Move! Move!

530
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:08,468
Transfer is available
for IND Queens Boulevard.

531
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:20,885
Next stop, 59th, Lexington Avenue.

532
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,051
Subway is faster.

533
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,343
People tend to romanticize science,
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

534
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:31,051
So, what's next, Dr. Schmidt?

535
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:33,176
Mars?

536
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,468
No, we've conquered space.

537
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:38,968
I'm moving to the next frontier.

538
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:42,843
What's beyond space?

539
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:49,468
You might wanna get that suit pressed,
Dr. Schmidt.

540
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:51,676
We leave for the airport in an hour.

541
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:53,319
He's gonna meet the President.

542
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,027
If the President objects
to a few creases...

543
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:57,301
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

544
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:00,135
- Can I use that?
- No.

545
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,510
Yes.

546
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:04,051
Baxter.

547
00:47:07,843 --> 00:47:08,968
It's for you, Doctor.

548
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:14,760
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

549
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:17,218
I'm expecting a delivery shortly.

550
00:47:20,426 --> 00:47:21,301
Speak.

551
00:47:21,426 --> 00:47:22,885
Your goons made a mess.

552
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,301
Did they?

553
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,801
Miss Shaw met with a professor. Jones.

554
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,260
She acquired the device from him.

555
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:31,218
Then we lost her.

556
00:47:32,885 --> 00:47:34,551
Dr. Jones got away as well.

557
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,135
Is that so?

558
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,635
Most unfortunate.

559
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:39,551
I gotta clean things up here, Doctor.

560
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,051
And as a representative
of the United States government...

561
00:47:42,218 --> 00:47:43,885
I urge you to cooperate.

562
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:45,493
Get on that plane to Los Angeles...

563
00:47:46,218 --> 00:47:47,738
and get your medal from the President.

564
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:56,051
Hello?

565
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,801
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

566
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:01,218
To Morocco.

567
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,468
Yes, sir.

568
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:06,551
The university murders took place
at the height of the parade.

569
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,218
Police are searching for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

570
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:13,385
A colleague told ABC
that Jones recently lost his son...

571
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,510
and was in the middle of a divorce.

572
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,885
This guy, he looks like you.

573
00:48:21,843 --> 00:48:24,260
Nah. No.

574
00:48:26,218 --> 00:48:27,218
It is you.

575
00:48:27,385 --> 00:48:28,218
No, no, no. Hey.

576
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,069
- Go home, pal. You're drunk.
- This is the guy!

577
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:31,343
- Hey!
- It's the killer!

578
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:35,426
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

579
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:37,051
Bridge traffic.

580
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,051
Boy, am I glad to see you, Sallah.

581
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,885
I wish I could say the same, old friend.

582
00:48:56,218 --> 00:48:58,135
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

583
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:04,218
Your goddaughter, Helena...

584
00:49:04,385 --> 00:49:07,010
was arrested in Tangier last year...

585
00:49:07,885 --> 00:49:09,885
for auctioning contraband.

586
00:49:12,426 --> 00:49:13,426
There's more.

587
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,926
She was bailed out by Aziz Rahim.

588
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:21,468
Aziz Rahim is the son of Big Rahim...

589
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,426
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

590
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,593
Big Rahim owns the Hotel Atlantique...

591
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,426
in Tangier, and this week...

592
00:49:32,551 --> 00:49:36,676
the hotel is hosting its annual auction...

593
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,718
of stolen antiquities.

594
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:42,385
All the big players are already there.

595
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,343
Alia, Jabari.

596
00:49:44,468 --> 00:49:48,635
This is the great man who brought
our family to America during the war.

597
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:51,260
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

598
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,718
1956.

599
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,593
Very impressive, Jabari.

600
00:49:55,718 --> 00:49:58,218
My grandchildren watch too much TV...

601
00:49:58,385 --> 00:50:00,843
but they know their history.

602
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:05,176
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

603
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:08,218
I need a ride to the airport, Sallah.

604
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,801
If you run, the police will assume
that you're guilty.

605
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,801
Without Helena or the Dial,
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

606
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:18,593
Have you thought about calling Marion?

607
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:21,051
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

608
00:50:27,218 --> 00:50:30,801
Welcome to New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

609
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:34,111
The upper level is for Pan American
Airlines passenger drop off only.

610
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:35,926
I took something else from your apartment.

611
00:50:36,135 --> 00:50:37,301
It was under the bed.

612
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:43,510
Thanks, Sallah.

613
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,593
I also brought my passport.

614
00:50:49,635 --> 00:50:50,801
I could help you.

615
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,010
In Tangier?

616
00:50:52,093 --> 00:50:53,718
Wherever chance takes us.

617
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,718
Indy, I...

618
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:58,093
I miss the desert.

619
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:00,010
I miss the sea.

620
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:03,301
And I miss waking up every morning...

621
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:06,551
wondering what wonderful adventure
the new day will bring to us.

622
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,551
This is not an adventure, Sallah.

623
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,593
Those days have come and gone.

624
00:51:13,718 --> 00:51:14,760
Perhaps.

625
00:51:14,968 --> 00:51:16,343
Perhaps not.

626
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,385
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

627
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:35,968
Champagne?

628
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,343
We've got four more hours to Tangier.

629
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:47,468
Your scotch, sir.

630
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:49,135
Thanks.

631
00:51:56,051 --> 00:51:57,426
Basil. Come on, Baz!

632
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,343
- Open the door!
- No!

633
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,968
- Stay out, Indy!
- Open the door.

634
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:06,051
The Germans were right, Indy.

635
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:08,510
- What?
- It's too big. It's too much.

636
00:52:08,676 --> 00:52:09,510
Hey, Ba...
Hey, hey!

637
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:11,468
- Hey, Baz! Give me...
- No.

638
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:13,861
- What are you doing?
- You've listened to nothing that I said.

639
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:15,635
I don't understand it, Baz!

640
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:18,051
Well, I was trying to explain it
to you downstairs.

641
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,776
- You've just ignored everything.
- You're terrifying your daughter.

642
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:24,635
Indy, Archimedes...

643
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:27,051
discovered a temporal meteorology.

644
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:29,843
Archimedes was a mathematician, Baz...

645
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:31,260
not a magician.

646
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:33,885
He could predict fissures in time.

647
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,593
Fissures in time?

648
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,051
- Baz, you can't prove that!
- Well, not yet.

649
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:41,093
Proving it is what makes it science!

650
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,510
Oh, Baz.

651
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,760
I never should've given you the thing.

652
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:03,010
It belongs in a museum.

653
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:05,551
Give it to me. Please.

654
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:10,510
If I give you this...

655
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:13,260
it must be destroyed.

656
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:15,676
I will.

657
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:19,801
I'll destroy it, Baz.

658
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:23,385
Promise.

659
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:31,010
I'm sorry about this.

660
00:53:31,176 --> 00:53:32,343
It's all my fault.

661
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,926
- Are you gonna be here?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,218
Okay. I've gotta catch an airplane.

663
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:41,176
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

664
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,635
Some things should stay buried.

665
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,551
I know, Baz.

666
00:53:43,718 --> 00:53:45,518
- It's vital that you destroy it.
- I will, Baz.

667
00:53:45,676 --> 00:53:47,116
- Do you understand?
- I'll destroy it.

668
00:53:47,218 --> 00:53:47,968
- Say you will, Indy.
- Yes.

669
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:49,135
I will... Yes.

670
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:50,885
You promised me. Remember that.

671
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,051
I will... I promise.

672
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:53,218
There's a reason...

673
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,843
a reason that Archimedes broke it in two.

674
00:53:56,051 --> 00:53:57,676
I know, Baz.

675
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:58,885
Indy.

676
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:02,093
Thanks, Wombat.

677
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,218
He's gonna be all right in a few days.

678
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:07,676
I'll call you as soon as I land.

679
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,010
Ladies and gentlemen...

680
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:16,635
we are 20 minutes from landing in Tangier.

681
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:51,785
- Stop drinking!
- What are you doing?

682
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:53,510
No more champagne! How many more...

683
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:54,635
I'm staying.

684
00:54:54,676 --> 00:54:56,218
Go home. Go home!

685
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,218
Miss Shaw, she's here.

686
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,510
Forged in bronze.

687
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:21,718
Nearly complete.

688
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,551
It is an astrological clock.

689
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:26,385
Dating third century BC...

690
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:30,426
and built by Archimedes himself.

691
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:33,885
All right, let's start at 20,000.

692
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,213
20,000, thank you very much.

693
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:36,593
30.30.

694
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:37,801
Gauges green...

695
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,468
power full...

696
00:55:39,593 --> 00:55:41,926
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

697
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:43,468
What next?

698
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:45,711
- Louis, help him! He's so cute.
- Pull back on the yoke.

699
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:48,051
- I did, man. I'm airborne.
- Yeah, he's airborne.

700
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,569
- Can I have a sip?
- Do I pick up the flaps?

701
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,593
Don't touch the flaps under 400 feet.

702
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,468
Decrease your pitch to get to 120.

703
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:54,593
All right.

704
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:59,426
- Private auction, old timer.
- I've gotta get in there.

705
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:02,135
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

706
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,777
- And what is the current bid?
- The bid is 50,000.

707
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:08,135
Then I bid 55.

708
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:10,093
- Who'll give me 60?
- 60.

709
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,676
60.65?

710
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,051
- 65.70?
- 75.

711
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,510
- 75.80?
- 80.

712
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,260
- 85.
- How about 90?

713
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,260
This auction is private.

714
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:25,510
This auction's over.

715
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:27,260
Au contraire, it's hardly begun.

716
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,760
- 100.
- 100,000.

717
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,510
I like the hat, by the way.

718
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:32,111
Makes you look at least two years younger.

719
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:33,218
Thanks.

720
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:35,111
- 110, bravo.
- I told you that this auction is over.

721
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:36,426
Excuse me, who is this man?

722
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,069
- I'm her godfather.
- He's mildly related.

723
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:40,010
And she's up past her bedtime.

724
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:41,527
- Come on, Wombat.
- I wouldn't do that.

725
00:56:41,551 --> 00:56:43,194
You want to explain it to the cops
at the bar?

726
00:56:43,218 --> 00:56:44,551
The ones I paid off?

727
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:46,676
You're out of your depth, Jonesy.

728
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:48,283
- "Jonesy"?
- He thinks I'm a criminal.

729
00:56:48,343 --> 00:56:50,135
He's the one wanted for murder.

730
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,301
Nice big picture in the
New York Herald. 130?

731
00:56:52,468 --> 00:56:54,135
I didn't kill anyone.

732
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,661
- No entry, it's a private auction.
- And you know it, Helena.

733
00:56:56,885 --> 00:57:00,135
But whoever did was looking for this.

734
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,635
What you've got here is Pandora's Box.

735
00:57:03,843 --> 00:57:05,093
No, actually.

736
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:07,468
It's my box.

737
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,051
You.

738
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,885
Have we met?

739
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:15,093
No.

740
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:16,551
My memory is a little fuzzy...

741
00:57:16,718 --> 00:57:18,468
but your face rings a bell.

742
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,176
Are you still a Nazi?

743
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,426
You're confused. My name is Schmidt.

744
00:57:26,926 --> 00:57:29,135
Professor Schmidt of Alabama University.

745
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:31,843
Professor Schmidt.

746
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:33,458
How nice to meet you in person.

747
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,940
- 150.
- After our conversation, Miss Shaw...

748
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,093
I thought we'd come to an agreement
about the Dial.

749
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:40,527
Funny. The last time I saw the other guy
who looks like you...

750
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:42,343
he was also after this.

751
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,646
Your numbers were light, Professor Schmidt.

752
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:45,944
But good news is, you're here now.

753
00:57:45,968 --> 00:57:48,468
- The bid is 160.
- You don't seem to understand, Miss Shaw.

754
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:49,801
This relic is my property.

755
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,551
It's not yours. You stole it.

756
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,468
Then you stole it.

757
00:57:52,593 --> 00:57:54,313
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

758
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:55,385
The bid is 160.

759
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:56,426
- 160.
- 170?

760
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:57,527
You should've stayed in New York.

761
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:59,426
- 170?
- You should've stayed out of Poland.

762
00:57:59,593 --> 00:58:01,426
170. Anyone? Anyone?

763
00:58:01,593 --> 00:58:02,885
Going, going...

764
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,426
Gone!

765
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:05,885
Stay away!

766
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:08,593
Get the Dial.

767
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,510
Stay away!

768
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:24,593
Oh, hello, Claude.

769
00:58:24,676 --> 00:58:26,196
You should not have come back, Helena.

770
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:36,468
Get back.

771
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:48,301
Teddy!

772
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:03,593
Rahim says you stay.

773
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,593
Thank you.

774
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:30,926
See you in the past, Dr. Jones.

775
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,718
Move! Get out of the way!

776
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,010
It's my cab!

777
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:05,718
Tell them to back off.

778
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:07,260
I just told them to shoot you.

779
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,510
All right, guys.

780
01:00:11,926 --> 01:00:13,343
Put the guns down.

781
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:14,635
Put 'em down.

782
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,760
All right.

783
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:20,635
That's better.

784
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:26,093
Oh, dear.

785
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:37,301
Rahim.

786
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,801
You're in pajamas.

787
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,093
I was sleeping, Helena.

788
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,510
Peacefully.

789
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:46,218
Then my father woke me.

790
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:48,926
He told me you'd returned to our hotel.

791
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,718
Then he handed me this scimitar...

792
01:00:52,885 --> 01:00:55,718
and told me to come home with your head.

793
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,843
Does it have to be that bit?

794
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:09,426
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

795
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:10,635
Rahim...

796
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:13,010
I had an item to sell.

797
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:15,051
Excuse me. The item she's talking about...

798
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:16,986
- actually belongs to me.
- No. You do not need to...

799
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,236
- And some very bad people...
- ...intrude in this conversation.

800
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,527
- ...worse people, have run off with it.
- You do not need to get involved...

801
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,611
- with my business.
- Is this your new man?

802
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:22,926
- No. No, no.
- It's complicated.

803
01:01:24,635 --> 01:01:26,218
What exactly do you owe this guy?

804
01:01:26,343 --> 01:01:28,426
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

805
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,301
I presume you sold the ring.

806
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:32,236
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

807
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,301
I'll do it!

808
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:34,510
What are you... Hey!

809
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,260
You just got me killed!

810
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:45,010
Well, I'm not the one that's engaged
to a mobster!

811
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:48,135
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

812
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,468
I'm not a grave robber.

813
01:01:49,593 --> 01:01:51,926
Your father and I
did important work together.

814
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,652
Don't tell me all your escapades
were noble, selfless quests.

815
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:57,676
You did it for the buzz!

816
01:02:00,343 --> 01:02:01,385
Oh, good work, Teddy!

817
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:04,551
- Move over, kid.
- Hey!

818
01:02:15,218 --> 01:02:17,135
- Helena!
- Back up! Back up!

819
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:35,801
Not this way!

820
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,277
You don't know where you're going, Indy!

821
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:39,341
- Listen to him. He knows this town!
- I know Tangier!

822
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,635
There he is!

823
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,885
Faster. Go faster!

824
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,051
Ten minutes to the airport, boss.

825
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,718
I'm not sure Professor Schmidt
is an actual professor, by the way.

826
01:02:58,885 --> 01:03:00,010
- He's a Nazi!
- Turn left!

827
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,718
Turn left! Turn left!

828
01:03:01,885 --> 01:03:02,968
- Oh, no!
- No!

829
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:19,593
Helena! Don't do this!

830
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,135
- Hey, this way!
- That way!

831
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:31,093
No!

832
01:03:32,051 --> 01:03:33,510
Helena!

833
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,510
No!

834
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,801
What the hell?

835
01:03:54,426 --> 01:03:55,635
Helena!

836
01:03:57,593 --> 01:03:58,468
Hey!

837
01:03:58,593 --> 01:03:59,593
Hey!

838
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:01,135
What the hell?

839
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:05,468
Come on!

840
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:11,051
Come on. Come on!

841
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:47,510
You think he'd be proud of this?

842
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:48,635
Who?

843
01:04:50,385 --> 01:04:51,218
Your father!

844
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:54,301
His only daughter selling her soul
for bail money!

845
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:55,902
Sounds quite cool
when you put it like that.

846
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,593
And it's not all bail money.

847
01:04:57,718 --> 01:05:00,051
- Some of it's gambling debt and some...
- Thank you, Teddy.

848
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:01,885
Helena!
No!

849
01:05:02,093 --> 01:05:03,093
Helena!

850
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,676
How did you end up like this?

851
01:05:06,843 --> 01:05:08,176
Well, you mean resourceful?

852
01:05:08,343 --> 01:05:10,635
Daring? Beautiful? Self-sufficient?

853
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:36,968
Hold on!

854
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,510
Go this way!

855
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:52,051
There he is.

856
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,926
- Stop! Stop!
- Hey! Hey!

857
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:20,843
On the left!

858
01:06:21,968 --> 01:06:22,968
Take the wheel, Teddy!

859
01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:26,260
What are you doing?

860
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:27,926
Getting what's mine.

861
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:29,885
Helena!

862
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:35,635
Damn it! You crazy?

863
01:06:38,301 --> 01:06:40,176
Hey! Helena!

864
01:06:44,135 --> 01:06:45,760
- Take the gun!
- Miss Shaw.

865
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:48,843
Let go, Miss Shaw!

866
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:12,676
Let go.

867
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,176
Come on! Give me the Dial!

868
01:07:16,593 --> 01:07:17,926
Helena!

869
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:20,801
Damn.

870
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:29,635
- Turn back! They went that way!
- He's gone!

871
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:31,635
- Move over!
- Hey!

872
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,135
I didn't come here to rescue you
from your fiancé!

873
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,260
Rescue me?

874
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:45,843
I just want the Dial back.

875
01:08:05,301 --> 01:08:06,801
Put your hands above your head.

876
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:09,611
Not the smoothest break-up I ever had.

877
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:11,875
- If your father was still alive...
- Well, he's not, Indy.

878
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:13,569
Hey, something's wrong with the engine.

879
01:08:13,593 --> 01:08:15,736
If only there'd been someone there for me,
some father figure...

880
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,635
someone specifically anointed for the job.

881
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,194
- You have no idea about the kind...
- Don't beat yourself up about it.

882
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,301
I mean, what even is a godfather?

883
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:26,343
Anyway, family never was your strong suit.

884
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:29,343
- What is the time, by the way?
- It's...

885
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,510
Hey, no fair.

886
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,260
Give me that back.

887
01:08:32,343 --> 01:08:33,510
That was my father's watch!

888
01:08:36,135 --> 01:08:37,135
Give it back to him.

889
01:08:41,468 --> 01:08:42,986
You're gonna have to leave town with me.

890
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,551
Rahim will be looking for you too.

891
01:08:44,676 --> 01:08:46,027
They'll go to Tangier airport first...

892
01:08:46,051 --> 01:08:48,531
so we'll need to catch a train
and get a plane from Casablanca.

893
01:08:50,385 --> 01:08:51,385
What was that?

894
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,510
Damn.

895
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,843
Yeah.

896
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:02,093
I know, sir.

897
01:09:04,343 --> 01:09:05,343
Yes...

898
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:07,551
Copy.

899
01:09:12,635 --> 01:09:13,760
They pulled the plug.

900
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,385
You got them scared.

901
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,426
- Because they don't understand.
- No.

902
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:20,051
Because your associates killed
three American civilians...

903
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:22,426
and blew up a nationally televised parade.

904
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:25,510
Because you stood up
the President of the United States...

905
01:09:25,676 --> 01:09:26,843
ran to Morocco...

906
01:09:27,093 --> 01:09:29,468
and created an incident
that required military extraction!

907
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,351
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

908
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:34,760
They want you to vanish.

909
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:37,051
We have half the Dial now.

910
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:38,898
They were just trying to keep you happy...

911
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,218
letting you chase that thing.

912
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,551
They never cared about it.

913
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,301
They will, Miss Mason,
when they understand what it can do.

914
01:09:45,468 --> 01:09:46,551
You put them on the moon.

915
01:09:47,301 --> 01:09:48,510
They got what they wanted.

916
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:51,718
All right, buckle up.
We're landing in Spain.

917
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:54,426
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

918
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:56,010
I'm not going back to Alabama!

919
01:09:56,218 --> 01:09:58,468
All we need is a vessel to take us
to the Mediterranean.

920
01:09:59,093 --> 01:10:00,611
The Grafikos will take us to the other...

921
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:02,676
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

922
01:10:02,843 --> 01:10:03,885
Let go of me, Schmidt.

923
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:05,676
I'm asking you personally.

924
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,051
You're a piece of work, Doc.

925
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:10,718
Hey!

926
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,093
Schmidt...

927
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:42,551
My name is Voller.

928
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:46,718
Jürgen Voller.

929
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:01,801
That's a Sea Stallion.

930
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:03,385
American helicopter.

931
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,135
Did you know the Wright Brothers?

932
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,051
- What?
- The Wright Brothers.

933
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:09,301
Orville and Wilbur.

934
01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:11,676
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

935
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:13,426
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

936
01:11:13,551 --> 01:11:15,926
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

937
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:18,676
And the Wright Brothers were born
during the Civil War.

938
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:20,968
Oh, I thought maybe you went to school
with them.

939
01:11:22,385 --> 01:11:24,843
Oh, come on, Indy. That was funny.

940
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:26,051
"Funny"?

941
01:11:26,968 --> 01:11:30,635
I'm stuck in Tangier with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

942
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:32,051
I'm wanted for murder.

943
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:34,176
Nazis have half of Archimedes' Dial...

944
01:11:34,343 --> 01:11:35,676
and your father's notebooks.

945
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:38,093
I have a copy.

946
01:11:38,885 --> 01:11:40,385
Dad's notebooks. I made a copy.

947
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:41,551
Where?

948
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,426
You memorized five notebooks?

949
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:45,801
Seven. And of course not.

950
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,608
Half of them were as dull as ditch water.

951
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:50,885
Just the really important bits.

952
01:11:51,885 --> 01:11:52,885
Like what?

953
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,420
The location of the Grafikos.

954
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,260
Nobody knows where the Grafikos is.

955
01:11:56,426 --> 01:11:57,676
- Dad did.
- No, he didn't.

956
01:11:57,843 --> 01:11:59,093
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

957
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,801
- Yes, he did.
- What's a Grafikos?

958
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,486
It's directions to the rest of the Dial.

959
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,194
Ask her if she knows what language it's in.

960
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:06,051
It isn't in a language. It's in a code.

961
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:07,468
What code?

962
01:12:07,593 --> 01:12:09,051
Archimedes used two codes.

963
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:10,760
Linear B and Polybius Square.

964
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:14,301
So, even if you find the Grafikos,
without me, you can't read it.

965
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,135
Please.

966
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,135
Dad taught me Polybius when I was nine.

967
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:20,027
Used to leave little
notes around the house.

968
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:21,051
"Tidy your room."

969
01:12:21,135 --> 01:12:22,426
"Stay away from my brandy."

970
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,551
What if it's Linear B?

971
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:26,843
50 quid it's Polybius.

972
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,051
Give me that.

973
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:30,218
Hey.

974
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:31,760
That won't work.

975
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:34,176
Moroccan chewing gum's made from the sap
of the Manilkara.

976
01:12:34,343 --> 01:12:35,635
Heat resistant.

977
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:38,343
Try and start it.

978
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:44,426
- Start it.
- I am.

979
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,135
Huh? Huh?

980
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,426
- Huh?
- It won't hold.

981
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,510
It'll get us to the train station.

982
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:53,760
"Us"?

983
01:12:53,885 --> 01:12:55,135
- You goin' home?
- No.

984
01:12:55,343 --> 01:12:57,093
I'm going to Casablanca.

985
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,051
Then I'm gonna hop a plane to the Aegean.

986
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:00,218
Just like you.

987
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:02,194
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

988
01:13:02,218 --> 01:13:05,301
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

989
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:07,510
Archimedes was surrounded by Romans.

990
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,468
Where else would it be?

991
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,593
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

992
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,000
And you don't have coordinates.

993
01:13:12,135 --> 01:13:13,593
And you don't have a boat.

994
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,926
I've got an old friend in Greece.

995
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:20,551
An expert diver.

996
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:22,551
With a big, beautiful boat...

997
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:24,718
that'll get us there before they will.

998
01:13:25,593 --> 01:13:27,635
You need me...

999
01:13:27,801 --> 01:13:29,051
and you know it.

1000
01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:20,301
Renny!

1001
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:23,385
Indy?

1002
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:25,343
Indy!

1003
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:32,676
So, that's the expert diver?

1004
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,093
Spain's greatest frogman.

1005
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:38,885
Hey!

1006
01:14:39,051 --> 01:14:42,468
So, Spain's greatest frogman has a
shit boat and only one good frog leg?

1007
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:43,718
Stop it.

1008
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:48,843
You got a different boat.

1009
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,051
Stop it.

1010
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,301
We're going here.

1011
01:15:06,926 --> 01:15:09,385
Where they found the first part
of the Antikythera.

1012
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:11,301
But...

1013
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:14,135
we're going deeper.

1014
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:19,426
Dad tracked down the old sponge diver
who found the Dial.

1015
01:15:19,551 --> 01:15:20,676
He told him...

1016
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:23,801
that the wrecked Roman ship broke up
under the sea...

1017
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,135
70 feet below.

1018
01:15:25,343 --> 01:15:28,260
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1019
01:15:29,468 --> 01:15:30,593
That's where they found it.

1020
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:35,260
But he said that most of the ship
had broken off...

1021
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:37,218
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1022
01:15:38,176 --> 01:15:39,676
Too deep for sponge divers.

1023
01:15:40,718 --> 01:15:43,551
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship...

1024
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:47,176
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1025
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:54,218
They weren't taking half a Dial
for a joyride.

1026
01:15:58,093 --> 01:15:59,593
They had the Grafikos...

1027
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:04,635
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1028
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,551
Your dad was a genius.

1029
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,260
Yeah.

1030
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:13,676
He was.

1031
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,551
Seven of spades.

1032
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:38,885
How do you do that?

1033
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:40,135
Wow.

1034
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:41,968
Do it again.

1035
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,676
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1036
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:56,343
Seven of spades!

1037
01:16:58,468 --> 01:16:59,510
She's magic.

1038
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:00,760
Trick deck.

1039
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:01,968
No.

1040
01:17:03,135 --> 01:17:04,551
I force the card.

1041
01:17:04,718 --> 01:17:06,010
I offer the mark...

1042
01:17:06,176 --> 01:17:07,385
you...

1043
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,550
the feeling of a choice...

1044
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:10,885
but ultimately,
I make you pick the card I want.

1045
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:14,176
"The mark."

1046
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,176
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1047
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,135
I have to check the lines.

1048
01:17:27,093 --> 01:17:28,218
Good night.

1049
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:34,468
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1050
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,135
Dates?

1051
01:17:37,301 --> 01:17:38,551
What dates?

1052
01:17:39,468 --> 01:17:40,468
These dates.

1053
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,635
Written over and over again in this letter.

1054
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:49,885
August 20th, 1969.

1055
01:17:50,135 --> 01:17:51,635
That's three days from now.

1056
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,051
And the same date in 1939.

1057
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,635
Two weeks before Hitler invades Poland.

1058
01:17:59,093 --> 01:18:00,093
Wait.

1059
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,176
Now you believe the
Dial has magical powers?

1060
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:06,468
I don't believe in magic, Wombat.

1061
01:18:08,385 --> 01:18:10,718
But a few times in my
life, I've seen things.

1062
01:18:13,843 --> 01:18:15,593
Things I can't explain.

1063
01:18:16,968 --> 01:18:19,385
And I've come to
believe it's not so much...

1064
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:21,635
what you believe.

1065
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:24,051
It's how hard you believe it.

1066
01:18:27,176 --> 01:18:28,468
I've seen things too, Indy.

1067
01:18:29,426 --> 01:18:32,010
The only thing worth believing in, ever...

1068
01:18:32,176 --> 01:18:33,760
is cash.

1069
01:18:36,135 --> 01:18:37,218
Right.

1070
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,328
What if you could go back in time?

1071
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:47,510
What would you do?

1072
01:18:48,843 --> 01:18:50,260
Witness the Trojan War?

1073
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:52,885
Check in on Cleopatra?

1074
01:18:56,468 --> 01:18:58,593
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

1075
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,510
Did he sign up to please you?

1076
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:06,760
No, he signed up to piss me off.

1077
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,676
How would you have stopped him?

1078
01:19:16,843 --> 01:19:18,676
I'd tell him he was gonna die.

1079
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:27,551
I'd tell him that his mother would...

1080
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,051
find no end to her grief.

1081
01:19:33,843 --> 01:19:35,635
And that his father would be...

1082
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,385
helpless to console her.

1083
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:46,218
And that the loss would put an end
to their marriage.

1084
01:20:00,176 --> 01:20:01,426
You're still wearing the ring.

1085
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Promising.

1086
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:35,551
More promising.

1087
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:42,468
Hello.

1088
01:20:44,635 --> 01:20:46,635
Get your gear on. They're waiting.

1089
01:20:51,343 --> 01:20:52,343
Hey.

1090
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:54,426
Come here.

1091
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,635
Okay.

1092
01:20:56,801 --> 01:20:57,593
I'm gonna show you something.

1093
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,676
Gosh, this looks important.

1094
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,760
Around the rope...

1095
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:06,176
Now, we are going deep.

1096
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:09,176
Descend fast,
and breathe through these hoses.

1097
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:10,343
Okay?

1098
01:21:10,593 --> 01:21:12,176
Stay separate.

1099
01:21:12,343 --> 01:21:14,301
No crisscross. All right?

1100
01:21:14,468 --> 01:21:15,593
We cannot stay long.

1101
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,093
I have a method
that usually prevents the bends.

1102
01:21:20,093 --> 01:21:21,135
- Usually?
- Yeah.

1103
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:22,468
I call it "the bounce."

1104
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:23,676
You know, fast down...

1105
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:25,760
three minutes on the bottom, and then up.

1106
01:21:25,926 --> 01:21:27,010
Three minutes!

1107
01:21:27,176 --> 01:21:29,010
No one more second.

1108
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:30,593
Three minutes.

1109
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,010
Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:21:32,093 --> 01:21:33,853
- Where is my lighter?
- I don't know, capitán.

1111
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:36,135
We have to go.

1112
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:39,843
Quick question.

1113
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,385
What's that?

1114
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,801
- They're sharks?
- No.

1115
01:21:42,968 --> 01:21:45,343
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1116
01:21:46,426 --> 01:21:47,426
Eels?

1117
01:21:47,468 --> 01:21:48,718
Anguilas.

1118
01:21:48,885 --> 01:21:49,885
Most are small.

1119
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,510
Sometimes they are big. Two meters.

1120
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:53,718
But if you see them, stay still.

1121
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:57,176
They bite you, they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1122
01:21:57,343 --> 01:21:58,676
They look like snakes.

1123
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:00,551
No, they don't.

1124
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,676
Private Brandy reporting for duty.

1125
01:22:03,343 --> 01:22:04,343
You're not coming, Teddy?

1126
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:06,051
I can't swim.

1127
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:07,385
Lucky him.

1128
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:08,801
Everyone can swim.

1129
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,635
Reach and pull. Reach and pull.

1130
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:16,926
All right. You stay here with Hector
and watch our lines.

1131
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:22,010
It is time, camarada.

1132
01:24:10,343 --> 01:24:11,343
Two minutes?

1133
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:43,551
I got it.

1134
01:26:24,385 --> 01:26:25,385
Hey.

1135
01:26:57,301 --> 01:26:58,301
Hurry up!

1136
01:27:13,218 --> 01:27:14,718
Helena!

1137
01:27:23,593 --> 01:27:24,510
Come on.

1138
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:26,218
That's it. That's it. That's it.

1139
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,260
That's it.

1140
01:27:51,385 --> 01:27:52,593
Who are these people?

1141
01:27:55,051 --> 01:27:55,843
Nazis.

1142
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,510
First, you return my Dial, Dr. Jones...

1143
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:01,801
and now, you bring me the Grafikos.

1144
01:28:02,718 --> 01:28:04,885
I'm very happy you're not wasting
in retirement.

1145
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,593
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1146
01:28:07,801 --> 01:28:08,926
Where are your sponsors?

1147
01:28:09,135 --> 01:28:10,635
I'm on my own now.

1148
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:12,510
Things move forward, Dr. Jones.

1149
01:28:12,676 --> 01:28:13,676
And sometimes...

1150
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,301
they go backward.

1151
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,760
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1152
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:51,176
What language is that?

1153
01:28:51,343 --> 01:28:52,926
It's not a language.

1154
01:28:54,176 --> 01:28:55,260
It's a code.

1155
01:28:56,218 --> 01:28:57,218
Polybius.

1156
01:28:57,926 --> 01:28:59,260
You owe me 50 quid.

1157
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,385
Not familiar with Polybius cipher?

1158
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,510
No.

1159
01:29:05,301 --> 01:29:06,635
But it appears you are.

1160
01:29:11,051 --> 01:29:12,051
Read it, please.

1161
01:29:20,426 --> 01:29:21,426
No.

1162
01:29:27,176 --> 01:29:28,176
Indy...

1163
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:40,510
Feeling helpful now?

1164
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:44,926
I am.

1165
01:29:47,926 --> 01:29:49,218
I know this stuff backwards.

1166
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:50,343
No!

1167
01:29:52,135 --> 01:29:53,135
Sorry, Indy.

1168
01:29:53,468 --> 01:29:54,760
I don't do noble death.

1169
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,551
Just...

1170
01:29:56,676 --> 01:29:58,135
cold, hard maths.

1171
01:29:58,676 --> 01:30:00,516
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1172
01:30:01,885 --> 01:30:03,593
One hundred grand. Cash.

1173
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,760
Helena...

1174
01:30:05,385 --> 01:30:06,385
Take it or leave it.

1175
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:08,926
You have a deal.

1176
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:24,260
He'll never pay you.

1177
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,635
I think you will find this is worth
more than your asking price.

1178
01:30:38,176 --> 01:30:39,593
- Teddy.
- Helena...

1179
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,010
don't do this.

1180
01:30:46,426 --> 01:30:47,760
Let's see what we've got here.

1181
01:30:49,968 --> 01:30:51,385
"My Makhana..."

1182
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,010
That's "machine"...

1183
01:30:54,093 --> 01:30:57,635
"lies with me, in the city I left.

1184
01:30:57,801 --> 01:31:00,176
"Where wolves teach men to walk."

1185
01:31:00,343 --> 01:31:04,468
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1186
01:31:07,343 --> 01:31:09,051
Only one thing lies anywhere forever.

1187
01:31:09,218 --> 01:31:11,843
The dead. So, if the Dial lies with him,
then...

1188
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,301
then this is directions to his tomb.

1189
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,093
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1190
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:20,301
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1191
01:31:23,385 --> 01:31:25,468
"The city I left."

1192
01:31:26,135 --> 01:31:29,510
Archimedes lived two places
his entire life, so he only left one.

1193
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:32,468
Anyone? At the back?

1194
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:34,801
Come on, Indy. Everyone knows this.

1195
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:35,801
Even this clown.

1196
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,385
Alexandria.

1197
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:38,551
Full marks.

1198
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,968
Now, "wolf" in Greek is "lycos."

1199
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:44,385
Root of the word "lycaeum" or "school."

1200
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:47,176
And the Doric for "walking" is...

1201
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:49,551
"peripatio."

1202
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:53,468
Which also happens to be the word for...

1203
01:31:58,676 --> 01:32:00,635
I thought you were a bright spark.

1204
01:32:03,301 --> 01:32:06,426
"Peripatio" means "walking"...

1205
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:08,968
but it also means "counting."

1206
01:32:09,135 --> 01:32:12,260
So, "Where wolves teach men to walk"...

1207
01:32:13,051 --> 01:32:15,301
- could be...
- The School of Mathematics.

1208
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:18,260
Is correct.

1209
01:32:18,385 --> 01:32:19,926
Now, the next bit is easy.

1210
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,760
"Beneath one of nine"?

1211
01:32:23,968 --> 01:32:25,343
There are nine Muses.

1212
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:26,593
The Museon.

1213
01:32:26,718 --> 01:32:29,260
The Greek word
for the Great Library of Alexandria.

1214
01:32:29,426 --> 01:32:33,176
Which, as we all know, has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1215
01:32:33,343 --> 01:32:34,343
May I?

1216
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:36,510
Thank you.

1217
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:40,510
The nine Muses, in reverse order...

1218
01:32:42,051 --> 01:32:43,468
are Calliope...

1219
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,426
Urania...

1220
01:32:46,801 --> 01:32:47,843
Polymnia...

1221
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:50,426
- Erato...
- Polymnia.

1222
01:32:50,593 --> 01:32:52,968
...and Meli whasisname...

1223
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:54,510
that other one...

1224
01:32:55,218 --> 01:32:56,218
Thalia...

1225
01:32:56,843 --> 01:32:58,051
Euteroe...

1226
01:32:58,218 --> 01:33:00,301
but the first is...

1227
01:33:00,718 --> 01:33:01,718
Clio.

1228
01:33:03,385 --> 01:33:04,545
The Muse of history and time.

1229
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:05,926
That Archimedes...

1230
01:33:06,135 --> 01:33:07,402
- what a clever bugger.
- The entrance...

1231
01:33:07,426 --> 01:33:09,510
to the tomb
is by the School of Mathematics...

1232
01:33:09,676 --> 01:33:11,426
under a statue of Clio...

1233
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:14,385
in the ruins
of the Great Library of Alexandria.

1234
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:15,760
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1235
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:18,385
Teddy!

1236
01:33:28,218 --> 01:33:29,676
The Grafikos, get it!

1237
01:33:57,301 --> 01:34:00,051
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1238
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:02,760
When you're in a tight spot, dynamite.

1239
01:34:04,551 --> 01:34:06,135
My friend was just murdered.

1240
01:34:11,593 --> 01:34:12,593
Sorry.

1241
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,510
You told them everything.

1242
01:34:16,218 --> 01:34:17,301
Word for word.

1243
01:34:17,926 --> 01:34:19,843
But Archimedes didn't make it that easy.

1244
01:34:20,593 --> 01:34:22,510
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1245
01:34:31,593 --> 01:34:32,593
Go!

1246
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:37,093
So, what do you see?

1247
01:34:37,718 --> 01:34:39,510
Polybius square.

1248
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:41,176
Made of?

1249
01:34:43,718 --> 01:34:44,926
Wax and wood.

1250
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:47,801
Anything else?

1251
01:34:51,426 --> 01:34:52,426
It's heavy.

1252
01:34:55,343 --> 01:34:56,468
Too heavy.

1253
01:34:58,551 --> 01:34:59,676
Give me that.

1254
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:41,510
This is solid gold?

1255
01:35:41,676 --> 01:35:42,885
Ancient gold.

1256
01:35:44,468 --> 01:35:45,468
From the Nile.

1257
01:35:47,176 --> 01:35:48,176
Hold it, Teddy.

1258
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:00,635
Sell this thing...

1259
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:02,483
and we are out of the hole and then some.

1260
01:36:02,635 --> 01:36:03,635
I have just the customer.

1261
01:36:03,718 --> 01:36:06,718
- Cranky, old Duchess in Gibraltar...
- This is going in a museum.

1262
01:36:10,093 --> 01:36:11,385
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1263
01:36:18,218 --> 01:36:19,218
What does it say?

1264
01:36:21,343 --> 01:36:24,218
"Search where Dionysius...

1265
01:36:25,051 --> 01:36:27,718
"hears each whisper..."

1266
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:30,593
"like a hurricane."

1267
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:34,843
The Ear.

1268
01:36:35,593 --> 01:36:37,426
The cave of Dionysius.

1269
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:39,301
Where is that?

1270
01:36:40,676 --> 01:36:41,718
In Sicily.

1271
01:36:43,218 --> 01:36:45,301
- How much fuel have we got?
- It's full.

1272
01:36:54,343 --> 01:36:55,343
They're heading west.

1273
01:36:56,635 --> 01:36:57,635
Not east.

1274
01:37:26,593 --> 01:37:27,593
I want the papaya.

1275
01:37:27,676 --> 01:37:28,718
How much is it?

1276
01:37:32,176 --> 01:37:33,176
Take this.

1277
01:37:35,926 --> 01:37:38,093
Look at that kid with the straw hat.

1278
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,260
This way.

1279
01:37:43,343 --> 01:37:44,343
Hey.

1280
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,051
What do you think?

1281
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:55,343
What are we doing?

1282
01:37:56,885 --> 01:37:58,593
Waiting for closing time at the caves.

1283
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,260
It's crawling with tourists.

1284
01:38:00,426 --> 01:38:02,843
Okay, so he's, like, running the show now?

1285
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:05,593
He's not running the show, Teddy.

1286
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:10,176
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1287
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:11,843
We are.

1288
01:38:15,426 --> 01:38:16,426
Most assuredly.

1289
01:38:16,468 --> 01:38:19,260
You know he's never gonna let us sell
any of that stuff.

1290
01:38:20,718 --> 01:38:22,426
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1291
01:38:22,551 --> 01:38:24,551
Helena, get over here! Give me a hand!

1292
01:38:30,468 --> 01:38:31,551
You splurged.

1293
01:38:32,926 --> 01:38:33,926
Here's your backpack.

1294
01:38:34,093 --> 01:38:35,093
Where's the kid?

1295
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,051
Hey, watch it!

1296
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:51,926
What's wrong with you?

1297
01:39:20,426 --> 01:39:21,551
Hello.

1298
01:39:23,218 --> 01:39:24,218
Hey.

1299
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:28,176
Let me go!

1300
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:30,385
Let me go!

1301
01:39:38,135 --> 01:39:40,343
Get off me! Let me go!

1302
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:45,051
Hey, hey, hey!

1303
01:39:56,051 --> 01:39:57,176
Helena!

1304
01:39:58,510 --> 01:39:59,968
They've got Teddy.

1305
01:40:02,051 --> 01:40:03,635
They took him up the hill somewhere.

1306
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:24,918
What are they gonna do to him?

1307
01:40:24,968 --> 01:40:27,635
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1308
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:30,510
They're not gonna hurt him.

1309
01:40:30,635 --> 01:40:31,801
They're gonna use him...

1310
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:34,801
to get the other half of the Dial.

1311
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:36,343
We gotta get there first.

1312
01:40:49,093 --> 01:40:53,135
Colonizing queens built many cities
in Sicily.

1313
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:54,801
- The temple...
- Let's go.

1314
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:58,051
...is the oldest of the Greek temples.

1315
01:40:59,135 --> 01:41:00,468
The cave's over there.

1316
01:41:10,801 --> 01:41:12,593
Could we go a little faster, please?

1317
01:41:21,801 --> 01:41:23,260
The Ear of Dionysius.

1318
01:41:31,010 --> 01:41:32,010
Wow.

1319
01:41:46,176 --> 01:41:49,676
"Search where Dionysius hears each whisper
like a hurricane."

1320
01:41:50,885 --> 01:41:51,885
That's some echo.

1321
01:41:53,593 --> 01:41:56,260
Keep making noise till we find out
where it's loudest.

1322
01:42:13,635 --> 01:42:14,635
Stop.

1323
01:42:22,426 --> 01:42:23,510
This is it.

1324
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,510
Greek pediment.

1325
01:42:30,635 --> 01:42:31,635
An entrance.

1326
01:42:33,051 --> 01:42:34,051
Used to be.

1327
01:42:37,343 --> 01:42:38,343
A crescent.

1328
01:42:41,218 --> 01:42:42,301
Just like on the Grafikos.

1329
01:42:49,843 --> 01:42:51,676
I think there's an opening up there.

1330
01:42:58,510 --> 01:42:59,510
You okay up there?

1331
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,510
Yes.

1332
01:43:04,176 --> 01:43:05,218
You're not moving.

1333
01:43:07,676 --> 01:43:08,926
I'm thinking.

1334
01:43:11,843 --> 01:43:12,843
About?

1335
01:43:13,885 --> 01:43:16,801
About what the hell I'm doing up here,
40 feet in the air...

1336
01:43:17,218 --> 01:43:18,718
with crap shoulders...

1337
01:43:18,885 --> 01:43:20,718
crumbling vertebrae...

1338
01:43:20,843 --> 01:43:23,426
a plate in one leg, screws in the other.

1339
01:43:23,551 --> 01:43:24,801
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1340
01:43:25,426 --> 01:43:26,551
No, you don't get it.

1341
01:43:27,385 --> 01:43:28,551
You're half my age.

1342
01:43:29,593 --> 01:43:32,301
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1343
01:43:32,468 --> 01:43:33,676
No. Fair enough.

1344
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,343
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1345
01:43:37,635 --> 01:43:40,468
And I'm just guessing, but I don't think
you've been shot nine times...

1346
01:43:40,593 --> 01:43:43,051
including once by your father.

1347
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,135
Dad shot you?

1348
01:43:46,843 --> 01:43:48,010
Don't talk to me.

1349
01:43:48,176 --> 01:43:49,416
Just go ahead. I'll follow you.

1350
01:43:58,135 --> 01:43:59,135
No, no, no.

1351
01:43:59,176 --> 01:44:00,635
We are close. We are close.

1352
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:01,801
Look around you.

1353
01:44:02,051 --> 01:44:03,531
- We are close.
- The Cave of Dionysius.

1354
01:44:03,635 --> 01:44:04,510
No, no, no.

1355
01:44:04,593 --> 01:44:06,551
The cave is closed for renovation.

1356
01:44:08,635 --> 01:44:09,635
Let me ask again.

1357
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,676
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1358
01:44:31,343 --> 01:44:33,510
What's the matter? You
worried about the kid?

1359
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,468
Are you sure they won't hurt him?

1360
01:44:36,593 --> 01:44:37,801
He'll be fine.

1361
01:44:37,968 --> 01:44:39,010
He's smart.

1362
01:44:40,885 --> 01:44:42,260
Where'd you find him?

1363
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:48,593
He tried to steal my purse outside a casino
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1364
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,593
I hit him repeatedly with my car door...

1365
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,343
but he didn't let go and neither did I.

1366
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:55,010
So, been together ever since.

1367
01:44:56,176 --> 01:44:58,093
Thought you were all about the money.

1368
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,260
I am.

1369
01:45:03,301 --> 01:45:07,343
Nobody memorizes every page
of their dead father's notebooks...

1370
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:08,551
for the money.

1371
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:16,260
Herr Voller!

1372
01:45:26,843 --> 01:45:28,218
They went that way.

1373
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,551
Why?

1374
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,385
Come on, come on.

1375
01:45:48,093 --> 01:45:49,093
Let's go.

1376
01:45:53,843 --> 01:45:54,843
Oh, my...

1377
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,260
Oh, my God!

1378
01:46:00,135 --> 01:46:01,426
Oh, my God!

1379
01:46:01,593 --> 01:46:03,051
- Oh, God!
- No, no.

1380
01:46:03,926 --> 01:46:05,343
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1381
01:46:09,801 --> 01:46:10,843
Are they off me?

1382
01:46:11,051 --> 01:46:11,843
- Get 'em off!
- No, no.

1383
01:46:12,051 --> 01:46:13,260
- Get 'em off!
- Wait.

1384
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:27,260
What is that?

1385
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:31,385
Methane.

1386
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:34,093
Don't breathe.

1387
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,260
Don't breathe?

1388
01:46:38,885 --> 01:46:40,343
We've gotta get outta here.

1389
01:46:49,218 --> 01:46:50,218
Athena.

1390
01:46:51,885 --> 01:46:53,218
Goddess of war.

1391
01:46:56,093 --> 01:46:57,301
And reason.

1392
01:47:01,551 --> 01:47:02,885
"Under the moon..."

1393
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:07,218
"life lies at her feet."

1394
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,301
Water displacement.

1395
01:47:17,135 --> 01:47:18,426
Get in the pool!

1396
01:47:18,551 --> 01:47:20,551
Why? Help me open the door.

1397
01:47:20,718 --> 01:47:22,468
Well, they didn't get out the doors!

1398
01:47:22,551 --> 01:47:23,551
Get in the pool!

1399
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:26,426
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1400
01:47:26,551 --> 01:47:27,676
Help me.

1401
01:47:30,426 --> 01:47:32,468
Archimedes was fascinated...

1402
01:47:33,926 --> 01:47:35,885
by water displacement!

1403
01:48:17,051 --> 01:48:18,260
Hey! Get back here!

1404
01:48:18,426 --> 01:48:19,426
Klaber!

1405
01:48:33,343 --> 01:48:34,468
You don't need to do that.

1406
01:49:00,635 --> 01:49:01,635
Hey!

1407
01:49:02,676 --> 01:49:03,676
Give me that!

1408
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:06,510
No!

1409
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,051
Leave them.

1410
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,385
I said leave them.

1411
01:49:41,801 --> 01:49:43,343
Reach and pull.

1412
01:49:43,468 --> 01:49:45,135
Reach and pull.

1413
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,426
Reach and pull.

1414
01:50:15,801 --> 01:50:17,426
Archimedes' tomb.

1415
01:50:46,343 --> 01:50:47,593
Grab that corner.

1416
01:51:33,843 --> 01:51:34,843
Indy.

1417
01:51:37,218 --> 01:51:38,551
This frieze...

1418
01:51:41,218 --> 01:51:42,510
It's a phoenix.

1419
01:51:42,635 --> 01:51:43,635
A common icon.

1420
01:51:43,801 --> 01:51:45,385
No. Look, it isn't.

1421
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:48,676
This phoenix has propellers.

1422
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:59,051
What's this doing here?

1423
01:52:07,801 --> 01:52:10,801
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years...

1424
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:12,926
much less watches.

1425
01:52:15,468 --> 01:52:16,635
Archimedes used it.

1426
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:21,551
Dad was right.

1427
01:52:22,385 --> 01:52:23,218
It works.

1428
01:52:23,385 --> 01:52:24,968
Of course it works, Miss Shaw.

1429
01:52:27,676 --> 01:52:28,885
Mathematics works.

1430
01:52:30,051 --> 01:52:33,051
As it conquered space,
it will conquer time.

1431
01:52:40,926 --> 01:52:42,843
You've already lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1432
01:52:43,051 --> 01:52:44,051
Your wife is gone.

1433
01:52:44,135 --> 01:52:46,051
Do you really want to lose your godchild?

1434
01:52:49,135 --> 01:52:50,218
For what?

1435
01:52:50,593 --> 01:52:52,718
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1436
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:05,260
Thank you.

1437
01:53:43,718 --> 01:53:45,135
History's greatest moment.

1438
01:53:52,218 --> 01:53:53,468
Its end.

1439
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:02,301
Throw me the gun!

1440
01:54:12,551 --> 01:54:13,801
Get him outta here.

1441
01:54:13,968 --> 01:54:14,968
Teddy.

1442
01:54:15,843 --> 01:54:17,010
Teddy! Teddy!

1443
01:54:17,135 --> 01:54:18,218
Come on! Go!

1444
01:54:18,385 --> 01:54:19,385
This way. Come on.

1445
01:54:23,343 --> 01:54:24,343
Go!

1446
01:54:28,593 --> 01:54:29,593
Indy!

1447
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:32,635
Go!

1448
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,051
Go!

1449
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:35,343
Stop!

1450
01:54:38,676 --> 01:54:40,093
Now what?

1451
01:54:41,718 --> 01:54:42,718
Bring him.

1452
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,760
Helena, come on!

1453
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:53,486
- Teddy, we can't just leave him.
- We're not!

1454
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,635
Follow me!

1455
01:54:56,635 --> 01:54:57,635
Come on!

1456
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:02,551
Come on.

1457
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,718
Teddy. Come on. We've got a car.

1458
01:55:23,676 --> 01:55:24,676
Crap.

1459
01:55:30,843 --> 01:55:31,885
Stay there.

1460
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,760
Hop on.

1461
01:55:55,385 --> 01:55:58,301
The first hemisphere sets the destination.

1462
01:55:59,801 --> 01:56:03,385
The second calculates the location
of the fissure...

1463
01:56:04,593 --> 01:56:06,468
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1464
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:09,885
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude...

1465
01:56:10,968 --> 01:56:12,801
and transmit way points to the pilots.

1466
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:26,468
Shortcut.

1467
01:56:30,718 --> 01:56:35,176
- You got coordinates for 37.07.
- So, who is it?

1468
01:56:35,843 --> 01:56:37,176
Churchill?

1469
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,510
Ike?

1470
01:56:41,801 --> 01:56:44,301
Who are you gonna kill to win the war?

1471
01:56:45,135 --> 01:56:48,051
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes...

1472
01:56:48,176 --> 01:56:50,093
we shall fly into the eye of this storm...

1473
01:56:50,843 --> 01:56:53,135
and cross into Sicilian airspace...

1474
01:56:53,301 --> 01:56:56,718
on August 20th, 1939.

1475
01:56:57,468 --> 01:57:01,051
We will head north over friendly skies
with enough fuel to reach Munich.

1476
01:57:02,385 --> 01:57:03,968
My quarry will be waiting for me...

1477
01:57:04,135 --> 01:57:06,968
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz...

1478
01:57:07,385 --> 01:57:09,551
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1479
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:20,468
What kind of Nazi kills the Führer?

1480
01:57:22,176 --> 01:57:24,760
The kind that believes
in victory, Dr. Jones.

1481
01:57:30,051 --> 01:57:33,885
Hitler lit a fire that could have burned
1,000 years.

1482
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:35,551
I saw every mistake.

1483
01:57:36,343 --> 01:57:37,635
Every blunder.

1484
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:39,468
And I will correct them all.

1485
01:57:39,593 --> 01:57:42,260
History is a long list
of losses, Dr. Jones.

1486
01:57:43,301 --> 01:57:44,510
It's just a question of whose.

1487
01:57:57,218 --> 01:57:58,218
Stop!

1488
01:59:11,343 --> 01:59:12,343
Teddy.

1489
01:59:13,968 --> 01:59:15,368
You think you can fly one of those?

1490
01:59:17,135 --> 01:59:18,135
A Nord?

1491
01:59:20,718 --> 01:59:21,718
Sure.

1492
01:59:22,426 --> 01:59:23,546
It's not a ringing response.

1493
01:59:23,676 --> 01:59:25,385
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1494
01:59:25,468 --> 01:59:27,093
You've never flown any plane.

1495
01:59:28,885 --> 01:59:30,093
I'll get it started.

1496
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:31,510
No, Teddy.

1497
01:59:32,801 --> 01:59:33,801
Crap.

1498
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:02,593
Fasten your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1499
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,093
There might be some turbulence.

1500
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:07,468
You're German, Voller.

1501
02:00:07,676 --> 02:00:09,676
Don't try and be funny.

1502
02:00:33,093 --> 02:00:34,885
Come on, big talker.

1503
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:50,801
Okay.

1504
02:01:07,468 --> 02:01:09,135
Okay. Okay.

1505
02:01:09,301 --> 02:01:11,760
Gauges green. Power full.

1506
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,968
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1507
02:01:52,635 --> 02:01:54,135
Okay, wings down.

1508
02:01:56,218 --> 02:01:58,218
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1509
02:01:58,593 --> 02:01:59,593
Rotate.

1510
02:03:07,426 --> 02:03:08,718
Time to destination?

1511
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,468
60 seconds.

1512
02:03:16,801 --> 02:03:18,343
Continental drift.

1513
02:03:21,718 --> 02:03:22,885
Continental drift!

1514
02:03:24,676 --> 02:03:27,260
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1515
02:03:28,093 --> 02:03:29,343
He couldn't have!

1516
02:03:30,343 --> 02:03:32,260
It hadn't been observed yet.

1517
02:03:33,301 --> 02:03:35,093
You're off target.

1518
02:03:35,468 --> 02:03:37,426
Your coordinates are based on markers...

1519
02:03:38,176 --> 02:03:41,385
that have been moving for 2000 years!

1520
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:44,885
You could be off by 10 degrees, by...

1521
02:03:59,885 --> 02:04:01,468
30 seconds.

1522
02:04:02,676 --> 02:04:03,510
Herr Voller...

1523
02:04:03,676 --> 02:04:06,468
Your calculations are wrong!

1524
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,330
- Herr Voller...
- Will you shut up?

1525
02:04:08,801 --> 02:04:09,801
I'm thinking!

1526
02:04:12,801 --> 02:04:13,801
20 seconds.

1527
02:04:16,468 --> 02:04:17,593
Hold the flight path!

1528
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:20,885
15 seconds.

1529
02:04:24,426 --> 02:04:25,986
I don't know where we're going, Jürgen.

1530
02:04:26,093 --> 02:04:27,093
10 seconds.

1531
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:28,510
9!

1532
02:04:28,593 --> 02:04:30,093
- But it sure as hell...
- 8!

1533
02:04:30,635 --> 02:04:32,176
- 7!
- ...ain't 1939!

1534
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:33,010
6!

1535
02:04:33,093 --> 02:04:34,385
Turn around!

1536
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:36,051
Abort!

1537
02:04:36,468 --> 02:04:37,468
Turn around!

1538
02:04:38,135 --> 02:04:39,135
ABORT!!!

1539
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:41,218
We're being pulled in!

1540
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,510
What are you doing?!

1541
02:04:52,718 --> 02:04:53,718
This is my plane!

1542
02:04:53,885 --> 02:04:55,301
You're flying my plane!

1543
02:05:20,093 --> 02:05:21,260
We're going to DIE!!!

1544
02:05:22,551 --> 02:05:24,301
We need to pull up!

1545
02:05:46,135 --> 02:05:47,301
Restart engines!

1546
02:06:15,885 --> 02:06:17,010
That's Sicily.

1547
02:06:17,176 --> 02:06:18,426
1939.

1548
02:06:20,135 --> 02:06:21,551
I did it.

1549
02:06:21,718 --> 02:06:23,218
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1550
02:06:23,385 --> 02:06:25,135
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1551
02:06:32,093 --> 02:06:34,135
Yesterday belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1552
02:06:58,968 --> 02:07:01,176
Those are Roman triremes.

1553
02:07:29,385 --> 02:07:30,551
Keep it in the air!

1554
02:07:50,676 --> 02:07:51,426
Master...

1555
02:07:51,635 --> 02:07:54,051
The Romans are getting closer.

1556
02:07:55,801 --> 02:07:56,801
They have dragons!

1557
02:08:01,385 --> 02:08:02,760
Amazing.

1558
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:13,260
Open the door!

1559
02:08:18,135 --> 02:08:19,135
What are you doing?

1560
02:08:20,093 --> 02:08:21,801
What are you doing, you idiots?

1561
02:08:21,968 --> 02:08:23,760
They think we're a monster!

1562
02:08:30,218 --> 02:08:31,676
You have to turn around.

1563
02:08:31,885 --> 02:08:33,760
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1564
02:08:34,926 --> 02:08:36,301
214 BC.

1565
02:08:36,426 --> 02:08:37,593
You got the wrong war.

1566
02:08:41,426 --> 02:08:42,426
Master...

1567
02:08:45,635 --> 02:08:46,843
Don't ride out there, Master!

1568
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:48,676
The dragons!!

1569
02:08:58,926 --> 02:09:02,468
We must take down their dragons!

1570
02:09:09,593 --> 02:09:10,468
Boss!

1571
02:09:10,593 --> 02:09:11,593
Change course!

1572
02:09:11,676 --> 02:09:13,051
The portal closes in minutes!

1573
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:14,510
I have to go back!

1574
02:09:14,843 --> 02:09:16,010
I can't be here!

1575
02:09:16,176 --> 02:09:17,260
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

1576
02:09:17,426 --> 02:09:18,885
The plane won't make it!!

1577
02:09:48,593 --> 02:09:49,593
Get out of the way!

1578
02:09:55,843 --> 02:09:58,010
How do you like that, you savages?

1579
02:10:01,051 --> 02:10:03,801
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1580
02:10:13,843 --> 02:10:15,926
What are you doing here?

1581
02:10:16,135 --> 02:10:17,593
Rescuing you!

1582
02:10:29,176 --> 02:10:30,176
Get him off!

1583
02:10:31,426 --> 02:10:32,468
Indy!

1584
02:10:38,176 --> 02:10:39,343
Parachute!

1585
02:10:42,176 --> 02:10:43,343
I got a parachute!

1586
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:45,760
Hang on!

1587
02:10:49,468 --> 02:10:50,468
Let go!

1588
02:10:52,635 --> 02:10:54,051
Give me the parachute!

1589
02:11:00,135 --> 02:11:02,260
Grab it. Hang on!

1590
02:11:04,635 --> 02:11:05,635
Indy!

1591
02:11:32,801 --> 02:11:34,343
We're losing altitude!

1592
02:11:35,551 --> 02:11:36,551
We're going down!

1593
02:11:38,426 --> 02:11:39,968
I've lost control!

1594
02:11:58,218 --> 02:12:00,593
Hey, those are my friends.

1595
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:02,801
Those are my friends. We need to help them!

1596
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:05,593
Those are my friends!

1597
02:13:07,426 --> 02:13:08,760
Eureka.

1598
02:13:26,010 --> 02:13:27,010
He's trying to land.

1599
02:13:27,051 --> 02:13:29,051
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1600
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,801
Get up. Yeah.

1601
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,301
We need to get you out of here. Okay.

1602
02:13:36,218 --> 02:13:37,468
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1603
02:13:38,385 --> 02:13:39,551
Sit up. You need to help me.

1604
02:13:39,718 --> 02:13:41,635
I know it hurts, but we gotta get you back.

1605
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,510
This is incredible, Wombat.

1606
02:13:45,051 --> 02:13:47,010
Incredible.

1607
02:13:48,551 --> 02:13:50,260
Yeah, it very well is.

1608
02:13:50,426 --> 02:13:52,051
But we have to get you out of here.

1609
02:13:54,135 --> 02:13:55,260
My God.

1610
02:13:56,926 --> 02:13:58,760
We're witnessing history.

1611
02:14:05,843 --> 02:14:07,676
Reverse these numbers.

1612
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:08,885
They'll get you home.

1613
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:11,760
What?

1614
02:14:14,510 --> 02:14:15,718
I'm going to stay.

1615
02:14:16,468 --> 02:14:18,468
No. You're not serious.

1616
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:22,343
Wow, you are serious.

1617
02:14:26,426 --> 02:14:28,176
Indy, you've been shot.

1618
02:14:28,343 --> 02:14:29,343
You're bleeding.

1619
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:31,135
You can't stay here.

1620
02:14:31,301 --> 02:14:32,301
Yes, I can.

1621
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,760
But for what?

1622
02:14:33,885 --> 02:14:37,510
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1623
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:40,635
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1624
02:14:41,718 --> 02:14:43,510
Studied it.

1625
02:14:43,718 --> 02:14:45,760
- All my life.
- Yeah.

1626
02:14:45,926 --> 02:14:49,051
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1627
02:14:49,218 --> 02:14:50,218
And die.

1628
02:14:50,718 --> 02:14:52,426
Please, get up.

1629
02:14:54,176 --> 02:14:55,343
Helena!

1630
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:56,635
I did it!

1631
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:59,135
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1632
02:14:59,343 --> 02:15:00,801
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go. Get up.

1633
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,611
- I need to get you into that plane, okay?
- No.

1634
02:15:02,635 --> 02:15:03,635
- We need to.
- No.

1635
02:15:03,718 --> 02:15:05,343
Get up. You can... We can!

1636
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:19,510
Master!

1637
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:23,760
We have to leave, Master.

1638
02:15:25,468 --> 02:15:26,468
It's him.

1639
02:15:35,385 --> 02:15:37,426
He's asking how far we've come.

1640
02:15:40,801 --> 02:15:43,551
Two thousand years.

1641
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:45,426
We've come...

1642
02:15:45,968 --> 02:15:48,968
two thousand years.

1643
02:15:51,343 --> 02:15:54,468
But we didn't expect to meet...

1644
02:15:54,968 --> 02:15:57,468
the great...

1645
02:15:58,051 --> 02:16:00,093
Archimedes.

1646
02:16:05,676 --> 02:16:06,676
You...

1647
02:16:07,801 --> 02:16:09,218
were always...

1648
02:16:09,801 --> 02:16:11,135
going to...

1649
02:16:11,635 --> 02:16:13,301
meet me.

1650
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:15,801
That dial is a forced deck.

1651
02:16:15,968 --> 02:16:17,448
It doesn't take us anywhere but here.

1652
02:16:17,551 --> 02:16:18,843
He built it to get help.

1653
02:16:19,010 --> 02:16:21,551
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy...

1654
02:16:21,718 --> 02:16:22,819
so I think we've helped enough.

1655
02:16:22,843 --> 02:16:24,468
Apologies, Archimedes.

1656
02:16:24,676 --> 02:16:26,051
I'm a fan...

1657
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,301
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

1658
02:16:28,426 --> 02:16:29,426
Helena...

1659
02:16:29,468 --> 02:16:30,611
He can't keep that, by the way.

1660
02:16:30,635 --> 02:16:31,652
He needs to build his own one.

1661
02:16:31,676 --> 02:16:33,468
Helena, we need to go!

1662
02:16:33,843 --> 02:16:36,010
Indy, the window is closing!

1663
02:16:36,218 --> 02:16:37,343
We cannot get stuck here!

1664
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,510
I want...

1665
02:16:39,635 --> 02:16:40,718
to stay...

1666
02:16:41,093 --> 02:16:42,843
with you.

1667
02:16:43,010 --> 02:16:44,968
No, no, no! Do not say yes!

1668
02:16:45,551 --> 02:16:47,801
You are a brilliant man...

1669
02:16:48,093 --> 02:16:50,093
a wise man...

1670
02:16:50,551 --> 02:16:51,926
a genius...

1671
02:16:52,135 --> 02:16:52,926
Helena...

1672
02:16:53,135 --> 02:16:55,426
a hero to your people.

1673
02:16:56,176 --> 02:16:59,635
But he can't help you.

1674
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:02,510
This is your time.

1675
02:17:02,635 --> 02:17:03,385
This is your time.

1676
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:05,510
He must be in his own time -

1677
02:17:05,635 --> 02:17:06,718
He needs to be in his.

1678
02:17:06,843 --> 02:17:07,843
His work is not done.

1679
02:17:08,218 --> 02:17:09,218
He needs to go home.

1680
02:17:09,343 --> 02:17:10,926
There is medicine at home.

1681
02:17:11,093 --> 02:17:12,885
He cannot die here. He can't.

1682
02:17:14,510 --> 02:17:17,385
Helena, get on the plane.

1683
02:17:20,010 --> 02:17:21,093
I'll be all right.

1684
02:17:22,843 --> 02:17:24,301
No, you won't.

1685
02:17:27,218 --> 02:17:28,885
I need to do this.

1686
02:17:30,176 --> 02:17:31,176
Me too.

1687
02:18:25,593 --> 02:18:26,593
Good morning.

1688
02:18:31,343 --> 02:18:32,676
How's the shoulder?

1689
02:18:35,385 --> 02:18:37,843
Better than my jaw.

1690
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:42,510
Right.

1691
02:18:44,510 --> 02:18:46,010
You should've let me stay.

1692
02:18:46,843 --> 02:18:48,093
I couldn't do that.

1693
02:18:57,135 --> 02:18:58,135
Why not?

1694
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:02,468
Well, for starters, you'd have changed
the course of history.

1695
02:19:06,801 --> 02:19:08,635
That's supposed to be a bad thing?

1696
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,551
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1697
02:19:18,426 --> 02:19:19,426
Here.

1698
02:19:24,468 --> 02:19:25,551
For who?

1699
02:19:52,843 --> 02:19:54,510
Marion.

1700
02:19:55,676 --> 02:19:56,718
Hey.

1701
02:20:16,135 --> 02:20:17,135
Teddy.

1702
02:20:18,593 --> 02:20:19,593
Marion.

1703
02:20:22,426 --> 02:20:23,426
What are you doing?

1704
02:20:24,843 --> 02:20:26,051
Putting groceries away.

1705
02:20:28,343 --> 02:20:31,051
There wasn't a scrap of food in this place.

1706
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:34,010
No. Really.

1707
02:20:38,718 --> 02:20:41,010
Someone told me you were back.

1708
02:20:48,468 --> 02:20:50,051
Are you back, Indy?

1709
02:20:51,676 --> 02:20:53,426
It was explosives...

1710
02:20:53,551 --> 02:20:55,676
and Indy was running,
Marion was running...

1711
02:20:55,843 --> 02:20:58,468
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1712
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:04,301
Indy, you're up and about.

1713
02:21:05,468 --> 02:21:06,801
Yes, I am.

1714
02:21:08,176 --> 02:21:09,176
Yes.

1715
02:21:09,551 --> 02:21:11,635
Why don't we go and
get some ice cream, kids?

1716
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:13,051
But Marion just bought some.

1717
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:14,343
Oh, I know a better place.

1718
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:16,676
You can never have too much ice cream,
can you?

1719
02:21:20,551 --> 02:21:21,551
See you later.

1720
02:21:24,551 --> 02:21:27,885
A British tar is a soaring soul

1721
02:21:28,093 --> 02:21:30,843
As free as a mountain bird

1722
02:21:31,093 --> 02:21:32,843
His energetic fist

1723
02:21:33,093 --> 02:21:35,510
Should be ready to resist...

1724
02:21:37,385 --> 02:21:38,635
That looks bad.

1725
02:21:40,135 --> 02:21:41,426
Does it hurt?

1726
02:21:43,926 --> 02:21:45,385
Everything hurts.

1727
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:49,885
I know how that feels.

1728
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:58,593
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1729
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:07,760
Here.

1730
02:22:08,968 --> 02:22:10,218
It doesn't hurt here.

1731
02:22:18,468 --> 02:22:20,051
And here.

1732
02:22:43,551 --> 02:22:46,010
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1733
02:22:46,176 --> 02:22:48,301
Helena! Hurry up!

1734
02:22:48,468 --> 02:22:51,135
I scream, you scream...

1735
02:22:51,301 --> 02:22:53,010
Everybody, slow down.

1736
02:22:53,093 --> 02:22:55,551
-I scream, you scream
-I scream, I scream

1737
02:22:55,718 --> 02:22:57,468
We all scream for ice cream!

1738
02:22:57,593 --> 02:22:58,760
Slow down.
