I'm sure they did.

One with your milk in it.

68

I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

69
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,679
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,319
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

71
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,319
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

72
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,559
Monitor?

73
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,439
He'll be separated
from the other children.

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,159
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,479
Samuel won't cope with this.

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,879
He already feels so different.

77
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,639
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

78
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,719
Mrs Fanning,

79
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,079
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,799
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

81
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,959
What he needs
is some understanding.

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,559
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,959
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,519
I think I'll just find
another school.

85
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,919
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,879
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,599
that sees my son
as a human being

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,519
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

89
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,399
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,759
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

91
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,879
His name is Samuel.

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,599
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,679
You can play
on that swing you like

94
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,519
for as long as you like, OK?

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,439
Mrs Bruen hates me.

96
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,999
No, she doesn't.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,319
Just need a break, that's all.

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,439
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

99
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,519
I'll tell her later.

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,239
(BEEP! BEEP!)

101
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,439
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

102
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,799
Sam, don't bother the lady.

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,359
No, no, no. That's alright.

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,159
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

105
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,719
My dad's in the cemetery.

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,879
Oh. That's...

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,759
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

108
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,359
Samuel.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,719
I'm sorry. He just...

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,479
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,479
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,199
We have to go.

119
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,439
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

120
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,359

It's wet.

to do for Wednesday?

I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,959
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

128

She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

129

- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

130
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,599
She wants to have
a princess party.

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,759
Mum! Mum!

132
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,199
That's OK.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,359
We don't have to come.

134
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,239
You can still come.

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,319
SAMUEL: Mum!

136
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,439
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,439
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

Watch.

his birthday properly

141
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,999
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

I just want you to be happy

and then this birthday thing
rolls around

145
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,679
and I end up feeling awful.

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,879
I don't want you to feel awful,

Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

360
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,159
What kind of writing did you do?

361
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,959
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

362
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

363
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,679
It must be difficult.

364
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,999
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

365
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,639
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

366
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,199

372
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,279
That's a real tragedy.

373
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,479
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

374
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,479

if it's real or not?

She never comes to our house.

383
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,999
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

384
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,799
'cause it's too depressing.

385

for breakfast.

- Shut up!

There's a big difference.

mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

Please help me!

429
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,239
There's something wrong
with my son.

430
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,719
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

431
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,519
That's when the brain overheats.

432
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,799
It always looks worse
than it is.

433
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,599
I've never seen
anything like this.

434
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,599
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

435
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,319
All his other results
are normal.

436
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,319
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

437
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,999
Very committed to
the monster theory.

438
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,319
That's an understatement.

439
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,919
All children see monsters.

440
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,599
Not like this.

441
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,879
And it's getting worse.

442
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,479
He's becoming aggressive.

443
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,999
He could see a psychiatrist.

444
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,559
I can refer you.

445
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,079
Takes a few weeks to get in.

446
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,239
That'd be great.

447
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
But can you just give me
something for now,

448
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,639
just to make him sleep?

449
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,279
Um, just until...

450
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,599
...just until
we get an appointment.

451
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,839
Please?

452
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,439
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

453
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,799
and when we go home tonight,

454
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,719
this whole nightmare
will start up again

455
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,919
and I am really...

456
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,679
...I'm really not coping.

457
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,279
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

458
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,599
Just until the tests come back.

459
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,279
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

460
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,199
It's really bad.

461
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,519
These can make children
feel foggy.

462
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,679
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

463
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,759
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

464
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,199
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

like me?

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,279
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

468

Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

469
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,639
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

470
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,959
and not worry.

471
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,119
I don't want you to die.

472
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,119
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

473
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,199
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

474
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,639
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

475
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,879
I've got the day off tomorrow.

476
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,839
Maybe we could do something,
hmm?

477
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,079
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

478
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,719
I think so

479
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,519

not to mention it again.
