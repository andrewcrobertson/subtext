1
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,255
What's wrong?

2
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,505
There's someone on the roof.

3
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,505
Jules!
Baby, are you sleepwalking?

4
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:36,923
Listen.

5
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:44,130
I don't hear anything.

6
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:46,130
Come on, baby,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

7
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,631
What now?

8
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,756
I don't know, she said she heard something on the roof.

9
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,631
There were footsteps.

10
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:53,380
Naturally.

11
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:54,881
Jingle bells too, right?

12
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,130
Mark, stop.

13
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:57,255
But I heard him.

14
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,797
Can you take care of this,
please?

15
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,297
I gotta be up in three hours.

16
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,172
Come on, Jules,
let's get back into bed.

17
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,631
No more sugar after dinner,
okay?

18
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,255
Too many bad dreams
and not enough sleep.

19
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,172
But mom!

20
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,881
I didn't have a bad dream.

21
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,547
I really heard someone
on the roof!

22
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,172
Shh.

23
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:17,130
Keep your voice down.

24
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,047
Don't wake up your brother.

25
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,130
Nobody believes me.

26
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:24,756
Jules, it's probably just
the house settling.

27
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,047
Or an animal.

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,631
You know, sometimes a raccoon
or squirrel can get up there.

29
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,547
It was Santa.

30
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,297
I'm positive.

31
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:36,005
You know who I really think
it was?

32
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,505
Who?

33
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,172
One of Santa's elves.

34
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,130
An elf?

35
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,631
Mhm.

36
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,255
Sometimes Santa sends a scout
a few days before Christmas Eve

37
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,005
to make sure our house meets
all the necessary

38
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,547
safety requirements.

39
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,756
Like what?

40
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,631
Like making sure the roof
is sturdy enough

41
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,756
to hold all the reindeer,
for one thing.

42
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,047
Can't have them crashing
through the ceiling,

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,005
running all through the house,
pooping on everything.

44
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,756
What else?

45
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,672
They have to measure the chimney
to make sure it's wide enough

46
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:03,297
to fit Santa's big fat belly.

47
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,172
Sometimes he splurges
too much during the holidays.

48
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:07,881
Just like daddy?

49
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,422
Just like daddy.

50
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:12,672
Can we leave some milk
and cookies out for the elves?

51
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,380
If you go to sleep right now,

52
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:16,505
I'll go downstairs
and leave them a plate.

53
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,631
Okay?

54
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,505
You forgot to lock
the front door again.

55
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:10,756
Perhaps you could have
a little concern

56
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:12,631
for your family's safety?

57
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,505
By the way, your daughter left
a glass of milk and cookies

58
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,422
for Santa's elves
in the kitchen.

59
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,631
Can you make sure to eat them before she gets up for school?

60
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,005
Hello?

61
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,380
Can you take care of that
when you wake up, please?

62
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,005
When I wake up?

63
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,505
I am up, Jen.

64
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,255
I have been up
because you keep talking to me.

65
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,130
I will take care of it.

66
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:43,881
Thank you, Mr. Grinch.

67
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,380
Santa?

68
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:35,923
Timmy!

69
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:36,672
Timmy, wake up!

70
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,505
Santa's downstairs.

71
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,380
Timmy!

72
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,297
He was putting presents
under the tree, I saw him!

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,547
Go away!

74
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,380
Juliet, I told you
to stay out of my-

75
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,422
Babe, what are you doing?

76
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:08,047
Timmy, Juliet, run!

77
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:15,130
Juliet!

78
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,505
Timmy!

79
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:37,505
Help me!

80
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:40,672
No, please!

81
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,422
Somebody fucking help me!

82
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,797
Help me, please!

83
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,923
Oh fuck, help me!

84
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,005
Help me!

85
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:18,797
Be advised.

86
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,505
Anonymous caller says possible suspect on lower level.

87
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:22,756
Armed and dangerous.

88
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,881
Oh, fuck.

89
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,297
Dispatch, I got
a decapitated body down here.

90
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,130
Victim appears to be male.

91
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,881
That's a ten-four.

92
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,047
Dispatch,
I'm not alone down here.

93
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,756
What's- what's the ETA
on the backup?

94
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:13,923
I'll have the ship
in the air in a minute!

95
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,172
The ship's on fire.

96
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,672
Eros?

97
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,505
Dean,
I need you to get down here now.

98
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,422
Cell three, east wing.

99
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:02,631
I think we got
a situation.

100
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,005
Over.

101
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,547
Aww!

102
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,380
Well, wipe your ass
and get down here, pronto!

103
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,047
Help.

104
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,172
Help me!

105
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,005
Please!

106
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,631
Please help me!

107
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,380
Oh, he made me do it.

108
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,130
Please just help me!

109
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,047
Help me!

110
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,881
Help me, fucker!

111
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,756
Help me!

112
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,130
Help me!

113
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:50,881
Help me!

114
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:04,505
Yes!

115
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,130
More!

116
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:20,797
Yo, yo!

117
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,756
You guys, you-
you look so good.

118
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,631
I mean, way better than mine.

119
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,380
I was gonna do
the blood thing, too,

120
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,255
but I was just worried
about the clean up.

121
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:32,130
But... Can I-
can I get a picture?

122
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,380
I'm gonna post this.

123
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:35,881
Guys, seriously?

124
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:36,756
You killed it.

125
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,881
This is awesome!

126
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:38,505
Aww.

127
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,380
Aww.

128
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:49,631
Vicky, you used to be so hot.

129
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,255
Now no one's gonna fuck you.

130
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:02,631
Pretty girl.

131
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:48,631
Hi.

132
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:49,130
Good morning.

133
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:49,923
Morning.

134
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:50,923
I'm here to pick up my niece.

135
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:51,923
She's a patient here.

136
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,005
What's her name?

137
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,756
Shaw.

138
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,005
Sienna Shaw.

139
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:56,422
Uncle Greg!

140
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,505
Never mind.

141
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:00,130
- Hey!
- Hey!

142
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,422
- How are you?
- Good.

143
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,130
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

144
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:04,756
Wow.

145
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:05,672
You look good.

146
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:07,130
- No, I got it.
- No, no, no, I got it.

147
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,505
- I insist.
- Thanks.

148
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:10,130
Welcome.

149
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,631
So do we run, or...

150
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:12,756
Gotta sign out first.

151
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:43,297
So, uh, how's my little
partner in crime?

152
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,631
Oh,
she's not so little anymore.

153
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,005
Uh, she's great.

154
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,631
Man, beautiful.

155
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:53,505
Sassy as hell
and talented like you.

156
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:56,130
In fact,
you're all she ever talks about,

157
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,130
so, little warning,

158
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:00,923
just get ready
to have your hands full,

159
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,881
because she misses you.

160
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,505
I miss her, too.

161
00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:20,923
Hey.

162
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,380
We're home!

163
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,380
All right.

164
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,172
Hello?

165
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,297
Sienna!

166
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,130
Incoming!

167
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,297
Oh, hey!

168
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:35,631
Hey!

169
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,505
Hey, Gabs.

170
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,505
Oh my god, you got so big!

171
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:45,172
When did that happen?

172
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:48,130
Never leave me
for this long ever again.

173
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,631
I won't.

174
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:52,130
I promise.

175
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:54,255
Oh, you got glitter
all over your face.

176
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,005
It's just sugar.

177
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,505
We were baking.

178
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:57,631
Did you want to help?

179
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:59,505
Gabbie, Sienna's not even
in here two minutes.

180
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,255
Why don't you let her
get settled first, all right?

181
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:03,255
Fine.

182
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,005
Yeah, I'd love to.

183
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,005
I'm so happy to see you.

184
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,505
Me too.

185
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:21,505
How was the trip?

186
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:22,047
Fine.

187
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,505
Wanna see your room?

188
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:24,130
Go ahead.

189
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:25,756
We'll catch up later.

190
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:26,422
Yeah. All right.

191
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,005
I'll see you guys later.

192
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:31,631
And don't pull her arm out.

193
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,631
- Ready?
- Yes.

194
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,422
Oh my God.

195
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,130
It looks like a fairy tale
exploded in here.

196
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:52,297
Do you like it?

197
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,881
Me and mommy redecorated,
but I picked out most of it.

198
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:58,380
I know how much you like
dragons and wizards.

199
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:00,631
I love it.

200
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,255
Really?

201
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:04,005
Yes, really.

202
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:05,255
This is the coolest room ever.

203
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,547
Are you kidding?

204
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,505
I don't know what to say,
this is beautiful.

205
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,130
Made this for you too.

206
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,130
Gabs.

207
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:22,380
'To Sienna, my big sister
from another mister.

208
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,422
I've missed you more than ever.

209
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:27,005
And getting into trouble
hasn't been nearly as much fun

210
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:28,756
without you.

211
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,047
Looking forward
to the best Christmas ever,

212
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,255
filled with fun,
smiles, and laughter.

213
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:35,505
Love, Gabby.

214
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:40,005
P.S. We still haven't made it
to the moon. '

215
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,380
To the moon!

216
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:47,380
Our little cardboard
rocket ship.

217
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,631
You remember?

218
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:52,255
Of course I do.

219
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,547
Come here.

220
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,047
Jesus.

221
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,005
- Yeah.
- Stinks in here.

222
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,756
A real beaut, ain't she?

223
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:28,130
Shit!

224
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,923
It's a rat, kid,
not the devil.

225
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:36,005
Yeah.

226
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,797
Are you alright?

227
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:40,005
Oh, you've been skittish
all day.

228
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,297
I just hate places like this.

229
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
It's like they got a soul
and they're pissed that

230
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:46,005
- we're tearing 'em apart.
- Oh, shit.

231
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,756
Please don't tell me
you believe all the stories

232
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,005
about this place.

233
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,505
What stories?

234
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,881
Back in the early 90s,

235
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,380
some maniac abducted
and killed over a dozen kids

236
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:00,130
in this town.

237
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,797
They buried all the bodies
in the basement here

238
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,380
in this building.

239
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,923
Now everyone swears
the place is haunted.

240
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:18,505
Are you fucking with me?

241
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,881
You're fucking with me.

242
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:25,797
Of course I'm fucking with you.

243
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,130
Now come on.

244
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:30,923
I'll take the first floor
and the basement.

245
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:33,631
You... upstairs.

246
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,631
Skittish all day.

247
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,756
So, what do you think?

248
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,005
More Blaster Man?

249
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:23,255
What's the matter
with Blaster Man?

250
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,631
I thought you liked him.

251
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,380
You only draw boys.

252
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,505
Boys, boys, boys.

253
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:29,923
That's not true.

254
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,881
I draw girls all the ti-
that is a girl right there.

255
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:33,505
Look at that.

256
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:34,756
That is a girl.

257
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:37,631
But she's not a superhero.

258
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:39,756
Last time you said
you were going to draw a girl

259
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:41,881
that could beat up Blaster Man.

260
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,172
Remember?

261
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:46,547
You pinky swore!

262
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,005
That's sacred.

263
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,881
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

264
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,005
I will tell you what, though.

265
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,756
As soon as I'm finished
with this comic,

266
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:56,297
I'm gonna make you
something really special.

267
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,005
How's that? Okay?

268
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,255
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:03,631
Yeah, well.

270
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,255
Okay.

271
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,631
Time for bed.

272
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,005
Sisi!

273
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,172
Wait a minute.

274
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
I do have something for you.

275
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:28,547
I woke up back
in the clown cafÃ©,

276
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,422
encased in glass.

277
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:32,881
My lungs filled with ice water.

278
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:34,923
This wasn't a dream
or a hallucination.

279
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:37,631
Okay, give me that.

280
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,631
This isn't
for public consumption, nosy.

281
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,005
It's my diary. Okay?

282
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,672
It's for my eyes only.

283
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:45,923
Got it?

284
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:47,172
Got it.

285
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,505
What's the clown cafÃ©?

286
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,756
It's a bad place.

287
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,672
A place I don't want
to think about.

288
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:58,130
Happy thoughts
from now on. Okay?

289
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,422
Okay.

290
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:26,631
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
this place fucking smells

291
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:49,756
Disgusting.

292
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,881
What the hell is that?

293
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,756
Anybody home?

294
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,130
What the fuck?

295
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,047
Hello?

296
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,881
It's not real.

297
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,631
It's not real, right?

298
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,631
Hey, Jackson!

299
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,005
Anybody home?

300
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,631
Yoo-hoo.

301
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,130
What the fuck?

302
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,380
Holy shit!

303
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:58,672
Holy shit!

304
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,255
Dennis!

305
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:22,672
Dennis!

306
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,881
Hey!

307
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,005
Hey!

308
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,130
Dennis!

309
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,505
Get your ass up here!

310
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,756
Now!

311
00:33:40,672 --> 00:33:42,130
Are you real?

312
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,172
No!

313
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,631
No! No!

314
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,255
I think we need to make
some cookies.

315
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,130
Yeah. For dessert!

316
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,756
We need to- Yeah!

317
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:17,756
We're gonna go all out, man.

318
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,172
Chocolate and peanut butter,
you are right.

319
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,380
That's the combination.

320
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,047
You know, those coconut peanut
butter ones are amazing.

321
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,505
This is going to be
a Christmas extravaganza.

322
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,422
I'd like to go see
those lights again.

323
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:28,631
I wanna see the lights.

324
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,380
I like the holiday market that
they have over there.

325
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,881
Gabs, stop starin'.

326
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:34,547
It's rude.

327
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:35,130
What?

328
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,422
I like her scars.

329
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:37,881
Gabbie!

330
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,380
No, it's fine.

331
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:40,505
No, it's not.

332
00:36:40,547 --> 00:36:41,797
It's very inappropriate.

333
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,631
I just think they're cool.

334
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:44,631
You know what?

335
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,923
Why don't you show her
your new scar?

336
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,297
Look at this thing.

337
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,005
Bad boy.

338
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:49,631
Ooh.

339
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:50,631
How'd you get that?

340
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,130
Fell off my bike
during summer break.

341
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,505
And landed on a broken bottle.

342
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,422
Oh, yeah.

343
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,756
Seven stitches, too.

344
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,631
There was so much blood,
and like this piece

345
00:36:58,756 --> 00:36:59,672
of fat oozing out.

346
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:00,631
All right, all right.

347
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,005
Can we change the subject,
please?

348
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,422
I don't wanna think about blood
and fat while we're eating.

349
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,380
So much blood.

350
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:07,130
Okay, honey.

351
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,672
You're disgusting.

352
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:10,756
Regardless,

353
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:12,380
Christmas hasn't really been
the same around here

354
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:14,797
since someone stopped
believing in Santa Claus.

355
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,255
When did that happen?

356
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,547
When I was, like, eight.

357
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,255
Oh, stop.

358
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,255
You were older than that.

359
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,631
No,
I just went along with it

360
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,130
so you and Daddy
wouldn't feel bad.

361
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,505
I've been finding presents
stashed around the house

362
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:25,505
for years now.

363
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:27,130
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're a little snoop.

364
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:27,756
Yeah.

365
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,005
Finding is a loose term.

366
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,255
More like investigating
and discovering, really.

367
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,422
Can you pass the rice?

368
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:34,505
It's not my fault that
they're really, really bad

369
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:35,380
at hiding presents.

370
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,005
Dude, it was under
the floorboard,

371
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:37,881
under the carpet.

372
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,756
Pass the rice, please?

373
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:41,505
Oh, she's also notorious
for opening presents

374
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:42,547
and then re-wrapping them.

375
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:43,881
Not very well, either.

376
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:45,255
- Sienna!

377
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:50,172
If you don't pass the rice,
I'm not gonna leave.

378
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:52,130
Please? Pass the rice?

379
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,881
Sienna?

380
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,297
Hello, Sienna?

381
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,505
You know, I'm dead because
of you, okay?

382
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,631
You led us to him.

383
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,631
You and that little shithead
brother of yours.

384
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,923
I'm dead and you killed me.

385
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:10,130
Just like you killed
your mother.

386
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:12,255
That was bad.

387
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:13,172
I didn't...

388
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,380
But anyway.

389
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:16,130
I mean,
that's how he always did it.

390
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:19,756
He's kind of cute.

391
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,005
Sienna?

392
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:24,881
You all right?

393
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,422
Yeah.

394
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,756
Sienna...

395
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:35,923
I mean, no amount of medication
is gonna stop me from being here

396
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:37,255
in front of you.

397
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:39,756
You killed me.

398
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:44,881
The least you can do
is pass the rice.

399
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:48,505
Pass the rice.

400
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,505
Pass the rice!

401
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:56,380
Pass the rice!

402
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:57,005
Excuse me.

403
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:05,005
Finish eating, sweetie,

404
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,505
so we can have
our fortune cookies.

405
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:25,380
Whoa!

406
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:26,255
Okay, wow.

407
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,631
Thanks for knocking, Shaw.

408
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:28,797
Sorry.

409
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,005
Wait!

410
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,005
Um, aren't you going
to introduce us?

411
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:33,756
Wow.

412
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:36,672
Uh, Shaw, this is,
um, Mia.

413
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:37,881
Hi.

414
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:39,631
She's a really big fan
of yours.

415
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:41,130
I'm not a fan, you asshole.

416
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,881
She's obsessed
with the Miles County Clown.

417
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,380
Like all that true crime shit.

418
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:48,005
She thinks
you're a celebrity, dude.

419
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,047
Don't listen to him.

420
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,631
Like, literally, ever.

421
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,255
Um, hi.

422
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,380
It is so nice to meet you.

423
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,005
Hi.

424
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,505
I seriously know,
like, everything about you.

425
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,130
Everything online at least,
um, I've been following you

426
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:04,255
for years.

427
00:40:04,297 --> 00:40:05,756
Dude, you're a legend.

428
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,255
You survived Art the Clown,

429
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,005
See? Fucking fangirl.

430
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,672
Eat me.

431
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:13,505
After you get his autograph.

432
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,005
Um, listen, I actually
had a little bit of a favor

433
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,255
that I wanted to ask you.

434
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,547
You see, my roommate and I,
we have a true crime podcast.

435
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:21,797
It's called Graven Image.

436
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:23,255
And our Miles County Massacre
episodes?

437
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,255
They get our biggest hits
by far.

438
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,255
So I was wondering
if maybe you'd be willing

439
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:28,631
to come on as a guest sometime?

440
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,255
I seriously would be so honored.

441
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,255
I don't really do
things like that.

442
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,130
Jesus, do you really think
he wants to dredge up

443
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:38,005
the worst experience
of his life?

444
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,380
I mean, the kid's just trying
to move on.

445
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:40,505
Right, Shaw?

446
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:42,756
Okay, well, I get that,
but I just-

447
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:46,005
I think a lot of people would
really like to hear from you

448
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,255
after all this time.

449
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,505
- Oh my god.

450
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,756
Come on.

451
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:52,297
I- I'll think about it.

452
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,130
He'll think about it.

453
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:53,756
Great.

454
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:54,881
Hah.

455
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,172
Shaw, are you coming
to the Beta Christmas bash

456
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:56,756
tomorrow night?

457
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:57,631
I gotta take this.

458
00:40:57,672 --> 00:40:58,505
Oh.

459
00:40:58,631 --> 00:40:59,130
Yeah.

460
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:00,505
Girl callin'

461
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:02,005
It was great meeting you,
Mia.

462
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:02,881
You too.

463
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,756
God, my man needs
to get laid so bad.

464
00:41:09,005 --> 00:41:11,881
Hey.

465
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,130
How are you?

466
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:14,547
I'm, uh, doing good.

467
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,047
Just got out of class.

468
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:19,631
I just got to Aunt Jess's.

469
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:21,380
Yeah, a couple hours ago.

470
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:26,130
It's really good to hear
your voice.

471
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:28,797
You know, I- I miss you.

472
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,255
I miss you, too.

473
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,672
Is, uh, everything all right?

474
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,005
I'm calling because, um...

475
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,756
I'm- I'm really excited
we're going to be spending

476
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:47,130
Christmas together.

477
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,881
It's been too long.

478
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,255
Yeah, it has.

479
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,172
I'm, uh, really looking
forward to it.

480
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:55,505
Well, uh,...

481
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,380
...I guess I'll see you
in a couple days?

482
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:04,255
Love you.

483
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:07,380
Love you more.

484
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:21,380
Are you okay?

485
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:23,756
Yeah.

486
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:28,380
It's, um, just this
new medication I'm on.

487
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,255
It makes me queasy sometimes.

488
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:32,255
Oh.

489
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,005
I need to be creative.

490
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:39,631
Wanna be my canvas?

491
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,756
All right.

492
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,130
Something's happening here.

493
00:44:42,172 --> 00:44:43,422
Can I see already?

494
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,881
Hold your horses.

495
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,297
I mean, you are starting
to look quite enchanted,

496
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,756
if I do say so myself.

497
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:51,005
Like a fantasy princess.
All right.

498
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:53,172
We're going to put a little bit
more elven eyeshadow

499
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,505
to go with that magic blush.

500
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:55,297
Close your eyes.

501
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,505
You know,

502
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:58,672
you could be a professional
makeup artist, right?

503
00:44:58,756 --> 00:45:00,380
Why, thank you.

504
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:03,797
I actually forgot
how much I enjoy this.

505
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:04,756
Eyes open.

506
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:05,505
Great.

507
00:45:05,631 --> 00:45:06,881
All right, let's do some lips.

508
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,881
How'd you get those scars?

509
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:14,923
You and these scars.

510
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:16,130
I got into a fight.

511
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,631
Did you win?

512
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,422
Yeah, I won.

513
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:21,672
Chin up.

514
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,881
All right,
gimme one of these.

515
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:30,881
You're all done.

516
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:32,631
You wanna see this mystical
masterpiece?

517
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:33,756
Yeah.

518
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:36,130
Wow!

519
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:39,380
It looks amazing.

520
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,255
Your face did all the work.

521
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:49,172
Take a picture!

522
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:51,672
Can I join the mile high club
in your sleigh?

523
00:45:51,756 --> 00:45:52,422
Oh my god!

524
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:53,881
Oh, ho ho ho.

525
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:55,130
I'd fuck ya.

526
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:58,297
No, Mrs. Claus would shank me
in my sleep.

527
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,631
- My wife's dead.
- Okay.

528
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,005
Wanna come down my chimney?

529
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,172
Oh my god,
come in her chimney, come!

530
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,380
I've got a chimney.

531
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:05,130
Okay, girls.

532
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:06,380
I'm a naughty little reindeer.

533
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:10,547
I wanna do drugs
on your stomach!

534
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:11,631
Be good.

535
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:13,881
Ho ho ho!

536
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:16,130
Oh, shit.

537
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,297
God damn!

538
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,881
I think I know
what I want for Christmas.

539
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:21,881
That Santa outfit comes
with some perks, dude.

540
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,255
Girls!

541
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,047
I don't remember
if I told you, but,

542
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,005
so I've been in entertainment
for a long time.

543
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,505
I'm Santa now, I was Elvis.

544
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,547
Those girls!

545
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:32,380
Laughlin, 1980s.

546
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,005
Whoo!

547
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,380
Nothing like this.

548
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:36,255
To Laughlin.

549
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:36,881
Laughlin!

550
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:37,797
To Laughlin?

551
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:38,797
I'm good.

552
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,797
Ow, ow!

553
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:44,923
You racist piece of shit!

554
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,130
Shit.

555
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:52,005
Get a load of this fucking guy.

556
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:54,130
Friend of yours, Eddie?

557
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:56,505
That is a fucking first.

558
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,380
All right, well,
now hold on now, listen.

559
00:46:58,422 --> 00:46:59,672
I'm wearing the outfit, right?

560
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:00,797
So it's just like Elvis.

561
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:03,380
He gets the full Santa
experience if he wants it,

562
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,756
all right?

563
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:05,756
Hello.

564
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:06,547
Hello.

565
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:08,547
Hi, hi!

566
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:09,422
You-
Come on over.

567
00:47:09,505 --> 00:47:10,047
Come on over.

568
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:10,672
It's fine.

569
00:47:10,756 --> 00:47:11,631
Yeah!

570
00:47:13,422 --> 00:47:14,505
Hi, hi.

571
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:17,172
Yes, yes, yes, that's-
that's me, that's me.

572
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:18,255
Guilty as charged.

573
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:20,505
Hey Santa,
it looks like you got a fan.

574
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,422
What's with the outfit, pal?

575
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,881
Yeah, did the circus
come to town?

576
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:26,923
Hey, buddy.

577
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:27,756
Watch it.

578
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:28,797
That's the real deal.

579
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,005
That's my-
that's my beard.

580
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:33,130
If Santa doesn't have
a real beard,

581
00:47:33,255 --> 00:47:36,005
he's not a real Santa Claus.

582
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:40,047
Hey, fella,
what's in the bag?

583
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:42,631
Oh, he's gonna show us.

584
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:45,422
Hey, what do ya got?

585
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:46,380
What do ya-

586
00:47:46,422 --> 00:47:47,881
Usually I'm the one
who's bringing

587
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:49,923
the magical sack of toys.

588
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:58,255
What?

589
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:05,881
Oh, that's good!

590
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:10,505
Okay. That's enough.

591
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:12,505
All right, now, look,
I'm startin' to like this guy,

592
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:13,547
I really am. Clowny.

593
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:15,255
Put-
put your little horn away.

594
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,505
Have a seat.

595
00:48:16,547 --> 00:48:18,631
And, uh,
Santa'll buy him a drink.

596
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,255
Clowny,
I'm startin' to like you.

597
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:28,255
Here you go.

598
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,631
I hope I gave you
enough marshmallows.

599
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:30,172
Oh.

600
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:31,047
It's perfect.

601
00:48:31,672 --> 00:48:32,756
Thank you.

602
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,297
Some peace and quiet
around here, finally, huh?

603
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,047
You must be exhausted.

604
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:43,756
No, I...

605
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:45,505
...I feel...

606
00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:48,881
What?

607
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,005
Normal?

608
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:56,505
Look, I'm not going
to pretend that

609
00:48:56,631 --> 00:49:00,881
I know what you're going
through, because I don't.

610
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,005
I- I can't even begin
to imagine it.

611
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:07,130
But I promise it'll get better.

612
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:11,047
You remind me so much of mom.

613
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,631
Before dad died,

614
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,923
she was the sweetest person.

615
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:21,255
Could talk to her
about anything.

616
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:23,505
Yeah, she was.

617
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:26,255
Mouth like a truck driver,
though.

618
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,756
She cursed so much.

619
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:30,255
So much!

620
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,547
She once called
Sister Rosemary a C-U-N-T

621
00:49:32,631 --> 00:49:33,505
in the sixth grade.

622
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:35,631
I don't know
where she came from!

623
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,672
Nobody in our family
talks like that.

624
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,130
I miss her.

625
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:45,297
I miss her so much.

626
00:49:47,756 --> 00:49:49,672
I know, sweetie.

627
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:51,005
I know.

628
00:49:53,297 --> 00:49:54,797
I miss her, too.

629
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:00,672
Hey, Santa.

630
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:02,380
Looks like you got
some competition.

631
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:03,881
It's Clowny Claus!

632
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:06,130
No.

633
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,005
Hey, you're a natural.

634
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:07,672
You look good.

635
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:08,881
But don't get it dirty.

636
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,005
And remember to give it back.

637
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,047
You don't want to get
on Santa's naughty list.

638
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:14,881
Hey, why don't you tell Santa
what you want for Christmas,

639
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:15,881
little boy?

640
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:17,130
Better hygiene?

641
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:19,130
All right, come on,
let's have a drink, uh,

642
00:50:19,172 --> 00:50:20,047
for everybody, okay.

643
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:20,631
Come on.

644
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:22,505
Got ID?

645
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:23,255
Come on.

646
00:50:23,297 --> 00:50:24,422
He's obviously old enough.

647
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:25,505
All right.

648
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:27,130
You think I'm gonna lose
my license for this guy?

649
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,672
Don't bust the clown's balls.

650
00:50:28,756 --> 00:50:30,130
This is normal to you?

651
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:32,005
Sorry about this, Clowny.

652
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,255
There, see?

653
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,505
He's got it.

654
00:50:39,047 --> 00:50:40,756
Maurice Jackson?

655
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:42,380
Eddie, you're killing me.

656
00:50:42,422 --> 00:50:43,631
Can we just celebrate?

657
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:44,380
Come on.

658
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:45,130
Fuck it.

659
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:46,130
It's Christmas.

660
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:47,255
All right,
let's have a drink!

661
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,631
To my new friend, huh?

662
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,255
To Maurice Jackson!

663
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,672
- Maurice Jackson.
- Cheers!

664
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,631
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

665
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:01,881
What's your problem, pal?

666
00:51:01,923 --> 00:51:03,756
Guy buys you a drink
and you spit it back

667
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:04,756
in his fucking face?

668
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,422
Hey, man.

669
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:06,505
That's-
that's wrong.

670
00:51:06,547 --> 00:51:09,172
Now look, you see,
you- you were just rude,

671
00:51:09,255 --> 00:51:10,297
and you shouldn't have
been rude.

672
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,047
Let's go, Clowny.

673
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,172
Get up.

674
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:18,881
No, I'm not ki-

675
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:21,255
Oh, shit.

676
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,756
What the...

677
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:25,672
What the fuck are you doing?

678
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:26,505
He peed on him!

679
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:27,756
Fucking told you!

680
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:29,255
Are you fucking kidding me?

681
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:32,422
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you sick fuck!

682
00:51:34,756 --> 00:51:35,923
I'll fucking kill him!

683
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:37,380
Hey, come on,
you motherfucker!

684
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:38,255
Fuck you!

685
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:39,505
Goddammit.

686
00:51:39,631 --> 00:51:40,756
Smokey, get his bag!

687
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,047
Son of a bitch!

688
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,547
This is my busy weekend.

689
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:44,297
I know.

690
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,255
What the fuck is in this?

691
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,631
Jesus, fuck!

692
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,172
Get that the fuck out of here.

693
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:50,923
What? What? Hey!

694
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,047
You motherfucker!

695
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,631
I'll fucking kill you!
I got it.

696
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:54,881
- Goddammit!
- Want me to call the cops?

697
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:56,130
I don't want you to call
the cops.

698
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:57,547
I want you to call
a fucking dry cleaner.

699
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,047
- Dry cleaner!
- Smokey, get a fucking mop!

700
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,380
I told you, don't let him
the fuck in here.

701
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,422
You said he's fuckin' normal!

702
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:04,422
Sit down, sit down!

703
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:06,130
Fuckin' 'you told me. '

704
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,547
Have a fucking drink.

705
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:12,255
Can't take a fucking hint,
can you?

706
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:13,297
I'm not going to tell you again.

707
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,380
Oh, fuck.

708
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:21,422
Oh, fuck.

709
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,756
Eddie?

710
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:27,047
And Smokey?

711
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,005
Oh, god, Smokey!

712
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,047
Oh, no, oh, god, oh, god.

713
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,631
No!

714
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:32,380
Oh, god.

715
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:33,756
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

716
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:34,631
Sir! No, sir.

717
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:35,631
No, no, no, no, sir.

718
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:36,380
No, no, please.

719
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:37,380
Please, please.

720
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:41,631
Let me be the first to apologize
for whatever's happened

721
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:42,547
here tonight.

722
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:43,881
I don't-
I don't know what happened.

723
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:44,756
Here, take it!

724
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:46,255
Take it, take it, take it!

725
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:47,005
It's yours.

726
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,505
You looked really good in it!

727
00:52:48,547 --> 00:52:49,422
Take it all!

728
00:52:49,505 --> 00:52:50,631
You be Santa!

729
00:52:50,756 --> 00:52:52,380
Clowny,
we're in the same business.

730
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:54,047
It's just me and you, remember?

731
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,255
It's just me and you.

732
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,756
We're in the same business.

733
00:52:57,631 --> 00:52:59,672
We make people happy.

734
00:53:09,881 --> 00:53:11,756
Help me, help me!

735
00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:13,797
God, help me!

736
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:16,380
Hey, you pay attention to me.

737
00:53:16,422 --> 00:53:17,380
Help me!

738
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:18,756
That isn't even funny.

739
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:19,797
It's not funny.

740
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:20,380
The fuck?

741
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:21,422
Come on.

742
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:24,881
Oh, Clowny, please,
please, Clowny, help me!

743
00:53:25,881 --> 00:53:26,756
Please, god!

744
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:27,881
Oh, god help me!

745
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:28,881
Oh, god.

746
00:53:28,923 --> 00:53:30,255
Clowny, come on.

747
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,130
You look good, Clowny.

748
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,547
You look good.

749
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:41,380
Oh, yeah,
that's never looked better.

750
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:43,380
Look, I'll go now, then.

751
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,631
You know, you're-
you're Santa Claus, right?

752
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,255
So I can go.

753
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:47,881
Yeah.

754
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:49,923
Oh, help!

755
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,130
Help me!

756
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:56,923
Help me!

757
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:58,130
Clowny!

758
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,672
What the hell is that?

759
00:54:06,756 --> 00:54:09,047
Oh god, oh god.

760
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,297
Clowny.

761
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,005
Clowny, look at me.

762
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:14,923
Clowny,
I'm not really Santa Claus.

763
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,047
No, no, wait.

764
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,172
Listen to me.

765
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:19,047
I have a name.

766
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,797
I have a real-
No, I have a real name!

767
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:23,631
My- my name
is Charles Johnson.

768
00:54:23,756 --> 00:54:25,672
Clowny, and I have a wife,
a wife!

769
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:27,255
I have a wife and two kids.

770
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,130
Hey, Clowny.

771
00:54:28,255 --> 00:54:30,631
No, no, no, Clowny, no!

772
00:54:30,672 --> 00:54:32,923
Listen to me,
Clowny I beg you.

773
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:35,672
Listen, I have four gorgeous
grandchildren.

774
00:54:35,756 --> 00:54:38,672
And their names, their names
are Brian and Denise and-

775
00:55:19,255 --> 00:55:20,005
Clowny!

776
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:32,422
Clowny,
it hurts so much, please!

777
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,631
So, how is she?

778
00:56:47,756 --> 00:56:50,047
As good as can be expected.

779
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,005
I think Gabbie brought some
life back into her today, right?

780
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:54,380
It's nice to see her smile
a little bit.

781
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:57,255
Oh my god, Gabbie.

782
00:56:57,297 --> 00:57:00,005
She follows Sienna around like
a brand new puppy.

783
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:02,172
It's concerning.

784
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:04,672
Now they're going
Christmas shopping tomorrow.

785
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,047
Just the two of 'em?

786
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,130
Mhm.

787
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:10,380
Sienna wants to pick up
a gift for Jonathan.

788
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,756
You really think
that's a good idea?

789
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,255
They'll be fine.

790
00:57:17,005 --> 00:57:19,172
Jess...

791
00:57:19,255 --> 00:57:21,881
...did you not see
what happened today?

792
00:57:21,923 --> 00:57:24,172
What if that little episode
was just a microcosm

793
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:25,756
of what's to come?

794
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,923
What if that shit gets worse?

795
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:29,881
I'm not gonna abandon her.

796
00:57:29,923 --> 00:57:30,505
She's healing.

797
00:57:30,631 --> 00:57:32,255
It's gonna take time.

798
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:35,130
She's taking her medication.

799
00:57:36,923 --> 00:57:39,422
All I'm saying is, let's keep
our guard up, all right?

800
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,923
That's all I'm saying.

801
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:45,923
Okay.

802
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:47,631
Merry Christmas!

803
00:58:47,672 --> 00:58:48,756
What is your name?

804
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:50,130
This way please. This way.

805
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:51,505
All right, sweetie,
look over here.

806
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:52,756
Ready?

807
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,005
Don't go past this point.

808
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:55,047
You'll be in trouble.

809
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,756
Thank you.

810
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:57,672
Next.

811
00:58:57,756 --> 00:58:59,505
All right, buddy,
smile for the camera.

812
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:02,505
You guys ready to meet Santa?

813
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:03,756
What are you going to ask for?

814
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,172
Makeup?

815
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:06,047
Yeah.

816
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,255
Are you old enough for makeup?

817
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:09,631
Okay. Thank you.

818
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:10,756
Next.

819
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:17,923
Hey, Gabs.

820
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:19,505
You think he'll like this?

821
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:20,255
Hmm.

822
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,505
Not sure.

823
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:23,881
I don't think Jonathan
is really into black anymore.

824
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:26,005
Jonathan doesn't wear black?

825
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,505
Mr. Death Metal?

826
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:29,881
I don't think he listens
to that anymore either.

827
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:31,631
Just a phase, I guess.

828
00:59:33,923 --> 00:59:38,297
All right, well, then,
what does he wear now?

829
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,547
I don't know.

830
00:59:40,797 --> 00:59:42,255
Normal clothes?

831
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:44,130
Really narrows it down.

832
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,923
Thanks, Gabs.

833
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:46,505
Okay, sweetie.

834
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:47,297
You ready?

835
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:50,547
Okay.

836
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:51,255
Thank you.

837
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:52,505
- Bye, Santa.
- Bye.

838
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,005
At least it's better
than Louisville.

839
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,255
You got a point, Bob.

840
00:59:58,172 --> 00:59:59,631
Let's take a break.

841
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:00,756
Oh.

842
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:02,881
Sorry, folks.

843
01:00:03,005 --> 01:00:05,130
Santa's gotta go feed
his reindeer.

844
01:00:05,923 --> 01:00:07,631
You know,
I'm not in charge here.

845
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:10,297
Can we go on a break too?

846
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,547
Sure.

847
01:00:13,631 --> 01:00:15,047
This one's nice.

848
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:16,797
Hmm, not bad.

849
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:17,756
Is it your favorite?

850
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:18,881
Top three.

851
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:20,672
All right, well,
then you choose.

852
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:22,130
You know your dad
better than me.

853
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:31,422
Hey!

854
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:34,797
What are you staring at?

855
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:43,255
Nothing.

856
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:43,881
Come on, you ready?

857
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:44,505
Let's get going.

858
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:45,380
You okay?

859
01:01:45,422 --> 01:01:46,422
Yeah.

860
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:57,130
Sienna Shaw
is the prime suspect.

861
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,505
Do you want to just do that?

862
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,881
Okay, she's linked
to every single victim?

863
01:02:04,005 --> 01:02:04,672
Okay?

864
01:02:04,756 --> 01:02:06,172
She was at every crime scene?

865
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,047
A history of mental illness
in her family?

866
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:12,505
with Art the Clown?

867
01:02:12,547 --> 01:02:13,631
And there's no body.

868
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:16,005
How about you show me
the dead clown's body?

869
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,005
Dude, there's so many holes
in that story.

870
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,130
Like, how do you not see that?

871
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:20,756
If Jonathan Shaw
hadn't testified

872
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,047
on his sister's behalf,

873
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,672
she'd probably be serving
a life sentence right now.

874
01:02:23,756 --> 01:02:24,881
You shouldn't be saying
that shit.

875
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,631
You look great.

876
01:02:41,672 --> 01:02:44,255
Your, uh, your scars
are healing up nicely.

877
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,547
Yeah, yours too.

878
01:02:48,255 --> 01:02:51,130
Gabbie thinks I look cool,
apparently.

879
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:54,005
So...

880
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:55,756
...Why'd you want to see me
right now?

881
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:59,047
I- I missed you.

882
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,881
I mean, can't a sister see
her little brother?

883
01:03:06,422 --> 01:03:09,130
Um, actually,
I was, uh,

884
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:11,297
I was thinking,

885
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,005
why don't you come over
Aunt Jess's tonight?

886
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,380
I mean,
why wait till Christmas Eve?

887
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:16,547
You've gotta be done
with classes by now, right?

888
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:19,505
I can't, I can't tonight.

889
01:03:19,631 --> 01:03:21,631
Why not?

890
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,380
There's a party on campus
that I was invited to.

891
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,547
Really?

892
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,380
Oh.

893
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:29,923
That's good.

894
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:30,756
No. I'm happy.

895
01:03:30,797 --> 01:03:33,047
Jonathan Shaw spotted in public!

896
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,380
What is this,
a Christmas miracle?

897
01:03:35,505 --> 01:03:36,422
Dick!

898
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:39,631
Um, Sienna, this is Cole,
my roommate. Cole.

899
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:40,380
Oh, wow.

900
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:42,923
Hey, big sis.

901
01:03:43,005 --> 01:03:45,797
I've, uh, heard a lot about you.

902
01:03:45,881 --> 01:03:47,380
It's nice to finally meet you.

903
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:48,631
Hi.

904
01:03:48,756 --> 01:03:52,130
Well, you've got a cool
baby bro here, and I treat him

905
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:53,172
like he's my own.

906
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:54,756
You treat me like shit.

907
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,505
Oh, he jokes.

908
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:58,923
Oh, shit.

909
01:03:59,005 --> 01:03:59,881
Let me get out of here.

910
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,297
Oh my God.

911
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,505
Sienna!

912
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:04,547
You're Sienna Shaw!

913
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:07,881
I, I seriously so-
I can't believe I'm sitting here

914
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,005
with you guys.

915
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,797
I was literally just telling
your little brother.

916
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:11,756
I'm sorry.

917
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:12,672
I'm probably being
a little weird.

918
01:04:12,756 --> 01:04:15,923
I'm just super stoked
to see you.

919
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:19,172
Mia has been following
our story very closely.

920
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,631
I am a true crime enthusiast,

921
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:24,005
and I've actually been following
your case in particular

922
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:27,172
for years on my podcast,
and no rush or anything,

923
01:04:27,255 --> 01:04:29,130
but I do know the five year
anniversary is coming up

924
01:04:29,172 --> 01:04:31,380
and the fanbase is rabid.

925
01:04:31,422 --> 01:04:34,881
Like, we would literally
kill for anything.

926
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:37,547
I'm thinking, Get Readys
with Me, What I Eat in a Day...

927
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,631
Just show us how you're coping.

928
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:40,005
You know, what you do
on a daily basis,

929
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,547
anything like that.

930
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:42,797
How I'm coping?

931
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,297
Yeah.

932
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:47,756
How we're coping?

933
01:04:49,631 --> 01:04:54,005
Well, uh, I've been in and out
of a psychiatric hospital

934
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:55,255
for the past five years.

935
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,672
Oh.

936
01:04:56,756 --> 01:05:00,505
I see images of my dead friends
and relatives on a daily basis,

937
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:03,797
images that wake me up screaming
in the middle of the night.

938
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:06,505
I have hideous scars
all over my body,

939
01:05:06,547 --> 01:05:08,005
and every time I see them,

940
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:11,380
I think of how that sick fuck
who ruined our lives

941
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:12,547
is still out there.

942
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:14,422
And you want to know
how I'm coping with everything?

943
01:05:17,255 --> 01:05:20,881
You guys are all
the same leeches.

944
01:05:20,923 --> 01:05:22,130
Sienna.

945
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:25,756
Can't you act like a human being
for one fucking second?

946
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:37,631
Sienna, what's wrong with you?

947
01:05:37,756 --> 01:05:38,505
I saw him today.

948
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:39,881
Who?

949
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:43,047
Where?

950
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,505
At the mall, with Gabbie.

951
01:05:45,631 --> 01:05:47,005
How can you be sure
it was really him?

952
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,631
I'm not, I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

953
01:05:48,756 --> 01:05:51,130
I don't know what's real
or what's in my fucking head.

954
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,422
Well,
what'd you see exactly?

955
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,172
He was dressed as Santa Claus.

956
01:05:58,756 --> 01:05:59,631
Santa Claus?

957
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,297
Okay, I know, I know
how that sounds...

958
01:06:02,881 --> 01:06:03,631
...but it was him.

959
01:06:03,756 --> 01:06:05,797
I could-
I could feel it.

960
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,130
We both know this isn't over.

961
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:11,130
You don't know that.

962
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:13,255
I mean, Jesus Christ,
you cut his fucking head off.

963
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,297
Come here.

964
01:06:18,756 --> 01:06:20,047
Hey, what is this?

965
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:20,881
Jonathan!

966
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:23,005
Hey, why are you
shutting me out?

967
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,172
I'm not shutting you out.

968
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:26,005
You don't believe me?

969
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,297
Why would he come back here?

970
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,380
Even if he was alive,
which he isn't.

971
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:32,255
Wouldn't you want to get as far
away from here as possible,

972
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,380
as far away from you?

973
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,005
Maybe it's me they want.
Isn't that what you said?

974
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,172
Boy genius.

975
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:37,255
What are you,
Mr. Academic now?

976
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:39,380
You think you're too good
for your own-

977
01:06:41,547 --> 01:06:43,005
I'm sorry.

978
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:45,005
At least I'm fucking trying.

979
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,172
I'm proud of you.

980
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:54,380
We need each other, okay?

981
01:06:55,672 --> 01:06:57,172
I need you.

982
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:01,005
What we need to do
is move on.

983
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:02,380
Let it go.

984
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,380
It's over.

985
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:07,672
'We have to destroy
the little girl

986
01:07:07,756 --> 01:07:09,881
before it's too late, Sienna.

987
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:11,422
Destroy her because
she's inhuman.

988
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,672
A demon. '

989
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,047
I still have your letters.

990
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:19,255
You wrote me almost every week
when I first went away.

991
01:07:19,297 --> 01:07:20,547
Remember that?

992
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:23,505
All your theories
about demonology, possession.

993
01:07:23,547 --> 01:07:24,130
You became obsessed.

994
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:25,505
But you weren't crazy.

995
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:26,631
You were right!

996
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:27,631
I'm not listening to this.

997
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:29,297
You listen to me!

998
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,255
'Sometimes demons
try to enter our world,

999
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,130
only they can't do it alone.

1000
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:39,756
They have to choose a vessel,
someone recently deceased

1001
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,005
who functions as a bridge
between worlds.

1002
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,005
But not just anyone.

1003
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,130
Someone sinister, depraved.

1004
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:48,297
The worst kind of evil.

1005
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:51,505
Like a serial killer?'

1006
01:08:11,756 --> 01:08:13,505
'If a demon enters this world
in the flesh,

1007
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,255
a counterpart must be
appointed to stop it

1008
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,547
from becoming too powerful.

1009
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,797
It's you, Sienna.

1010
01:08:18,881 --> 01:08:19,797
As long as you're alive,

1011
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:21,547
they're vulnerable,
and they know it. '

1012
01:08:23,005 --> 01:08:24,047
That's why Daddy created
the sword.

1013
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,005
Whoever chose me
was guiding him.

1014
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:28,631
He was preparing me for this.

1015
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:34,672
It's using Victoria Heyes
as a host now, isn't it?

1016
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,130
That's why she disappeared
that night.

1017
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:51,505
What do you wanna do?

1018
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:53,756
What, do we just up
and leave town?

1019
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:57,672
Call the cops, tell Aunt Jess
and Uncle Greg?

1020
01:08:57,756 --> 01:08:58,881
No. They'll never believe us.

1021
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:00,505
Especially me.

1022
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:09,380
I have to go back
to the Terrifier.

1023
01:09:10,923 --> 01:09:12,297
Why?

1024
01:09:15,172 --> 01:09:16,923
It's still buried there,
isn't it?

1025
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:20,380
And if I'm right,
it might be the only thing

1026
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:21,881
that can stop them.

1027
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:26,756
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way

1028
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:30,672
Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh

1029
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:34,505
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way

1030
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:38,380
Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh

1031
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,255
Hey, Santa!

1032
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:13,047
Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh

1033
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,881
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

1034
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:20,672
Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright

1035
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:24,505
What fun it is to ride and
sing a sleighing song tonight

1036
01:10:24,631 --> 01:10:26,631
Sarah, get back over here!

1037
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:27,297
Wow.

1038
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,505
Thanks, Santa.

1039
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:30,422
Hey, Santa's handing out
presents!

1040
01:10:33,505 --> 01:10:36,255
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way

1041
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,130
Santa claus is coming along
Riding down this way

1042
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:49,380
Joy to the world
the Lord is come

1043
01:10:49,422 --> 01:10:52,756
Let earth receive her king

1044
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,172
What's going on here?

1045
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:57,130
That's not Bill.

1046
01:10:57,172 --> 01:10:58,297
What?

1047
01:10:58,923 --> 01:11:00,923
That's not our Santa Claus.

1048
01:11:01,005 --> 01:11:04,797
And heaven and nature sing

1049
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:08,631
And heaven and Heaven
and nature sing

1050
01:11:08,756 --> 01:11:09,881
Kids, clear out of here.

1051
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,047
Get goin'!

1052
01:11:15,797 --> 01:11:20,756
Joy to the world
the savior reigns

1053
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,130
Let men their songs employ

1054
01:11:22,255 --> 01:11:23,756
Who is this Santa?

1055
01:11:23,881 --> 01:11:25,797
He's scaring my kid.

1056
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,756
Yeah, he's scaring me, too.

1057
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:30,255
What do you think you're doing?

1058
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:32,923
You can't be here.

1059
01:11:35,505 --> 01:11:37,923
I said, let's go.

1060
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:40,881
Come on.

1061
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,380
Get the kids out of here.

1062
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:43,130
Sarah!

1063
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:44,422
What did I say?

1064
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:47,756
Christ almighty,
what's the uproar, people?

1065
01:11:47,797 --> 01:11:49,130
Get the fuck out!

1066
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,672
Don't come back!

1067
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:54,881
And makes the nations prove

1068
01:11:55,005 --> 01:11:55,422
Come on!

1069
01:11:55,505 --> 01:11:56,172
No!

1070
01:11:58,255 --> 01:12:03,297
The glories
of His righteousness

1071
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,547
Corey?

1072
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:09,005
And wonders of His love

1073
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,631
Corey,
get back over here!

1074
01:12:10,672 --> 01:12:12,005
Back in line, kids.

1075
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,380
Time for the real Santa.

1076
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:14,756
I wonder what I got.

1077
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:15,380
Corey!

1078
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:40,005
What's that?

1079
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,505
Jesus! You scared me.

1080
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:45,255
What are you doing,
snooping around like that?

1081
01:14:46,005 --> 01:14:47,505
Is it for me?

1082
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:50,047
None of your business,
nosy.

1083
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:51,005
It is, isn't it?

1084
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,130
No, it's not.

1085
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:54,005
And don't even think about
opening it, all right?

1086
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,005
What happened to your hands?

1087
01:14:56,047 --> 01:14:57,297
My hands?

1088
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,422
I fell, okay?

1089
01:15:03,505 --> 01:15:06,130
I slipped on some ice
and took a ridiculously nasty

1090
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:07,756
spill in front of, like,
20 college students.

1091
01:15:07,797 --> 01:15:08,672
Is that what you wanna hear?

1092
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,756
I wish I saw that.

1093
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:12,881
You think that's funny?

1094
01:15:13,005 --> 01:15:13,422
Come here!

1095
01:15:13,505 --> 01:15:14,672
No!

1096
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,255
Christmas

1097
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:41,797
Shady

1098
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:51,505
Save us all
from satan's power

1099
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:57,881
Save us all
from satan's power

1100
01:15:58,005 --> 01:16:04,130
Save us all
from satan's power

1101
01:16:07,422 --> 01:16:14,005
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

1102
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,005
Yo, grab that door?

1103
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:19,255
- Here we go.

1104
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,172
Thank you.

1105
01:16:20,255 --> 01:16:22,422
That is wicked!

1106
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:23,672
Kegs here!

1107
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:30,923
Oh.

1108
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:32,631
Something smells amazing.

1109
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,881
You're back late.

1110
01:16:35,005 --> 01:16:36,130
How's your brother?

1111
01:16:36,255 --> 01:16:37,380
Oh, he's good.

1112
01:16:37,422 --> 01:16:38,047
Yeah.

1113
01:16:39,255 --> 01:16:41,255
He's going to a campus
Christmas party tonight.

1114
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,130
Jonathan's going
to a Christmas party?

1115
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:44,797
Oh!

1116
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:46,255
Nice to hear
he's socializing.

1117
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:47,672
Yeah.

1118
01:16:48,505 --> 01:16:50,797
God, these are so freaking cute,
Aunt Jess.

1119
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,505
Those are my favorite.

1120
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:53,756
Do you want some?

1121
01:16:54,631 --> 01:16:56,297
No, thanks.

1122
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,255
Oh, sorry, I forgot you don't
like cereal anymore.

1123
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,505
Who doesn't like cereal?

1124
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:01,380
Sienna.

1125
01:17:01,505 --> 01:17:04,130
What? Sienna,
you don't like cereal?

1126
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:08,047
I mean, I can understand tofu
or Lima beans,

1127
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:08,923
but cereal's the best.

1128
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:10,380
I know, honey. Chill.

1129
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:13,172
Yeah, I just try to stay away
from too much sugar.

1130
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:14,756
You got more willpower than me.

1131
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,881
Hey Gabs, what do you say
we go upstairs

1132
01:17:17,005 --> 01:17:19,047
and play some board games?

1133
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,380
Let's go.

1134
01:17:21,505 --> 01:17:22,505
Yeah.

1135
01:17:22,631 --> 01:17:24,505
I think we need some
Christmas tree sprinkles.

1136
01:17:24,547 --> 01:17:26,255
You need
Christmas tree sprinkles.

1137
01:17:26,297 --> 01:17:27,380
What are you in the mood for?

1138
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:28,547
I have a ton.

1139
01:17:28,631 --> 01:17:32,047
Pictionary,
Guess Who, Monopoly.

1140
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:33,422
I like Monopoly.

1141
01:17:33,505 --> 01:17:36,047
Takes forever, though.

1142
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:41,172
I never told you
I don't like cereal.

1143
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:44,130
What?

1144
01:17:44,255 --> 01:17:46,380
How'd you know
I don't like cereal?

1145
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:52,923
Gabbie?

1146
01:17:53,005 --> 01:17:54,380
Did you read my journal?

1147
01:17:54,505 --> 01:17:55,756
I'm sorry.

1148
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,631
Please don't be mad at me.

1149
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:02,505
Where is it?

1150
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,923
I put it back in your room.

1151
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:05,422
How much of it did you read?

1152
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:08,255
Tell me.

1153
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,756
All of it?

1154
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:11,631
Jesus, Gabbie.

1155
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:15,005
You- you promised me.

1156
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,005
I'm sorry.

1157
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:18,047
I wanted to know
what happened to you.

1158
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,631
Is it true?

1159
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:24,547
All that stuff about
the clown and Uncle Michael?

1160
01:18:25,422 --> 01:18:27,172
You saw him today,
didn't you?

1161
01:18:27,797 --> 01:18:28,505
At the mall.

1162
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,047
That's why you freaked out.

1163
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:33,631
Gabbie, I'm sick.

1164
01:18:35,756 --> 01:18:37,505
I see things that aren't there.

1165
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:42,505
And sometimes I write about it
in my journal and talk about it

1166
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,172
with people who can help me.

1167
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,255
So you didn't really chop off
the clown's head

1168
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,255
with the magical sword?

1169
01:18:49,297 --> 01:18:50,005
No.

1170
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:53,505
Damn,
that would've been so cool.

1171
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,881
Gabs.

1172
01:19:04,923 --> 01:19:08,130
You have to promise me
you're not gonna tell anyone

1173
01:19:08,172 --> 01:19:10,130
what you read
in my journal, okay?

1174
01:19:10,255 --> 01:19:12,505
Not your parents,
not your friends at school?

1175
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:13,505
No one.

1176
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:14,797
Promise me.

1177
01:19:15,505 --> 01:19:17,130
I promise.

1178
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:19,672
Pinky swear.

1179
01:19:23,881 --> 01:19:25,255
Okay.

1180
01:19:29,172 --> 01:19:31,130
Let's play Pictionary
so I can kick your ass.

1181
01:19:37,631 --> 01:19:38,923
You're probably
still passed out.

1182
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:42,631
Uh, look, I just wanted
to call and see if...

1183
01:19:42,672 --> 01:19:43,422
...you're okay, man?

1184
01:19:43,505 --> 01:19:44,631
Um...

1185
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:45,756
Yeah.

1186
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:47,380
Gimme a call back whenever
you get this, but, uh,

1187
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:50,505
if you can't reach me,
I'll be at the Beta bash, so...

1188
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:51,923
Peace.

1189
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:55,923
You don't think I was that
insensitive before, do you?

1190
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:57,881
Uh, yes.

1191
01:19:57,923 --> 01:19:59,547
Yes, I do actually.

1192
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:01,255
Okay, I get
it's like a touchy subject

1193
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,505
and all, but come on,
it didn't happen yesterday.

1194
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:04,797
It happened five years ago.

1195
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:06,172
Yeah, I don't think
that's something

1196
01:20:06,255 --> 01:20:07,797
you ever really get over.

1197
01:20:07,881 --> 01:20:10,380
Well, she still didn't mean
to snap at me the way she did.

1198
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:13,172
Besides, talking it out
is good therapy.

1199
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,380
I was basically doing
her a favor.

1200
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:17,756
Wow, how selfless of you.

1201
01:20:18,756 --> 01:20:20,297
Well, what about Jonathan?

1202
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,631
Do you think he'd still be
willing to do it?

1203
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,005
I don't know, Mia.

1204
01:20:27,505 --> 01:20:29,547
Cole,
I want that interview.

1205
01:20:29,631 --> 01:20:30,756
I mean, sitting across
from someone

1206
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:33,297
who actually encountered
Art the Clown?

1207
01:20:33,756 --> 01:20:36,172
The most famous serial killer
since Jack the Ripper.

1208
01:20:36,255 --> 01:20:37,881
It's historic.

1209
01:20:37,923 --> 01:20:38,881
'Encountered. '

1210
01:20:38,923 --> 01:20:41,631
That's putting it mildly,
wouldn't you say?

1211
01:20:41,756 --> 01:20:43,297
The kid was almost butchered.

1212
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,380
You know what I mean.

1213
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:48,005
I want to know
what it's like to be

1214
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:50,756
in the presence
of that kind of evil.

1215
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,505
What goes through
your brain

1216
01:20:53,547 --> 01:20:56,255
when he's close enough to you
that you feel his breath

1217
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,005
on your body?

1218
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:59,797
What does he smell like?

1219
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:02,547
When you look into his eyes.

1220
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:03,255
What do you see?

1221
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,005
Is there a soul or...

1222
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:09,881
'His eyes!'

1223
01:21:10,756 --> 01:21:12,005
You sound like
you want to fuck him.

1224
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:13,380
I don't want to fuck him.

1225
01:21:15,797 --> 01:21:18,255
I mean,
you're friendly with Jonathan.

1226
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,047
You said he looks
up to you, right?

1227
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,047
Maybe you can convince him
for me,

1228
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:23,130
Mia...

1229
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:25,297
Come on.

1230
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,631
Do it for me.

1231
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:29,047
Please?

1232
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:32,631
I'll be nice,
I promise.

1233
01:21:32,756 --> 01:21:33,631
Mhm.

1234
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:36,380
All I need is 20 minutes,
tops.

1235
01:21:38,005 --> 01:21:40,047
I'll make it worth your while.

1236
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:53,047
Oh, wow.

1237
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:54,255
You are very persuasive.

1238
01:21:57,005 --> 01:21:59,881
I'll see what I can do.

1239
01:22:03,672 --> 01:22:05,255
Okay, so remind me
how to play this again.

1240
01:22:05,297 --> 01:22:06,255
It's been a while.

1241
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:06,923
Wait.

1242
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,047
We need more players.

1243
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,797
Dad, come on.

1244
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:15,130
just outside of Miles County.

1245
01:22:15,172 --> 01:22:16,422
Dad?

1246
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:18,756
Again, five people have been
declared dead at this time

1247
01:22:18,797 --> 01:22:21,380
and six
are in critical condition.

1248
01:22:21,505 --> 01:22:23,756
The explosion happened
around 5pm this afternoon

1249
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:26,756
at the Centerville Mall,
as the children gathered around

1250
01:22:26,797 --> 01:22:28,505
the holiday center display.

1251
01:22:28,631 --> 01:22:30,756
No suspects are in custody
at this time,

1252
01:22:30,797 --> 01:22:33,881
as the investigation
is still underway.

1253
01:22:34,005 --> 01:22:34,756
Close?

1254
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:36,881
I was pretty damn close!

1255
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:38,756
Too close for my liking.

1256
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:39,923
Was it a terrorist attack?

1257
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,005
I don't know, baby.

1258
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:44,005
There was this guy, and he
was dressed as Santa Claus,

1259
01:22:44,047 --> 01:22:45,923
and he was handing out
presents to kids.

1260
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:47,756
Every little kid that was there.

1261
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,797
I heard a commotion,
and then I saw security

1262
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:50,672
leading the guy out.

1263
01:22:50,756 --> 01:22:51,631
And then, bam!

1264
01:22:51,756 --> 01:22:53,756
There was an explosion
right there.

1265
01:22:53,797 --> 01:22:54,756
Holy shit.

1266
01:22:54,881 --> 01:22:58,130
He's here, he's here.

1267
01:22:58,255 --> 01:22:59,130
It's not safe.

1268
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:00,047
It's not safe.

1269
01:23:03,797 --> 01:23:04,881
It's not safe.

1270
01:23:05,005 --> 01:23:05,881
It's not safe.

1271
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:07,047
Sienna,
what are you talking about?

1272
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:09,172
The Miles County Clown.

1273
01:23:09,255 --> 01:23:11,380
I saw- I saw him today.

1274
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:12,005
Listen to me.

1275
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,047
No, I saw him today.

1276
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,756
- All right.
- Okay, I saw him.

1277
01:23:14,881 --> 01:23:16,047
And I wasn't gonna say
anything

1278
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,255
because I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

1279
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,005
Okay.

1280
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:20,005
And he's gonna come for us.

1281
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:21,422
- No, honey. No.
- He's gonna come.

1282
01:23:21,505 --> 01:23:22,672
All right.

1283
01:23:22,756 --> 01:23:24,422
We have to get- As long as
I'm here, we're in danger.

1284
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:25,547
Okay? We're in danger.

1285
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:27,422
We have to get as far away
from here as possible.

1286
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:29,005
There's no Miles County Clown,
Sienna.

1287
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,380
No, it was him, okay?

1288
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,547
I saw him.

1289
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:32,380
- Nobody's coming for-
Listen to me.

1290
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:33,047
Stop it!

1291
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:34,005
You are scaring Gabbie.

1292
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:34,547
Stop it!

1293
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:35,422
Jonathan!

1294
01:23:35,505 --> 01:23:36,380
Jonathan!
We have to call Jonathan.

1295
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:37,547
I will call Jonathan.

1296
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:39,797
If they know- Jonathan,
then we have to call Jonathan,

1297
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,130
right now.

1298
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:58,297
Hey, Uncle Greg.

1299
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:59,422
Jonathan.

1300
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:02,380
Dude, your sister
is freaking out over here, man.

1301
01:24:02,422 --> 01:24:03,923
She saw something on the news,

1302
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:05,505
and she's adamant
about getting you over here

1303
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:07,130
as soon as possible.

1304
01:24:08,172 --> 01:24:10,005
She thinks you're in danger.

1305
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:15,672
What'd she see?

1306
01:24:15,756 --> 01:24:18,631
She saw the news, man,
about the explosion.

1307
01:24:18,672 --> 01:24:21,255
Look, I think a few people
were killed, and now she's-

1308
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:22,005
Look, dude. It's bad.

1309
01:24:22,047 --> 01:24:23,505
I need to talk to him, okay?

1310
01:24:23,547 --> 01:24:24,172
Sienna!

1311
01:24:24,255 --> 01:24:25,505
Jonathan.

1312
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:27,505
Oh! It's happening,
it's happening, okay?

1313
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:29,547
You need to let Uncle Greg
come and get you right now.

1314
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,380
You're not safe.

1315
01:24:32,255 --> 01:24:34,297
Okay, I'll come over.

1316
01:24:37,047 --> 01:24:38,547
Did you get it?

1317
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:43,005
Yeah, I got it.

1318
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,005
See you soon.

1319
01:24:47,255 --> 01:24:48,047
Okay.

1320
01:24:58,881 --> 01:25:00,756
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

1321
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:02,130
Good.

1322
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,672
You were right.

1323
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,881
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

1324
01:25:13,923 --> 01:25:15,881
Be careful.

1325
01:25:15,923 --> 01:25:17,672
Call me if anything.

1326
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:24,005
Hey, sweetie.

1327
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:25,005
You okay?

1328
01:25:26,005 --> 01:25:27,505
Where's Sienna?

1329
01:25:28,005 --> 01:25:29,756
She's sleeping.

1330
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:36,756
She's gonna go back
to the hospital, isn't she?

1331
01:25:38,422 --> 01:25:40,505
I don't know, baby.

1332
01:25:40,547 --> 01:25:42,422
I don't want her to.

1333
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:45,130
But if she's not well,
we gotta do what's best for her.

1334
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:49,130
What if she's right?

1335
01:25:49,172 --> 01:25:50,881
What if the Miles County Clown
is back?

1336
01:25:50,923 --> 01:25:53,255
He's not, Gabs.

1337
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,756
You're safe.

1338
01:25:54,797 --> 01:25:55,797
Sienna's just scared.

1339
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:59,047
Nothing's going to happen
to any of us, okay?

1340
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,797
Just get some rest.

1341
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:02,672
Jonathan and Daddy
will be back soon.

1342
01:26:03,881 --> 01:26:05,047
Okay.

1343
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:07,881
I love you.

1344
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:10,130
Love you too, mom.

1345
01:28:56,505 --> 01:28:57,547
Help!

1346
01:28:57,631 --> 01:28:58,881
Help us!

1347
01:29:01,547 --> 01:29:03,923
Oh, Mia, no, Mia!

1348
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:28,380
Mia!

1349
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:31,130
No!

1350
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:10,881
Hey, Uncle Greg.

1351
01:32:11,005 --> 01:32:11,672
Jonathan.

1352
01:32:11,756 --> 01:32:13,255
I'm here.

1353
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,672
Where? I don't see you.

1354
01:32:15,756 --> 01:32:16,797
I'm parked right
where you told me.

1355
01:32:16,881 --> 01:32:18,505
I'm in front of your dorm.

1356
01:32:20,756 --> 01:32:23,130
Jonathan,
can you hear me?

1357
01:32:35,797 --> 01:32:38,797
Sisi, wait a minute.

1358
01:32:40,547 --> 01:32:42,505
I do have something for you.

1359
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:51,130
Ta-da!

1360
01:32:51,672 --> 01:32:53,130
You drew it!

1361
01:32:53,172 --> 01:32:54,631
I knew you would!

1362
01:32:54,756 --> 01:32:58,297
Yeah, I just- I didn't think
it was really ready,

1363
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,756
but, um...

1364
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,797
...you like her?

1365
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:04,547
I love her.

1366
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,130
She's beautiful.

1367
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:09,672
Is she an angel?

1368
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:11,672
Not just an angel.

1369
01:33:11,756 --> 01:33:13,797
She's an angel warrior.

1370
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,547
You see that fire sword?

1371
01:33:16,631 --> 01:33:18,505
It has special powers.

1372
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:21,797
She can defeat any bad guy
with that sword,

1373
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:23,547
and he can never hurt her.

1374
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,047
Wow.

1375
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:27,005
Can she defeat Blaster Man?

1376
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:28,255
Oh, yeah.

1377
01:33:28,297 --> 01:33:30,130
Ten Blaster Men.

1378
01:33:32,047 --> 01:33:33,923
So cool.

1379
01:33:34,005 --> 01:33:37,631
Well,
now you get to name her.

1380
01:33:37,756 --> 01:33:39,130
I can name her?

1381
01:33:39,255 --> 01:33:40,631
Of course you can.

1382
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,255
It's your character,
isn't it?

1383
01:33:44,047 --> 01:33:45,923
Thanks, Dad.

1384
01:33:46,005 --> 01:33:48,172
You're very welcome,
sweetheart.

1385
01:33:59,005 --> 01:34:00,505
Dad?

1386
01:34:03,172 --> 01:34:04,255
Daddy?

1387
01:34:07,756 --> 01:34:09,631
Go!

1388
01:34:09,672 --> 01:34:11,130
Daddy!

1389
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,881
Let go.

1390
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,547
What's that?

1391
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:33,881
Sisi,
I need you to listen to me.

1392
01:34:33,923 --> 01:34:35,631
Look.
Look at me, look at me.

1393
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,923
I am always with you.

1394
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,130
We have got to put
a stop to this before

1395
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:32,130
it goes too far, Jess.

1396
01:35:32,255 --> 01:35:34,047
What do you suggest we do?

1397
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:36,005
I think we should call
the doctor immediately.

1398
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,255
That's what we should do.

1399
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,380
I'm not doing that.

1400
01:35:38,505 --> 01:35:40,505
It's obvious she's unstable.

1401
01:35:40,547 --> 01:35:42,172
She's just confused.

1402
01:35:42,255 --> 01:35:43,380
Confused my ass.

1403
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:44,380
Come on.

1404
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,422
There's no telling
what she's liable to do.

1405
01:35:46,505 --> 01:35:49,005
I'm not sending her back
to that place on Christmas Eve.

1406
01:35:50,005 --> 01:35:50,881
Listen to me.

1407
01:35:51,005 --> 01:35:52,672
She is a danger right now.

1408
01:35:52,756 --> 01:35:56,631
Not only to herself,
but to us, to our family.

1409
01:35:56,756 --> 01:35:58,005
We have to think about Gabbie.

1410
01:35:58,047 --> 01:35:59,380
Shh!

1411
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:01,380
Keep your voice down.

1412
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,631
I don't want Sienna to hear us.

1413
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:05,130
Oh, I don't give a fuck
if she hears us or not.

1414
01:36:05,172 --> 01:36:06,756
As a matter of fact,
you know what I think

1415
01:36:06,797 --> 01:36:08,297
we should do to Sienna?

1416
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:12,172
I think we should go upstairs
and smother her in her sleep.

1417
01:36:13,505 --> 01:36:16,047
Then we'd be free.

1418
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:17,005
Free from her bullshit.

1419
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:20,631
Free...

1420
01:36:21,631 --> 01:36:25,255
Free, free, free, free, free...

1421
01:36:25,297 --> 01:36:28,255
Free!

1422
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:31,255
Crazy lady!

1423
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,756
Crazy lady!

1424
01:36:32,881 --> 01:36:36,797
Crazy lady!

1425
01:36:39,422 --> 01:36:41,255
Crazy lady!

1426
01:36:41,297 --> 01:36:42,881
You're a danger to yourself
and everyone else

1427
01:36:42,923 --> 01:36:44,255
in this fucking house.

1428
01:36:46,255 --> 01:36:47,380
Crazy lady!

1429
01:36:47,422 --> 01:36:48,881
Crazy! Crazy!

1430
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:50,505
Gabbie!

1431
01:38:11,422 --> 01:38:13,297
Cheese, bitch.

1432
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:31,047
Cheese.

1433
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,005
To Mommy.

1434
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:55,255
Love, Gabbie.

1435
01:39:28,047 --> 01:39:29,923
Try it on, Mommy.

1436
01:39:31,923 --> 01:39:33,881
Aww, it looks good on you,
Mommy.

1437
01:39:33,923 --> 01:39:35,047
Hah!

1438
01:39:43,255 --> 01:39:48,172
If you scream, I'm gonna rip
your fucking tongue out.

1439
01:39:56,881 --> 01:39:58,756
Where's my daughter?

1440
01:39:58,797 --> 01:40:00,631
Oh, what did you do
to my daughter?

1441
01:40:02,255 --> 01:40:04,255
I thought you'd never ask.

1442
01:40:25,631 --> 01:40:28,172
Merry Christmas, Mommy.

1443
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:34,631
Hi, Gabbie!

1444
01:40:36,797 --> 01:40:38,005
No!

1445
01:40:40,005 --> 01:40:41,881
Hi, Mommy!

1446
01:40:41,923 --> 01:40:43,380
We love you.

1447
01:40:43,422 --> 01:40:44,672
We miss you.

1448
01:40:48,505 --> 01:40:51,672
That's not my daughter.

1449
01:40:51,756 --> 01:40:53,130
But it is!

1450
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:55,297
Can't recognize
your own flesh and blood?

1451
01:41:04,172 --> 01:41:08,047
I gave you a present,
Mommy.

1452
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:10,797
And now I want you
to give me one.

1453
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:12,756
Fuck you!

1454
01:41:38,797 --> 01:41:41,380
No, no!

1455
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:45,923
I love you, Sienna.

1456
01:41:49,547 --> 01:41:51,297
Kill them both.

1457
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:53,255
Make them suffer.

1458
01:41:55,881 --> 01:41:57,756
You first.

1459
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:02,380
No, no!

1460
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:22,672
No, no!

1461
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:25,672
Stop!

1462
01:42:34,005 --> 01:42:35,505
No!

1463
01:42:40,297 --> 01:42:41,631
Stop!

1464
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:42,422
You're no savior.

1465
01:44:22,297 --> 01:44:25,505
I'm gonna take
everything you love.

1466
01:44:25,631 --> 01:44:31,380
Then I'm gonna invade that
pretty pink flesh of yours.

1467
01:44:31,505 --> 01:44:33,380
And destroy you
from the inside out,

1468
01:44:33,422 --> 01:44:35,756
just like I did this bitch.

1469
01:44:36,797 --> 01:44:40,380
But first,
I have a confession to make.

1470
01:44:45,881 --> 01:44:48,005
That's not Gabbie.

1471
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:51,756
Gabbie!

1472
01:44:51,881 --> 01:44:52,631
Gabbie!

1473
01:44:52,756 --> 01:44:53,422
Gabbie!

1474
01:44:53,505 --> 01:44:54,422
Let me go!

1475
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:57,756
Gabbie!

1476
01:45:09,756 --> 01:45:12,881
Please,
just let her go.

1477
01:45:12,923 --> 01:45:16,005
You can have me,
you can have me.

1478
01:45:18,172 --> 01:45:19,756
I already have you.

1479
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,672
Gabby!

1480
01:45:21,756 --> 01:45:24,255
I'll fucking kill you!

1481
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,672
Stop!

1482
01:45:26,005 --> 01:45:29,005
You cruel fuck,
she's just a baby,

1483
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,005
leave her alone!

1484
01:45:31,923 --> 01:45:33,756
Stop.

1485
01:46:02,631 --> 01:46:05,505
It's all your fault.

1486
01:46:06,505 --> 01:46:09,255
I told you that wasn't Gabbie.

1487
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:12,005
See you soon.

1488
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,547
Love you.

1489
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:15,005
Jonathan!

1490
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:17,255
No, no!

1491
01:46:17,297 --> 01:46:18,547
No!

1492
01:46:18,631 --> 01:46:20,047
You fucking bitch!

1493
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:21,505
No!

1494
01:46:24,881 --> 01:46:26,422
That's it!

1495
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:28,172
Come on!

1496
01:46:28,255 --> 01:46:30,881
Kill me! Kill me!

1497
01:46:30,923 --> 01:46:32,255
No!

1498
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:34,672
Everything you love is gone.

1499
01:46:34,756 --> 01:46:37,672
There is no hope,
there is no God.

1500
01:46:37,756 --> 01:46:39,756
Just let go!

1501
01:46:39,881 --> 01:46:41,380
So you can let me in!

1502
01:46:46,881 --> 01:46:48,756
Sienna!

1503
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:49,672
Sienna!

1504
01:46:49,756 --> 01:46:50,923
Let her go!

1505
01:46:51,005 --> 01:46:52,923
Sienna!

1506
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:21,505
Oh, you are strong,
aren't you?

1507
01:47:21,547 --> 01:47:23,505
Now I know why they chose you.

1508
01:47:25,255 --> 01:47:27,505
You really love that one,
don't you?

1509
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:30,380
She's fighting for you,
Gabby.

1510
01:47:30,422 --> 01:47:32,631
You're all she's got left.

1511
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:38,380
And you're the only thing
that's keeping her

1512
01:47:38,422 --> 01:47:41,631
from letting me in.

1513
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:44,505
Gabby! No!

1514
01:47:44,631 --> 01:47:45,130
No!

1515
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:47,047
Don't fucking touch her!

1516
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,547
No!

1517
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:51,005
I'm sorry you didn't get
to open my present.

1518
01:47:53,505 --> 01:47:55,422
That's not fair.

1519
01:47:55,505 --> 01:47:57,047
Which one is yours, sweetie?

1520
01:47:58,631 --> 01:47:59,756
I said which one?

1521
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:02,505
The one at the back
with the angels.

1522
01:48:04,005 --> 01:48:06,130
The angels, of course.

1523
01:48:28,547 --> 01:48:30,797
Did you wrap this yourself?

1524
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:34,380
Shitty job.

1525
01:48:38,255 --> 01:48:39,672
Do you want to know
what Gabbie got you

1526
01:48:39,756 --> 01:48:41,255
for Christmas?

1527
01:48:43,047 --> 01:48:44,547
Yes.

1528
01:48:45,047 --> 01:48:47,631
Do you want to open it
yourself?

1529
01:48:49,255 --> 01:48:51,005
Yes.

1530
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:52,380
So do it.

1531
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:14,255
No!

1532
01:49:23,047 --> 01:49:24,756
Enough!

1533
01:49:32,797 --> 01:49:35,130
You said you wanted to open it.

1534
01:49:36,505 --> 01:49:38,380
Stop it, stop it!

1535
01:49:38,505 --> 01:49:39,631
Let her go!

1536
01:49:43,297 --> 01:49:44,672
Open it!

1537
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:02,505
We're waiting.

1538
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:07,881
Stop it!

1539
01:50:07,923 --> 01:50:08,422
Let her go!

1540
01:50:29,297 --> 01:50:31,422
Hope you like it.

1541
01:50:38,756 --> 01:50:40,380
Best gift ever.

1542
01:51:04,547 --> 01:51:06,130
Tell me how this tastes.

1543
01:51:29,547 --> 01:51:31,380
Oh, Gabs!

1544
01:51:31,505 --> 01:51:32,631
Oh, God.

1545
01:51:32,756 --> 01:51:33,797
Oh, God.

1546
01:51:37,255 --> 01:51:38,505
How did you know?

1547
01:51:38,547 --> 01:51:40,130
I opened it.

1548
01:51:40,172 --> 01:51:42,005
I'm a snoop, remember?

1549
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:44,422
Yeah.

1550
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:47,130
Get down!

1551
01:52:20,881 --> 01:52:22,172
Gabbie!

1552
01:52:42,923 --> 01:52:44,631
Come on, fucker!

1553
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:26,923
Mommy!

1554
01:53:28,255 --> 01:53:29,380
Mommy.

1555
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:31,255
Mom!

1556
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:33,547
Please!

1557
01:53:33,631 --> 01:53:35,005
Wake up!

1558
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:41,297
Sienna!

1559
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:43,130
Gabbie!

1560
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:52,756
Sienna, I'm slipping!

1561
01:55:58,505 --> 01:55:59,756
Gabbie!

1562
01:56:01,881 --> 01:56:03,756
Reach up, Gabbie!

1563
01:56:03,797 --> 01:56:05,505
Hold on!

1564
01:56:05,631 --> 01:56:07,631
Sienna,
I can't, I can't!

1565
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:14,005
Grab on!

1566
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:15,172
Sienna, I can't!

1567
01:56:15,255 --> 01:56:17,130
Yes you can, baby,
reach out!

1568
01:56:17,172 --> 01:56:18,297
Come on!

1569
01:56:19,923 --> 01:56:21,422
Grab it!

1570
01:56:25,172 --> 01:56:26,631
Come on, baby, work with me!

1571
01:56:26,756 --> 01:56:27,672
Come on.

1572
01:56:27,756 --> 01:56:29,130
Reach for it.

1573
01:56:31,631 --> 01:56:32,505
Hold, baby.

1574
01:56:32,547 --> 01:56:33,756
Pull up!

1575
01:56:33,797 --> 01:56:35,130
Sienna, I'm slipping!

1576
01:56:35,172 --> 01:56:37,505
Oh, God, help!

1577
01:56:37,547 --> 01:56:38,255
Sienna!

1578
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,756
I love you.

1579
01:56:46,422 --> 01:56:48,881
Sienna!

1580
01:56:55,005 --> 01:56:57,005
Gabbie!

1581
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:00,631
Gabbie!

1582
01:58:26,797 --> 01:58:28,547
Gabbie.

1583
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,380
I'll find you.

1584
01:59:03,172 --> 01:59:05,797
All is bright

1585
01:59:06,881 --> 01:59:09,797
Round yon virgin-

1586
01:59:12,505 --> 01:59:14,047
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you reading a book?

1587
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:15,756
Just tell me
to shut up next time.

1588
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:16,422
Oh, no.

1589
01:59:16,505 --> 01:59:17,631
It's okay.

1590
01:59:17,756 --> 01:59:19,422
This book is actually
a lot creepier

1591
01:59:19,505 --> 01:59:21,005
than I anticipated.

1592
01:59:21,047 --> 01:59:22,005
Horror?

1593
01:59:22,047 --> 01:59:23,172
Yeah.

1594
01:59:23,255 --> 01:59:24,881
I don't, uh...

1595
01:59:24,923 --> 01:59:27,797
I don't get
into all that blood and gore.

1596
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:29,505
I'm more of a rom-com guy.

1597
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,172
Frankenstein.

1598
01:59:32,255 --> 01:59:33,130
That's a good movie.

1599
01:59:33,172 --> 01:59:34,756
A classic.

1600
02:00:27,631 --> 02:00:29,172
You ok hun?

1601
02:00:42,923 --> 02:00:45,380
It's a Terrifier Christmas

1602
02:00:45,422 --> 02:00:48,130
Let the horror
fill your heart

1603
02:00:48,255 --> 02:00:50,672
Do you hear footsteps,
that's not Santa

1604
02:00:50,756 --> 02:00:53,547
It's a jolly clown named Art

1605
02:00:53,631 --> 02:00:56,130
He is a Miles County legend

1606
02:00:56,172 --> 02:00:58,881
With a smile that brings
on chill

1607
02:00:59,005 --> 02:01:01,255
On a journey
to outdo himself

1608
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:04,005
Let's talk his latest kill

1609
02:01:06,797 --> 02:01:09,380
We saw your gleaming eyes

1610
02:01:09,505 --> 02:01:12,130
He'll kill the flesh right
off your bones

1611
02:01:12,172 --> 02:01:14,881
And shock with
a silent laugh

1612
02:01:15,005 --> 02:01:17,881
It's a Terrifier Christmas

1613
02:01:20,756 --> 02:01:24,505
Tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta
