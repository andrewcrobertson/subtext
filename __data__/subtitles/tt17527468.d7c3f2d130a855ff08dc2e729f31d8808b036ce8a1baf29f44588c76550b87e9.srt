1
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,220
Tonight is
the fucking night, okay?

2
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,850
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,810
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,020
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,480
We're getting out there.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,020
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,730
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

8
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,400
Man, speak for yourself.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,530
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,990
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,450
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,530
I think that it's time.

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,740
Oh, really? It's time?

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,990
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,540
we've all been going
to school together?

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,830
I've been building tension.

17
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,210
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,330
Yeah, okay.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,830
And just what would I say?

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,300
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,130
How's his penis?

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,130
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,840
They could have broken up,
you never know.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,310
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,560
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,560
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,860
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,070
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,530
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,610
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,820
It's probably white, okay?

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,330
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,410
What the fuck happened to her?

35
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,950
She's washed up.

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,920
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

37
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,040
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,630
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

39
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,130
Josie, tick-tock.

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,220
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,180
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

42
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,430
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

43
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,510
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,100
I might have a good shot
that way.

45
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,540
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,290
What the fuck are you wearing?

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,570
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

48
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,360
I think you wanna be here.

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,780
Who said that?

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,280
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,450
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,950
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,830
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,120
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,420
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,000
You have Munchausen's.

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,710
Look, just follow my lead.

58
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,090
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh.

59
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,420
Oh.
You know what?

60
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,670
- Just keep going.
- How was your summer?

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,470
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

62
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,930
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

63
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,930
This school has such
a gay problem.

64
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

65
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,100
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

66
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,020
Like, look at Matthieu.

67
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,810
Rock on, man. Killin' it.

68
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,110
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

69
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,920
Thanks, bitch.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,110
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,610
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

72
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,580
- Every show.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,910
Ooh. Popcorn.

74
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,090
Don't mind if I do.

75
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,970
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

76
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,510
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

78
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,910
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

79
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,350
yeah, it was good.

80
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,770
What are you guys doing here?

81
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,850
You guys never come
to the fair.

82
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,150
What happened to your arm?

83
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,520
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,980
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

85
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,150
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

86
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,860
No, I just tripped
and I--

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,870
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

88
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,410
Did you go to juvie?

89
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,040
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

90
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,580
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ... it's time to get ready,

91
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,250
{\i1}get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!

92
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, my God, what did you do?

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,670
And the man
who will lead us to victory

94
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,760
{\i1}against the evil, maniacal,

95
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,130
{\i1}shit-eating
Huntington Ferrets,

96
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,550
{\i1}let's hear it for Jeff!

97
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,220
Jeff! Have my babies!

98
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,930
Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

99
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,930
I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

100
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,730
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

101
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,250
What's the grossest animal?

102
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,270
Jeff,
come sign my tits!

103
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,500
Eat my pussy!

104
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
That's right.

105
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,450
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

106
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,660
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,160
- Take this.
- No.

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,660
Really quick.
This is the moment.

109
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
Stop yelling at me!

110
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,890
Could you give that back
really quickly?

111
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,670
I am loving all the...

113
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,420
holes in your pants.

114
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,550
Thanks.

115
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,550
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

116
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,680
Thank you.

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,010
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

118
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,060
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

119
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,560
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- No, not that.

120
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,190
Brittany.

121
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,690
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

122
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,190
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

123
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,270
I need to pull trig.

124
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,780
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

125
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm gonna say something crazy.

126
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,610
I think you could eat food,

127
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,200
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

128
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,530
Mmm, gross.

129
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,200
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,500
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

131
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,370
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

132
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh, I don't know.

133
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,040
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

134
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,170
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

135
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,010
- Yes, you could.
- No.

136
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,050
No bun. Okay.

137
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,340
Um, Isabel.

138
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,640
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't think so.

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,470
I think so.
It was really good.

141
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,990
It was super funny.

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,500
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

143
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

144
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, you're skinny--

145
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,160
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

146
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,160
You probably should eat.

147
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,580
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

148
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,140
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

149
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,830
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

150
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,060
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

151
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,760
Fuck! Fuck!

152
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,760
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,300
You know what? I'm good.

154
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

155
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,760
If it's not happening here,

156
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,510
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

157
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,730
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

158
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,810
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

159
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,400
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

160
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,860
That's the only hope for me.

161
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,400
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,820
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

163
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,610
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

164
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,820
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

165
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,900
We're going to have
to join a church.

166
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,200
He'll be the gay pastor.

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
My whole life's fucked!

168
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,620
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

169
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,370
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

170
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,790
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

171
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,500
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

172
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,170
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

173
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,340
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

174
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,750
And yeah, guess what?

175
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,590
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

176
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,970
He's fucking the evangelist!

177
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,890
I don't wanna
live like that.

178
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,720
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

179
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
- Isabel.
- Leave me alone!

181
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,900
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

182
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,150
- What?
- Look.

183
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,030
- Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

184
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,440
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

185
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,610
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

186
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,870
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

187
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,200
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

188
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

189
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,290
Yes, come on.

190
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,830
...Irish Catholic.

191
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,250
And I'm regular Christian!

192
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,000
- Josie, ask her. Come on.
- PJ, stop.

193
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
You're hurting my head.

194
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,340
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

195
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,710
And it's giving me PTSD
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

196
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,630
- Just do it now.
- No.

197
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,570
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

198
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,450
Isabel.

199
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,220
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

200
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,640
Isabel...

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,140
Get out of the car.

202
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,480
You can't tell me what to do.

203
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,350
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- Okay,

204
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

205
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,530
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

206
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,780
Move, you prick!

207
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,820
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

208
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,990
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

209
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,740
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

210
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,000
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

211
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,500
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

212
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,170
Get out! Come on.

213
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,330
- I feel like
we should just drive.
- Drive.

214
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,630
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

215
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,210
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

216
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,550
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

217
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,670
He's gonna move.

218
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,090
- We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

219
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,090
- Drive. He'll move.
- Just drive. Josie, go.

220
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,550
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

221
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,400
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

222
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,670
Jeff?

223
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,320
Jeff!

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,610
- Are you...
- Are you okay?

225
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,780
When people move cars,
don't people move?

226
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,570
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

227
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,160
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,700
- Back up! Back up!
- We didn't even do anything.

229
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,040
No, come here.

230
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,290
- Man down! Man down!
- You!

231
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,620
Oh, my God.

232
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,330
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

233
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,630
We should go. Let's go.

234
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,090
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

235
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,670
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

236
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,170
- Fine.
- What did you do to him?

237
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,090
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

238
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,430
You fucking cowards!

239
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,650
You better fucking run!

240
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,470
- I don't understand.
- What the fuck?

241
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,730
They're not gonna
get away with this!

242
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,400
{\an8}{\i1}Attention.

243
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
{\i1}The library
is out of use again.

244
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
{\i1}Huntington shot up
our remaining books,

245
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,200
{\i1}so there will be no reading
again this year. Thank you.

246
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,120
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

247
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,290
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

248
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,120
I know I won't even digest it.

249
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,290
I have to throw up."

250
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,340
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

251
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,460
She's like, "No, not, just...

252
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,060
Maybe, but not the bun."

253
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh, it was just really sweet.

254
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,930
You had to be there.

255
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,070
I was there.

256
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,270
Are you serious?

257
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,980
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

258
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,640
You're the sidekick, not me.

259
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,690
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

260
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,710
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

261
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,320
Thanks.

262
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,820
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

263
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,490
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

264
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,760
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

265
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,410
Hi.

266
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,200
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

267
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,750
What? Yeah.

268
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,330
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- All right, kiddos.

269
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,290
Welcome back to class.

270
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,170
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

271
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,460
That belongs to the school.

272
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

273
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,590
Nice try, PJ,

274
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,510
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

275
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,510
All right, check it out.

276
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,950
- Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,270
Do what?

278
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,100
Holy shit. Is he okay?

279
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey, you good, man?

280
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,820
What the fuck?

281
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,110
- Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

282
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,190
Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

283
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,610
Okay, so, did he fight back?

284
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,160
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,910
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

286
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,530
or anything,
just let me know...

287
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,080
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

288
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,330
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

289
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,370
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

290
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

291
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,210
That's how, okay?

292
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,040
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,590
Overall bitch.

294
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,420
This is you.

295
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,380
God damn it, Jeff.

296
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,880
What the fuck?

297
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,350
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

298
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,220
Hello,
this is Principal Meyers

299
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,140
{\i1}with an important
Huntington update.

300
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,770
{\i1}So, listen to this girl.

301
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,860
Last night,
outside the fair,

302
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,650
{\i1}a Huntington player
followed me home,

303
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,860
{\i1}pinned me against my car
and punched me in the face.

304
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,860
{\i1}And now my face
is totally fucked.

305
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,030
Fuck.

306
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,780
{\i1}We haven't faced the violence
of Huntington for 20 years.

307
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,450
{\i1}They think they can get
in our heads

308
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,660
{\i1}by picking on our weak
and defenseless.

309
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
{\i1}Well, we can't let them
break our spirit, folks.

310
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,250
{\i1}Keep your heads in the game.

311
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,330
They're gonna pork us!

312
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,750
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

313
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,090
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

314
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,760
Oh, great. More violence.

315
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,840
Just what this school needs.

316
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,590
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

317
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,640
- That's class?
- Latte.

318
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Get my shit.

319
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,600
Solid class.

320
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,200
Hey.

321
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,150
Josie, right?

322
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,670
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

323
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,650
Um, weren't you there?

324
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,610
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

325
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,990
- and killed girls in juvie.
- Really?

326
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,450
Um, what did you think
about that?

327
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,990
Excuse me.

328
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,710
{\i1}Could the ugly,
untalented gays

329
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,670
{\i1}please report
to the principal's office?

330
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,670
Guess that's you guys.

331
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,300
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

332
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,920
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

333
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,630
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

334
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,090
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

335
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,930
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

336
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,010
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

337
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,680
- Shush.
- Okay.

338
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,100
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

339
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,480
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

340
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,230
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

341
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,530
- Twenty years.
- Couldn't be clearer.

342
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,610
I think I can explain.

343
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,940
I can explain.

344
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,990
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

345
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,490
Ha! Sure.

346
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,950
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

347
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,290
Yeah, actually.

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,370
How come you can't buck up

349
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,080
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

350
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,250
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

351
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,000
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

352
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,590
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

353
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,760
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

354
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,090
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

355
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,100
- Can we just
calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

356
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,810
- You know what?
- What?

357
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,350
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

358
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,930
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

359
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,440
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

360
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,710
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

361
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,840
for...

362
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
for our self-defense club.

363
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,870
Self-defense-- What is that?

364
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,330
- Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

365
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,380
- Well, here's the thing--
- Yes! Yes!

366
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,340
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

367
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,670
A fight club.

368
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,170
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

369
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,260
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

370
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,630
No, we don't. Shut up.

371
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,090
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

372
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,470
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

373
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,510
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

374
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,310
while you perform
The Vagina Monologues.

375
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,020
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

376
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,850
Yes, sir.

377
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,190
I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

378
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,570
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

379
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,070
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

380
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,150
We're doing it.

381
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,070
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

382
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,660
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

383
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,450
Also, you heard
the announcements.

384
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,660
Girls are terrified.

385
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,370
It's perfect. They need this.

386
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

387
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,210
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

388
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,460
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

389
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,630
That's the point of feminism.

390
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,010
That's not the point
of feminism.

391
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,880
You also don't care
about feminism.

392
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,180
Your favorite show
is Entourage.

393
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,720
You're missing the point!

394
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

395
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,270
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

396
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,060
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

397
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,560
About juvie?

398
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
- Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

399
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,810
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

400
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,230
I just didn't correct you.

401
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,530
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

402
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,820
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

403
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,990
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

404
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,240
Look, this is how we do this.

405
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,660
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

406
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,030
Which I've got covered.

407
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,160
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

408
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,250
Hub-bub-bub-bub.

409
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,830
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

410
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

411
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,630
You know Stella-Rebecca?

412
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,380
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

413
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,500
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

414
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,670
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

415
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,510
- Josie.
- What?

416
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,010
- We're doing this.
- No.

417
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah. Listen to me.

418
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,470
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

419
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,480
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

420
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,140
They are grateful to us.

421
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,690
We build a community, we bond,

422
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,940
we share, we connect.

423
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,940
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

424
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,400
Next thing you know,

425
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,160
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

426
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,630
- Jeffrey!
- Josie...

427
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,740
Isabel knew your name.

428
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,830
- Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

429
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,040
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

430
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,670
we just run the risk
of becoming

431
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,580
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

432
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,960
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

433
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,300
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

434
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,970
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

435
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,130
We're the lowest of the low.

436
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,680
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

437
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,810
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

438
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,480
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

439
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,690
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

440
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,190
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

441
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,870
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

442
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,750
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

443
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,740
What's your plan here?

444
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,450
I don't need a plan.

445
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,630
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

446
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,920
Okay.

447
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,180
What's up, lads?

448
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,380
What the fuck?

449
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,460
- These girls are ugly.
- Okay.

450
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,970
Where is Stella?

451
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,590
She was booked
for a car convention.

452
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,220
What? It's a Monday.

453
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,890
Um, maybe we should go

454
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,100
before someone cool shows up?

455
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,680
Before I die? Pick one.

456
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,270
Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

457
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,230
I love David Fincher.

458
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,770
- Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

459
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,780
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

460
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,360
and stopped huffing paint.

461
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,200
She'll never stop
huffing paint.

462
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,360
So, I thought
we'd start...

463
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,510
Um...

464
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,470
- Okay.
- Sorry.

465
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,660
All right.

466
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,910
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

467
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,670
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

468
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
Um, it's a self-defense club.

469
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,840
It's not really, "Fight."

470
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,420
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

471
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,130
and they're picking
on the weak

472
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,800
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

473
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,510
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

474
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,680
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

475
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,980
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

476
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,640
Then, punch-bucket,

477
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,650
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

478
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,810
and we punch you
until you bleed.

479
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,860
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

480
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,070
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

481
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,200
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

482
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,280
Juvie was way crazier.

483
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,370
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

484
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,490
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

485
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,330
I get up. I'm blind.

486
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,770
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

487
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,730
Broke her fuckin' nose.

488
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,550
Josie?

489
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,770
Care to share?

490
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, all right.

491
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,180
Juvie was insane.

492
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,510
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

493
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,490
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

494
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,850
So, you killed a girl?

495
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,730
Uh, no.

496
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,900
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

497
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,240
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

498
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
when she came back
to life, so...

499
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,030
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

500
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,830
She came back to life.

501
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,500
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

502
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

503
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,670
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

504
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,100
Josie, if you'll step forward.

505
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,420
No, I don't wanna do that.

506
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,420
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

507
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,010
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

508
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,590
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

509
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,760
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

510
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,100
They wanna see the punch.

511
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,180
Who am I gonna punch?

512
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,560
Punch me. Just punch me.

513
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,230
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

514
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,310
I can punch you.

515
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,810
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

516
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,190
Something people
would always say,

517
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,310
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

518
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,560
Come on up.

519
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,880
Oh!

520
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,710
Oh, fuck!

521
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,290
Will there an advisor
for this club?

522
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,040
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

523
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,120
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

524
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,180
where we punch each other
in the face?

525
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,150
The Holocaust. It happened.

526
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes, it did.

527
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,930
But how? The seeds were sown
in the Treaty of Versailles,

528
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,850
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

529
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,820
I mean, he's perfect.

530
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,850
No.

531
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,140
- What?
- No.

532
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,730
Please.

533
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,480
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

534
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,360
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

535
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,650
Fuck! When did you show up?

536
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,150
Hey, guys.

537
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,700
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

538
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,740
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

539
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,530
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

540
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,660
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

541
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,450
and, like, guns and stuff,

542
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,670
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

543
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,170
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

544
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,420
But, unfortunately,

545
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,130
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

546
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,920
What? Why?

547
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,010
I don't know.

548
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,800
Why? It was just
so empowering.

549
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,090
What was empowering?

550
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,060
Oh, my God, hi. Um...

551
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,310
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

552
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,440
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

553
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,000
Isabel, let's go.

554
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,030
Hi, boo-boo.

555
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm so strong.

556
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
I mean...

557
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,580
Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.

558
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,090
Great class today.

559
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,090
Hey, uh, girl.

560
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,590
Thanks for coming in today.

561
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,880
We have to come in.
It's class.

562
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,090
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

563
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,430
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

564
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,020
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

565
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,770
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

566
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,270
Sure, he did.

567
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,690
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

568
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,900
- What kind of club is that?
- It's a women's club.

569
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,840
We talk about women's issues.

570
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,010
For example,
periods,

571
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
declining egg count,

572
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,240
skirts...

573
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,490
Skirts?

574
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,370
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

575
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,670
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

576
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,750
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

577
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,340
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

578
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,340
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

579
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,090
Listen. I'm kind of,

580
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,340
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

581
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,010
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

582
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,010
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

583
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,810
Back to the club,

584
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,690
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

585
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
Can I be honest?
You're a man

586
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,020
who's not coping
with what's going on.

587
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,480
- Yeah.
- You know what?

588
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,110
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

589
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,320
And here's one thing

590
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,650
- my mom's always said to me.
- Mmm.

591
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,780
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

592
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,410
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

593
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,740
It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

594
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,660
- but you don't even
come to the dang club.
- No.

595
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,790
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

596
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,040
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

597
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,210
You just say
you're doing something

598
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,960
and then you don't do
any of those things.

599
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,130
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

600
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't come. Yeah.

601
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,610
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

602
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
- Amazing.
- What?

603
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,850
- Yeah.
- Really?

604
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,200
- Okay.
- So cool.

605
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,020
How many girls go
to this school, again?

606
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,780
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

607
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,090
Hey, guys.

608
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,820
Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

609
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,950
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

610
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,000
Hey, ladies.

611
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,140
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

612
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,350
All right. Um...

613
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Hello, everybody.

614
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,670
Okay, excuse me.

615
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,130
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

616
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,420
Um...

617
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,650
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

618
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,290
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

619
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,740
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

620
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,210
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

621
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,090
First...

622
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
listen.

623
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,930
Second,

624
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,680
be on time.

625
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,250
Yeah.

626
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,060
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

627
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,170
What time is it?

628
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,970
- 3:30.
- 3:30!

629
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,650
Club starts at 3:15.

630
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,240
Not 3:16.

631
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,850
Not 3:17,

632
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,400
but the doors close at 3:15.

633
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,210
No exceptions.

634
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,860
I don't care if you're like...

635
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,700
"Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

636
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,490
because I... I need
to get a full ride

637
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,040
because my mom
lives in a trailer

638
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,290
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

639
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,460
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

640
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,080
Shut up, okay?

641
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,730
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

642
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,640
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

643
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,930
Nice.

644
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,890
Uh, we're just getting
started here.

645
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,580
So, um...

646
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,270
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

647
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,020
We're gonna do wrestling.

648
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,320
I think I need a volunteer.

649
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,070
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

650
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,150
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

651
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,570
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

652
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,910
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

653
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,330
Don't be late.

654
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,580
- But this week is good...
- Yeah. No worries.

655
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,830
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

656
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,040
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

657
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
This is a self-defense
class, right?

658
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,290
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

659
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,920
against, like,
football players.

660
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

661
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,420
They're gonna pork us.

662
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,510
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

663
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,930
There's a cash prize, right?

664
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,890
I thought this was
to be part of, like,

665
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,280
a local underprivileged
female community.

666
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

667
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,730
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

668
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,900
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

669
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,440
So, uh, you know, like...

670
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,030
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

671
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,030
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

672
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,450
- Love that.
- Yeah.

673
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

674
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,290
Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

675
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,620
I don't know about this shit.

676
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,040
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

677
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,130
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

678
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,550
- Look.
- We can take it slower.

679
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,960
- Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

680
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
Take that route.
Little slower.

681
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,140
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

682
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,400
Whatever you want, 'kay?

683
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,560
Oh, fuck.

684
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,890
Okay.

685
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,520
That's great.
I say that we go again.

686
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,190
- Oh!
- Ow, fuck! My back.

687
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,270
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

688
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,860
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

689
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,480
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

690
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

691
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,400
- No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

692
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,820
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

693
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,740
I know that,

694
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,620
you know, this is
a little messy right now

695
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,660
but, like, the only way

696
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,100
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

697
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,420
Huntington is coming.

698
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,350
We need this.

699
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,840
I know that things
might seem scary,

700
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,070
but that's okay, because...

701
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,100
because...

702
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,180
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

703
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,850
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

704
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,270
- Right?
- Yes.

705
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,520
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

706
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,480
You are never gonna
get assaulted
on your birthday again.

707
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,240
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

708
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,780
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

709
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,370
Yeah, absolutely.

710
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,530
And for me,

711
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,430
I'll be able
to kill my stepdad.

712
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,830
- Awesome.
- Okay.

713
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,160
And if you believe
in yourselves

714
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,460
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

715
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm like,
"Let's fucking do this!"

716
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,000
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

717
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,130
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

718
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,590
So good.

719
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,090
Yeah! Yes!

720
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,490
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

721
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,270
Yes! Yes, queen, slay!

722
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,390
Yes! Yes!

723
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,730
Slay! Yeah!

724
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,420
Cool.

725
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,360
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.

726
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,570
Yeah, for sure.

I told you.

766
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,990
I know. I feel like
if we keep it up,

767
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,820
we can actually take on
Huntington, you guys.

768
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,580
No, if we keep it up,
we can put our fingers

769
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,450
inside of each other. Grow up.

770
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,580
All right.

771
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,160
You know, PJ,

772
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,040
I feel like people
are actually liking
more than just

773
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

774
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,460
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

775
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,380
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

776
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,970
it means a lot to people,

777
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,430
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

778
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,180
and actually get
to know these girls,

779
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,680
like, it would be
really important,

780
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,910
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

781
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,520
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

782
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,110
- Yeah.
- I love talking
about my trauma.

783
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,320
I literally jack off
after every single

784
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,610
- therapy session.
- What?

785
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,410
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

786
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,660
- Don't say "girls." It's you.
- Bonjour.

787
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,790
I just wanted to say

788
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

789
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600
It seems so supportive
of women.

790
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,750
Especially the hot ones.

791
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,590
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

792
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,550
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

793
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,550
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

794
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,890
I'm just a bit concerned

795
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,010
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

796
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,410
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

797
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Okay.

798
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,900
So, we know
that the club has been a place

799
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,950
where we can feel
empowered physically,

800
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,740
but we also thought
it could be

801
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,410
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

802
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,930
and talk about our feelings.

803
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Okay, so who's been raped?

804
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,810
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

805
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,770
Gray area stuff counts too.

806
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,900
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

807
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,980
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

808
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,870
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

809
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,610
fuck, whatever.

810
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,240
You know?

811
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,570
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

812
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,780
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

813
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,870
And then the form
tells me to call,

814
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,160
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

815
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

816
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,580
but that doesn't count.

817
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,670
So, it's just, like, annoying.

818
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,100
Been there.

819
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,500
We've all been there.

820
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,300
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

821
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,590
but I'm more annoyed

822
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,890
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

823
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,980
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

824
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,950
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

825
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,980
See?

826
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,610
Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

827
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,570
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

828
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,240
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

829
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,160
It's been really, really dark.

830
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,160
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

831
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,670
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

832
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,180
- I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
- I can go next,

833
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,270
if that's okay.

834
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,220
I don't really like talking
about juvie

835
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,140
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

836
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,310
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

837
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,780
'cause people think
it's so badass.

838
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,600
But, really wasn't.

839
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,280
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

840
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,610
like, badass. I mean, um,

841
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,990
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

842
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,080
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

843
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,120
fight people basically
every single night.

844
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,330
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

845
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,790
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

846
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,130
and, um, pipes as well.

847
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,340
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

848
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,170
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

849
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,530
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

850
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,640
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

851
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,480
Like, I don't have
to just let things

852
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,060
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

853
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,070
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

854
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,650
for what the club
has become and...

855
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,360
Um...

856
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,970
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

857
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,040
Yeah, sorry.

858
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,660
I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

859
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,910
I've never really,

860
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,330
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

861
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,090
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

862
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm going through a divorce.

863
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,720
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

864
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,220
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

865
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,360
men... men need therapy.

866
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,970
Yeah.

867
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,910
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

868
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

869
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,260
Um...

870
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,050
Thank you, um, for that.

871
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,470
Um...

872
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,080
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

873
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,460
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

874
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,860
if you wanna...

875
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah.

876
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,700
Yeah, okay, sure.

877
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,580
Mom?

878
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,670
Mom?

879
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,070
Oh, hi, honey.

880
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,760
What are you doing home
so early?

881
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,640
Uh...

882
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,520
Are you kidding me?

883
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,190
I had a long day.

884
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,230
Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

885
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,260
First club fundraiser.

886
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,930
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

887
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,350
Hello, ladies.

888
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,850
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

889
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,980
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

890
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,600
It's so weird.

891
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,190
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

892
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,440
Thanks, PJ.

893
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,150
Ah. We're havin' fun.

894
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,740
We're selling panties.

895
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,130
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

896
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,780
Very nice.

897
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,160
Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

898
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,970
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

899
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,010
Um, I can't. Uh...

900
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,710
Isabel and I have plans, so...

901
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

902
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,170
Yep.

903
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,430
Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

904
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,260
I have to keep up.

905
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,600
Hazel, what is wrong?

906
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,970
Are you constipated
or something?

907
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,310
I'm fucking tired.

908
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,640
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

909
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

910
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,020
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

911
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,580
He's like the crybaby.

912
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,940
With the balls?

913
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,340
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

914
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,090
He's like the main guy.

915
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
Jeff?

916
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,450
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

917
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,040
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

918
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,710
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

919
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,830
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

920
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm good.

921
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,210
Looking good, Stella!

922
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,650
Are you gonna tell her?

923
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,010
Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

924
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,410
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

925
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,560
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

926
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,700
Hit me! Ow!

927
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,420
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

928
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,650
Got it. Thank you.

929
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,240
Jeff!

930
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,590
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

931
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,300
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

932
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,380
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

933
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,770
I wanted to...

934
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,430
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

935
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,370
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

936
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,870
Me too.

937
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,190
I think it's really impressive

938
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,410
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

939
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,870
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

940
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,340
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

941
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,580
You're really, really brave.

942
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,000
No.

943
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,420
No. No, no.

944
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,750
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl.

945
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,900
You're...

946
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Yeah, you're...

947
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,610
really, really brave.

948
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,110
What?

949
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,750
Actually, Isabel, uh...

950
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,690
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

951
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,230
There's something
you maybe should know.

952
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,540
Uh...

953
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,700
I mean it's pretty insane.

954
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,590
Okay.
What... what is it?

955
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,590
I just, I...

956
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,500
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

957
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,770
Wait...

958
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,140
Wait, what?

959
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,430
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

960
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,520
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

961
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,400
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

962
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,110
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

963
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,990
like, constantly.

964
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,120
I mean, just at it
with each other,
which is pretty fucked up.

965
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,200
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

966
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,210
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

967
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,830
Oh.

968
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,180
Thanks.

969
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,140
Jeff so hungy.
Hungy hungy, hungy.

970
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,770
Jeff so hungy.

971
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,990
Swoosh!

972
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,400
What the fuck is this?

973
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,540
Is there pineapple in this?

974
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,860
We talked about this, Janice.

975
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,170
Jeffrey's allergic
to pineapple.

976
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,590
Eat a bag of dicks.

977
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,980
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
but this is the last straw.

978
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,730
How was last night?

979
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,890
Uh, bad, probably,
I would say.

980
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,060
Wait, really?

981
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,080
She's walking really fast.

982
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,920
She usually walks
a lot slower.

983
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,700
Hi.

984
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,220
Are you having sex
with Mrs. Callahan?

985
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,410
Baby, you look so beautiful.

986
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,580
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

987
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,960
Bad. Are you having sex
with her?

988
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,650
I'm... I'm...

989
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,630
helping her with her taxes.

990
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,130
Aren't you
in eighth grade algebra?

991
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,090
I can't answer
that question

992
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,470
because I... I don't know
how to read.

993
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,760
She's asking you to your face!

994
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,310
Fuck, that usually works.

995
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,140
Are you cheating
on me again?

996
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,350
Baby, no! No!

997
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,730
No, why would...
why would I do--

998
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,360
That was one time
with your sister, just once,

999
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,650
two, four times.

1000
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,570
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

1001
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,660
I promise you
I am not sleeping with her.

1002
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,160
I literally saw you yesterday.

1003
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,780
Shut up, nerd!
I fucked your mom!

1004
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,890
Mmm. Mmm.

1005
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,910
Wait.

1006
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,710
- Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

1007
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,130
I'm getting revenge.

1008
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,880
I'm gonna fuck up
some football players.
And I'm buyin' a gun.

1009
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,720
Hell yeah.
I'll get my stepdad's.

1010
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,180
What about, like, egging?

1011
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,550
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

1012
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,760
Ooh, we could cook 'em
and be like...

1013
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,100
- "You're cooked."
- Yes. Yeah.

1014
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,240
Or what about, like, a bomb?

1015
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,980
Like a...
like a super small bomb.

1016
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,480
I mean, they're super easy
to make,

1017
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,190
and I can just put it
under his car,

1018
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,420
and it can be a distraction.

1019
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,920
Yeah, Hazel,
let's do terrorism.

I get a little bit terrified ♪

{\i1}♪ And then I see

Fuck you.

1038
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,380
Sylvie,
you can't just throw it.

1039
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,010
You have to fucking jump
with it.

1040
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,820
- I'm trying.
- Okay,
watch me. Just...

1041
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,140
Damn, we're, uh...
 We're really gonna scare them off.

1042
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,890
Nice! Nice!

1043
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,500
I think I'mma help Isabel
keep watch, so...

1044
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,230
Okay, well,
don't get distracted,

1045
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,090
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

1046
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,050
Thought you might want
some company.

1047
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,890
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1048
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,560
It's nice everybody's here,
like...

1049
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
vandalizing...

1050
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Jeff's house.

1051
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,570
It is nice.

1052
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,940
I, uh...

1053
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,530
Like, how are you doing?

1054
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,310
I mean,
I think it's for the best.

1055
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,440
But I did kind of miss
when he would touch my hair

1056
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,710
and go, like,

1057
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,030
"Shiny, shiny, shiny."
You know?

1058
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,630
I wanted to tell you
this before, but...

1059
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,080
I really appreciated
you fighting

1060
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,890
and speaking loudly
at my boyfriend.

1061
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,170
I really value

1062
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,020
when people use violence
and raise their voices for me.

1063
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,060
It's actually one
of my love languages.

1064
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,190
- Is the other one gifts?
- The other one is gifts.

1065
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,050
Um, I know

1066
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,820
everything is, like,
really fucked up and...

1067
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,490
you still probably miss Jeff,
which I get,

1068
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,860
but I just think

1069
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,460
you deserve way better,
Isabel.

1070
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,320
'Kay, guys.

1071
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,870
Let's make sure we return
or donate these, okay?

1072
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,010
Does anybody know
where the fuck Hazel is?

1073
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,850
Like, 15 minutes?

1074
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,630
Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

1075
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,560
Okay. Um...

Oh, wow, yeah,
it's gonna blow, guys.

1080
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:54,870
Oh, my God.

1081
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
What the fuck?

1082
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,030
Holy shit.

1083
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh, fuck, there's no door!

1084
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,580

Can you listen to me for,
like, once...

1090
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,680
Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!

1091
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,060
- You're awesome!
- No, you're awesome.

1092
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,560
Great. What are we supposed
to do now?

1093
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,770
Relax. No one knows it's us.

1094
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,910
Hey, guys.

1095
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,040
Great show last night.

1096
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,780
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1097
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,820
Oh, you don't.
No, it's really all good.

1098
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,090
Jeffrey needed a new car,
anyway, so...

1099
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,590
don't worry about it.

1100
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,470
What's wrong, Josie?

1101
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:55,970
You seem a little off.

1102
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,940
Your club is over.

1103
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,860
You understand?

1104
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:11,950
Good.

1105
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:14,520
All right, well,
some of us clearly

1106
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,140
have a different definition
of egging,

1107
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,110
but if we keep
our mouths shut,
stay calm, we'll be fine.

1108
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,540
They're gonna shut us down,
aren't they?

1109
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,320
What?

1110
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,990
No. We don't know that.

1111
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,650
- What-- Why--
- Principal Meyers
will believe

1112
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,410
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1113
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,130
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1114
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,380
Man...

1115
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,330
Fuck.

1116
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,000
You know,
it's been real, guys.

1117
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,210
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1118
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,420
with the goodbyes and...

1119
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,310
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

1120
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,800
And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1121
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,590
I mean, that was
fucking insane!

1122
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,550
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1123
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,560
Wait. Stop.

1124
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,850
We don't-- Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1125
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,940
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1126
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,650
All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1127
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,370
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1128
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,790
No matter what,

1129
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,410
this club has brought me
so much.

1130
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,550
I feel...

1131
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,720
so much more powerful
and, um...

1132
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
protected.

1133
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:18,870
Me too.

1134
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,380
- Great.
- Oh, my God, PJ.

1135
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,210
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1136
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,300
what you wanted
out of this group,

1137
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,260
but I think
the rest of us did.

1138
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,840
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1139
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,180
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1140
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,930
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1141
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,010
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1142
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,720
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1143
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,060
You really think
that you're the reason
that we have this club?

1144
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,310
The reason? No.

1145
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,480
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1146
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,940
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1147
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,520
You're really ungrateful.

1148
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,570
You're so lucky
that we even let you
be a part of this.

1149
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,420
PJ, you're a liar.

1150
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,080
Yeah, well,
you have no friends,

1151
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,430
and a skank as a mom, so...

1152
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,980
Hazel.

1153
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,830
PJ...

1154
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,210
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1155
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,750
Hazel.

1156
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,570
Whoa.

1157
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,570
I love God.

1158
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,910
Yes, same.

1159
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,570
Yeah.

1160
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,840
Oh, my God,
I always wanted
one of these.

1161
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,370
But my mom says
they hide your figure
and make you look ugly.

1162
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,490
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1163
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,390
Like, as a joke or...

1164
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,540
whatever.

1165
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,710
Thanks.

1166
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,850
Yeah.

1167
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,430
Wow, you and PJ

1168
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,390
really have been
friends forever.

1169
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,200
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1170
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,020
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1171
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,910
PJ called her Gay Yoda,
but I think she's kind of
like a mentor.

1172
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,880
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1173
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,880
She's so, like...

1174
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
like...

1175
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,490
You know?

1176
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,640
- Yeah.
- And you're...

1177
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,600
You're so, like...

1178
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,480
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1179
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,570
Josie...

1180
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,100
I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1181
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,770
- Really?
- Yeah.

1182
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,540
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1183
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,490
Wow.

1184
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,320
This is, um, a total shithole.

1185
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,220
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1186
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,790
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1187
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,190
they give you a tax break.

1188
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,180
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1189
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,470
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1190
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,680
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1191
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,180
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1192
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,270
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1193
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,330
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1194
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,720
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1195
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,250
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1196
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,770
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1197
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,020
Watch out.

1198
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,410
What?

1199
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,450
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1200
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,730
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1201
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:39,360
Your wrists are so small,
and the pen is so heavy
that I'm like,

1202
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,780
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1203
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,700
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1204
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,990
with all the surface area

1205
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,220
that yours are taking up.

1206
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,330
Wow.

1207
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,700
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1208
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,290
Okay, does this hurt?

1209
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,250
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1210
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1211
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,460
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1212
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,350
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1213
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,360
Um...

1214
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,950
Uh...

1215
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,410
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1216
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,840
Oh.

1217
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,630
Um...

1218
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,120
Yeah. Um...

1219
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,250
- I'm... I'm sorry
if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1220
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,230
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1221
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,950
Um...

1222
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,540
I wanted to tell you something.

1223
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,230
What?

1224
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,960
Like, something that happened
last night.

1225
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,760
What happened?

1226
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,470
With Isabel.

1227
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Wait.

1228
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,270
Wait, seriously?

1229
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,690
That's... that's amazing.
That's...

1230
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,550
Everybody,

1231
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,310
{\i1}- even the fucking losers...
- Even the fucking losers!

1232
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,140
{\i1}...make some noise!

1233
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,690
I thought you were
super Christian.

1234
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,820
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1235
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,610
{\i1}All right, uh, so we're gonna
do the pep rally.

1236
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,200
{\i1}First up, cheerleaders.

1237
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,770
Football!

1238
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,430
{\i1}Whoo! Yeah,
thank you, ladies. Ooh!

1239
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,970
{\i1}Thank you all for joining us
here today, folks.

1240
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,010
{\i1}There's been some

1241
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,100
{\i1}exciting stuff happening
at Rockbridge Falls recently.

1242
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,240
Oh.

1243
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,690
{\i1}How many of you

1244
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:23,690
{\i1}know about that little girl
fight club that could?

1245
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,070
Ay, there go my girls.

1246
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:31,320
{\i1}Well, do we have
a surprise for you.

1247
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,660
{\i1}- We're gonna bring...
- Where is she?

1248
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,970
Hazel down.

1249
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,460
{\i1}One of the founding members.

1250
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,790
{\i1}To show us everything
the club's taught her

1251
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,300
{\i1}in a fun little challenge.

1252
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,630
- Let's go, Hazel!
- Go, Hazel!

1253
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,490
- What is this?
- I... I don't know.

1254
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:58,030
Hazel will be
fighting Tucker,

1255
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,790
{\i1}the school's number one boxer.

1256
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,070
Wait, I thought I was gonna be
fighting PJ?

1257
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,070
{\i1}I know what you're thinking,
but don't be alarmed.

1258
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,870
{\i1}Girls can do anything
guys can do, right?

1259
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,260
Yeah, kick his ass!

1260
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,930
{\i1}Ready?

1261
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,830
- Fuck.
- Go.

1262
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,240
Oh, my God.

1263
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,400
- You got this, Hazel.
- Come on, Hazel!

1264
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,500
You got it.

1265
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,010
Shit.

1266
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,560
Whoo! Get him!

1267
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,560
- The fuck are you doing?
- Is she, like,

1268
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,810
sort of winning or...

1269
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,700
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1270
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,820
Fuck.

1271
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,400
Oh. Oh, my God.

1272
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,110
{\i1}I know what you're thinking.

1273
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,590
{\i1}You may be wondering
how a girl
under the training of...

1274
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,790
{\i1}of two juvie convicted killers

1275
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,330
{\i1}can't even stand up
for herself
against a regular old guy.

1276
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,640
Well, truth is, they...

1277
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,880
{\i1}they didn't go to juvie.

1278
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,050
{\i1}No.

1279
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,700
There's no record
of them there.

1280
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,640
{\i1}And according to Hazel...

1281
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,520
{\i1}...they never fought
anyone at all.

1282
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,520
{\i1}And you know what else?

1283
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,170
{\i1}They didn't start the club
to empower women.

1284
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,200
{\i1}They did it
to fuck cheerleaders.

1285
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,260
{\i1}What is wrong with you?

1286
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,470
{\i1}It is such a shame.

1287
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,920
{\i1}We were really rooting
for you girls.

1288
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,460
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1289
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,130
Okay.

1290
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,380
{\i1}- Thank you for attending...
- Hazel!

1291
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,970
{\i1}- ...today's pep rally.
Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!
- Is she okay?

1292
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,430
- Hazel!
- Whoo!

1293
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,150
- Yes!
- Yes!

1294
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,750
Is that true?

1295
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,230
That's why you started this?

1296
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,900
No, no, no.

1297
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,610
Not... not entirely.

1298
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,320
Not entire-- Okay.

1299
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,330
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1300
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,970
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1301
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,290
The point of the club

1302
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:10,210
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1303
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,340
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1304
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,710
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1305
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,170
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1306
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,940
This is the second wave
all over again.

1307
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,310
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1308
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,770
PJ made me do this.
I didn't want to.

1309
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,000
I would never want to do this.

1310
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,170
You're pathetic, Josie.

1311
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,290
Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1312
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,540
All right, look.

1313
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,920
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1314
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,210
I just look like this.

1315
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,460
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1316
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,380
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked
y'all group

1317
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,630
and what y'all stood for.

1318
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,300
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1319
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,640
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1320
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,480
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1321
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,850
Is this about the time I said

1322
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,990
Amelia Earhart
was a fake hero?

1323
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,400
Because it's true.

1324
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,650
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1325
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:17,840
but you never hear about them.

1326
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,070
And then it's like,

1327
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,450
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

1328
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,120
"We, like, make less money."

1329
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,160
"We had to lose
our last names."

1330
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,620
"I love you."

1331
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,580
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1332
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,210
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1333
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:34,500
And all of a sudden,

1334
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,380
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1335
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,260
and suddenly,
the fucking kitchen
is lime green.

1336
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,720
I think...

1337
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,220
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1338
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,720
Oh, you look confused,
like how I'm confused
right now,

1339
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,470
on how you created
a fucking fight club
to get some cooch.

1340
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,730
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1341
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,690
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1342
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,940
you know what
I'm talking about?

1343
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,190
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1344
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,150
of that neck
and all type of--

1345
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,110
Sorry, I just don't know
if you're supposed
to be talking to us like that.

1346
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,700
Just, like, as a teacher...

1347
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,370
Man, I knew women were evil.

1348
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,470
Motherfuckers always
tellin' me like,
"No, that's not true."

1349
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,510
But time and time again...

1350
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,050
Women ain't nothing
but the fuckin' devil.

1351
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,340
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1352
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,610
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1353
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:30,470
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1354
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:33,810
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1355
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,110
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1356
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,650
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1357
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,360
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1358
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,150
and then he wouldn't be
so upset

1359
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,490
and then whatever the fuck
just happened
would not have happened.

1360
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,530
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1361
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,120
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1362
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,180
Well, I mean, yeah,
it was your idea
to start the whole club.

1363
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,880
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1364
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,960
You know that.

1365
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,050
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1366
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,880
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1367
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,640
about girls betting on you
to fight other girls
with shivs.

1368
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,520
You're just mad
because I did this.

1369
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,600
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1370
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,060
Without you.

1371
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,810
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1372
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,360
ever.

1373
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,030
I'm the one who made it
happen for you.

1374
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:26,030
You know what's so funny
about this whole
fucking thing,

1375
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,360
all your little schemes,

1376
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,410
all your,
"Oh, we'll have our year

1377
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,700
and we'll fuck
so many girls,"
and whatever?

1378
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,170
Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1379
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,540
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1380
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,210
Yeah, no, shit,
she's straight.

1381
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:43,760
Does it even matter?

1382
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,970
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1383
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,430
Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

1384
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,850
Just find some other girl

1385
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,160
to fucking jack off to
and do nothing about.

1386
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,410
Cool. Yeah, I will.

01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,750

Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1435
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,240
Hey, Rhodes.

1436
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:52,750
Do you have a minute to talk?

1437
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,450
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1438
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:57,300
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1439
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,450
Like, for advice?

1440
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,450
I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

1441
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,710
You're too old for this shit.

1442
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,170
Girl, when I was
in high school,

1443
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,840
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1444
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,130
And back then it was worse

1445
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,010
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1446
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,130
Not for being
gay and untalented.

1447
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,010
Mmm.

1448
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:18,890
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1449
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,990
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1450
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,850
And I used to say,

1451
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,230
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1452
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:25,640
Look, that's not the point.

1453
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,730
You want some advice?

1454
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,610
Invest in yourself,

1455
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,400
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1456
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,570
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1457
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,900
I just, um...

1458
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,240
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1459
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,660
So, like...

1460
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,410
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1461
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,620
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1462
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,040
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1463
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,850
it's just gotten more sad.

1464
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,670
Okay, um...

1465
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,550
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1466
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,550
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1467
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:56,720
I wouldn't do that.

1468
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,890
Why not?

1469
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,930
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1470
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,060
Well, I'm guessing
they've been fucking people up
for the past month, right?

1471
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,640
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1472
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,100
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1473
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,080
I don't know. Football?

1474
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,150
Game? Tackle?

1475
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:13,380
Oh, girl.

1476
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,950
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1477
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,050
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1478
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,910
How you don't know--

1479
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:24,750
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1480
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,920
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1481
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:31,040
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1482
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,420
It's called quartering.

1483
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,960
I know... I know
what it's called.

1484
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,090
So, tonight,
I'm stayin' inside

1485
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,630
and double boltin'
those doors.

1486
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,600
If you ever grab a--
Nah, I don't care.

1487
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,730
I didn't understand a word
of that, I'm so sorry.

01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,010
Oh, my God.

1493
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,180
- Hey.
- How did you find me?

1494
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,050
Why are you breathing
so heavy?

1495
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,640
Okay. I know we're not
in a great place right now--

1496
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,020
Yeah, because I'm pissed.
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1497
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,400
Okay, well, I just still think
we need to talk

1498
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,310
about everything
that's, like, going on.

1499
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,520
Yeah, cool, well,
I don't wanna hear it, so...

1500
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,610
Okay, maybe you
should reconsider

1501
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,200
because I saw Rhodes,
she says hi, by the way.

1502
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,570
She said
this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

1503
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,370
Apparently,
every time Huntington
plays Rockbridge,

1504
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:47,580
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

1505
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,870
The pets?

1506
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,870
It's bloodlust, man.
That's not the point.

1507
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,120
Sounds like I should get

1508
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,210
- the fuck out
of here now. Okay?
- No.

1509
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:54,670
PJ, seriously, come on.

1510
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,130
We need to get
the club back together,

1511
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,800
so we can save them.

1512
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,980
What?

1513
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,430
Sorry, you're saying
you want me and then you

1514
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,970
and then all of the girls
that fuckin' hate us

1515
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,180
to get together and save
some fucking football player,

1516
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,600
who we hate?

1517
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,310
Circle of bad vibes.

1518
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,940
Okay, well, obviously,
why would you
lay it out like that?

1519
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,110
Because it sounds insane.

1520
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,980
'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1521
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,210
Because we made
these girls trust us
and then we humiliated them.

1522
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,740
They deserve a shot
at showing everybody

1523
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,370
what they know,
what they learned,

1524
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,930
how fucking cool they are.

1525
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,760
Let's do this for the club.

1526
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,100
What do you say?

1527
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:37,290
Can we save the damn day?

1528
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,550
Wow.

1529
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,670
Pulling out the necklace

1530
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,780
- in the final fuckin' hour.
- Well...

1531
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Yeah.

1532
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,520
Mmm. Nice.

1533
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,900
Rockbridge,
this is the most
important day of your life.

1534
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,980
{\i1}Forget your wedding,
forget your funeral,

1535
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,730
{\i1}fuck your bar mitzvah.

1536
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,650
{\i1}This is what matters.

1537
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,610
{\i1}Gameday, let's do this!

1538
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:08,970
{\i1}- Let's go, Vikings!
- We're almost there.

1539
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:15,250
Okay, first off,
PJ has something
to say to Hazel, so...

1540
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,090
The apology. Do the apology.
Do the apology, instead.

1541
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,710
Okay.

1542
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:22,310
I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

1543
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,090
And I'm sorry

1544
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:30,970
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

1545
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,890
in front of all
of your friends.

1546
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,580
And I'm sorry
for being an asshole
a lot of the time.

1547
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,480
Most of the--
All of the time.

1548
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,990
And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

1549
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:48,420
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1550
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,800
and I really appreciate it.

1551
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,390
Do you forgive me?

1552
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,460
Yes.

1553
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,050
I don't want
to interrupt this
gorgeous moment

1554
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,840
but we don't have time now

1555
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,470
because I got information from
a very confidential source

1556
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,140
that Huntington
is trying to kill

1557
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,510
someone on this team tonight.

1558
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,600
What are you even
talking about, Josie?

1559
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,970
Nobody's even over there.

1560
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,890
Oh, my God,
nobody is even over there.

1561
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,640
Well, that is obviously
a red flag.

1562
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,060
Are we not reading that
as a red flag? That's crazy.

1563
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,190
- What?
- Please, Annie.

1564
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,730
Even though
you're a Black Republican,

1565
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:25,070
you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

1566
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,070
I mean, obviously I know that.
You think I don't know that?

1567
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,070
Then help us
figure this out.

1568
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:31,740
We need to stop the game.
We need to save them.

1569
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:34,140
Wait, wait, hang on.
Hazel...

1570
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,010
we need a distraction.

1571
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,500
Oh, now you want a bomb.

1578
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,220
I know you really must
hate me right now,

1579
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,730
but the club needs you.

1580
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,980
To what? Have sex with them?

1581
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,270
Guys, we really,
really need you. We do.

1582
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,070
In your fucking dreams, PJ.

1583
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,830
Which you don't deserve
to have.

1584
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,320
When you sleep,

1585
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,280
- it should be, like... Total darkness.
- Rockbridge,
are you ready?

1586
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,200
- Oh, fuck.
- Wow, okay.

1587
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,280
Okay, wait, seriously,

1588
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,790
maybe if you
just listened to us.

1589
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,410
- Just listen to us. Whoa!
- Brittany.

1590
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,040
{\i1}- Here comes your team!
- Isabel.

1591
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,170
I wouldn't be asking you
if this wasn't important!

1592
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,630
We don't have time
for this.

1593
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,380
- Josie, come on.
- Hazel!

1594
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,710
{\i1}- Okay, now that you're all...
- Ugh. Uh...

1595
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,050
{\i1}...warmed up,
I want you guys...

1596
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,420
Is it the red wire?

1597
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,800
Shit, or is it the yellow?

1598
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,260
{\i1}...Shawshank your way out.

1599
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,510
{\i1}- Put your hands together...
- You got this, Jeff.

1600
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:34,760
{\i1}- ...and shake your tanks.
- You got it!

1601
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,990
Hazel! It's starting!

1602
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,890
Jeff!

1603
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,110
Jeff! Eat my pussy!

1604
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,310
Come on, come on!

1605
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,070
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

1606
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,440
- Hurry, Hazel!
- It's gonna blow.

1607
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,410
{\an8}- Hazel, come on!
- Hazel!

1608
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:53,870
Hazel, come on!

1609
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,000
- Hazel, it's not working.
- Hazel, it's not going.

1610
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,460
- Oh, no.
- Fuck. Fucking...

1611
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:03,750
- Maybe turn it off...
- Maybe hit it?

1612
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,840
No. Give me space. Stop.

1613
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,270
Turn it off
and then back on.

1614
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,690
Jeff!

1615
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,840
I want you to rub
Vicks VapoRub on your tanks

1616
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,220
{\i1}and dance around
like the fruitbats
that you are!

1617
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:20,350
Okay, plan B. We need to get
the cheerleaders to make out.

1618
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:21,980
Wait, okay, which cheerleaders
do you think?

1619
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,520
It's a distraction.
We need a distraction.

1620
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,820
- Guys.
- Hey, guys.

1621
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,110
Guys, kiss each other.

1622
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,370
Make out.
Make out with each other!

1623
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,590
We need
to delay the game.

1624
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:41,180
Guys! Make out
with each other!

1625
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,880
Everyone,
get your guns out,
hide your children

1626
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,690
{\i1}because here comes Huntington.

1627
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,470
- Fuck you! Bitch!
- What the frick is up?

1628
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:02,350
- Yeah! Get back!
- Yeah! Wake up, pussy!

1629
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,980
Hold me back!

1630
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,100
You're so lucky!
You're so fucking lucky.

1631
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,610
Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!

1632
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:09,790
What do we do?

1633
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,740
Look, look, look.

1634
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,190
Oh, wait. I'm gay.

1635
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,190
Okay, yeah, I'm not.

1636
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,260
I just like gay porn.

1637
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,070
This is nothing
like porn at all.

1638
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,160
Wait.

1639
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,900
Is porn even real?

1640
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:03,290
Can we cut the gay shit
and get this show on the road?

1641
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:08,500
I came here for some good
man-on-man grappling
and slapping football!

1642
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,210
Can everybody
stop looking
at the dyke parade?

1643
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:16,090
{\i1}Who do I have to blow
to get this game
started already?

1644
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,550
- Yes!
- - Now make 'em eat a bag of urine cakes.

1645
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,180
Look, I found empty
barrels of pineapple juice.

1646
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,310
There is pineapple here.

1647
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:26,160
So, they're gonna
poison Jeff then.

1648
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,480
Where the fuck is it?

1649
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,110
Fuck, I'm thinking
really quick.

1650
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,860
What if it's in their mouths
and they're swishing it around

1651
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,940
and then they're gonna
spit it out mid-game?

1652
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,400
- What?
- I hate to say it,

1653
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,900
but it might have something
to do with their semen.

1654
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,450
Obviously, it does not.
What is wrong with you?

1655
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:40,950
They kissed on the mouth.

1656
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,330
- With tongue.
- As a distraction,

1657
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,000
and we can do it again
if people are asking.

1658
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,000
- Wait, when was this?
- The bomb didn't work,

1659
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,580
and there was no
other distractions!

1660
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,080
- Yeah, there was...
- And because we were...

1661
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,000
- They're gonna spray the field.
- What?

1662
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,880
- Okay, we're gonna have to run.
- - No!

1663
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,090
- We're gonna have to run.
We're gonna have to run.
- We can't run. No!

1664
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,300
No!

1665
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,880
- Oh, my asthma.
- No, please!

1666
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,970
You don't have asthma.

1667
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:02,890
I feel like I have asthma now!

1668
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,600
PJ!
Cover the sprinklers.

1669
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,740
I got it.

1670
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,540
Oh, fuck!

1671
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,570
Get back here,
you fuckin' weasel!

1672
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,710
I'm sorry.

1673
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,270
You saved me.

1674
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,560
You're... you're welcome?

1675
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,980
Oh, no.

1676
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,780
- I... Would...
- Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh.

1677
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:49,990
Are you okay?

1678
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,820
Yeah.

1679
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:53,980
- Whoa.
- Hazel!

1680
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,640
- Hazel! Hazel! Look out!
- Hey.

1681
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,050
It's pineapple juice!

1682
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,630
It's pineapple juice!

1683
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:29,010
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- 'Scuse me.

1684
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,140
Turn it off!
Please just turn it off!

1685
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:46,380
Yes.

1686
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,780
Yes!

1687
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,240
Yes, this is the Viking way!

1688
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,260
Yes, thank you,
thank you.

1689
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,180
You did it.

1690
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,960
You fucking saved me.

1691
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,270
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1692
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,310
Thanks.

1693
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,140
- What is...
- I mean...

1694
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,350
- Okay.
- I guess we did it.

1695
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:20,940
We did that shit!

1696
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,020
I mean...

1697
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,160
Really proud of you.

1698
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,080
I'm proud of us.

1699
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,380
I do wanna say, um,

1700
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,450
I feel like
you killed that guy.

1701
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,120
Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed--

1702
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,200
I think we killed...

1703
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,160
- You killed that guy...
- No.

1704
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,920
- Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.
- No. Oh, my God.

1705
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,600
Yeah, we killed a couple.
We killed...

1706
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,460
we killed a lot of guys.

1707
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,050
I-- Let's just--
We'll process it later.

1708
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,170
- Much later.
- Later.

1709
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,780
- Yeah.
- Um...

1710
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:52,940
Do you wanna...

1711
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,240
Yeah.

1712
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,860
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1713
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,440
You don't have to forgive me
at all or anything.

1714
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,110
But I, like, really want
you to know
how sorry I am.

1715
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:13,320
I was kind of insane,

1716
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,700
and the sheer amount
of lies I told is...

1717
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,410
is shocking,

1718
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:20,010
and it doesn't excuse
what I did.

1719
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,850
But I really liked
getting to know you.

1720
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,210
And I still really like you.

1721
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,400
- I just...
- You know, you didn't have
to start, like, a whole

1722
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,070
fight club just to date me.

1723
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:38,890
You could have just,
like, talked to me.

1724
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,430
Oh. Okay, uh,
I don't really know

1725
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,150
how true that is.
