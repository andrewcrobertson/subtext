Right?

9
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:41,984
I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited to be here.
It's been a while.

10
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:42,885
You know, for a long time,

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,119
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.

12
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:45,888
Disney bought Fox,

13
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,957
there was a whole boring rights issue,

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:48,759
blabbity-blabbity-blah.

15
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:51,322
But then, it turned out, they wanted me.

16
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,733
The one guy who shouldn't
even have his own movie,

17
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:56,096
much less a franchise.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,132
Marvel's so stupid.

19
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,102
Look, we know the title of this thing.

20
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,170
So, I know what you're wondering.

21
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,038
How are we gonna do this

22
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:07,845
without dishonoring Logan's memory?

23
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,936
And I'll tell you how.

24
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,134
We're not.

25
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,116
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,611
Wolverine is not dead.

27
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:20,726
Sure, it made for a perfect
ending to a very sad story.

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,484
But that's not how

29
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:23,586
regenerative healing factors work.

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,795
You think I wanna be out here

31
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,621
in beautiful downtown North Dakota,

32
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:30,032
digging up the one and only
Wolverine? No, thank you.

33
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,804
But the fate of
my entire world is at stake.

34
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,630
He may not be living his best life,

35
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:37,017
but he sure as hell ain't

36
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,427
dead.

37
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,367
Bingo.

38
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:47,204
Yahtzee.

39
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,342
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

40
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,894
Damn it!

41
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,746
Son of a bitch!

42
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,088
You...

43
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,037
Christ. Motherfucker!

44
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,875
My world is fuck...

45
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,076
That was weird.

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
I'm much calmer now.

47
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,443
Look, I'm not a man of science.

48
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:22,976
But you seem incredibly passed away.

49
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:26,857
But it's good to see ya.

50
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,796
I gotta be honest,
I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.

51
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,719
You and me getting into it.

52
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,691
Deadpool and Wolverine
just fuckin' shit up.

53
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:39,596
Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,036
the residuals?

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,169
"G'day, mate."

56
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,436
"There's nothing that'll
bring me back to life faster"

57
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,075
"than a big bag of Marvel cash."

58
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,706
Me too, Hugh.

59
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,081
But, no. No, no, no.

60
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:57,713
You had to get all noble and die for real.

61
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:00,046
Goddamn it!

62
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,885
I could really use your help right now.

63
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:15,840
Wait!

64
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,942
I'm warning you, I'm not alone.

65
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,536
Wade Winston Wilson,

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,639
you are under arrest by
the Time Variance Authority...

67
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:23,507
Oof.

68
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,771
...for too many crimes to list.

69
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:25,897
Come out...

70
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,361
...and we'll extend you the courtesy

71
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:30,020
- of taking you in one piece.
- Death by day-player.

72
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,119
Last chance.

73
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:31,889
Throw out your weapons

74
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:34,023
and come out peacefully.

75
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,158
I'm not gonna give you my weapons,

76
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,753
but I promise not to use them.

77
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,239
There are two hundred and six
bones in the human body.

78
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,749
Two hundred and seven

138
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:50,682
The wanton violence,
the whiff of necrophilia.

139
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:51,715
It isn't who I am.

140
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,520
It isn't who I wanna be.

141
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:54,190
Who I wanna be?

142
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,424
Well, to help you understand that,

143
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,325
I've gotta take you back.

144
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,823
A little joyride I took
through space and time,

145
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,091
to the day that changed everything.

146
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:16,443
I can't believe I'm finally here.

147
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:20,306
I've waited for this moment for so long.

148
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,847
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

149
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,881
I... I firmly believe

150
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,702
that my services could be of

151
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:29,523
great use to your organization.

152
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:30,127
Now, I know

153
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,394
I was caught smashturbating
in the lobby of Stark Tower,

154
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,298
- but I can assure you that...
- Smashturbating?

155
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,642
I'm sorry, what... what was that?

156
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,027
No, I'm sorry. That...
That's when you get those toy,

157
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,730
Hulk hands, right?

158
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:42,315
And then you just, you look
down, and you just...

159
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,900
you brace yourself,
and you ravage the midsection.

160
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,084
- Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.
- I get it. Okay, thank you.

161
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,905
- The picture's painted.
- You get the gist.

162
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,611
Uh, what exactly brings you here today?

163
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:55,076
Why am I... Wow. Okay. Uh...

164
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,977
I... I care.

165
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,104
I know I turn everything
into a joke, but I...

166
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:04,845
I care, and I wanna use that feeling...

167
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,774
for something important.

168
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,584
I... I wanna matter.

169
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:14,085
I need to show my girl that I matter.

170
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,931
And...

171
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,538
You know, I feel like I'm wasting

172
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,274
the good stuff here.

173
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,969
Is the man not gonna be joining us?

174
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:20,738
- The man?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:22,575
I should save this if he's gonna...

176
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,183
Uh, as far as you're concerned
right now, I'm the man.

177
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:26,546
- No.
- The man is me.

178
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,814
I am the man in this circumstance.

179
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,012
- Mm.
- He doesn't do

180
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,718
this kind of thing anymore.

181
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:33,487
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

182
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,622
- Meetings.
- Entry-level meetings.

183
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:36,226
Entry-level?

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,986
Aren't you the chauffeur...

185
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,396
- maybe?
- I... Common misconception.

186
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,991
- Okay.
- I did begin my career

187
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:43,563
as Mr. Stark's driver.

188
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:44,787
- Okay.
- Quickly pivoted to...

189
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,331
- Chauffeur.
- ...the Head of Security.

190
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,096
The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,933
And why I am vetting your resume.

192
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,475
You seem to have left out
whether or not you had

193
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,609
any experience as a member of a team.

194
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,345
Could you maybe add

195
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,729
a little bit of perspective there?

196
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:00,075
Oh. No, yes, of course.
I was Special Forces...

197
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,428
- Okay.
- ...but I was...

198
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:02,572
Mainly, I was team leader...

199
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:03,716
founder, really, of X-Force.

200
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,916
Sadly, they... they all
perished in action though.

201
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,220
Oh. How exactly did that happen?

202
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:09,050
Well, the police say gravity, but if...

203
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,020
Just between us, they didn't test well

204
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,774
- in the focus group.
- I see.

205
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,529
- Particularly Cable.
- X-Force.

206
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:15,232
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

207
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:16,776
Look, I can see this isn't going well.

208
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,557
Please stop writing. Look, I... I...

209
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:20,723
I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.

210
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,122
I wanna be an Avenger.

211
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:26,738
Why do you wanna be an Avenger?

212
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,510
Look around you. I mean, they're the...

213
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,341
they're the best of the best.

214
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,173
And... And what they do matters.

215
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,075
I need to be an Avenger.

216
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,914
Sir, my girl has kinda had it
with my shtick,

217
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:37,815
and I... if I don't, you know,

218
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,367
turn things around and
do something with my "gifts,"

219
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,920
I don't think it's gonna
really work out for me,

220
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:44,954
and I wouldn't blame her.

221
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:49,861
Avengers are a very unique
group of superheroes

222
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:50,597
that stand for something

223
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,732
more than just fighting
and wearing costumes.

224
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:56,868
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

225
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:57,868
- They...
- I'm sorry. "Us"?

226
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:00,674
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

227
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:01,938
Avengers-adjacent, technically.

228
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,242
Oh, wow. What's your superpower?

229
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:06,251
Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.

230
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:06,844
That was cruel.

231
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:09,683
I lash out when I'm nervous.
Won't happen again.

232
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,146
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

233
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,388
You just said moments ago

234
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,854
that you wanted to be
an Avenger because

235
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,020
you need it.

236
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,185
Yes, sir, I do.

237
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,990
But the Avengers don't do the job

238
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,056
because they need it.

239
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,325
They do the job
because people need them.

240
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:27,020
Do you see the distinction?

241
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,221
Yes, sir.

242
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,506
Please, Mr. Hogan.

243
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,090
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life

244
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:36,248
like an annoying one-trick pony.

245
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,943
All right.

246
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,549
Oh, my God, you're standing.

247
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,717
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

248
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,178
Damn it.

249
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:46,015
Now, the problem might be that you're

250
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,852
reaching a little... little too high.

251
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,592
Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.

252
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,056
Right? I think you got a good heart.

253
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,561
I believe what you're saying.

254
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,696
But not everybody's
the world-saving type.

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,033
I'm not, and I'm happy.

256
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,394
Right? I found my place.

257
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,636
Find your place.

258
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,671
All right? Get back out there.

259
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:06,773
- We'll keep an eye on you.
- Okay.

260
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,292
Good luck.

261
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,161
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,879
Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.

263
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,201
Rejection makes me hungy.

264
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,152
- No, no. Please.
- No?

265
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,852
- Yeah, no, no, no.
- Okay.

266
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,679
Okay, thank you.

267
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,527
You know what they say.

268
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,816
When one door closes,

269
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,499
your locker at work opens.

270
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,141
Now let's go sell some certified

271
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,831
pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...

272
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,002
Technically, the...
the Carnival's not a minivan.

273
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,210
It's an MPV.

274
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:51,818
So how does the Kia compare
to the Honda Odyssey?

275
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:53,322
The Odyssey? That's a great question.

276
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,150
Um, it doesn't fucking suck.

277
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,692
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

278
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,662
I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't...
I don't have kids.

279
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,164
Not that I haven't dreamt of that,

280
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,690
but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

281
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:09,024
You'll get 'em next time, pal.

282
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,132
- Yeah.
- And look,

283
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,716
you can always go back
to superhero-ing.

284
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,274
I mean, I know I'd like
to see you back in the suit.

285
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,908
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

286
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:19,846
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to saddle up again.

287
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,718
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that doing in there?

288
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,336
I'm done.

289
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,051
I'm done.

290
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,103
And I'm fine with being done.

291
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,155
Look, is sales the best match?

292
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:32,792
Probably not.

293
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,731
Is this the life that I always
imagined for myself? Fuck no.

294
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,504
But this is the right fit
for me, Sugar Bear, it is.

295
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,867
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

296
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,688
I'm just saying, once a month,

297
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,508
we could go on a little mission.

298
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,677
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

299
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,974
After all, we're Deadpool.

300
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,912
Please stop saying that.
We're not Deadpool.

301
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,781
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

302
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:58,082
Well, if you're gonna have
a midlife crisis, go big.

303
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,753
A few years ago, a friend of mine

304
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,806
got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain

305
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,882
that goes down and attaches
to his Van Johnson.

306
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,766
Are... Are you feeling grumplestiltskin

307
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,989
'cause it's your birthday?

308
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:16,761
What?

309
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,422
No.

310
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,666
No.

311
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,526
Surprise!

312
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,399
Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.

313
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,178
Get in here.

314
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:31,687
If this were six years ago,
you'd all be dead.

315
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,623
So then, he gets out of the cab,

316
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,623
and you will not believe it.

317
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,504
I turn around, and what do I find?

318
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,386
- AirPods. His AirPods.
- His AirPods!

319
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,320
- Come on.
- Crazy story.

320
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:43,216
- Every time. Come on.
- Every single time.

321
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,816
Make any sales today?

322
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,064
You know I didn't.

323
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,968
Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy

324
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,573
or whatever it is that you do?

325
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,543
Our rent's due in three days, Wade.

326
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,857
I can't keep carrying you.

327
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,171
Relax. I have the money.

328
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:58,109
I sold some old
blood pressure medication

329
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,043
I found lying around.

330
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,649
You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?

331
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,553
I'm not the one
dousing everything in salt,

332
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:05,182
- motherfucker.
- I pray every day

333
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,985
that fire finds your body

334
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:09,004
and finishes the job God didn't have

335
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,948
- the nuts to do.
- That's hurtful.

336
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:12,893
If you could hear the look on my face,

337
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,361
you'd smell how sad I am.

338
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,096
You watched anything good?

339
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,832
Great British Bake Off.

340
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, goddamn.

341
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,082
That show stood between me
and suicide for 10 years.

342
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:23,706
Those are my feelings on
abortion, religious freedom,

343
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,872
animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines,

344
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,655
free-market capitalism,
global climate change.

345
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,439
Yeah, duh-duh-duh.
No, no speaking lines, Buck.

346
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,661
- Hi, Yukio.
- Hi, Wade.

347
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,882
Nice fake o'clock shadow.

348
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:38,720
It's a summer balayage.
From the French.

349
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,791
It's meant to mimic
the natural highlights of the sun.

350
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,826
- It's a toupee.
- It's a hair system.

351
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,532
I love your hair system, Wade.

352
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:48,697
Thank you. Heh.

353
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,456
Wanna do some cocaine?

354
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,933
Hey, cocaine is the one thing
that Feige said is off limits.

355
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,571
What about Bolivian marching powder?

356
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,871
They know all the slang terms.
They have a list.

357
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,170
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

358
00:14:59,194 --> 00:14:59,939
White girl interrupted?

359
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,363
- Even Forrest Bump.
- Booger sugar?

360
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,867
I wouldn't even try powdered go nuts.

361
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:07,550
- Do you wanna build a snowman?
- Yes. But I can't.

362
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,586
Pull here.

363
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,643
- Here?
- Yeah.

364
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,307
- What happened?
- That's the fun part.

365
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,561
Thanks for coming.

366
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:17,594
Yeah.

367
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,628
How's work?

368
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,720
Oh, I got a promotion.

369
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:21,521
No way.

370
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,427
Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle
management, but I'm happy.

371
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,089
That's great.

372
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:30,323
- You, uh, seeing anyone?
- How about you?

373
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,642
Um... Yeah.

374
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,580
A guy from work. Dermot.

375
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:36,503
Dermot.

376
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,043
- He's kind.
- Good.

377
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,583
Likes to go hiking.

378
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,563
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

379
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,567
Well, it's the early days.

380
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,550
What about you? You seeing anyone?

381
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,154
Mm...

382
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,959
No, no, I live
in a one-bedroom apartment.

383
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:54,314
I share a bed with Blind Al.

384
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,930
Okay.

385
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,253
- All right.
- All right.

386
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,216
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

387
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,062
- Speech! Speech!
- Yes!

388
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,932
All right. Okay, okay, okay. Uh...

389
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:08,942
Birthdays.

390
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,813
Boy, every spin around the moon

391
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:11,681
is a new adventure indeed.

392
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,939
- Sun, dumb-ass.
- Okay, round-earther.

393
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,886
- Where was I?
- The adventure of life.

394
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,578
Right. Um...

395
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,316
It's been a challenging few years.

396
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,054
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

397
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,540
Been through a lot, uh, change of life.

398
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,027
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

399
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,797
- Mm-mm.
- Sorry.

400
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,701
I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.

401
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,694
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

402
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,738
But I'm happy.

403
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,962
You know, and that's... that's

404
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,324
because of each and every one of you.

405
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,519
I guess, what I'm trying to say is

406
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,714
how proud I am, how grateful I am

407
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:44,780
to be standing in a room

408
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,236
with every single person I love.

409
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,683
I'm the luckiest man alive.

410
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,288
Make a wish, buddy.

411
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:01,490
Ten-four, good buddy.

412
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,152
Going down.

413
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:09,838
Wade Wilson?

414
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,938
Oh, yeah. Dancers.

415
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,709
Dopinder must have ordered you.

416
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,009
Are those supposed
to be cop costumes?

417
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,877
Never mind.

418
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,573
Take your clothes off
but leave the helmets.

419
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:20,162
And this isn't Pretty Woman.

420
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,751
We're kissing. All right?

421
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,788
What song do you guys
normally dance to?

422
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:28,187
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

423
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,371
Is that supposed to be scary?

424
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,652
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.

425
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,104
But it is for Disney.

426
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:34,555
Ah, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!

427
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,574
Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,

428
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,755
so we're gonna take things real slow.

429
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:40,936
And I want some crazy eye contact.

430
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,595
Not you. You.

431
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,939
Can't see your eyes through the mask,
but I can feel them.

432
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,500
We're gonna move on down the hallway

433
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,635
so we can spare a cleanup
on aisle asshole.

434
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,538
How's everyone feel about this plan?

435
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:50,241
I don't like you.

436
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,574
Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.

437
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:54,808
And we're gonna do it angry.

438
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,388
Mr. Wilson...

439
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:18,105
you appear to have soiled
yourself while unconscious.

440
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:21,009
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

441
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,570
I go by the name of Paradox.

442
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:26,641
Mr. Paradox. And you're
sitting here at the TVA.

443
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:28,576
The Time Variance Authority.

444
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,611
We're really a watchdog organization,

445
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:33,549
except we're more lighthearted
than that sounds,

446
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,025
with a sort of throwback, ironic twist.

447
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,928
And we're in charge of defending

448
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,830
what's known as the Sacred Timeline.

449
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,560
Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton
of exposition for a threequel.

450
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,716
Is this because
I used Cable's time machine?

451
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,872
Brought a couple of people back to life,

452
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:49,630
then I destroyed it.

453
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,974
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes,

454
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,722
we're aware of your abuse
of your timeline.

455
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:56,632
And you were so abusive of it.

456
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:59,542
Uh, no, it has nothing to do with that.

457
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:01,204
Walk with me.

458
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:09,057
I brought you here,
Mr. Wilson, to tell you

459
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,552
that you're special.

460
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:13,963
In fact, you've been chosen
for a higher purpose,

461
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,526
a purpose unclear even to me.

462
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,263
But one that could

463
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,936
save the entire Sacred Timeline

464
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,907
from a possibly grisly fate
sometime in the future,

465
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:27,207
which may very well need to be...

466
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:28,768
avenged.

467
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,201
This Sacred Timeline,

468
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:34,148
I assume I'm going to marvel

469
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,676
at how

470
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,249
cinematic it feels?

471
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,822
Gratuitous cameos,

472
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,683
indiscriminate use of
Variants, the whole package?

473
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,543
Well, you tell me.

474
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,321
Cap!

475
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,152
You are no longer lost, Wade.

476
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:03,737
You can be a hero among heroes.

477
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,147
We've been surveilling you
for quite a while.

478
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,240
- Subway station.
- A TVA outpost, yes.

479
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:12,704
- And what is that?
- Hmm?

480
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:17,049
Is that me? Is that Thor?

481
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,055
- Is he crying?
- Uh, let's not

482
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,510
get ahead of ourselves.

483
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,101
That happens in the distant future.

484
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,691
Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.

485
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,726
Do not speak to her.
Stop that. Eyes on me.

486
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,762
I brought you here
to offer you an opportunity.

487
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,681
The opportunity you sought years ago,

488
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,601
but for which you were not ready.

489
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,832
We believe you're ready now.

490
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,873
Ready for a chance
to leave your timeline

491
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:36,913
and join the greatest universe of all.

492
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:39,444
I am about to give you the thing
you've always wanted.

493
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:41,077
Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.

494
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,711
The power in the Marvel Universe

495
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:44,769
is about to change forever.

496
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,705
I am the Messiah...

497
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,720
I am...

498
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:55,417
...Marvel Jesus.

499
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:57,561
Can you excuse me for just a moment?

500
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,883
I'm just gonna go over here.

501
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,797
Suck it, Fox!

502
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,519
I'm going to Disneyland.

503
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,264
Get fucked!

504
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:10,837
Where do I sign?

505
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,806
Oh, there's no need for paperwork.

506
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,776
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

507
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,413
Oh.

508
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:18,407
There is one thing I will need, though.

509
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:24,555
Oh, fuck off!

510
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,152
Adorn me, Beardo.

511
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,512
Fuckin' A!

512
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:50,118
Uhh! It's perfect! FYI,

513
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,090
your tailor is a predator,
but I love it. Snug.

514
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:54,782
No camel toe.

515
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:58,754
New car smell
and adamantium katanas?

516
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,409
You shouldn't have.

517
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,064
Go ahead. Take it in.

518
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:05,002
And yes, your underwear
is getting tighter.

519
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,800
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

520
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,168
His clothes says middle management,

521
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:11,536
but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.

522
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,538
Yes. You look very nice.

523
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:14,241
"Nice"?

524
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:16,475
Your buddy here is ready
to throw it all away for me.

525
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,659
- You callin' your wife?
- HR.

526
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:18,723
Does your wife work in HR?

527
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:21,513
I'm really glad you're taking this so well.

528
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,986
Oh, I'm taking it well.

529
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,649
I have never had a problem
traveling for work.

530
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:27,683
That said, we should talk vacation days.

531
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:30,489
I'm more of a one-week-on-
one-week-off kind of guy.

532
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:31,993
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

533
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,097
You know, you'll never see
a Danish flag on the moon,

534
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:35,493
but goddamn it, they're happy.

535
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:38,860
Now, let's power up your
little Amazon Fire phone there

536
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:39,662
and zip me back home

537
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,468
so I can let my friends know
that they've been upgraded

538
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:43,105
to disciples.

539
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,905
Yeah. I don't think you...
quite understand.

540
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,889
Um, you will not be returning
to your home

541
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,873
because there will be
no home to return to.

542
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:52,774
Come again?

543
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,734
This time in my ears.

544
00:22:57,803 --> 00:23:01,972
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

545
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:02,916
That

546
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,952
is what happens when a universe

547
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:06,920
loses their Anchor Being.

548
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,889
See how it decays from the inside?

549
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:11,843
- This is how a reality dies.
- What's an Anchor Being?

550
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,797
An Anchor Being is an entity
of such vital importance

551
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:15,533
that when they die,

552
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,602
their whole world slowly
withers out of existence.

553
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:21,325
You've just won the lottery
because I didn't die.

554
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,048
It was just a little midlife
crisis. I'm better now.

555
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:27,206
Oh, no, no, no.

556
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,682
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I love to laugh.

557
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:35,554
Can you imagine
if you were the Anchor Being?

558
00:23:35,578 --> 00:23:38,375
- Yeah.
- Oh!

559
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,197
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

560
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,329
Your Anchor Being died

561
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:45,233
in an act of self-sacrifice so epic

562
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,138
that it sent shivers down the Timeline.

563
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:52,165
I am referring, of course, to...

564
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:57,269
Logan. The Wolverine.

565
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:03,170
Don't be what they made you.

566
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,782
Ah, so this is what it feels like...

567
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,653
Logan.

568
00:24:18,884 --> 00:24:20,391
Of course.

569
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:22,052
Logan.

570
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,504
Logan?

571
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,407
The guy with forks for hands?

572
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,541
That Wolverine?

573
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,675
Yeah, I got it. You can turn your

574
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,118
retro graphics of death
off now. Make it stop.

575
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:35,845
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.

576
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:37,903
We certainly can't stop it.

577
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,013
How long have we got?

578
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:41,999
In most cases, couple thousand years.

579
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,246
- Well, sweet.
- Well, most cases

580
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,952
aren't fast enough. Not for me.

581
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,823
What does that mean?

582
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,693
It means that I have been tasked

583
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:52,565
with overseeing the end of your universe.

584
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:53,334
And regardless of what

585
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,667
the pencil pushers upstairs would prefer,

586
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:56,238
I will not

587
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:59,803
waste my life watching it die
slowly of natural causes.

588
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:01,920
We used to just prune
these things. Simple.

589
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,200
Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA

590
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:06,324
doesn't like to do that
anymore. Well, I do.

591
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:08,921
And no matter what
my so-called superiors say,

592
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:11,518
the multiverse does not
need a babysitter.

593
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,184
We need a mercy killer.

594
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,850
And in this instance,

595
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:18,878
I am the mercy killer. Ha!

596
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,826
What in the MacGuffin is that?

597
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,863
That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.

598
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:27,962
An accelerant.

599
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,735
Once completed,
it will allow me to destroy

600
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,138
the space time matrix of your universe.

601
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:35,542
You see, I don't want
to work for the TVA.

602
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:36,773
I want to be the TVA.

603
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:39,942
And the first step involves
showing this organization

604
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,894
how much more efficient it can become.

605
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:43,847
To wit, I will be giving your universe

606
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:45,947
a swift and compassionate end.

607
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,891
And don't worry, your friends
won't feel a thing.

608
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:51,680
It'll be over just like this.
"Oh, what's that?"

609
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,319
Trust me.

610
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,541
You're gonna Old Yeller
my fucking universe?

611
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,542
Mm... In your parlance, yes.

612
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:10,926
Two in the heart, one in the head.

613
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,743
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

614
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,811
You can either rejoin your loved ones

615
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:16,880
and collectively cease to exist in,

616
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:19,783
I'd say, 72 hours. Or...

617
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,049
you join the Sacred Timeline.

618
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:25,053
And you end your days of insignificance

619
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:27,429
and mediocrity.

620
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,759
Wade.

621
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:30,828
Wade, you can finally,

622
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:33,920
finally matter.

623
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,282
That's all I've ever really wanted.

624
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:47,098
I know.

625
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:48,449
I know.

626
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,947
And you know I'm... I'm nothing if not

627
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:53,104
morally flexible.

628
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,745
Yep, yep.

629
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,119
I'll do it.

630
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:00,054
Wise choice.

631
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,638
The Sacred Timeline's happy
to have you.

632
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,679
I was actually talking about finding

633
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,853
the Wolverine and breaking
your fucking nose.

634
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:13,073
♪ And I'd give up forever to touch you ♪

635
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:16,897
♪ 'Cause I know
that you feel me somehow ♪

636
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,844
Find him. Find him!

637
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,475
And boy, did he ever.

638
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,171
Which brings us back to this.

639
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,074
The desecration of the sacred corpse.

640
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:37,214
Oh, my God!

641
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,657
Oh! My own fucking arm!

642
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,133
Now we're talkin'!

643
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:46,805
Not like this!

644
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:48,443
No, dear God! No!

645
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!

646
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,426
Make it stop!

647
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,835
Mangold tried.

648
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,233
You sick fuck!

649
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,784
Logan was a hero.

650
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,556
And the only thing worth a shit

651
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,614
to ever come out of Canada.

652
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,963
Get my country's name

653
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:15,956
out of your fuckin' mouth.

654
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,728
And my sword. Give me that.

655
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,172
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

656
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:24,974
An alive one.

657
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:27,736
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.

658
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,076
Logan!

659
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,389
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

660
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,721
Who's asking?

661
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,701
Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.

662
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,638
Did you stick the landing, little guy?

663
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,506
Yes, you did!

664
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,541
Comic-accurate short king.

665
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,224
Such a cute wittle Wolvie.

666
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:56,907
Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.

667
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:58,910
Ahoy!

668
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:01,484
Everything seems to be on fire.

669
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:02,583
You have a dragon?

670
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,907
Ooh, you have Anchor Being
written all over...

671
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:13,562
♪ Make a one man weep,
make another man sing ♪

672
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,729
♪ Change a hawk... ♪

673
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,223
Patch!

674
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:20,427
Oh, now we're talkin'.

675
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,701
Oh, yeah.

676
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:24,992
That's the whole goddamn
package right there.

677
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:26,035
Howdy!

678
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,187
I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.

679
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:32,362
Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need
some coconut oil.

680
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:38,146
What in the fuck?

681
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,490
Are you okay?

682
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:41,116
Oh, yes, yes.

683
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,887
Classic John Byrne brown and tan.

684
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,012
Now, you fought the Hulk
in this outfit. No?

685
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,994
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,

686
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:51,018
and I will not...

687
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:04,196
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

688
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:07,483
You know, from behind,

689
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:08,907
you look a little bit like Henry...

690
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,957
Oh, my fuck!

691
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,148
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

692
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:16,724
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity,

693
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,461
this just feels right.

694
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,858
We will treat you so much better

695
00:30:19,882 --> 00:30:21,402
than those shit fucks down the street.

696
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,626
- You were just leavin'.
- No, sir.

697
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,119
Not while the fate of my universe is at...

698
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:31,838
This one looks promising.

699
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:33,698
Down you go.

700
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:35,940
Again.

701
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,438
I told you. You're not welcome here.

702
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,609
You're not welcome anywhere.

703
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,873
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

704
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:43,652
Just give me one more drink
and then I'll leave.

705
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,444
That's not how it works.

706
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,250
It does now. Leave the bottle.

707
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:49,184
I know you, bub?

708
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,571
Nope. But I know you.

709
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,982
Everybody knows me.

710
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,027
I'm the Wolverine.

711
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,731
Yes, you are.

712
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:01,121
And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

713
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,033
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

714
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:04,640
Really gettin' into your cups here.

715
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,863
Why would I go with you?

716
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,172
Because, unfortunately,

717
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:09,776
I need you,

718
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,013
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

719
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:17,401
You two gonna fuck or fight?

720
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,086
You gonna take that from him?

721
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,152
Yep.

722
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:25,452
I can tell you have a sort
of don't-get-too-close-

723
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:27,597
I'll-only-break-your-heart vibe going here,

724
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:28,564
but every other Wolverine

725
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:29,714
would've really hurt me by now.

726
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:31,058
And I'm sort of on the tick-tick.

727
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:32,800
- So, upsy-daisy. Here we go.
- Whoa, whoa.

728
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,900
- Up you go.
- Hey, hey!

729
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:35,793
I got you, big guy.

730
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,092
Oh.

731
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:39,608
Whiskey dick of the claws.

732
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,644
It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.

733
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:42,369
You don't want this.

734
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:45,043
You're right. I don't.
And you don't want this.

735
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,781
Unless you wanna take a deep breath

736
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,079
through your fuckin' forehead,

737
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:50,444
I suggest you reconsider.

738
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:52,172
Let's go, peanut.

739
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,628
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

740
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:00,180
Watch this.

741
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,160
All right. That... Whoa.

742
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,822
Easy.

743
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:08,802
Good God.

744
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,928
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?

745
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,499
It's okay. Keep goin'.

746
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:16,702
Audiences are accustomed
to long run times.

747
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,917
Guess you'll have to do.

748
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:25,678
Okay, here we...

749
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:28,657
Oh! Look at those jammies.

750
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,605
That only took 20 fucking years.

751
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:34,554
One Anchor Being coming right up!

752
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,077
On your left, baby girl.

753
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,600
This Logan has the same

754
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,817
he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.

755
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:42,034
And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

756
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:43,535
like he's not embarrassed to be

757
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,037
in a superhero movie for once.

758
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:46,532
I don't understand.

759
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:47,434
You said my universe is dying

760
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,943
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

761
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,505
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

762
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,687
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

763
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:58,819
with this?

764
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,955
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

765
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,791
But you have outdone yourself

766
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,777
and brought me the worst Wolverine!

767
00:33:05,801 --> 00:33:07,763
What do you mean, the worst one?

768
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:08,697
Mr. Wilson.

769
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,591
This Wolverine let down his entire world.

770
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,672
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

771
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:17,036
And what he did,

772
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,739
well,

773
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:21,195
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

774
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,536
Okay.

775
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,782
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

776
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,608
I gave you a chance at greatness.

777
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,447
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

778
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:34,251
Clearly not special in a good way.

779
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:35,020
Apparently you have some

780
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:37,518
important future purpose to serve.

781
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:38,662
With Thor. He holds me.

782
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,025
But I did my duty.

783
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:42,193
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

784
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:43,963
And instead of accepting my offering

785
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,033
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

786
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:47,769
It looks great.

787
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,436
And you decimated dozens of my men

788
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,102
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

789
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:53,941
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

790
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,437
What are you, the Internet?

791
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,208
Your world is dying!

792
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:58,978
Thank you very much.

793
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,103
And there's no stopping it.

794
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:04,182
The humane thing to do

795
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:04,918
is to make it quick.

796
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,218
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe

797
00:34:07,242 --> 00:34:08,235
making you peckish?

798
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,252
I'm eating my feelings.

799
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:11,436
I'm about to lose everything
that I've ever cared about

800
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,588
because that hairy thundercunt
from down undercunt

801
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:15,225
finally dies,

802
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:17,767
and he's standing
right behind me, isn't he?

803
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,768
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

804
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,886
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

805
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,676
As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

806
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,589
I want you to get him on the phone

807
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,501
and you tell him, her, or them,

808
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,836
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

809
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,115
Holy shit.

810
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,721
I just heard a symphony

811
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,186
of butt holes clenching all at once.

812
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:41,790
You're off grid.

813
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,650
Your bosses don't know
what you sick fucks

814
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:44,617
are doing down here.

815
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:45,552
Well, I'll tell you what.

816
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,764
I have a black belt in Karen...

817
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:48,687
And I'm gonna go upstairs

818
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,131
and I'm gonna tell 'em
all about you and your...

819
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,034
Oh, silence is nice, isn't it?

820
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:54,869
Where the fuck did he go?

821
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,555
To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.

822
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,138
Whew.

823
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,395
That was close.

824
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,131
Don't just stand there, you ape.

825
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,769
Give me a hand up.

826
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,430
Nope. I'm actually okay.

827
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:31,940
Thank you very much.

828
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,039
Where the hell are we?

829
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,537
I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.

830
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:38,111
But that would be IP infringement, right?

831
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:39,135
Fucking jokes.

832
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:43,852
Fuck! Fuck.

833
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:45,276
Were you even listening back there?

834
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,517
If we don't make it back
to that Mr. Paradox asshole,

835
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,057
everyone I know is gonna die.

836
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,740
Not my fuckin' problem.

837
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:53,422
Oh, is that all you got?

838
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:56,800
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

839
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,115
Come again?

840
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:01,356
Yeah, I heard all about you.

841
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,598
How you screwed up everything.

842
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,433
You should be thankin' me

843
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,787
for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.

844
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,165
You back-stabbing son of a bitch!

845
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,804
Are you ready to be calm now?

846
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:25,015
Rest in pieces, Fox.

847
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:43,001
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

848
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,770
Doesn't matter what you did.

849
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:47,434
I just need your help.

850
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:50,371
I don't fuckin' care.

851
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,977
Uh... Uh-oh.

852
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:01,646
Fuck. This is gonna hurt.

853
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,396
All right.

854
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,727
Fuck it.

855
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:10,648
Let's give the people what they came for.

856
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:13,569
Let's fuckin' go.

857
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:16,044
Get your special sock out, nerds.

858
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,795
It's gonna get good.

Let's see you grow

870
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:25,805
your fuckin' head back.

871
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,396
Wait, wait, wait! I can fix it! I can fix it.

872
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,987
- Fix what?
- Whatever it is that you did.

873
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:33,088
Whatever made you so bad.

874
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:34,088
Those... Those

875
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,520
pricks in the TVA. You heard him.

876
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:39,104
They have the power to end my universe,

877
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:43,326
but they also have
the power to change yours.

878
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:47,597
We get back there,
and we can fix your world.

879
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:49,292
Together.

880
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,822
I promise.

881
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,429
They can fix it.

882
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,011
Hey!

883
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,760
We fight each other, we lose.

884
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:59,669
Dear God, it's him.

885
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,577
- Who?
- The one.

886
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,515
The superhero equivalent
to comfort food, or Molly.

887
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,716
White guys' answer
to all the disappointments.

888
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,783
And another A-lister.

889
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:09,849
Fair warning, gorgeous.

890
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:12,423
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language,

891
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,998
a smidge of ass play,
but we've been prohibited

892
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,526
from using cocaine. On camera.

893
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,470
- They're coming.
- Who's "they"?

894
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,199
Oh, they're driving angry.

895
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,689
Now that's a superhero landing.

896
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,544
I got this.

897
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,446
Stay close.

898
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,406
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

899
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:12,903
You got this.

900
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:18,711
Cassandra is gonna be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

901
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:19,919
You can't run.

902
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:20,854
Everybody knows that.

903
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,175
You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?

904
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,496
You're not gonna love
what happens next.

905
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,862
Oh. Oh, my God.

906
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,535
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.

907
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,767
- Ah! Fuck.
- Ha!

908
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:32,998
Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!

909
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:35,105
- Say what?
- Avengers, assemble...

910
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:37,235
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

911
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,103
Ohh!

912
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,500
Fuck!

913
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:02,920
Ahhh!

914
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,638
- We don't know that guy.
- We thought we did.

915
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:09,111
I know you.

916
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:12,336
Holy sh...

917
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:15,178
Sabretooth.

918
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:16,670
Your brother.

919
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:17,911
Ready to die?

920
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:21,784
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Time!

921
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:22,982
You look ridiculous.

922
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:25,755
People have waited decades
for this fight.

923
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:27,757
It's not gonna be easy. Baby Knife.

924
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:29,759
Shoot the double, you take him down.

925
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:32,058
Side control, then full mount,

926
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:32,992
and you ground and pound

927
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:34,945
till he makes no sound
because he's dead.

928
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:36,898
- Shut the fuck up!
- Oh, my God!

929
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:39,660
Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.

930
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:52,583
What is it, girl?

931
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:55,808
Is there trouble at the well?

932
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:01,890
Big trouble.

933
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:03,055
Behold!

934
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,829
The head of your precious queen,

935
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:08,260
Furiosa!

936
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:11,283
I have the Wolverine!

937
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:13,709
I alone control her!

938
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:16,495
You come for me,

939
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,304
you come for her.

940
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:21,964
So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."

941
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:24,187
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

942
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,517
Who's next?

943
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,849
Toad!

944
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:28,676
You're up.

945
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,890
Uh-oh.

946
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,685
- Oh, holy sh...
- Fuck.

947
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,929
God of Thunder.

948
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,476
How long was I asleep?

949
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,944
Not all of you was asleep.

950
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:58,881
Don't bother.

951
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:00,816
They're very thorough.

952
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,051
If you know where we are, start talking.

953
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:05,656
You're in The Void.

954
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,493
Think of it as purgatory.

955
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:10,090
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.

956
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:11,464
Where anything useless goes

957
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,466
before it gets annihilated forever.

958
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,602
And where the TVA sends
people that don't play nice

959
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,032
with the rest of the multiverse.

960
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:19,439
- Like you?
- And you.

961
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,036
What does the annihilating?

962
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,607
Alioth.

963
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:24,307
Alioth is in this thing?

964
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:26,006
From Loki, Season 1, Episode 5?

965
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,175
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.

966
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,714
Most don't make it.

967
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,485
There's a resistance, though.

968
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,588
Other people like us
that managed to survive.

969
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:37,738
They're hidin' out in the borderlands,

970
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:39,889
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.

971
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:41,440
Then that's where we go.

972
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:43,684
"We"? Us? A team?

973
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,928
The answer is yes. Shake on it.

974
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:46,697
Fuck! You nicked it.

975
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:49,084
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

976
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,472
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

977
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,112
Make 'em fix things.

978
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:55,805
Something funny, bub?

979
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:58,171
She might have somethin'
to say about that.

980
00:43:58,195 --> 00:43:59,998
Who's "she"?

981
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:01,646
In The Void,

982
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,177
you're either food for Alioth

983
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,036
or you work for her.

984
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:20,505
Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.

985
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:22,733
Oh, you must be this year's Juggernaut.

986
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:24,961
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

987
00:45:24,985 --> 00:45:26,501
She don't like the chatter.

988
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:28,427
She's gonna love you.

989
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:45,487
Is it... Is that Charles?

990
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,918
Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

991
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:49,425
That's not Chuck.

992
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,142
Ah, shit.

993
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:52,691
Oh, ableism. Great.

994
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:55,992
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

995
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,597
A Wolverine.

996
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,964
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

997
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:01,766
You're one of Xavier's.

998
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,066
You-You know him? You know Chuck?

999
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,237
Oh, I knew him.

1000
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,408
We shared a womb.

1001
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:09,071
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow

1002
00:46:09,095 --> 00:46:09,807
with my umbilical cord.

1003
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:13,878
Amen. I've never
loved roommates. Mine's blind.

1004
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:15,715
Except she can see cocaine.

1005
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,517
For some... reason.

1006
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:20,489
You want to chime in,
Your Majesty? I'm dying here.

1007
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:21,082
Who are you?

1008
00:46:21,106 --> 00:46:23,552
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

1009
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:26,022
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

1010
00:46:26,046 --> 00:46:28,463
Hmm. You two are cute.

1011
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:31,050
I have a good feeling about this.

1012
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:35,047
And I've been trying to catch

1013
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:37,066
this little firefly for years.

1014
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,132
Haven't I, Johnny?

1015
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:41,675
Aw... You picked the wrong
time to make new friends.

1016
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,743
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

1017
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,811
- Maybe shut up now.
- Yeah, maybe don't...

1018
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:47,208
We're just talkin' here.

1019
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:47,944
Yeah, Johnny told us

1020
00:46:47,968 --> 00:46:49,781
you're a psychotic
megalomaniacal asshole.

1021
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:54,909
His words, not mine.
Hellbent on domination and pain.

1022
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:56,822
You said all that about me?

1023
00:46:56,846 --> 00:46:57,822
No! No! I don't...

1024
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:01,410
- I didn't say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

1025
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:03,927
Don't let her intimidate you.

1026
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,797
It's like you said in the convoy.

1027
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:07,667
This finger-lickin' dead-inside

1028
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,671
pixie slab of third rate
dime-store nut-milk

1029
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,656
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring

1030
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,617
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

1031
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,577
Okay. I have never said
any of those words

1032
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,042
- in my entire life!
- Ha! The modesty.

1033
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:21,517
People think I'm a shit talker.

1034
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,484
But this guy...

1035
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:23,931
Next level.

1036
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:25,377
What? This... I... We...

1037
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:27,115
I don't even know
what half of that means!

1038
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,854
- This... I...
- My hat's off to you, sir.

1039
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:29,722
- Truly.
- What? This...

1040
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,121
I didn't... He's... That's... I...

1041
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:33,408
I... I don't...

1042
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:39,733
Not my favorite Chris.

1043
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:40,964
You stupid piece of shit.

1044
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:42,301
You just got him fucking killed!

1045
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:43,637
Hey! We're all grieving!

1046
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,730
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

1047
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:51,139
Alioth is hungry.

1048
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,977
There's been some kind of mistake.

1049
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:54,846
Big yellow is a back-up Anchor Being,

1050
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,916
and I'm Marvel Jesus.
MJ, if you're nasty.

1051
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,751
This may be hard to hear,

1052
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,352
but there's another British villain

1053
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:01,953
who's gonna destroy my universe,

1054
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:02,722
and I'm gonna stop him.

1055
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,560
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me

1056
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:06,947
as the world-saving type.

1057
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,993
Did I hit a nerve?

1058
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,898
I didn't want it to come to this.

1059
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:13,601
Either you help us

1060
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,383
or my friend here is gonna sing

1061
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:17,166
the entire second act of Music Man

1062
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,969
with zero warm-up.

1063
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:20,033
Where'd you get the chair?

1064
00:48:20,057 --> 00:48:21,104
Well, once in a while,

1065
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:23,502
I do get a Charles through here.

1066
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,777
Never mine, though.

1067
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,582
No. He didn't care to find me.

1068
00:48:27,606 --> 00:48:30,981
Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!

1069
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:34,557
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

1070
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,322
or cancer like the rest of us?

1071
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,088
But I'm not like the rest of you.

1072
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:39,693
Except maybe the Wolverine.

1073
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,829
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

1074
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:43,994
You're that scary, huh?

1075
00:48:44,018 --> 00:48:46,062
The TVA certainly thought so.

1076
00:48:46,086 --> 00:48:48,802
They sent me here before I could walk.

1077
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,573
And you know, it's the best thing

1078
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:52,608
that ever happened to me.

1079
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:53,201
I love it here.

1080
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:54,367
You live in a garbage dump.

1081
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,141
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

1082
00:48:58,165 --> 00:48:59,614
The Void is a paradise.

1083
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:02,881
I can wield my power here
without shame.

1084
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:06,149
Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier

1085
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:08,151
to teach me temperance.

1086
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:10,153
What about your Charles?

1087
00:49:10,177 --> 00:49:11,989
Did he protect you?

1088
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:13,991
Did he make you feel safe?

1089
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:16,583
We're mutants. We're never safe.

1090
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,069
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1091
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:26,554
I don't... I don't want the smoke.

1092
00:49:26,578 --> 00:49:28,215
I don't have any beef with you.

1093
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,513
I just want to save my friends.

1094
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:30,810
I just... I want to go home.

1095
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,978
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

1096
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:35,447
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

1097
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:37,940
Not good.

1098
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:41,579
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

1099
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,726
Your... fingers are inside me,

1100
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,484
but not in a good way.

1101
00:49:45,508 --> 00:49:48,829
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

1102
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:51,018
I have to get my hands dirty.

1103
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:56,321
I've got you.

1104
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,061
I've got you...

1105
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:03,702
What do you mean?

1106
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:07,650
I can't... I can't reach you.
You're not here.

1107
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:08,683
I'm right here.

1108
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:11,852
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

1109
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:15,109
Then show me. You got to do something.

1110
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:16,515
Show you what?

1111
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:21,036
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

1112
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,558
Ever since they turned you
down, you took a knee.

1113
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:28,353
Baby, you never got back up.

1114
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,564
I know you're going through something.

1115
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:33,840
Let me go through it with you.

1116
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,736
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

1117
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:42,228
Where'd you go?

1118
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,204
Oh, my God.

1119
00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:48,185
You just say it. Okay?

1120
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,889
Say, "I don't want you."

1121
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,825
"I don't want to be with you."

1122
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,586
Go ahead. Say it. Say... Say, "I don't..."

1123
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,175
Say it. You don't wanna be with me.

1124
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:56,765
Tell me that and I'll walk away.

1125
00:50:56,789 --> 00:50:57,789
Say, "I don't want you."

1126
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:05,663
Fuck...

1127
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:09,130
You'll never fucking matter.

1128
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:13,638
What?

1129
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:16,775
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

1130
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:25,486
- You'll...
- You'll...

1131
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,070
- never...
- never...

1132
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:29,699
- fucking...
- fucking...

1133
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:32,351
- matter.
- Matter...

1134
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:34,599
She never said that.

1135
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:35,803
No.

1136
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,192
But I bet she thought it.

1137
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,990
You are so mean!

1138
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,075
My brain could taste your fingers,

1139
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,746
and they tasted like hate!

1140
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,948
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

1141
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:50,967
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

1142
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:54,010
And long before you came here.

1143
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:55,449
This is Baby Knife.

1144
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:57,089
She's gonna fuck you in the face now.

1145
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:57,858
If you want to kill me,

1146
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,125
it's going to take more than a little blade.

1147
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:01,653
How about six?

1148
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:05,834
My boy's wicked strong.

1149
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:07,561
That's my big boy.

1150
00:52:07,585 --> 00:52:09,256
Yes, you are.

1151
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,975
Well, this has been fun.

1152
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,595
But the big guy needs to eat,
and the rent is due.

1153
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,510
By the way,

1154
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:25,041
you're the rent.

1155
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:45,851
Come on! Fuck!

1156
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,074
You comin' or what?

1157
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,934
Coming!

1158
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:09,963
What you thinkin' 'bout?

1159
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,828
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Shh, shh, shh.

1160
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:13,693
- Almost done.
- Almost done what?

1161
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:15,904
Getting my knife out of your buttocks,

1162
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:17,663
- pervert!
- Aah! Fuck!

1163
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:20,116
Get your mind out of my pants!

1164
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,570
- I'm telling Blake.
- New rules.

1165
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:23,174
I talk now.

1166
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:24,946
That's gonna be very hard
on the audience.

1167
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:26,612
Shut the fuck up!

1168
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,278
Let me fuckin' think.

1169
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:31,338
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?

1170
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,580
Right?

1171
00:53:33,604 --> 00:53:36,485
Je m'excuse. Am I allowed
to speak now or...

1172
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:39,412
Just nod, asshole.

1173
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:41,126
Right.

1174
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,512
Then we find the others
that poor kid, Johnny,

1175
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:44,256
was talking about
before you got him killed!

1176
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,362
"Poor kid." He's, like, 50!

1177
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:46,880
Yeah, if there's a chance they know

1178
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,805
how to get out of here, we find 'em.

1179
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:50,730
And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit

1180
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:52,281
like you fucking promised!

1181
00:53:52,305 --> 00:53:53,855
I smell quest.

1182
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:58,134
I smell food.

1183
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:04,943
So what made you finally wear
an honest-to-God costume?

1184
00:54:05,405 --> 00:54:07,416
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

1185
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,552
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

1186
00:54:10,576 --> 00:54:12,785
Have you been checked for ADHD?

1187
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:13,752
Mm-mm.

1188
00:54:13,776 --> 00:54:15,688
But I've had several STDs,

1189
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:18,428
which were probably caused by ADHD.

1190
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:19,958
Fuck!

1191
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,003
What are you looking for?

1192
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:23,971
Oh. Thank fuck.

1193
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:25,941
No, no, no, no, no.
That's rubbing alcohol.

1194
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:27,701
You don't want to drink... Oh, yeah.

1195
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:29,858
There you go. Fuck that liver.

1196
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:33,301
Good. Okay.

1197
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:35,435
What the fuck are those?

1198
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:36,115
Oh.

1199
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,118
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,

1200
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,176
but nobody knows.

1201
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,675
Everybody knows.

1202
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:47,556
Wanna talk about what's haunting you,

1203
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,262
or should we wait
for a third act flashback?

1204
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,057
Ah... Go fuck yourself.

1205
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:57,325
You know...

1206
00:54:57,853 --> 00:55:01,230
in my world, you're...

1207
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,505
You're well regarded.

1208
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,276
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1209
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,675
They don't like me much in mine either.

1210
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:08,609
You don't say.

1211
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:11,679
I wanted to be something, you know. I...

1212
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:13,582
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

1213
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:15,484
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1214
00:55:15,508 --> 00:55:19,116
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1215
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:21,131
When my girlfriend left me,

1216
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:23,592
- and I just...
- You had a girlfriend?

1217
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:24,813
Yeah.

1218
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:26,033
Vanessa.

1219
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:28,422
When we met, she was a dancer.

1220
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:30,787
We had a whole life.

1221
00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:32,798
It was good.

1222
00:55:32,822 --> 00:55:35,858
But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.

1223
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,729
Fucked that right up.

1224
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:39,937
But you,

1225
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,872
you were an X-Man.

1226
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:44,042
Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...

1227
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,111
The Wolverine.

1228
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,049
He was a hero in my world.

1229
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,975
Yeah, well...

1230
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:56,285
he ain't shit in mine.

1231
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:04,326
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1232
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,229
He died.

1233
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:06,931
How?

1234
00:56:06,955 --> 00:56:09,869
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked by a tree, but,

1235
00:56:09,893 --> 00:56:11,772
really, you just ran out of batteries

1236
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:13,928
- trying to save someone.
- Who?

1237
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:16,084
The shit heels that grew her in a lab

1238
00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:18,406
called her "X-23." But...

1239
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:19,614
she was just a kid.

1240
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:23,784
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

1241
00:56:23,808 --> 00:56:25,753
You died trying to save her.

1242
00:56:25,777 --> 00:56:26,720
It was beautiful.

1243
00:56:26,744 --> 00:56:29,657
Look, mijo, I know you're hurtin'.

1244
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,923
My blind, elderly,
African-American roommate,

1245
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:35,433
Blind Al, always says that
pain teaches us who we are.

1246
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:37,468
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain

1247
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:38,369
instead of running from it.

1248
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:39,733
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

1249
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:43,001
No, no, no. That's her name?
You call her "Blind Al"?

1250
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,729
Well, she's blind.

1251
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:59,556
♪ I've never seen you looking
so lovely as you did tonight ♪

1252
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:06,579
♪ I've never seen you shine
so bright, mm-hmm, hmm ♪

1253
00:57:06,817 --> 00:57:11,426
♪ The lady in red ♪

1254
00:57:12,757 --> 00:57:16,662

1255
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:18,904

1256
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,809

1257
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:22,974
Look at you!

1258
00:57:22,998 --> 00:57:23,744
She's coming with us.

1259
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:25,879
- No, she's not. Fuck no!
- Oh, yes, she is.

1260
00:57:25,903 --> 00:57:27,044
- Oh, yes...
- Sorry!

1261
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,125
Sorry about that!

1262
00:57:30,149 --> 00:57:32,655
Come here, girl!

1263
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:33,820
Who are you?

1264
00:57:33,844 --> 00:57:34,821
Oh, I'm Deadpool.

1265
00:57:34,845 --> 00:57:36,460
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1266
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:38,677
But in here, everybody
calls me "Nicepool."

1267
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:40,894
Oh, my goodness.
Wait till you see Ladypool.

1268
00:57:40,918 --> 00:57:41,663
She is gorgeous.

1269
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:44,469
She just had a baby too. And...

1270
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:45,062
Can't even tell.

1271
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,933
I don't think you're supposed to say that.

1272
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:48,175
That's okay.

1273
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,145
I identify as a feminist.

1274
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:51,796
Right.

1275
00:57:52,731 --> 00:57:53,741
Are those gold-plated,

1276
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:56,514
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

1277
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:57,283
'Course.

1278
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,780
To match my ear huggie.

1279
00:57:58,804 --> 00:57:59,846
Can I have 'em?

1280
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,882
Over my dead body.

1281
00:58:01,906 --> 00:58:02,651
You're fun.

1282
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:05,820
And I guess you've
already met Mary Puppins.

1283
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:07,051
AKA Dogpool.

1284
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:08,395
Careful where you put your hands.

1285
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:11,561
She's ninety percent g-spot,
and she'll let you know it.

1286
00:58:11,585 --> 00:58:14,961
You let this little flirt out
of your sight for one second

1287
00:58:14,985 --> 00:58:16,996
and she starts shopping for a new papa.

1288
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,030
If you can't be a responsible pet owner,

1289
00:58:19,054 --> 00:58:22,067
then maybe you don't deserve
this little unicorn.

1290
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:24,707
Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.

1291
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:25,823
Shan't happen again.

1292
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:26,939
Why are you so nice?

1293
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:28,727
Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.

1294
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,515
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1295
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:32,220
- Caliente.
- This is Logan.

1296
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:32,945
He's usually shirtless,

1297
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:35,972
but he's let himself go since the divorce.

1298
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,876
Where's your mask?

1299
00:58:40,845 --> 00:58:41,845
Come on, guys.

1300
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:44,055
Ugh, this guy.

1301
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,860
We're looking for a group of survivors.

1302
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:46,695
Oh, they're out there.

1303
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:48,664
Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope

1304
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:50,634
that you don't run
into the Deadpool corps.

1305
00:58:50,658 --> 00:58:51,370
Yeah, they're crazy.

1306
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,032
They will chop you up
into a thousand pieces

1307
00:58:53,056 --> 00:58:54,065
and hide you all over The Void.

1308
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:56,101
If they could only process
their childhood trauma,

1309
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,938
they'd go on one heck
of a healing journey.

1310
00:58:57,962 --> 00:58:59,775
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.

1311
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:00,643
You know where it is?

1312
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,931
Yeah, that... that's 12 klicks due west.

1313
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:05,220
I can lend you my ride, if you like.

1314
00:59:05,244 --> 00:59:08,004
It would be my honor.

1315
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,755
Oh, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

1316
00:59:12,779 --> 00:59:15,021
Uh-uh. What the... No! No!

1317
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:16,055
Just get in the car.

1318
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,088
This isn't a car.

1319
00:59:17,112 --> 00:59:19,409
This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.

1320
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:21,731
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1321
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:22,698
Dated infotainment system.

1322
00:59:22,722 --> 00:59:24,800
When Honda saw
that untreated chlamydia

1323
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:25,569
was makin' a comeback,

1324
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:28,771
they invented
the Honda Odyssey to compete.

1325
00:59:28,795 --> 00:59:31,575
Get in the fucking car.

1326
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,842
She'll get you there safe and sound.

1327
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:35,546
Old Betsy always does.

1328
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,484
You're gonna have to
give me my dog back, though.

1329
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,616
I know. Listen.

1330
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,716
Yes, child.

1331
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,456
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home,

1332
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,854
or if something should happen to you,

1333
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:46,590
I'd love to be her papa.

1334
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:49,396
What would ever happen to me?

1335
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,322
Lots of stuff.

1336
00:59:54,149 --> 00:59:55,412
- Jesus.
- No!

1337
00:59:55,436 --> 00:59:56,699
We're running away.

1338
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:58,900
- Give me that.
- The corn was too dense, girl!

1339
00:59:58,924 --> 00:59:59,966
- There.
- Come here!

1340
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,432
- Fuck!
- Hello!

1341
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:04,532

Okay, I'm just gonna ask...

1349
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:32,933
What's with the suit?

1350
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:34,738
First thing I did when I flamed out,

1351
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:35,882
- I took mine off.
- Drop it.

1352
01:00:35,906 --> 01:00:36,838
It's not that ugly.

1353
01:00:36,862 --> 01:00:39,102
- Stop talking about my suit.
- Did you make it yourself?

1354
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:40,036
- Been there.
- Quit. Now.

1355
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,109
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

1356
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:44,933
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

1357
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:47,454
Friends don't let friends
leave the house lookin' like

1358
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,621
they fight crime
for the Los Angeles Rams.

1359
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:50,555
Shut the fuck up about this, or...

1360
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,921
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch
your frown lines, angel baby.

1361
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:54,425
I'm just trying to bond a little bit.

1362
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:56,430
Yeah, well, then talk
about somethin' else.

1363
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:57,883
Fine.

1364
01:01:00,655 --> 01:01:02,931
Pshew. Pshew, pshew.

1365
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:03,865
Pshew!

1366
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:05,933
- Stop it.
- Pshew.

1367
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:07,917
If they can fix your world,
what's the first thing

1368
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:09,248
you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

1369
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:10,675
Get some rubbing alcohol shots,

1370
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:11,972
maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1371
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:13,942
- What did you say?
- I said when you get back,

1372
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:15,581
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1373
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,837
No, no, no. Before that.

1374
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:20,774
If... they can fix your world?

1375
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:25,986
What do you mean, "if"?

1376
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,954
- I mean...
- You lied to me.

1377
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:27,922
You don't have a fucking clue

1378
01:01:27,946 --> 01:01:30,222
if they can help me fix things, do you?

1379
01:01:30,246 --> 01:01:31,662
No. I mean... Ow!

1380
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:33,961
Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!

1381
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:38,154
- You lied!
- No! I made an educated wish!

1382
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:41,322
Because I need you.

1383
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:44,939
This. This is why. Right here.

1384
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:47,244
'Cause if we don't do
something, they die.

1385
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,549
I don't know anything
about saving worlds.

1386
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,613
And why would I even care?

1387
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:54,686
Because my entire world
is right here in this picture.

1388
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,082
It's only nine people,

1389
01:01:56,106 --> 01:01:59,360
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1390
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:02,056
I know how to fuck people up
for money. But you,

1391
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,719
you know how to save 'em!

1392
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:06,171
At least the other Wolverine did.

1393
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:10,438
Fuck! I guess I'm stuck
with the worst one.

1394
01:02:10,462 --> 01:02:12,505
Did you say you made

1395
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:15,541
an educated fucking wish?

1396
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,758
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

1397
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:20,368
They don't call me "Truthful Timmy",

1398
01:02:20,392 --> 01:02:23,001
"the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."

1399
01:02:26,136 --> 01:02:27,718
One more word.

1400
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:31,779
Please give me one.

1401
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,275
Gubernatorial.

1402
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:37,048
Oh, fuck!

1403
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:40,084
You know what? You're a fucking joke.

1404
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:42,209
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1405
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:45,539
Or the X-Men. And they'll take
fucking anyone.

1406
01:02:45,563 --> 01:02:46,506
I mean, you are

1407
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:51,105
a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1408
01:02:51,129 --> 01:02:53,041
I have never met

1409
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:53,744
a sadder,

1410
01:02:53,768 --> 01:02:56,847
more attention-starved,
jabbering little prick

1411
01:02:56,871 --> 01:02:57,682
in my entire life.

1412
01:02:57,706 --> 01:02:59,949
And that says a lot, 'cause I've been alive

1413
01:02:59,973 --> 01:03:03,018
for more than 200 fuckin' years,

1414
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:03,853
and I'll tell ya,

1415
01:03:03,877 --> 01:03:05,922
that bald chick was right about one thing.

1416
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:08,352
You will never save the world!

1417
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:11,499

01:03:12,754 --> 01:03:15,849
And motherfucker, I wish
I could say you'd die alone,

1420
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,968
but it's one of God's
best jokes that you can't die,

1421
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:21,389
except that's on all of us!

1422
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:27,230
Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?

1423
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:37,944
I'm gonna fight you now.

1424
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,849

1425
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:53,365

Where are we?

1455
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:11,965
No clue, but... I like it here.

1456
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:21,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1457
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:12,101
Okay.

1458
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:16,327
Look at you... all.
You must be the others.

1459
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:17,205
Terrific.

1460
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:19,290
So just to refresh, you are.

1461
01:07:19,314 --> 01:07:21,374
- Wonder...
- Elektra.

1462
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:24,245
Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?

1463
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:27,117
And you. I was not expecting
to see you here.

1464
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:29,020
I thought you were, you know,

1465
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:31,243
retired.

1466
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:32,948
Retarded?

1467
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:34,519
"Retired."

1468
01:07:34,543 --> 01:07:35,421
I'm already in The Void.

1469
01:07:35,445 --> 01:07:36,925
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1470
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:40,055
- I don't like you.
- You never did.

1471
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:42,902
And who's this succulent reminder

1472
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,629
of my own inadequacies?

1473
01:07:44,653 --> 01:07:45,497
Look at you.

1474
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:48,402
You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1475
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:51,944
The name's Remy LeBeau,
Le Diable Blanc.

1476
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:53,208
But you can call me the Gambit.

1477
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:55,640
It's been a while
since I've seen Sling Blade.

1478
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:57,212
Hit me again.

1479
01:07:57,236 --> 01:07:58,015
They call me the Gambit.

1480
01:07:58,039 --> 01:07:59,479
Do they? Are you sure you didn't

1481
01:07:59,503 --> 01:08:01,283
just really, really want them to,

1482
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:03,110
but it never quite worked out?

1483
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,092
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

1484
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:08,861
But I can tell you now,

1485
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:10,676
it's just a common courtesy to ask

1486
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,491
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1487
01:08:12,515 --> 01:08:15,089
Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.

1488
01:08:18,796 --> 01:08:20,226
Fuck.

1489
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,329
So embarrassing.

1490
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:25,471
Boo, boo, boo.

1491
01:08:25,495 --> 01:08:26,935
Well, now that that's settled, look,

1492
01:08:26,959 --> 01:08:28,439
we came a long way to find you three.

1493
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:30,048
- There's four of us.
- There's four...

1494
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:31,675
Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1495
01:08:31,699 --> 01:08:33,986
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto,

1496
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,330
- because with him...
- He's dead.

1497
01:08:35,354 --> 01:08:36,922
Fuck! Now Disney gets cheap?

1498
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,974
It's like Pinocchio jammed
his face in my ass

1499
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:41,314
- and started lying like crazy.
- Ooh, you nasty!

1500
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:44,002
Mon pet it rouge. Laissez
les bons temps rouler, huh?

1501
01:08:44,026 --> 01:08:46,691
Not a single word.
What do you do exactly?

1502
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:49,198
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1503
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:51,839
Your power's
close-up magic. That's good.

1504
01:08:51,863 --> 01:08:53,775
We're not totally fucked at all.

1505
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:55,441
So who brought us here?

1506
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,131
That would be me.

1507
01:09:06,734 --> 01:09:08,670
Don't make me regret it.

1508
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:12,794
Holy shit. Logan. That's her. That's X-23.

1509
01:09:12,818 --> 01:09:15,380
She's the one I told you about.

1510
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:21,165
Hey, how did you all get stuck
in The Void?

1511
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:23,035
There was a knock at the door.

1512
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:24,399
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1513
01:09:24,423 --> 01:09:25,762
Well, maybe I was born here.

1514
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:28,116
It's... It's hard to know for sure.

1515
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,470
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1516
01:09:30,494 --> 01:09:33,838
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1517
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,676
People like us don't go quietly.

1518
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,030
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1519
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:42,384
The answer is yes. I'm in.

1520
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:44,154
- In what?
- A team.

1521
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:45,969
Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.

1522
01:09:45,993 --> 01:09:47,861
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1523
01:09:47,885 --> 01:09:49,754
Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!

1524
01:09:49,778 --> 01:09:51,723
It was an educated wish!

1525
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:54,188
- Ha!
- Look.

1526
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:56,463
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1527
01:09:56,487 --> 01:09:59,071
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1528
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:01,271
She can get us home. She told us.

1529
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:03,470
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1530
01:10:03,494 --> 01:10:05,109
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1531
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:07,843
- Nobody's ever done that.
- We did.

1532
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:10,577
Every time one of us
has gone up against her,

1533
01:10:10,601 --> 01:10:11,148
they die.

1534
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:13,855
The Punisher, the Quicksilver,
the Daredevil.

1535
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:15,939
Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1536
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:18,047
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1537
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:22,523
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1538
01:10:22,547 --> 01:10:24,129
He up and gone missing like,

1539
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,932
what, two days ago?

1540
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:27,791
Ugh. That's so sad.

1541
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:31,225
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1542
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:34,766
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1543
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:35,436
All right? Us...

1544
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,503
plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra

1545
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,979
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1546
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:40,603
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1547
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,147
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1548
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,380
Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1549
01:10:44,404 --> 01:10:46,284
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1550
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,922
You guys may not have been able

1551
01:10:47,946 --> 01:10:49,753
to save your universes.

1552
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:51,584
But you can avenge them.

1553
01:10:51,608 --> 01:10:53,191
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1554
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,921
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1555
01:10:56,964 --> 01:10:57,964
Oh, yeah.

1556
01:10:57,988 --> 01:10:59,592
Dickhead here talked him into a team-up,

1557
01:10:59,616 --> 01:11:02,431
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1558
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:03,695
No, no, no. We don't know that.

1559
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:06,247
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1560
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:08,833
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1561
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:10,873
Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!

1562
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:12,914
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1563
01:11:12,938 --> 01:11:14,218
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1564
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:16,709
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1565
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:17,280
Look.

1566
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:19,679
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1567
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:21,053
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1568
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,117
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1569
01:11:23,141 --> 01:11:26,653
while the soil greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1570
01:11:26,677 --> 01:11:27,797
He was like a brother to me.

1571
01:11:27,821 --> 01:11:31,328
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1572
01:11:31,352 --> 01:11:32,791
Look, maybe you couldn't

1573
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:33,934
save your worlds, but...

1574
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,530
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1575
01:11:36,554 --> 01:11:38,796
I don't give a shit about your world, but

1576
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:42,108
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1577
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,801
we can get back in and take her down.

1578
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:46,474
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, Chere.

1579
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:49,148
If we can block her psychic powers,

1580
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:51,216
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1581
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,953
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1582
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:55,351
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1583
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,651
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1584
01:11:57,675 --> 01:11:58,960
- Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1585
01:11:58,984 --> 01:12:00,676
- Fuck!
- She don't play.

1586
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,265
She knows that helmet was the only way

1587
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:03,854
to protect anyone from her powers.

1588
01:12:03,878 --> 01:12:06,198
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1589
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,066
but he works for Cassandra.

1590
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,430
Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.

1591
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:10,574
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1592
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,198
without that dome gonna come off wit'it.

1593
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:13,469
I'm so sorry, beautiful.

1594
01:12:13,493 --> 01:12:14,304
I want this to be gentle.

1595
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:16,174
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1596
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:20,707
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1597
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:23,963
I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of hiding.

1598
01:12:23,987 --> 01:12:27,219
Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.

1599
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:29,155
Or never learned about us.

1600
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,574
The heroes we were.

1601
01:12:30,598 --> 01:12:31,866
Lives we saved.

1602
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,158
Or wanted to save.

1603
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,580
Maybe these two are our chance.

1604
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:38,493
To be remembered.

1605
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:40,255
The way we deserve.

1606
01:12:40,849 --> 01:12:41,959
Yes.

1607
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,564
An ending.

1608
01:12:43,588 --> 01:12:44,863
- Legacy.
- Yes!

1609
01:12:44,887 --> 01:12:46,072
Yes! Let this man cook.

1610
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,920
This is what I'm talking about.

1611
01:12:47,944 --> 01:12:49,769
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1612
01:12:49,793 --> 01:12:50,637
Everybody working together.

1613
01:12:50,661 --> 01:12:52,673
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1614
01:12:52,697 --> 01:12:55,115
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1615
01:12:55,139 --> 01:12:56,165
Yes! Gambit?

1616
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:57,215
I ain't know my daddy,

1617
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,981
but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.

1618
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:00,746
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1619
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,930
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1620
01:13:02,954 --> 01:13:05,008
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1621
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:07,721
Johnny must have loved you.

1622
01:13:07,745 --> 01:13:10,163
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1623
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:10,855
The name's Laura.

1624
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:14,068
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

1625
01:13:14,092 --> 01:13:15,292
It's on like chicken and corn.

1626
01:13:15,316 --> 01:13:17,038
- Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1627
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:17,796
You're all fuckin' dead.

1628
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,164
My God! Read the room.

1629
01:13:30,602 --> 01:13:35,145
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1630
01:13:36,608 --> 01:13:38,036
You remind me of him.

1631
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,488
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1632
01:13:39,512 --> 01:13:42,845
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1633
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:46,255
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1634
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,160
Couldn't help it.

1635
01:13:52,657 --> 01:13:54,824
You might not know it, but...

1636
01:13:54,956 --> 01:13:56,694
you're a good man, Logan.

1637
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:00,213
You might not know it, but apparently,

1638
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:02,304
I'm the worst Logan.

1639
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,033
I got to have a life because of you.

1640
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:10,675
I got to grow up because of you.

1641
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:13,093
A lot of kids did.

1642
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:16,384
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1643
01:14:17,781 --> 01:14:20,190
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1644
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:22,696
That suit says different.

1645
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,756
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1646
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:29,331
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1647
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:34,204
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1648
01:14:35,733 --> 01:14:36,941
All of them.

1649
01:14:36,965 --> 01:14:41,165
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1650
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:45,413
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1651
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:49,978
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1652
01:14:54,455 --> 01:14:57,061
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1653
01:14:57,085 --> 01:14:58,864
the humans came...

1654
01:14:58,888 --> 01:15:00,989
and went mutant hunting.

1655
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:03,088
I can guess the rest.

1656
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:04,663
No, no, let me...

1657
01:15:05,235 --> 01:15:07,094
Let me say it. I...

1658
01:15:09,063 --> 01:15:10,900
I need to say it.

1659
01:15:12,099 --> 01:15:15,519
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1660
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:17,379
it was too late.

1661
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,846
They were dead. Every...

1662
01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:32,086
This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1663
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,122
And what I did.

1664
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:49,906
We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.

1665
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:52,744
Have fun. Not my fight.

1666
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:57,683
We won't pull this off without you.

1667
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:07,957
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1668
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:12,401
You were always the wrong guy.

1669
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:38,161
What?

1670
01:16:38,185 --> 01:16:39,998
Alioth didn't get them.

1671
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:43,442
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1672
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:44,068
They got away.

1673
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:45,840
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1674
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:46,873
Good. All right. Phew.

1675
01:16:46,897 --> 01:16:48,793
- The others found them.
- Oh, very cute.

1676
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,713
Well done, Pyro. Classic bait and switch.

1677
01:16:50,737 --> 01:16:53,385
- You really got me there.
- Relax.

1678
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:55,850
If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1679
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:57,653
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1680
01:16:57,677 --> 01:16:59,920
Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

1681
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:02,692
Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.

1682
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:05,464
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1683
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:06,828
I cannot take any chances.

1684
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:07,961
Well, maybe not.

1685
01:17:07,985 --> 01:17:09,011
But I can.

1686
01:17:09,035 --> 01:17:10,061
For a price.

1687
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:11,965
Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?

1688
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:12,602
It's so icky.

1689
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:15,100
- You want it done or not?
- All right. Your price.

1690
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:16,871
Take her out.

1691
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:18,664

walk away from this.

01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:39,066
Boys are so silly.

1759
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,100
I just need to get home.

1760
01:21:40,124 --> 01:21:42,575
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1761
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:46,503
It's death or enslavement.
A la carte, of course.

1762
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,935
Upsy-daisy.

1763
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:54,180
Finally,

1764
01:21:54,204 --> 01:21:56,656
it's nice to give someone else
a chance to talk.

1765
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,829
Not my strong suit.

1766
01:22:16,094 --> 01:22:18,261
You shouldn't have done that.

1767
01:22:37,445 --> 01:22:39,282
Adios, pendejo.

1768
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,427
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1769
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:47,224
I do feel like you get lost
behind all of his...

1770
01:22:49,732 --> 01:22:53,769
Deadpools are a dime a dozen
here in The Void.

1771
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:55,747
But you...

1772
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:59,434
What's going on in here?

1773
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:10,346
Logan!

1774
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:14,152
Interesting...

1775
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:17,188
Not what I expected back here.

1776
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:19,663
Behind the anger.

1777
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:24,006
You're hiding.

1778
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:25,777
From them.

1779
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:28,738
From all the ones you let down.

1780
01:23:30,707 --> 01:23:32,434
So much pain.

1781
01:23:34,535 --> 01:23:36,480
I walked away.

1782
01:23:36,504 --> 01:23:38,516
They called after me and I...

1783
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,244
I walked away.

1784
01:23:40,584 --> 01:23:41,584
I always do.

1785
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:43,720
- Logan!
- I know.

1786
01:23:45,117 --> 01:23:47,284
That's not all you did.

1787
01:23:47,614 --> 01:23:48,614
Is it?

1788
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,829
You found them.

1789
01:23:54,126 --> 01:23:55,831
The X-Men.

1790
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:01,738
Dead.

1791
01:24:04,236 --> 01:24:06,138
Piled like wood.

1792
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:09,108
What did you do?

1793
01:24:10,978 --> 01:24:12,450
I started killing.

1794
01:24:12,474 --> 01:24:16,181
And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.

1795
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:19,789
All those bad men.

1796
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:25,762
It's not just the bad ones.

1797
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:28,424
My little animal.

1798
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:34,011
And I turned the whole world
against the X-Men.

1799
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,662
Blade!

1800
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:42,306
Just once...

1801
01:24:42,845 --> 01:24:46,915
I wanna be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1802
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:49,148
Logan...

1803
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:54,351
in The Void, you can be what you are.

1804
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,249
I just wanna be free.

1805
01:24:58,273 --> 01:25:00,555
I can set you free.

1806
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:16,780
I can silence all those voices.

1807
01:25:23,545 --> 01:25:25,118
I've got you.

1808
01:25:27,054 --> 01:25:28,825
I've got you.

1809
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,387
No.

1810
01:25:31,157 --> 01:25:32,895
I got you.

1811
01:25:39,836 --> 01:25:41,979
Get it off!

1812
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:43,547
You're gonna send us home,

1813
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,211
or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.

1814
01:25:45,235 --> 01:25:47,579
Why are you laughing?

1815
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:48,480
I can't send you home

1816
01:25:48,504 --> 01:25:51,792
unless you get this thing off my head.

1817
01:25:51,816 --> 01:25:52,649
And as soon as you do that,

1818
01:25:52,673 --> 01:25:55,636
I'm going to boil your brains
on an atomic level

1819
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:58,623
whilst flicking my bean
to the Enya box set.

1820
01:25:58,647 --> 01:26:00,163
There's an Enya box set?

1821
01:26:00,187 --> 01:26:01,895
Either you kill me

1822
01:26:01,919 --> 01:26:03,651
or I kill you.

1823
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,530
Both wonderful options.

1824
01:26:05,554 --> 01:26:07,236
You want me to do it?

1825
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:07,840
No, I'll do it.

1826
01:26:07,864 --> 01:26:09,072
I have her neck right here.

1827
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:10,943
- It's really no problem.
- You'll screw it up.

1828
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,846
Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,

1829
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:13,703
except the last one!

1830
01:26:13,727 --> 01:26:16,730
What the fuck?

1831
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,677
You have no idea

1832
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:20,413
what it's like!

1833
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:23,747
Day after day. Shovel the shit.

1834
01:26:23,771 --> 01:26:25,154
Fetch the meats.

1835
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:28,984
I have spent my entire exis...

1836
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:31,391
Not everyone gets a speech.

1837
01:26:31,415 --> 01:26:33,899
She's gonna die.

1838
01:26:33,923 --> 01:26:35,836
Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off,

1839
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,420
do you promise you won't kill us?

1840
01:26:37,444 --> 01:26:39,004
- Fuck!
- I promise...

1841
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:40,433
I will kill you first thing.

1842
01:26:40,457 --> 01:26:42,843
Oh! Why are you like this?

1843
01:26:42,867 --> 01:26:43,733
I wish I knew.

1844
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:44,921
- Take it off.
- What?

1845
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:46,109
- Take it off.
- Why?

1846
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:47,893
- Just take it off.
- This is our only chance

1847
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:51,051
- to fix our shit!
- Take it off!

1848
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:53,578
I am wearing this suit.

1849
01:26:53,602 --> 01:26:57,243
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all...

1850
01:26:57,947 --> 01:26:59,949
it means I'm an X-Man.

1851
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,347
And I know your brother.

1852
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:04,993
As much as I want to fucking kill you,

1853
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:08,412
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you,

1854
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:12,093
he would not let me stand here
and watch you die!

1855
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:15,822
Take your hands off.

1856
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:18,759
This is for him.

1857
01:27:19,826 --> 01:27:21,905
This is for Charles.

1858
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,420
Hey, no, no, no!

1859
01:27:32,444 --> 01:27:35,050
Don't you dare do me like Johnny!

1860
01:27:40,649 --> 01:27:42,420
My brother loved you.

1861
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:45,390
He loved all of us.

1862
01:27:45,687 --> 01:27:47,095
Hmm.

1863
01:27:47,887 --> 01:27:49,724
Must be nice.

1864
01:27:49,823 --> 01:27:52,067
He would've loved you, too.

1865
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,104
If he knew about you...

1866
01:27:56,973 --> 01:27:58,016
if he knew where you were,

1867
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,811
he would've torn a hole
in the fucking universe

1868
01:28:00,835 --> 01:28:02,704
to bring you home.

1869
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:07,421
This is my home.

1870
01:28:07,445 --> 01:28:10,877
Well, then at least let us save his.

1871
01:28:13,957 --> 01:28:16,421
You want to hear something crazy?

1872
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:21,294
An amateur magician rolled
through here a while back.

1873
01:28:21,558 --> 01:28:23,107
I killed him, of course.

1874
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,761
Wore his skin around for four days.

1875
01:28:26,947 --> 01:28:27,947
But

1876
01:28:27,971 --> 01:28:29,746
I found this

1877
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:31,544
little trinket

1878
01:28:31,568 --> 01:28:33,678
on his lovely fingers.

1879
01:28:33,702 --> 01:28:35,836
Strange!

1880
01:28:37,475 --> 01:28:40,994
- Marvel sparkle circle.
- What is that?

1881
01:28:41,018 --> 01:28:42,753
This is your way home.

1882
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:44,623
I do owe you for saving my life.

1883
01:28:44,647 --> 01:28:46,609
But let's keep things interesting.

1884
01:28:46,633 --> 01:28:48,595
I'd say you have about four seconds

1885
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:50,917
before you're Alioth's food.

1886
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,263

bumper to bumper warranty.

1903
01:30:22,448 --> 01:30:23,986
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1904
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:26,142
And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,

1905
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,322
so I'll see he gets half the commission...

1906
01:30:29,135 --> 01:30:30,135
Whoa.

1907
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:32,137
That feels like a Kia.

1908
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:36,099
It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?

1909
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:39,541
Holy shit. That's Deadpool.

1910
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:40,376
And that's Wolverine.

1911
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,038
You're damn straight it is.

1912
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:42,972
Fox killed him.

1913
01:30:42,996 --> 01:30:43,709
Disney brought him back.

1914
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:46,406
They're going to make him
do this till he's 90.

1915
01:30:46,538 --> 01:30:47,812
Let's go.

1916
01:30:47,836 --> 01:30:49,518
I'll clock you out!

1917
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:51,378
Forever!

1918
01:30:51,741 --> 01:30:53,248
Forever.

1919
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:00,594
Wakey-wakey.

1920
01:31:00,618 --> 01:31:03,291
God?

1921
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:07,063
Now, you put all these bullets in my belly,

1922
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,703
and I'm gonna find out why.

1923
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:11,332
Whoa, whoa!

1924
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:12,771
I'll just say it.

1925
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:15,005
You don't have to stick
your fingers in me.

1926
01:31:15,029 --> 01:31:18,151
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

1927
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:19,835
Fine.

1928
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:21,879
Really?

1929
01:31:21,903 --> 01:31:23,321
Hands in pockets.

1930
01:31:24,851 --> 01:31:26,356
Guy named Paradox.

1931
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,424
He said he'd get me out of The Void.

1932
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,493
All I know is he works for the TVA.

1933
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:31,163
The TVA.

1934
01:31:31,187 --> 01:31:32,461
We had an agreement.

1935
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:34,662
I don't think this guy cares.

1936
01:31:34,686 --> 01:31:36,163
Huh. He will.

1937
01:31:36,187 --> 01:31:37,664
Hey, people!

1938
01:31:37,688 --> 01:31:40,063
How much longer before
the Time Ripper is active?

1939
01:31:40,087 --> 01:31:41,607
We're running the final safety checks.

1940
01:31:41,631 --> 01:31:44,639
Oh, okay. All right.
Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.

1941
01:31:44,663 --> 01:31:46,179
- Take your time.
- Really?

1942
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:47,444
No, you drooling boob!

1943
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:48,708
No! We have company.

1944
01:31:48,732 --> 01:31:52,647
Cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now!

1945
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:54,969
Oh, I hate you so much.

1946
01:31:56,112 --> 01:31:57,112
No! Stop!

1947
01:31:57,136 --> 01:31:58,586
Piss off! You're too late.

1948
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,886
- You're fuckin' done.
- Why was Thor crying?

1949
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,787
How dare you!

1950
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:04,494
No one comes back from The Void.

1951
01:32:04,518 --> 01:32:06,882
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1952
01:32:14,758 --> 01:32:17,695
Paradox. We have a problem.

1953
01:32:19,796 --> 01:32:21,831
Paradox.

1954
01:32:22,634 --> 01:32:25,878
Well, you are doughier than
you looked in Pyro's head.

1955
01:32:25,902 --> 01:32:27,330
You tried to kill me.

1956
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:28,781
I literally have no I...

1957
01:32:28,805 --> 01:32:30,850
You come for the king,

1958
01:32:30,874 --> 01:32:32,918
you better kill the king.

1959
01:32:32,942 --> 01:32:33,654
Oh-ho-ho!

1960
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:36,140
Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.

1961
01:32:36,164 --> 01:32:38,627
You know she doesn't wash that hand.

1962
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:40,464
Oh.

1963
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,115
What's this?

1964
01:32:42,747 --> 01:32:43,747
A Time Ripper?

1965
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:44,698
Naughty boy.

1966
01:32:44,722 --> 01:32:45,732
Oh, no. We're on it.

1967
01:32:45,756 --> 01:32:47,899
We're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1968
01:32:47,923 --> 01:32:50,067
We got ya, boo.
You just keep playing those keys.

1969
01:32:50,091 --> 01:32:52,575
I don't want to destroy it.

1970
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:53,575
I want to use it.

1971
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:57,196
Now, shoo. Mummy and Daddy
are having a conversation.

1972
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:05,588
You know, the funny thing is,

1973
01:33:05,612 --> 01:33:07,083
I was happy in The Void.

1974
01:33:07,107 --> 01:33:11,022
You sent your trash to me.
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

1975
01:33:11,046 --> 01:33:12,891
Everyone was happy.

1976
01:33:12,915 --> 01:33:16,764
And then you had to
go and piss on my side of the fence.

1977
01:33:16,788 --> 01:33:19,667
And so now the fence must come down.

1978
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:22,021
I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.

1979
01:33:22,045 --> 01:33:24,579
And I'm going to destroy this universe

1980
01:33:24,603 --> 01:33:27,876
and the next and the next and the next

1981
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,174
until all that's left is The Void.

1982
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:33,483
And I get to play God.

1983
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:35,046
Come on.

1984
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,947
Now you're going to show me

1985
01:33:35,971 --> 01:33:37,850
how to use this fancy gadget of yours.

1986
01:33:37,874 --> 01:33:39,754
And don't worry, I've called some friends

1987
01:33:39,778 --> 01:33:42,384
to make sure we're not disturbed.

1988
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:45,694
Sorry to bother, madam,

1989
01:33:45,718 --> 01:33:47,464
but there's something you need to see.

1990
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:50,567
We're getting indications
of an unsanctioned Time Ripper

1991
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:53,692
activating on Earth-10005.

1992
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,695
Whose district is that?

1993
01:33:56,893 --> 01:33:58,301
Paradox.

1994
01:34:08,641 --> 01:34:11,016
Well, thank you so much
for your help, darling.

1995
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,656
God. Good to get out of that head.

1996
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,352
Whew! What a mess!

1997
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:23,830
Stop!

1998
01:34:23,854 --> 01:34:25,965
Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.

1999
01:34:25,989 --> 01:34:29,222
Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God!

2000
01:34:33,127 --> 01:34:36,635
- Oh. My. God.
- Fuck.

2001
01:34:43,742 --> 01:34:45,951
It's her!

2002
01:34:45,975 --> 01:34:48,978
Come on, girl!

2003
01:34:50,144 --> 01:34:51,792
♪ Was love always this good ♪

2004
01:34:51,816 --> 01:34:54,928
♪ Or could this be just the start? ♪

2005
01:34:54,952 --> 01:34:56,611
Come on, girl!

2006
01:34:56,635 --> 01:34:58,293
♪ Baby, baby ♪

2007
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:03,442
♪ Turn the radio up
for that sweet sound ♪

2008
01:35:03,466 --> 01:35:07,809
♪ Hold me close, never let me go ♪

2009
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:10,713
♪ Keep this feelin' alive... ♪

2010
01:35:10,737 --> 01:35:11,713
That's my girl!

2011
01:35:11,737 --> 01:35:13,011
We don't have to be apart

2012
01:35:13,035 --> 01:35:15,146
ever, ever again. Never, ever...

2013
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,775
- Sorry!
- Fuck!

2014
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:19,083
What's Cafe Gratitude doing here?

2015
01:35:19,107 --> 01:35:21,069
Sorry about that.

2016
01:35:21,093 --> 01:35:23,055
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.

2017
01:35:23,079 --> 01:35:24,408
I'll handle him.

2018
01:35:24,432 --> 01:35:25,760
Come here, girl. Papa's here.

2019
01:35:25,784 --> 01:35:29,061
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

2020
01:35:29,085 --> 01:35:30,782
She can decide who her papa is.

2021
01:35:30,806 --> 01:35:32,503
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

2022
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:34,637
Original recipe or Van Milder here?

2023
01:35:34,661 --> 01:35:39,478
Ah, that's funny. I can gently
tap the fourth wall too.

2024
01:35:39,502 --> 01:35:41,261
The Proposal.

2025
01:35:41,843 --> 01:35:42,843
The fuck was that?

2026
01:35:42,867 --> 01:35:44,879
Bitch, you think that's what I do?

2027
01:35:44,903 --> 01:35:45,846
Both of you shut up.

2028
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:48,179
You smell somethin'?

2029
01:35:48,203 --> 01:35:48,882
Yeah, you.

2030
01:35:48,906 --> 01:35:51,072
A lot of you.

2031
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:08,728
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

2032
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:22,401
That's bad.

2033
01:36:43,796 --> 01:36:45,544
I take it they're not friendly.

2034
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,269
Goodness, no.

2035
01:36:46,293 --> 01:36:47,941
Sorry about this, boys. Mission over.

2036
01:36:47,965 --> 01:36:51,748
Cause of death, one hundred
kill-thirsty Deadpools.

2037
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:52,374
They're dumb.

2038
01:36:52,398 --> 01:36:53,798
But they can fight. Not me, though.

2039
01:36:53,822 --> 01:36:56,753
Would love to get in the mix,
but I have low bone density

2040
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,304
and I have to keep my face safe.

2041
01:36:58,328 --> 01:36:59,854
Hold, please.

2042
01:36:59,878 --> 01:37:02,825
- Oh, God.
- All right. Look.

2043
01:37:02,849 --> 01:37:04,344
Guys!

2044
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,091
Deadpool Prime here.

2045
01:37:06,115 --> 01:37:08,061
- Our fight isn't with you...
- Hey!

2046
01:37:08,085 --> 01:37:09,094
When I want your opinion,

2047
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:11,669
I'll take Wolverine's dick
out of your mouth.

2048
01:37:11,693 --> 01:37:13,104
That's Kidpool. She's the dirtiest.

2049
01:37:13,128 --> 01:37:14,539
Can we just be done?

2050
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:16,740
Ooh, we're just getting started.

2051
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,923
No, no, no, no, no.

2052
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:21,130
With the whole multiverse thing.

2053
01:37:21,537 --> 01:37:23,064
It's not great.

2054
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,616
It's just been miss

2055
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,029
after miss

2056
01:37:26,053 --> 01:37:27,442
after miss.

2057
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:29,918
Look, The Wizard of Oz
did the multiverse first,

2058
01:37:29,942 --> 01:37:33,218
and they did it best. The gays knew it.

2059
01:37:33,242 --> 01:37:34,119
But we didn't listen.

2060
01:37:34,143 --> 01:37:36,858
Let's just take the I and move on.

2061
01:37:36,882 --> 01:37:39,664
I think it's been
steadily great since Endgame.

2062
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:41,699
What are you talking about?

2063
01:37:41,723 --> 01:37:42,930
The multiverse is over.

2064
01:37:42,954 --> 01:37:44,427
Cassandy gonna destroy

2065
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:46,032
the fuck outta every timeline.

2066
01:37:46,056 --> 01:37:47,672
Heh. Y'all can't do shit about it.

2067
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:48,573
Do you not get it?

2068
01:37:48,597 --> 01:37:49,938
If we don't go down to the subway

2069
01:37:49,962 --> 01:37:50,806
and stop her, we all die.

2070
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:52,105
Say, the boss lady

2071
01:37:52,129 --> 01:37:53,105
don't want no disturbances.

2072
01:37:53,129 --> 01:37:55,240
You wanna get down to the subway,

2073
01:37:55,264 --> 01:37:56,681
you gotta go through us.

2074
01:37:56,705 --> 01:37:57,714
Uzi time, baby.

2075
01:37:57,738 --> 01:37:59,282
Uzi time, baby.

2076
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:00,873
Look alive!

2077
01:38:09,244 --> 01:38:11,190
- I think I'm hit.
- No shit.

2078
01:38:11,214 --> 01:38:11,959
You did that on purpose.

2079
01:38:11,983 --> 01:38:14,028
I did no such thing!

2080
01:38:14,052 --> 01:38:14,764
Listen to me, gorgeous.

2081
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,833
How long does it take
for you to regenerate?

2082
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:18,792
Regenerate?

2083
01:38:23,489 --> 01:38:25,644
You really are
God's perfect idiot, aren't you?

2084
01:38:25,668 --> 01:38:27,272
- I'm okay.
- How dare you!

2085
01:38:27,296 --> 01:38:28,943
You insensitive son of a bitch!

2086
01:38:28,967 --> 01:38:31,650
How was I supposed to know
he doesn't regenerate?

2087
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:32,650
I'm not a medicine woman.

2088
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:35,445
Look. A donut cart.
They're practically hospitals.

2089
01:38:35,469 --> 01:38:36,379
- What?
- They sell

2090
01:38:36,403 --> 01:38:37,883
- portable triage units.
- They don't.

2091
01:38:37,907 --> 01:38:39,712
I'm gonna get you to safety.

2092
01:38:39,736 --> 01:38:41,815
- He's not.
- Deep breath.

2093
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:50,899
Hey, why are we stopping?

2094
01:38:50,923 --> 01:38:52,065
I'm just catching my breath.

2095
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:55,465
What, are your legs on
vacation? You're dead weight!

2096
01:38:55,489 --> 01:38:56,649
That's because I'm paralyzed.

2097
01:38:56,673 --> 01:38:59,612
We all have problems. Listen to me.

2098
01:38:59,636 --> 01:39:01,263
You're gonna live.

2099
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:03,418
Look at me, Nicepool.

2100
01:39:06,906 --> 01:39:08,875
You're gonna live.

2101
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,721
Say it!

2102
01:39:10,745 --> 01:39:11,854
I'm gonna live.

2103
01:39:11,878 --> 01:39:14,154
Say it with me. You're gonna live.

2104
01:39:14,178 --> 01:39:16,056
I'm gonna live!

2105
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,127
Ha-hah! Say it louder!

2106
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:22,020
I'm gonna live...

2107
01:39:30,226 --> 01:39:32,294
Hold your fire!

2108
01:39:33,559 --> 01:39:35,671
Sweet little puppy.

2109
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,658
God damn it!

2110
01:39:46,682 --> 01:39:48,661
I don't think he's gonna make it.

2111
01:39:48,685 --> 01:39:50,156
God, he loved his face.

2112
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,995
I can taste his final thought.

2113
01:39:53,019 --> 01:39:54,227
He was so afraid.

2114
01:39:54,251 --> 01:39:55,458
But he died a hero.

2115
01:39:55,482 --> 01:39:57,361
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

2116
01:39:57,385 --> 01:40:00,421
And all I have to remember him by

2117
01:40:00,586 --> 01:40:02,102
are these two gold-plated,

2118
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:04,875
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.

2119
01:40:04,899 --> 01:40:06,427
This is for him.

2120
01:40:06,559 --> 01:40:07,877
Are you ready?

2121
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:09,946
I get to kill a hundred yous?

2122
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:11,782
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

2123
01:40:11,806 --> 01:40:13,609
Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.

2124
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,633

01:43:21,095 --> 01:43:22,997
Stand down.

Oh, no.

2178
01:43:35,472 --> 01:43:36,712
Holy shit.

2179
01:43:36,736 --> 01:43:38,672
That's fuckin' Peter!

2180
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,652
Wait, you... You guys know Peter?

2181
01:43:42,676 --> 01:43:45,062
You kidding me?
Every Deadpool has a Peter.

2182
01:43:45,086 --> 01:43:47,823
Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend

2183
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:49,561
in every Deadpool's world.

2184
01:43:49,585 --> 01:43:51,893
Peter-san. Hai.

2185
01:43:58,659 --> 01:44:01,275
Peter. Peter. Peter.

2186
01:44:01,299 --> 01:44:04,130
Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter. Peter.

2187
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:06,985
Peter. Peter. Peter.

2188
01:44:07,009 --> 01:44:09,339
Enjoy my Peter.

2189
01:44:35,838 --> 01:44:36,838
Oh, now you're here.

2190
01:44:36,862 --> 01:44:38,775
Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.

2191
01:44:38,799 --> 01:44:39,478
Not yet, it's not.

2192
01:44:39,502 --> 01:44:41,547
Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.

2193
01:44:41,571 --> 01:44:42,949
Homestretch, folks. Promise.

2194
01:44:42,973 --> 01:44:44,351
Quick, let's up the stakes.

2195
01:44:44,375 --> 01:44:45,935
If she steals the Time Ripper's energy,

2196
01:44:45,959 --> 01:44:48,389
she has the power to shred
the fabric of all realities

2197
01:44:48,413 --> 01:44:50,655
until there is nothing left but The Void.

2198
01:44:50,679 --> 01:44:52,030
How do we shut it down?

2199
01:44:52,054 --> 01:44:53,152
I don't know.

2200
01:44:54,494 --> 01:44:55,494
How about now?

2201
01:44:55,518 --> 01:44:57,546
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

2202
01:44:57,570 --> 01:44:59,598
It's like Batman,
except he can move his neck.

2203
01:44:59,622 --> 01:45:01,731
Okay, look, look, look.

2204
01:45:01,755 --> 01:45:04,784
The Ripper is fed from
a secure chamber below ground.

2205
01:45:04,808 --> 01:45:07,837
It is powered by twin matter
and anti-matter feeds

2206
01:45:07,861 --> 01:45:09,476
converging inside the device.

2207
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,278
Now, Cassandra Nova

2208
01:45:10,302 --> 01:45:11,622
is redirecting the Ripper's power

2209
01:45:11,646 --> 01:45:13,777
to eliminate all timelines,
starting with this one.

2210
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:15,121
Theoretically, you could stop her

2211
01:45:15,145 --> 01:45:17,145
by short-circuiting the feeds
in the chamber below.

2212
01:45:17,169 --> 01:45:19,585
One of you were to create a
circuit between the two feeds,

2213
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:22,203
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

2214
01:45:22,227 --> 01:45:24,821
- But, well... But...
- Come on, man.

2215
01:45:24,845 --> 01:45:26,822
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

2216
01:45:26,846 --> 01:45:30,794
Whoever formed the bridge
would be annihilated.

2217
01:45:30,818 --> 01:45:31,530
I could live with that.

2218
01:45:31,554 --> 01:45:33,314
Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.

2219
01:45:33,338 --> 01:45:34,714
You know, we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

2220
01:45:34,738 --> 01:45:35,766
Not this time.

2221
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:37,976
This is matter and anti-matter.

2222
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,802
They do not play nicely with each other.

2223
01:45:39,826 --> 01:45:42,607
When they mix in your body,
you will be atomized.

2224
01:45:42,631 --> 01:45:45,412
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

2225
01:45:45,436 --> 01:45:48,218
Even if you lived long enough
to make the circuit,

2226
01:45:48,242 --> 01:45:51,739
you will die down there.

2227
01:46:16,038 --> 01:46:17,411
Hold off. Hold.

2228
01:46:17,435 --> 01:46:18,715
You heard that asshole upstairs.

2229
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:23,616
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead. Permanently.

2230
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,939
- That's why it's got to be me.
- What?

2231
01:46:29,942 --> 01:46:31,788
Look, man...

2232
01:46:31,812 --> 01:46:34,528
you didn't ask for any of this.

2233
01:46:34,552 --> 01:46:36,035
You were right.

2234
01:46:36,059 --> 01:46:37,563
I lied.

2235
01:46:37,587 --> 01:46:38,894
I lied right to your face

2236
01:46:38,918 --> 01:46:42,163
just to get you to help me. And you did.

2237
01:46:42,559 --> 01:46:44,660
You didn't lie.

2238
01:46:45,694 --> 01:46:47,960
You made an educated wish.

2239
01:46:50,633 --> 01:46:52,006
Come on.

2240
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:55,033
You got a whole world to go back to.

2241
01:46:55,968 --> 01:46:57,739
I got nothin'.

2242
01:46:59,114 --> 01:47:00,874
I got nothin'.

2243
01:47:05,153 --> 01:47:06,913
Give me this.

2244
01:47:13,557 --> 01:47:15,130
Hey.

2245
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:21,400
I waited a long time for this team-up.

2246
01:47:22,962 --> 01:47:24,898
You know something?

2247
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:28,522
You were the best Wolverine.

2248
01:47:36,074 --> 01:47:38,945
Say hi to your friends for me.

2249
01:47:50,604 --> 01:47:51,604
No!

2250
01:47:51,628 --> 01:47:52,242
Open the door!

2251
01:47:52,266 --> 01:47:54,938
I can't hear you
over all the noble sacrifice.

2252
01:47:54,962 --> 01:47:56,510
Why are you fucking doing this?

2253
01:47:56,534 --> 01:48:00,703
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

2254
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:03,277
Or Spock.

2255
01:48:03,937 --> 01:48:05,405
Hard to say.

2256
01:48:09,547 --> 01:48:11,641
Wade!

2257
01:48:11,665 --> 01:48:13,782

01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:19,468
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

2259
01:48:19,492 --> 01:48:22,395
I think I'm nervous about dying.

2260
01:48:22,626 --> 01:48:23,669
This should be me.

2261
01:48:23,693 --> 01:48:26,101
Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.

2262
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:26,804
Wade!

2263
01:48:26,828 --> 01:48:28,939
You want to be an annoying prick,
do it this side!

2264
01:48:28,963 --> 01:48:31,701
You're gonna die in there,
you dumb fuck!

2265
01:48:38,103 --> 01:48:39,949
Hey! You don't need to do this.

2266
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:43,019
I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.

2267
01:48:43,043 --> 01:48:45,847
I'm doing it because they do.

2268
01:48:56,693 --> 01:48:58,299
No!

2269
01:49:26,888 --> 01:49:29,154
He's not gonna make it.

2270
01:49:37,239 --> 01:49:38,999

01:51:44,091 --> 01:51:46,731
It means I'm an X-Man.

You've been busy.

2314
01:52:38,816 --> 01:52:39,628
Well, somebody had to be.

2315
01:52:39,652 --> 01:52:41,796
We had some strange readings
from this location.

2316
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,100
You wouldn't know anything about

2317
01:52:43,124 --> 01:52:44,980
an unsanctioned Time Ripper,
would you?

2318
01:52:45,004 --> 01:52:46,908
Uh, no. No. I wouldn't know anything

2319
01:52:46,932 --> 01:52:48,889
about an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

2320
01:52:48,913 --> 01:52:50,871
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.

2321
01:52:50,895 --> 01:52:51,640
Because I was assured

2322
01:52:51,664 --> 01:52:54,039
that she was safely held
in The Void. But no,

2323
01:52:54,063 --> 01:52:55,974
she was here. And she fondled my brain.

2324
01:52:55,998 --> 01:52:58,714
- How did you let this happen?
- You weren't involved at all?

2325
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:01,783
In stopping her, yes! Yes, I was.

2326
01:53:01,807 --> 01:53:02,717
But not nearly enough.

2327
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:06,448
Not as much as the men
who went down there after her.

2328
01:53:06,778 --> 01:53:08,241
My men.

2329
01:53:08,516 --> 01:53:10,045
My friends.

2330
01:53:10,385 --> 01:53:11,385
I warned them.

2331
01:53:11,409 --> 01:53:13,569
That they would be completely
obliterated if they went.

2332
01:53:13,593 --> 01:53:16,166
But they went anyway. Like...

2333
01:53:16,887 --> 01:53:17,986
Like heroes.

2334
01:53:20,154 --> 01:53:22,321
Because that's who they were.

2335
01:53:23,993 --> 01:53:26,765
They just did what they had to do.

2336
01:53:26,864 --> 01:53:29,768
With no concern for their own safety.

2337
01:53:31,935 --> 01:53:35,685
The fact that we are all still standing here

2338
01:53:35,709 --> 01:53:39,437
is a testament to their heroism.

2339
01:53:42,011 --> 01:53:43,759
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do

2340
01:53:43,783 --> 01:53:45,685
to bring them back now.

2341
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:48,830
He has risen, baby girl.

2342
01:53:48,854 --> 01:53:49,324

And we're doing just fine,
you piece of shit.

2349
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:14,823
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

2350
01:54:14,847 --> 01:54:15,592
Fine indeed.

2351
01:54:15,616 --> 01:54:19,124
All right. Put your greasy tits away,

2352
01:54:19,148 --> 01:54:19,992
you preening slut.

2353
01:54:20,016 --> 01:54:21,708
I don't understand.

2354
01:54:21,732 --> 01:54:23,424
How are you two still alive?

2355
01:54:23,448 --> 01:54:25,801
You were right. One
of us would have been killed.

2356
01:54:25,825 --> 01:54:27,803
But you put a Deadpool

2357
01:54:27,827 --> 01:54:28,638
and a Wolverine together,

2358
01:54:28,662 --> 01:54:31,510
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

2359
01:54:31,534 --> 01:54:33,577
indestructible, motherfucker.

2360
01:54:33,601 --> 01:54:35,910
Let's get this Deadpool
Variant back to The Void.

2361
01:54:35,934 --> 01:54:37,472
Wait, hold on. What?

2362
01:54:37,496 --> 01:54:38,472
Nope. Actually...

2363
01:54:38,496 --> 01:54:40,552
This one's homegrown, like me.

2364
01:54:40,576 --> 01:54:41,514
He belongs here.

2365
01:54:41,538 --> 01:54:42,476
And you are?

2366
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:46,240
Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.

2367
01:54:47,076 --> 01:54:49,045
And I hope that you do.

2368
01:54:54,149 --> 01:54:56,095
What the fuck is happening here?

2369
01:54:56,119 --> 01:54:57,491
You are under judgment

2370
01:54:57,515 --> 01:54:59,703
for operating
an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

2371
01:54:59,727 --> 01:55:01,087
- Take him.
- I was just doing what

2372
01:55:01,111 --> 01:55:02,914
you don't have the guts to do.

2373
01:55:03,631 --> 01:55:07,426
Get your insolent hands off me! Get off!

2374
01:55:07,965 --> 01:55:10,363
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

2375
01:55:10,572 --> 01:55:11,274
Let's hold the bows.

2376
01:55:11,298 --> 01:55:13,816
You led an Omega-level mutant
to this timeline.

2377
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,433
- You're welcome.
- And you

2378
01:55:15,457 --> 01:55:17,512
shouldn't even be near this timeline.

2379
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:19,591
- He's welcome.
- And you

2380
01:55:19,615 --> 01:55:21,692
look damn good in that suit.

2381
01:55:21,716 --> 01:55:23,376
I'm so sorry.

2382
01:55:26,951 --> 01:55:29,382
I wanna show you something.

2383
01:55:29,491 --> 01:55:30,491
Something huge.

2384
01:55:30,515 --> 01:55:33,727
That's what
Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

2385
01:55:34,695 --> 01:55:35,969
Do you see that?

2386
01:55:35,993 --> 01:55:38,699
Your universe is regenerating.

2387
01:55:38,864 --> 01:55:40,501
Whatever you did here,

2388
01:55:40,525 --> 01:55:42,679
you not only saved your world.

2389
01:55:42,703 --> 01:55:46,201
You spared your timeline from extinction.

2390
01:55:47,113 --> 01:55:48,113
I'd rest up.

2391
01:55:48,137 --> 01:55:50,721
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

2392
01:55:50,745 --> 01:55:53,548
Till you're 90.

2393
01:55:53,572 --> 01:55:54,416
Wait! Um...

2394
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:58,289
We couldn't have made it out
of The Void without some help

2395
01:55:58,313 --> 01:56:01,897
from some people
that the world kind of...

2396
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:02,490
kind of forgot.

2397
01:56:02,514 --> 01:56:05,736
Is there any way that
you could maybe find a way

2398
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,761
to bring them home?

2399
01:56:08,464 --> 01:56:09,464
I'll see what I can do.

2400
01:56:09,488 --> 01:56:12,484
And, um, I promised my friend here

2401
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:15,504
that the TVA could undo
some pretty awful shit

2402
01:56:15,528 --> 01:56:16,141
in his timeline.

2403
01:56:16,165 --> 01:56:17,913
What would you say to that?

2404
01:56:17,937 --> 01:56:18,847
Change the past?

2405
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:21,114
Well, he did help me save the world.

2406
01:56:21,138 --> 01:56:24,755
And his past made him
the man who did it.

2407
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:28,177
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

2408
01:56:29,112 --> 01:56:30,784
Logan.

2409
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:35,987
- Shawarma? Yeah.
- I could eat.

2410
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:48,075
You know, the Avengers
discovered shawarma.

2411
01:56:48,099 --> 01:56:50,804
They'd be lucky to have you.

2412
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:59,724
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

2413
01:56:59,748 --> 01:57:01,276
Fuck off!

2414
01:57:01,573 --> 01:57:02,858
Come here, my little cunchkin.

2415
01:57:02,882 --> 01:57:04,729
Yes, it's you.

2416
01:57:04,753 --> 01:57:06,962
You're a survivor.

2417
01:57:06,986 --> 01:57:07,621
Mwah.

2418
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:10,318
Oh, all is right in the world.

2419
01:57:11,022 --> 01:57:12,760
Yes, it is.

2420
01:57:13,552 --> 01:57:15,730
So what are you gonna do next?

2421
01:57:16,027 --> 01:57:19,228
I'll figure it out. I always do.

2422
01:57:19,525 --> 01:57:21,107
All right.

2423
01:57:21,131 --> 01:57:22,428
So I'll probably see you around?

2424
01:57:27,907 --> 01:57:29,667
Probably not.

2425
01:57:32,175 --> 01:57:33,946
See you, bub.

2426
01:57:42,856 --> 01:57:44,682
Logan.

2427
01:57:50,523 --> 01:57:52,034
Al. I'm back.

2428
01:57:52,058 --> 01:57:53,568
About damn time.

2429
01:57:53,592 --> 01:57:56,605
You holdin'? I'm all outta devil's dandruff,

2430
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:58,915
and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.

2431
01:57:58,939 --> 01:58:01,720
Thank you, Al. We have company.

2432
01:58:01,744 --> 01:58:03,221
Althea, this is...

2433
01:58:03,245 --> 01:58:04,722
This is Logan.

2434
01:58:04,746 --> 01:58:07,637
- Nice to meet you, Logan.
- Nice to meet you, too.

2435
01:58:07,661 --> 01:58:10,553
And this little ancient anal
shit-knot is Mary Puppins.

2436
01:58:10,577 --> 01:58:12,829
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

2437
01:58:12,853 --> 01:58:15,931
You want to treat yourself
to a little stroke?

2438
01:58:15,955 --> 01:58:19,732
- Get the tongue. There it is.
- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!

2439
01:58:19,756 --> 01:58:23,533
Right? It's like an armadillo
fucked a gremlin, angrily,

2440
01:58:23,557 --> 01:58:25,105
- in a bed of gonorrhea...
- Wow.

2441
01:58:25,129 --> 01:58:28,693
...and didn't stop till the sun came up.

2442
01:58:28,902 --> 01:58:30,539
Everyone wants to matter.

2443
01:58:30,563 --> 01:58:34,148
Turns out that you don't need
to be Marvel Jesus to do it.

2444
01:58:34,172 --> 01:58:37,921
You just need to open
your eyes and look around.

2445
01:58:37,945 --> 01:58:39,823
And if you're lucky,

2446
01:58:39,847 --> 01:58:41,958
you'll find a few friends.

2447
01:58:41,982 --> 01:58:43,860
Old friends,

2448
01:58:43,884 --> 01:58:46,414
and some new ones too.

2449
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:53,157
Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.

2450
01:59:02,979 --> 01:59:03,979
Oh, hi.

2451
01:59:04,003 --> 01:59:05,938
Hi.

2452
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:09,701
You've been busy.

2453
01:59:11,945 --> 01:59:14,178
I did it for you.

2454
01:59:14,673 --> 01:59:18,644
And even if you don't want me,
I... I did it for you.

2455
01:59:27,191 --> 01:59:28,630
Turns out,

2456
01:59:28,654 --> 01:59:30,401
I am the world-saving type.

2457
01:59:30,425 --> 01:59:34,000
Just look around this table
if you want proof.

2458
01:59:34,099 --> 01:59:35,813
And the best part?

2459
01:59:35,837 --> 01:59:38,707
Sometimes the people we save,

2460
01:59:38,731 --> 01:59:40,137

I was there for three weeks
before I shot a single thing.

2489
02:01:43,064 --> 02:01:45,438
At our first day of shooting,

2490
02:01:45,462 --> 02:01:46,768
I was so nervous, man.

2491
02:01:46,792 --> 02:01:48,980
Everyone was sort of going,
"Who's this guy?"

2492
02:01:49,004 --> 02:01:50,844
You know, there was a lot of that and,

2493
02:01:50,868 --> 02:01:53,327
you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"

2494
02:01:53,351 --> 02:01:55,810

Never the actor.

For medical research.

- Bye-bye, video.
- Bye.

2504
02:06:42,527 --> 02:06:45,804
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors

2505
02:06:45,828 --> 02:06:47,895
that I got Johnny killed.

2506
02:06:48,093 --> 02:06:49,996
Let's look at the tape.

2507
02:06:50,545 --> 02:06:51,545
In The Void,

2508
02:06:51,569 --> 02:06:53,746
you're either food for Alioth

2509
02:06:53,770 --> 02:06:55,738
or you work for her.

2510
02:06:57,905 --> 02:06:59,014
Go on, Johnny.

2511
02:06:59,038 --> 02:07:01,149
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2512
02:07:01,173 --> 02:07:01,753
Cassandra Nova.

2513
02:07:01,777 --> 02:07:03,673
A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.

2514
02:07:03,697 --> 02:07:05,592
A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab

2515
02:07:05,616 --> 02:07:07,991
of third rate dime-store nut-milk.
And I'll tell you

2516
02:07:08,015 --> 02:07:09,745
- what she can do.
- I'm listening.

2517
02:07:09,769 --> 02:07:11,449
She can lick my goddamn
cinnamon ring clean

2518
02:07:11,473 --> 02:07:13,073
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2519
02:07:13,097 --> 02:07:15,471
In fact, I don't give a shit
if she removes all my skin

2520
02:07:15,495 --> 02:07:18,067
and pops me like some
nightmarish blood balloon.

2521
02:07:18,091 --> 02:07:18,836
If the last thing I do

2522
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,971
in this godforsaken cum-gutter existence

2523
02:07:20,995 --> 02:07:22,907
is light that fuck-box on fire,

2524
02:07:22,931 --> 02:07:23,643
I still won't die happy.

2525
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:24,941
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2526
02:07:24,965 --> 02:07:28,176
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until I've urinated

2527
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,831
on her freshly barbecued corpse

2528
02:07:29,855 --> 02:07:31,627
and husk-fucked the charred remains

2529
02:07:31,651 --> 02:07:33,592
while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.

2530
02:07:33,616 --> 02:07:35,557
- Wow!
- And you can quote me.

2531
02:07:35,581 --> 02:07:37,256
'Kay.

2532
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,979
Got you, fuck face.
