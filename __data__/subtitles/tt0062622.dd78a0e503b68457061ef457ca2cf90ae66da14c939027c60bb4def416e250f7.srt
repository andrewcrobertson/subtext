1
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,746
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,714
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:43,755
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,325
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

5
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,327
We haven't seen you up here
for a long time.

6
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:50,796
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,356
- Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
- Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:56,302
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:57,736
May I call him for you?

10
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,205
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:01,071
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,133
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,304
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,814
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,349
- Well, shall we go through?
- Okay.

16
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,884
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,681
- Thank you, Miss Turner.
- Thank you.

18
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:13,812
This way.

19
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,525

Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,691
I think we can manage that.

29
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:58,994
How long have I got?

30
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,695
Your flight leaves
in an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,739
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,773
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,004
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,377
I suppose you saw the work on
the new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:16,281
- Yes, coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:17,607
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:20,917
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:42,140
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact</i>
<i>the Met Office?</i>

39
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,312
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact</i>

40
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:51,215
<i>Yes?</i>

41
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,453
- How are you, squirt?
- <i>All right</i>.

42
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:57,081
What are you doin'?

43
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,527
<i>Playing</i>.

44
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,989
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,928
<i>Gone to shopping</i>.

46
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,496
- Well, who's taking care of ya?
- <i>Rachel</i>.

47
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,459
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,298
<i>She's gone to the bathroom</i>.

49
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:11,971
<i>Are you coming to my party tomorrow?</i>

50
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,702
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,401
<i>Why not?</i>

52
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,179
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,813
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

54
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,082
I'm gonna send you
a very nice present, though.

55
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,847
<i>All right</i>.

56
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,357
- Anything special that you want?
- <i>Yes</i>.

57
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,450
What?

58
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:33,887
<i>A telephone</i>.

59
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,128
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,530
Can't you think of anything else
you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,228
Something very special?

62
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,294
- <i>Yes</i>.
- What?

63
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,731
<i>A bush baby</i>.

64
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,535
A bush baby?
Well, we'll have to see about that.

65
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,474
I want you to tell Mommy
something for me.

66
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:51,444
- Will you remember?
- <i>Yes</i>.

67
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:54,014
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,046
<i>Yes</i>.

69
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,779
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:00,984
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,988
<i>Yes</i>.

72
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:06,026
Okay, sweetheart.
Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:07,152
<i>All right</i>.

74
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:10,262
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,391
<i>All right</i>.

76
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,334
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

77
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:16,768
<i>All right. Bye-bye!</i>

78
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,398
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,945
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,355
What a wonderful surprise
to meet you here!

81
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,656
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:42,821
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,365
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

84
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,560
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

85
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,500
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,199
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:53,740
Won't you sit down?

88
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:56,007
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

89
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,011
Well, thank you.

90
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,180
- Would you like a drink, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

91
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,844
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,547
I'll just sit with you a few minutes
and then I must be off.

93
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:10,648
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,486
- And how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

95
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:17,195
He's been doing some underwater research
in the Baltic so...

96
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:21,461
...l'm afraid we don't get a chance
to see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:23,466
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:24,903
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,133
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

100
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,834
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:34,210
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,916
- And what about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,385
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,448
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but...

105
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,893
...perhaps you can clear up
the great big mystery...

106
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:50,157
...about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,659
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

108
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:55,669
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

109
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:58,865
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,068
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

111
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:06,110
For one thing, whenever you phone
the base all you get is a recording which...

112
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,411
...repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:15,888
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,016
That's what we thought
was the explanation at first...

115
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:21,027
...but it has been going on now
for the past ten days.

116
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:24,062
You have not been able to contact anyone
for the past ten days?

117
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,394
That's right.

118
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:26,725
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,593
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,161
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses
was denied permission...

121
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,707
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,101
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,543
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:42,572
Denying the men permission to land is
a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,675
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:47,186
- Did the crew get back all right?
- Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,882
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:56,787
At the risk of pressing you
on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

129
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,659
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

130
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,198
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:08,065
Quite frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

132
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:11,807
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:15,077
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,715
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

135
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,093
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

136
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:30,325
...l'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

137
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,093
I understand.

138
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:37,727
But this epidemic could quite easily
spread to our base.

139
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:40,137
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,176
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,606
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:53,887
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

143
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:56,423
No, I'm positive.
Now, I really must be going.

144
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:59,722
I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,227
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:04,560
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:08,625
Well, that will all depend on
school vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:09,931
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,370
Don't forget you have a standing invitation
if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,807
No, of course not. Gregor and I will
look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,869
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,280
It has been a pleasure meeting you all,
Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:25,342
Whatever the reasons for your visit
to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,546
Thank you.

155
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,812
Ladies.

156
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:25,021
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,090
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,601
You're welcome.

159
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,639
Well...

160
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:47,620
I know you will all want to join with me
in welcoming our...

161
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,317
...distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:54,325
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:59,795
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius
to be with us today.

164
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,793
And before the briefing I know
he'd like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:05,998
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:21,082
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,486
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,581
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:30,719
First of all, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell who...

170
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:34,159
...has asked me to convey
his deepest appreciation to all of you...

171
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:37,102
...for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

172
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:40,737
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

173
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:46,141
...which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:49,875
Now...

175
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:54,452
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

176
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:58,154
...regarding the need
for complete security in this matter.

177
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,923
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

178
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,889
...created to give the impression
that there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:10,733
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

180
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:15,602
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

181
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:20,078
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:24,278
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

183
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,046
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:34,223
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,461
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,060
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential...

187
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,867
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

188
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:47,998
...contained in this present situation...

189
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:51,036
...if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public...

190
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,602
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

191
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,315
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

192
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:03,522
The purpose of my visit here is
to gather additional facts and opinions...

193
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:05,482
...on the situation...

194
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:08,853
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

195
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,364
...recommending when and how...

196
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:14,628
...the news should eventually
be announced.

197
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:19,466
Now, if any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

198
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,074
...in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,581
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:30,848
Any questions?

201
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:37,853
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer this cover story...

202
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,926
...will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:43,061
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,660
I suppose it will be maintained as long as
is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:50,861
There must be adequate time for
a full study to be made on the situation...

206
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,499
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

207
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:58,170
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

208
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,611
...that formal security oaths are
to be obtained in writing...

209
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:03,377
...from everyone who has any knowledge
of this event.

210
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:07,779
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:17,794
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

212
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,861
...and as there seems
to be no more questions...

213
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,132
...I think we ought to get on
with the briefing.

214
00:45:24,204 --> 00:45:26,331
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

215
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:05,761
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,210
- What we've got?
- You name it.

217
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,816
- What's this? Chicken?
- Something like that.

218
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:18,181
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,748
Any ham?

220
00:47:20,888 --> 00:47:22,549
Ham, ham, ham...

221
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:31,689
- Looks pretty good.
- They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:35,534
That was an excellent speech
you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,899
It certainly was.

224
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,835
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:41,204
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:44,137
I want to say to both of you
that I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:45,610
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,615
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:49,683 --> 00:47:52,481
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,711
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,085
Take a look at them.

232
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:58,454
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:00,584
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:04,354
When we first found it, we thought
it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

235
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:07,832
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

236
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:12,565
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,468
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,135
We thought it might be
the upper part of some buried structure...

239
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,802
...so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:21,040
But, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:24,242
And what's more, the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

242
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,253
...it has not been covered up
by natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,154
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

244
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:32,558
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:38,228
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,562
- Great.
- Good idea.

247
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:48,900
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:50,841
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:55,209
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:48:55,983 --> 00:49:00,044
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly
come up with something.

251
00:58:46,406 --> 00:58:47,498
<i>Good evening</i>.

252
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:51,070
<i>Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,</i>
<i>Discovery One</i>...

253
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:54,045
...<i>left on its half-billion mile voyage</i>
<i>to Jupiter</i>.

254
00:58:54,147 --> 00:58:57,810
<i>This marked the first manned attempt</i>
<i>to reach this distant planet</i>.

255
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:01,517
<i>Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"</i>
<i>recorded an interview</i>...

256
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:05,820
...<i>with the crew of Discovery at a distance</i>
<i>of 80 million miles from Earth</i>.

257
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:10,055
<i>It took seven minutes for our words</i>
<i>to reach the giant spacecraft</i>...

258
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,428
...<i>but this time delay has been edited</i>
<i>from this recording</i>.

259
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:16,195
<i>Our reporter, Martin Amer,</i>
<i>speaks to the crew</i>.

260
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:20,037
<i>The crew of Discovery One</i>
<i>consists of five men</i>...

261
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,900
...<i>and one of the latest generation</i>
<i>of the HAL-9000 computers</i>.

262
00:59:25,612 --> 00:59:27,978
<i>Three of the five men</i>
<i>were put aboard asleep</i>...

263
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,811
...<i>or to be more precise,</i>
<i>in a state of hibernation</i>.

264
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:36,115
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,</i>
<i>Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky</i>.

265
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:39,721
<i>We spoke with Mission Commander,</i>
<i>Dr. David Bowman</i>...

266
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:42,090
...<i>and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole</i>.

267
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,354
<i>Well, good afternoon, gentlemen</i>.
<i>How is everything going?</i>

268
00:59:45,431 --> 00:59:49,128
<i>Marvelous. We have no</i>...
<i>we have no complaints</i>.

269
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,661
<i>Well, I'm very glad to hear that</i>
<i>and I'm sure that the entire world</i>...

270
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,198
...<i>would join me in wishing you</i>
<i>a safe and successful voyage</i>.

271
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,301
- <i>Thanks very much</i>.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

272
00:59:59,445 --> 01:00:03,245
<i>Although hibernation has been used</i>
<i>on previous space efforts</i>...

273
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:07,952
...<i>this is the first time that men have been</i>
<i>put into hibernation before departure</i>.

274
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,386
<i>Why was this done?</i>

275
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,314
<i>Well, this was done in order to achieve</i>
<i>the maximum conservation</i>...

276
01:00:13,393 --> 01:00:16,794
...<i>of our life-support capabilities,</i>
<i>basically food and air</i>.

277
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:20,555
<i>Now, the three hibernating crew members</i>
<i>represent the survey team</i>.

278
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,731
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized</i>
<i>until we are approaching Jupiter</i>.

279
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:28,270
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like</i>
<i>while you are in hibernation?</i>

280
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:33,538
<i>It's exactly like being asleep;</i>
<i>you have absolutely no sense of time</i>.

281
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:36,047
<i>The only difference is you don't dream</i>.

282
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:39,082
<i>As I understand it,</i>
<i>you only breathe once a minute</i>.

283
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:40,414
<i>Is this true?</i>

284
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,644
<i>That's right</i>.

285
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,713
<i>And your heart beats three times a minute,</i>
<i>body temperature is usually down</i>...

286
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,884
...<i>to about three degrees centigrade</i>.

287
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:51,020
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew</i>
<i>was not concerned</i>...

288
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,291
...<i>about the problems of hibernation</i>.

289
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,425
<i>For he was the latest result</i>
<i>in machine intelligence</i>.

290
01:00:57,036 --> 01:01:01,405
<i>The HAL-9000 computer</i>
<i>which can reproduce</i>...

291
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:04,868
...<i>though some experts still prefer</i>
<i>to use the word "mimic"</i>...

292
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:09,904
...<i>most of the activities of the human brain</i>
<i>and with incalculably greater speed</i>...

293
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:11,449
...<i>and reliability</i>.

294
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:15,279
<i>We next spoke</i>
<i>with the HAL-9000 computer</i>...

295
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:18,319
...<i>whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal</i>.

296
01:01:19,192 --> 01:01:21,626
<i>Good afternoon, Hal</i>.
<i>How's everything going?</i>

297
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:25,391
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer</i>.
<i>Everything's going extremely well</i>.

298
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:28,733
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility</i>
<i>on this mission</i>.

299
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:31,361
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>perhaps the greatest responsibility</i>...

300
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,405
...<i>of any single mission element</i>.

301
01:01:33,473 --> 01:01:36,533
<i>You are the brain</i>
<i>and central nervous system of the ship</i>.

302
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:40,511
<i>Your responsibilities include</i>
<i>watching over the men in hibernation</i>.

303
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,447
<i>Does this ever cause you</i>
<i>any lack of confidence?</i>

304
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,910
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer</i>.

305
01:01:46,386 --> 01:01:50,322
<i>The 9000 Series is</i>
<i>the most reliable computer ever made</i>.

306
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:55,793
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made</i>
<i>a mistake or distorted information</i>.

307
01:01:56,929 --> 01:02:00,057
<i>We are all by any practical definition</i>
<i>of the words</i>...

308
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,198
...<i>foolproof and incapable of error</i>.

309
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,031
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,</i>
<i>are you ever frustrated</i>...

310
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:10,905
...<i>by your dependence on people</i>
<i>to carry out actions?</i>

311
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:13,106
<i>Not in the slightest bit</i>.

312
01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:15,643
<i>I enjoy working with people</i>.

313
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:20,242
<i>I have a stimulating relationship</i>
<i>with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman</i>.

314
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,323
<i>My mission responsibilities range</i>
<i>over the entire operation of the ship</i>...

315
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,649
...<i>so I am constantly occupied</i>.

316
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:31,889
<i>I am putting myself</i>
<i>to the fullest possible use</i>...

317
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:37,094
...<i>which is all, I think, that</i>
<i>any conscious entity can ever hope to do</i>.

318
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:41,173
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like living</i>
<i>for the better part of a year</i>...

319
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,401
...<i>in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

320
01:02:44,977 --> 01:02:47,172
<i>It's pretty close to what you said</i>
<i>about him earlier</i>.

321
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:49,476
<i>He's just like the sixth member</i>
<i>of the crew</i>.

322
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:53,645
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea</i>
<i>that he talks. You think of him</i>...

323
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,912
...<i>really as just another person</i>.

324
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:59,889
<i>In talking to the computer</i>
<i>one gets the sense that he is capable</i>...

325
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,516
...<i>of emotional response</i>.

326
01:03:01,594 --> 01:03:03,960
<i>For example, when I asked him</i>
<i>about his abilities</i>...

327
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,966
...<i>I sensed a certain pride in his answer</i>
<i>about his accuracy and perfection</i>.

328
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:11,098
<i>Do you believe that Hal</i>
<i>has genuine emotions?</i>

329
01:03:12,505 --> 01:03:15,531
<i>Oh, yes. Well, he acts</i>
<i>like he has genuine emotions</i>.

330
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:19,407
<i>Of course, he's programmed that way</i>
<i>to make it easier for us to talk to him</i>.

331
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:21,743
<i>But, as to whether or not</i>
<i>he has real feelings</i>...

332
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:25,147
...<i>is something I don't think anyone</i>
<i>can truthfully answer</i>.

333
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:51,400
<i>Excuse me, Frank</i>.

334
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:53,304
What is it, Hal?

335
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:56,246
<i>We've got the transmission</i>
<i>from your parents coming in</i>.

336
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:01,753
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:03,583
<i>Certainly</i>.

338
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:17,969
- <i>Hello, Frank</i>.
- <i>Happy birthday, darling</i>.

339
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:20,301
<i>Happy birthday</i>.
<i>Many happy returns of the day</i>.

340
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,863
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,501
<i>Now, Mother and I are both</i>
<i>feeling wonderful, too</i>.

342
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:26,238
<i>Ray and Sally were going to be here, too</i>...

343
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:29,076
...<i>but at the last minute</i>
<i>Ray's back went bad on him again</i>.

344
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:30,615
<i>How do you like your cake, dear?</i>

345
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:33,083
<i>Looks great, doesn't it?</i>
<i>Sorry you can't be with us</i>.

346
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:35,052
<i>Oh, I ran into Bob the other day</i>.

347
01:04:35,154 --> 01:04:37,145
<i>He said to be sure</i>
<i>and wish you a happy birthday</i>.

348
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:40,124
<i>All my students made me promise</i>
<i>to send their best wishes, too</i>.

349
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:42,023
<i>You know they talk about you</i>
<i>all the time in the classroom</i>.

350
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:44,721
<i>You're a big celebrity in the second grade</i>.

351
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:46,954
<i>You know we were on television</i>
<i>last week?</i>

352
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:50,125
<i>Oh, yes! Your mother and I</i>
<i>and Dave's parents were interviewed</i>...

353
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:52,500
...<i>about what we thought of</i>
<i>our illustrious son</i>.

354
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:56,167
<i>You can imagine what we told them</i>.
<i>I think it's being broadcast next Thursday</i>.

355
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:57,937
<i>Perhaps you'll be able to listen in</i>.

356
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,978
<i>Oh, we were thrilled</i>
<i>about Elaine and Bill, dear</i>.

357
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:03,914
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,</i>
<i>but please tell me how much to spend</i>.

358
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,952
<i>Oh, yes, Frank,</i>
<i>about your AGS-19 payments</i>...

359
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:08,816
<i>I think I straightened it out for you</i>.

360
01:05:08,888 --> 01:05:11,152
<i>I talked to the Accounting Office</i>
<i>in Houston yesterday</i>...

361
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:15,819
...<i>and they said you should be receiving</i>
<i>your higher rates of pay by next month</i>.

362
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:18,394
<i>Well, I can't think of anything else to say</i>.
