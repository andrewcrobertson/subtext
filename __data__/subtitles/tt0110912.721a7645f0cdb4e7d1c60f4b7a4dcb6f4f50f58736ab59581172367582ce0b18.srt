1
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,638
Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:32,001
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,575
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

4
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:37,602
"l'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,777
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

6
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:43,572
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

7
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:45,389
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

8
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,189
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

9
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,817
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

10
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:54,470
- Quack, quack, quack...
- Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,336
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack about never gonna doin' it.

12
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:01,641
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:06,333
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

14
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:10,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,868
I mean, the way it is now,

16
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:15,497
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

17
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,440
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

18
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:21,329
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,260
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.

20
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,983
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

21
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,477
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

22
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:36,163
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

23
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,590
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

24
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,916
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.
Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:47,320
Cleans the place out.
They don't even lift a fuckin' finger.

26
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,981
Did they hurt the little girl?

27
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,886
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl in the first place.

28
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:53,567
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

29
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:56,120
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

30
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,550
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

31
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:02,194
I'm just illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

32
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,885
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

33
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,577
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

34
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,633
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

35
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,067
You tell 'em empty out the register,
they don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.

36
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,471
They make it too personal.

37
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:19,979
- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

38
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:24,189
I don't want to kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.

39
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:25,983
And if it's not the gooks,

40
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:29,444
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

41
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,364
You got Grandpa Irving sitting by the...
behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

42
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,630
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

43
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,250
See how far that gets you.
Fuck it. Forget it.

44
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,052
- We're out of it.
- Yeah well, what then, day jobs?

45
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,699
- Not in this life.
- What then?

46
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,236
Garçon, coffee!

47
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,223
This place.

48
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,420
Garçon means boy.

49
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,962
This place?
A coffee shop?

50
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,359
What's wrong with that?

51
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:06,330
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

52
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:10,247
Bars, liquor stores,

53
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,047
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

54
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,112
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

55
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:21,044
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

56
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,048
- I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

57
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,920
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

58
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,916
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

59
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,724
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

60
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:38,491
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

61
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,057
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

62
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,393
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

63
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,443
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

64
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:51,066
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet,
next minute, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

65
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:56,809
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

66
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,822
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:04,229
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

68
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,959
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

69
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,804
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

70
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:13,460
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,036
Pretty smart.

72
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:20,135
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

73
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:25,074
- Come on.
- All right. Same as last time, remember?

74
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:27,829
You're crowd control.
I'll handle employees.

75
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,383
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

76
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,080
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

77
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,025
Any of you fucking pricks move,

78
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,960
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

79
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,740
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

80
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:42,973
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

81
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:45,243
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

82
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,547
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

83
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,883
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

84
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:52,014
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

85
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,388
- Jungle boogie
- Get down and boogie

86
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,753
- Jungle boogie
- Shake it around

87
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:08,382
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

88
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,290
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

89
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,990
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

90
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:19,397
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

91
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:22,130
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this. Okay.

92
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:24,536
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

93
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:27,803
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

94
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:32,279
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

95
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:36,807
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

96
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:40,821
- I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man! I'm goin'.

97
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,563
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

98
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,682
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

99
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:49,225
- But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
- What?

100
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:53,234
It's the little differences. I mean, they got
the same shit over there that they got here,

101
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,925
- but it's just there, it's a little different.
- Example.

102
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:59,421
Alright, well you can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

103
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,771
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

104
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:07,679
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in
McDonald's. You know what they call...

105
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:11,241
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,184
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

107
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,387
No man, they got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.

108
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,360
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

109
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:21,896
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

110
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,898
What do they call a Big Mac?

111
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:27,265
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

112
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:30,464
Le Big Mac.

113
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,703
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

114
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:38,212
- You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,272
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

116
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,650
- I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

117
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:51,622
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

118
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:57,360
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

119
00:08:57,432 --> 00:09:01,027
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

120
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:04,504
- So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.

121
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,939
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

122
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,671
- What's her name?
- Mia.

123
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:13,943
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

124
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:17,611
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

125
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:20,177
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

126
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:24,692
- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,287
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

128
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:31,992
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

129
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:35,161
- and on this invention they show shows, right?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:39,640
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

131
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,126
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

132
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:45,372
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.

133
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:50,242
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

134
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:53,515
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

135
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,352
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

136
00:09:56,425 --> 00:10:00,259
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."

137
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:03,729
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

138
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,632
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

139
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:11,139
- I think I know who you mean. What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

140
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:15,438
Word 'round the campfire is it was on
account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

141
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:27,612
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

142
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:31,386
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

143
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,892
A foot massage?

144
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,023
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,034
Then what'd Marsellus do?

146
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:43,265
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

147
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:47,274
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

148
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:51,403
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

149
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,744
Nigger fell through that.

150
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,750
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

151
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,950
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

152
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,460
- But still I have to say, you play with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?

153
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:13,695
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

154
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,389
You don't think he overreacted?

155
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:21,173
Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react
the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

156
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:25,407
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

157
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,007
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

158
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:33,987
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy
out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

159
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,148
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

160
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:38,818
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

161
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:42,830
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

162
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:45,833
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

163
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:49,667
But you know, touchin' his wife's feet and
sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...

164
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:54,004
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the
same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

165
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:57,943
- Look, foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

166
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,107
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

167
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,845
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

168
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,151
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

169
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,885
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

170
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:13,308
Fuck you.

171
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:17,347
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

172
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:21,498
- You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage myself.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

173
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,767
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

174
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,401
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

175
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,891
What time you got?

176
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:36,009
7:22 in the a.m.

177
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:39,645
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

178
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,995
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

179
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:54,263
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

180
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:57,066
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

181
00:12:57,138 --> 00:13:00,620
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

182
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,419
You know what I'm sayin'?

183
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:06,403
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a
massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

184
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:11,111
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

185
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:14,917
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

186
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,083
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

187
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:20,389
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

188
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:25,525
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

189
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,003
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a
man with a sense of humor about this shit.

190
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,869
You know what I'm sayin'?

191
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,875
It's an interestin' point.

192
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,877
Come on.
Let's get into character.

193
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,820
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

194
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,913
- Mia.
- Why you so interested in big man's wife?

195
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,223
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked
me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

196
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:58,255
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out, you know.

197
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,700
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

198
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,295
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

199
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,690
It is not a date.

200
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:10,820
You know, it's just like if you were gonna take
your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

201
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:14,773
It's just good company, that's all.

202
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:23,551
It's not a date. It's
definitely not a date.

203
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,759
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

204
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,490
Hey, keep chillin'.

205
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,468
You know who we are?

206
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,499
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

207
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:52,603
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

208
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:58,251
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

209
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:03,314
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:07,725
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

211
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,626
don't ya, Brett?

212
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:11,358
Yeah, I remember.

213
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:15,766
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

214
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:18,465
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

215
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,507
Hamburgers.

216
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,671
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

217
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,345
What kind of hamburgers?

218
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,145
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

219
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:33,312
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

220
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,186
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

221
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:39,385
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

222
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,396
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I
ain't never had one myself. How are they?

223
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,160
They're... They're good.

224
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,862
You mind if I try one of yours?

225
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,370
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

226
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,677
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

227
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,277
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

228
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:10,814
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

229
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:14,328
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

230
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:18,229
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

231
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,427
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

232
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:24,665
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

233
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:29,267
You know what they call a
Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?

234
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,403
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

235
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:35,506
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

236
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,041
You know why they call it that?

237
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,180
Uh, because of
the metric system?

238
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:46,556
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

239
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:49,960
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

240
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,427
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

241
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:56,436
Sprite. Good.

242
00:16:56,504 --> 00:17:00,372
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

243
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,963
Go right ahead.

244
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,589
That hit the spot.

245
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:21,719
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

246
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:25,323
- Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over...

247
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,995
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

248
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,504
You were sayin'?

249
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,634
It's in the cupboard.

250
00:17:39,414 --> 00:17:42,383
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

251
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,230
We happy?

252
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,624
Vincent?

253
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:11,080
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

254
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:17,647
Look, I'm sorry, uh, l...
I didn't get your name.

255
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:20,915
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

256
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:26,324
- My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

257
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,730
I just want you to know how...

258
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:36,859
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

259
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,133
with us and Mr. Wallace.

260
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:42,349
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never...

261
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:47,179
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

262
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:49,842
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

263
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:55,082
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

264
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:00,393
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

265
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:03,191
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

266
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,726
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

267
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,999
What?

268
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:15,338
- What country you from?
- What?

269
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:19,675
- "What" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?

270
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:22,443
- English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?
- Yes!

271
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,212
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

272
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,721
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

273
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:30,416
- What? l...
- Say "what" again!

274
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:34,427
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

275
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:38,397
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

276
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:40,798
- Go on!
- He's bald!

277
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,598
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

278
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:49,366
Does he look... like a bitch?

279
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,343
- No!
- Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

280
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:56,212
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

281
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,025
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

282
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:02,962
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

283
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:07,085
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

284
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:11,723
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
Sort of fits this occasion.

285
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,131
Ezekiel 25:17.

286
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:17,500
"The path of the righteous man..."

287
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:21,508
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

288
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:24,511
and the tyranny of evil men.

289
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:29,516
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

290
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,747
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

291
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,482
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

292
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:39,117
and the finder of lost children.

293
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:42,993
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

294
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:45,032
and furious anger...

295
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:49,763
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

296
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:53,671
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

297
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,142
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

298
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:18,025
I think you gonna find...

299
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,761
when all this shit
is over and done...

300
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:26,805
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

301
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:31,174
The thing is, Butch,

302
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:34,271
right now...
you got ability.

303
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,384
But painful as it may be,

304
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:41,615
ability... don't last.

305
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,902
And your days are just about over.

306
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:52,165
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

307
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:57,261
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

308
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:04,634
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

309
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:08,671
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

310
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:14,115
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

311
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:19,622
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

312
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,263
Besides, Butch,

313
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,628
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

314
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:30,898
Hmm?

315
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,939
Two?

316
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,442
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

317
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:42,539
You came close,
but you never made it.

318
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:46,814
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

319
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:05,801
You my nigger?

320
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,878
Certainly appears so.

321
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,256
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

322
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,760
That's pride fuckin' with you.

323
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:33,425
Fuck pride!

324
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,195
Pride only hurts.

325
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:40,206
It never helps.

326
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,667
You fight through that shit.

327
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,082
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

328
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:55,095
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

329
00:23:57,064 --> 00:24:01,330
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.

330
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:05,201
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

331
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:11,210
Say it.

332
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,916
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

333
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,377
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

334
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:25,915
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

335
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:29,827
- Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

336
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:33,162
Where's the big man?

337
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:36,168
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

338
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:40,696
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

339
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,674
How ya been?

340
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:49,682
- I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

341
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,152
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

342
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,486
At Marsellus's request.

343
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,321
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

344
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,594
What's so fuckin' funny?

345
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,261
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

346
00:25:09,336 --> 00:25:13,602
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

347
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:16,336
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

348
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,378
Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

349
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:21,573
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

350
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:24,708
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

351
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:27,276
Asshole.

352
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,722
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

353
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,730
No.

354
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:44,469
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

355
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:50,065
- What's that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

356
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,737
Vincent Vega's in the house?

357
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:56,112
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

358
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,488
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

359
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,721
You shouldn't worry about it.

360
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:11,764
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

361
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:16,600
And some matches.

362
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:21,640
Thanks.

363
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,844
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

364
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,817
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

365
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:36,288
Well, you see how they use that gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

366
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:40,224
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

367
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:45,163
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

368
00:26:45,232 --> 00:26:48,724
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

369
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:51,930
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

370
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:54,872
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

371
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:58,400
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

372
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:00,412
I was just curious,

373
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,348
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

374
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:07,910
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

375
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:11,947
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

376
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,792
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

377
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:25,304
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

378
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:28,307
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

379
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:32,812
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

380
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,848
But this one
is a little more expensive.

381
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,316
This is 500 a gram.

382
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:41,786
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

383
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:45,951
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

384
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:49,689
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

385
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:52,527
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

386
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,625
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood? No.

387
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:58,865
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

388
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,931
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

389
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,376
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

390
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:08,744
- any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

391
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:12,683
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

392
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:16,746
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

393
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:20,691
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

394
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:25,420
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

395
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,935
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

396
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:31,766
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

397
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:36,036
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

398
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,272
That is what a nice guy I am.

399
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:43,442
- And I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

400
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,508
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

401
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:50,522
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

402
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,558
Okay.

403
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:56,153
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

404
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:59,528
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

405
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,763
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

406
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:06,271
That's my wife.

407
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:10,935
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

408
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,879
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

409
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:17,678
I'll take a rain check.

410
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:21,084
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

411
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,453
Still got your Malibu?

412
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:27,618
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

413
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,628
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

414
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:33,291
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

415
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,062
I had it in storage
for three years.

416
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:40,470
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

417
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,977
They should be fuckin' killed, man.
No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

418
00:29:45,045 --> 00:29:49,778
Oh I wish I could've caught him doin' it.
I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doin' it.

419
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,583
- It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!

420
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:57,452
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

421
00:29:57,524 --> 00:30:00,425
- I mean don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

422
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,894
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

423
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:05,124
Thank you.

424
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:07,996
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

425
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:11,367
Muchas gracias.

426
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:58,401
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

427
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:02,674
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

428
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:13,557
Hello?

429
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:18,119
Billy Raye was a preacher's son and when
his daddy would visit he'd come along

430
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,323
Vincent.

431
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,899
Vincent.

432
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,903
I'm on the intercom.

433
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:29,599
Where is...
Where is the intercom?

434
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:33,007
It's on the wall
by the two African fellas.

435
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,171
To your right.

436
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:40,409
Warm.

437
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,578
Warmer.

438
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,645
Disco.

439
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:47,316
Hello?

440
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:50,725
Push the button
if you want to talk.

441
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:52,854
Hello?

442
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:56,765
Go make yourself a drink and
I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

443
00:32:56,835 --> 00:33:00,236
The bar's by the fireplace.

444
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:04,166
Okay.

445
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:06,676
When he started
sweet talkin' to me

446
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:09,508
He come and tell me
everything is all right

447
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:12,243
He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right

448
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,251
Can I get away again tonight

449
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,913
The only one who could
ever reach me

450
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:19,616
Was the son of a preacher man

451
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:22,751
The only boy
who could ever teach me

452
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:25,796
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

453
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:28,162
He was

454
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,861
Lord he knows he was
Yes he was

455
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:35,939
How will I remember

456
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,737
The look was in his eyes

457
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,301
Stealing kisses from me
on the sly

458
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:43,973
Taking time to make time

459
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:46,539
Telling me that he's all mine

460
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:49,553
Learning from each other's knowin'

461
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,714
Looking to see
how much we've grown

462
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:54,257
And the only one
who could ever reach me

463
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:56,589
Was the son of a preacher man

464
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,630
The only boy
who could ever teach me

465
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,063
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was

466
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:04,931
Was, was
He was

467
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,699
Oh, yes he was

468
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:09,603
Let's go.

469
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:17,214
Fuck is this place?

470
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:20,774
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

471
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,184
An Elvis man should love it.

472
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:27,452
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

473
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,323
Don't be a...

474
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:33,831
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

475
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:57,050
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

476
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:59,954
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

477
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,925
We reserved a car.

478
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:07,111
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,967

00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:34,787
I've been waitin' in school
all day long

485
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,952
Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home

486
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:39,519
Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone

487
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,690
- Come on, baby
- Coffee, please? Decaf.

488
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,064
- Just a minute.
- Heading down to the drugstore to get a soda pop

489
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:46,501
Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock

490
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,630
School's out, baby
Gonna tell you some news

00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,765

Five, six, come get your kicks

00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:07,714

496
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:11,523
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

497
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:16,232
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

498
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:19,702
- Fantastic job, Rick. Thank you very much.
- Vincent!

499
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:27,974
Just to let you all know,
Ricky will be back in the second half of our show,

500
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:31,607
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

501
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:33,049
Thank you.

502
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:36,006
Call for...

503
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:42,251
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

504
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:47,026
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

505
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:50,932
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

506
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:57,805
Let's see, steak, steak, steak.
Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

507
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,673
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

508
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:04,044
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and...

509
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:06,845
Oh, yeah, look at this...
Vanilla Coke.

510
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:08,886
What about you, Peggy Sue?

511
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:12,286
I'll have the...

512
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:16,691
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

513
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:20,663
And... a five-dollar shake.

514
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:23,462
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

515
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:27,664
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

516
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,798
Mm-hmm.

517
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:33,037
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

518
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:37,514
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?

519
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,948
- No.
- Just checking.

520
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:42,713
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

521
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:44,721
To Lonesome Town

522
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:48,748
To cry my troubles away

523
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:54,422
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

524
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:57,366
You can have this one, cowgirl.

525
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:59,369
Thanks.

526
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,837
The streets are filled
with regret

527
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:06,133
Think nothin' of it.

528
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,044
Lay me down in Lonesome Town

529
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:13,641
- I can learn to forget
- So...

530
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:16,812
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

531
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:20,016
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

532
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:22,616
Just over three years.

533
00:38:25,163 --> 00:38:27,996
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

534
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:31,796
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

535
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:34,804
Why would you?

536
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,411
I heard you did a pilot.

537
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,377
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

538
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:51,150
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

539
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:53,952
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

540
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,289
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

541
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,828
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

542
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,660
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

543
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:05,429
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

544
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:08,631
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

545
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:12,767
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

546
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:15,711
French fox's speciality was sex.

547
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,149
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

548
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,251
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

549
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:26,186
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

550
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:30,521
According to the show, she was the
deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

551
00:39:30,593 --> 00:39:33,357
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

552
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:37,559
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

553
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:40,932
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

554
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,871
where every show
I would've told another joke.

555
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:48,839
You know any of them old jokes?

556
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:52,642
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

557
00:39:52,715 --> 00:39:55,275
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

558
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,278
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

559
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:02,051
- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr...

560
00:40:02,124 --> 00:40:06,060
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

561
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:09,996
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

562
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:12,398
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

563
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:15,904
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

564
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:18,566
What a gyp.

565
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:22,108
Martin and Lewis.

566
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:27,581
Vanilla Coke.

567
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:35,254
Mmm. Yummy.

568
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:38,293
You think I could
have a sip of that?

569
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,990
Be my guest.

570
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,091
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

571
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:49,626
- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

572
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:52,572
Cooties I can handle.

573
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:54,610
All right.

574
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:04,482
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

575
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:08,614
- Told ya.
- I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

576
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,086
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

577
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:49,495
Uncomfortable silences.

578
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,028
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

579
00:41:56,105 --> 00:42:00,041
I don't know.
That's a good question.

580
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,842
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

581
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:09,613
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

582
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:13,781
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,
but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

583
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,419
I'll tell you what.

584
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,759
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

585
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:25,028
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

586
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,202
I'll do that.

587
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,473
Okay.

588
00:42:57,733 --> 00:42:59,928
I said goddamn!

589
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:03,165
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

590
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:08,369
I need some hair spray.

591
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,207
Mmmm.

592
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:20,619
Don't you just love it when you come back from
the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?

593
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:23,089
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

594
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,287
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

595
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:29,490
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

596
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,625
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

597
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:35,033
That is Marilyn Monroe.

598
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:37,834
That is Mamie Van Doren.

599
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:42,844
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off or somethin'.

600
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,348
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

601
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:50,784
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

602
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,389
However...

603
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,118
you seem like
a really nice person, and l...

604
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:02,028
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

605
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:07,297
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,
boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

606
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:10,361
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

607
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,272
Well, well, I do. I do.

608
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:17,403
- But you have to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

609
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,712
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

610
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:26,653
So you can go ahead and ask me what you're gonna ask me,
and my natural response could be to get offended.

611
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:29,088
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

612
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:31,854
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

613
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:35,988
Trying to forget anything as intriguing
as this would be an exercise in futility.

614
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:38,260
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

615
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:43,362
- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission?
- All right, all right.

616
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:46,237
Well, here goes.

617
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,334
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

618
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:52,847
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

619
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:56,146
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

620
00:44:56,218 --> 00:45:00,917
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.

621
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,153
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

622
00:45:04,226 --> 00:45:09,357
Yet even another way is to say he was thrown
out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

623
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:11,865
- Is that a fact?
- No.

624
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:15,062
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.
That's just what I heard.

625
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:18,038
- Who told you?
- They.

626
00:45:18,107 --> 00:45:20,575
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

627
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:25,407
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

628
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:29,884
- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did "they" say?
- I'm... I'm not shy.

629
00:45:29,952 --> 00:45:32,477
- Um...
- Did it involve the "F" word?

630
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:36,548
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that
Antwan had given you a foot massage.

631
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:40,721
- And?
- And... And nothin'.

632
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:41,863
That's it.

633
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,791
You heard Marsellus...

634
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,237
threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story
window for giving me a foot massage?

635
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:52,240
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

636
00:45:52,308 --> 00:45:56,836
I could... Well, I mean
at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.

637
00:45:56,912 --> 00:46:00,006
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

638
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:02,842
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

639
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:06,077
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

640
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:09,417
I mean I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

641
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:14,121
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

642
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:17,927
A husband almost killing another man for
touching his wife's feet is something else.

643
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,194
But did it happen?

644
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:26,505
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

645
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,175
Really?

646
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:31,777
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that fourth-story window...

647
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,382
except Marsellus and Tony.

648
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,443
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

649
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:42,455
Ladies and gentlemen.
Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

650
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:47,552
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

651
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:54,299
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

652
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,830
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

653
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:02,468
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

654
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:04,808
- Right here!
- All right!

655
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,906
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

656
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:12,716
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

657
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,224
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

658
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,989
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

659
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:21,270
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

660
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,002
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

661
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,642
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

662
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:35,514
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?

663
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,576
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

664
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,282
And how 'bout your fella here?

665
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,188
Vincent Vega.

666
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,695
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

667
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,697
- Go for it.
- Come on!

668
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,943
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

669
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,915
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

670
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:23,092
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

671
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:29,368
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

672
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,405
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale

673
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:41,580
The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

674
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,355
But when Pierre found work the
little money comin' worked out well

675
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,725
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

676
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,801
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

677
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,104
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

678
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,940
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

679
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:18,912
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

680
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:48,646
They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

681
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,646
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

682
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,057
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

683
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,497
I don't know what you call that.

684
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,194
Drinks! Music!

685
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,433
I'm gonna take a piss.

686
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:47,466
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, Vince but go right ahead.

687
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,457
Girl

688
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,391
Bomp, bomp, bom

689
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,953
You'll be a woman soon

690
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,602
I love you so much
Can't count all the ways

691
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,662
I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is

692
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,937
He's not your kind

693
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:25,243
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

694
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,681
What I'm gonna find

695
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,847
Don't let them make up your mind

696
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,789
Don't you know, girl

697
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,788
You'll be a woman soon

698
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,957
One drink, and that's it.

699
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,867
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

700
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,906
Say good night...
and go home.

701
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,440
You'll be a woman soon

702
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,707
Soon

703
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,251
You'll be a woman

704
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,120
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

705
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:12,125
But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife

706
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,561
The boy's no good

707
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,327
Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for

708
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,803
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure
Sure they would

709
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:24,567
Baby, I've done all I could

710
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:29,305
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

711
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,644
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

712
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:36,015
Because... being loyal
is very important.

713
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:40,682
You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around

714
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:43,385
What I'm gonna find

715
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,419
Don't let them make up your mind

716
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,330
Don't you know, girl

717
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,769
You'll be a woman soon

718
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,241
Please

719
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,606
Come take my hand

720
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,683
Girl

721
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,955
You'll be a woman soon

722
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,291
Please

723
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:20,524
Come take my hand

724
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,166
- Hello.
- Girl

725
00:53:26,635 --> 00:53:29,171
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night."

726
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:32,264
I've had a very lovely evening."

727
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:37,405
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,
jerk off, and that's all you gonna do.

728
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,187
Now it's up to you, girl

729
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:50,882
You'll be a woman soon

730
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,463
Please

731
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,160
Come take my hand

732
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,036
Girl

733
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,804
You'll be a woman soon

734
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,480
Soon

735
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,643
You'll be a woman

736
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,526
All right, Mia.

737
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,691
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?

738
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,204
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

739
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,003
You fu...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

740
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,374
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!

741
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:47,132
Oh... Come on, girl.
We're gettin' outta here. We gotta walk now.

742
00:54:56,909 --> 00:55:00,003
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

743
00:55:00,078 --> 00:55:02,012
Fuck!

744
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:11,122
Answer.

745
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,624
Have you got the ring?

746
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:17,526
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

747
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:20,030
Please! Please!

748
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:22,760
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

749
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:31,168
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

750
00:55:36,248 --> 00:55:38,182
Now what do you say?

751
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,185
I give up!
I'll marry you!

752
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:45,917
Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

753
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:49,560
I can hear it.

754
00:55:49,628 --> 00:55:53,064
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call here this late!

755
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:54,465
Yeah, I told them.

756
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:58,398
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

757
00:55:59,972 --> 00:56:02,805
- Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

758
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:05,139
Lance! Vincent.

759
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,145
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

760
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:12,309
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

761
00:56:12,384 --> 00:56:15,649
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

762
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:20,055
I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, man!
Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

763
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:22,184
- No choice.
- Wh... She's O.D.in'?

764
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:25,458
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

765
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:29,728
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,
and you take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

766
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:32,235
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

767
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:36,035
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

768
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:38,941
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

769
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:41,445
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

770
00:56:41,513 --> 00:56:44,846
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

771
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:55,860
The hell was that?

772
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:00,263
Have you lost your fucking mind?

773
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:03,267
- You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.

774
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:06,270
- You crashed your car into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

775
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:09,774
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

776
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:12,276
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

777
00:57:12,314 --> 00:57:14,478
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is? Do you?
- Yeah.

778
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:17,002
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

779
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:22,946
Now look, I will be forced to tell him that you did
not help and that... and you let her die on your fucking lawn.

780
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:25,956
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

781
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:28,959
Shit.

782
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:33,395
Lance!

783
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:35,399
Shit.

784
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:37,901
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

785
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,303
What the fuck's going on out here?

786
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:43,307
Who's she?

787
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,310
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

788
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,437
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

789
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:50,572
- Get her the hell outta here!
- Get the shot!

790
00:57:50,649 --> 00:57:54,176
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

791
00:57:54,252 --> 00:57:56,186
You just keep talking to her,
all right?

792
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:58,689
She's gettin' the shot.
I'm going to go get my little black medical book.

793
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:00,548
The fuck you need
a medical book for?

794
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:03,181
- I've never had to give an adrenalin shot before!
- You've never given an adrenaline shot?

795
00:58:03,405 --> 00:58:04,243
I never had to, alright!

796
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,793
I don't go joy-poppin' with a bunch of bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

797
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:08,566
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

798
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,769
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

799
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:14,271
- Get the shot!
- All right!

800
00:58:17,442 --> 00:58:20,878
- Hurry up, Lance. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

801
00:58:20,946 --> 00:58:22,880
What's he looking for?

802
00:58:22,948 --> 00:58:25,883
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

803
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:28,886
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

804
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:33,050
My little black fucking medical book!
It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

805
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,060
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

806
00:58:36,128 --> 00:58:39,063
- If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

807
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:43,067
- Stop bothering me!
- Listen, while you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

808
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:45,069
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

809
00:58:45,137 --> 00:58:49,039
- I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!

810
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:53,339
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

811
00:58:53,412 --> 00:58:56,848
- Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. Come on.
- Okay. Look, while I'm doing this,

812
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:59,139
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

813
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,996
- Does it gotta be exact?
- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.

814
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,131
We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so I guess it's gotta be fuckin' exact.

815
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:06,890
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I'm gonna think it's right here.

816
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:10,621
- That's it.
- This it? All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

817
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:12,629
- You got it?
- What?

818
00:59:12,697 --> 00:59:15,393
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

819
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:18,095
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

820
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:23,233
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

821
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:28,902
- Hurry up, man.
- Here, I'll tell you what to do.

822
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,915
- No, no, no, man, I ain't gi... You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

823
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:35,218
- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before.
- I ain't giving her the shot. Yeah, I never done this before either, alright!

824
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:37,978
I ain't starting now! Look, you brought her here,
and that means you give her the shot.

825
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:41,457
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house,
then I give her the shot. Give her the shot.

826
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:43,460
- Give it to me. Give me that.
- Here.

827
00:59:44,428 --> 00:59:46,463
All right, tell me what to do.

828
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:50,223
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

829
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:52,836
But she's got a breastplate...
You gotta pierce through that.

830
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:55,899
So what you gotta do is...
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.

831
00:59:55,907 --> 00:59:59,443
- I gotta... I gotta stab her three times?
- No, you don't gotta fucking stab her three times! You just gotta stab her once!

832
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:02,547
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

833
01:00:02,614 --> 01:00:05,549
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

834
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:08,608
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

835
01:00:08,686 --> 01:00:11,121
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

836
01:00:11,189 --> 01:00:14,625
- She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's...
- All right, count to three.

837
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:16,888
- All right. Ready?
- One.

838
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:23,691
Two.

839
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:33,644
Three!

840
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:51,491
If you're all right,
then say something.

841
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:54,589
Something.

842
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,990
That was fuckin' trippy.

843
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:02,504
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

844
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:29,133
Mia. Mia.

845
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:33,737
What's...

846
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:36,603
What's your thoughts on... on...

847
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,700
On how to handle this?

848
01:01:38,777 --> 01:01:40,711
What's yours?

849
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:48,284
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

850
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:51,750
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

851
01:01:51,884 --> 01:01:54,682
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

852
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,812
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

853
01:01:56,889 --> 01:01:59,380
I seriously doubt that.

854
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,393
I can keep a secret if you can.

855
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,364
Shake on it?

856
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,868
Mum's the word?

857
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,873
Cool.

858
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:20,275
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

859
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,949
Vincent.

860
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:29,845
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

861
01:02:30,923 --> 01:02:32,857
Sure.

862
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:35,951
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

863
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:38,963
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

864
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:42,364
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

865
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:44,629
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

866
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:47,570
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

867
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,073
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

868
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:54,306
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

869
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,314
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

870
01:02:57,382 --> 01:02:59,475
"Ketchup."

871
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,255
Ketchup.

872
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,520
See you around.

873
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,280
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

874
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:38,289
He think totem pole alive!

875
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:41,087
He arctic tenderfoot!

876
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:45,822
That totem pole been here forever!

877
01:03:45,897 --> 01:03:46,831
Butch?

878
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:49,766
One more thing, and we'll start for...

879
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:52,770
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

880
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:56,467
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

881
01:03:59,244 --> 01:04:04,181
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

882
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:07,980
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

883
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,988
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

884
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:18,262
Hello, little man.

885
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:22,426
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

886
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:25,732
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

887
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:28,830
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

888
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:31,375
over five years.

889
01:04:31,443 --> 01:04:33,377
Hopefully...

890
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:36,380
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

891
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:39,884
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

892
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:42,750
for as long as we were,

893
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:47,121
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

894
01:04:47,192 --> 01:04:49,126
If it'd been me who'd...

895
01:04:50,462 --> 01:04:52,396
Not made it,

896
01:04:52,464 --> 01:04:56,730
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

897
01:04:56,802 --> 01:05:00,465
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

898
01:05:01,873 --> 01:05:03,807
Butch...

899
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:07,278
I got something for ya.

900
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,844
This watch I got here...

901
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:20,722
was first purchased by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

902
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:25,456
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

903
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,091
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

904
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:32,102
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

905
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,333
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

906
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:38,342
on the day he set sail for Paris.

907
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:40,844
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

908
01:05:40,912 --> 01:05:44,279
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

909
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:47,910
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

910
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:52,423
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

911
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:56,928
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

912
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:00,726
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

913
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,257
This time they called it
World War ll.

914
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:09,330
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

915
01:06:09,408 --> 01:06:12,400
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

916
01:06:12,477 --> 01:06:15,412
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

917
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,507
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

918
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:22,519
Your granddad was facing death.

919
01:06:22,587 --> 01:06:24,521
He knew it.

920
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:29,125
None of those boys ever had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive,

921
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:31,790
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

922
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:37,096
your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki...

923
01:06:37,169 --> 01:06:40,104
A man he'd never met before
in his life...

924
01:06:40,172 --> 01:06:43,141
To deliver to his infant son,

925
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:47,804
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

926
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:52,213
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

927
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:56,550
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

928
01:06:56,621 --> 01:07:00,853
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

929
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:02,860
This watch.

930
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:14,172
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

931
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,675
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

932
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:21,804
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

933
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,407
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

934
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:29,181
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

935
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,190
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their
greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

936
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:37,194
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something... his ass.

937
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:40,698
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

938
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:44,964
Then he died of dysentery...
He give me the watch.

939
01:07:45,036 --> 01:07:48,904
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

940
01:07:48,974 --> 01:07:50,908
Then...

941
01:07:50,976 --> 01:07:55,037
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

942
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,047
now...

943
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:02,419
Iittle man,
I give the watch to you.

944
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:27,211
It's time, Butch.

945
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:37,888
In the heavyweight division,

946
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:41,119
in the right corner wearing
the blue trunks,

947
01:08:41,193 --> 01:08:44,458
weighing 210 pounds,

948
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,657
Floyd Ray Wilson!

949
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:52,669
It's official. It's official.

950
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:55,172
- Wilson is dead!
- Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,

951
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,774
and hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

952
01:08:57,843 --> 01:09:01,338
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.

953
01:09:01,363 --> 01:09:04,348
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes, Richard.

954
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:08,352
I could see from my position the frenzy in his eyes
give way to the realization of what he was doing.

955
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,856
- I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
- Dan, do you feel this tragedy...

956
01:09:11,923 --> 01:09:13,257
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing?

957
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:17,361
Oh, Richard, a tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

958
01:09:17,429 --> 01:09:21,865
But it's of paramount importance, during the sad
weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...

959
01:09:56,701 --> 01:09:59,033
Man, you know I didn't...

960
01:09:59,104 --> 01:10:02,039
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

961
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:04,041
I didn't do it.

962
01:10:04,109 --> 01:10:06,600
- How you doing?
- Great.

963
01:10:06,678 --> 01:10:09,112
I never thanked you for dinner.

964
01:10:11,016 --> 01:10:12,950
- What you got?
- He booked.

965
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:16,112
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

966
01:10:16,187 --> 01:10:19,623
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think."

967
01:10:19,691 --> 01:10:23,286
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

968
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:26,297
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

969
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,799
Butch's search...
How do you want it done?

970
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:31,802
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

971
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,306
If Butch goes to Indochina,
I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

972
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:37,500
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

973
01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:39,712
I will take care of it.

974
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,821
Mister.

975
01:10:54,727 --> 01:10:57,218
- Hey, mister.
- What?

976
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:02,097
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

977
01:11:02,168 --> 01:11:05,604
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

978
01:11:05,671 --> 01:11:08,435
No, come on.

979
01:11:08,508 --> 01:11:10,442
You're him.

980
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,944
I know you're him.

981
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,580
Tell me you're him.

982
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,583
I'm him.

983
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:22,119
You killed the other boxing man.

984
01:11:25,758 --> 01:11:27,851
He's dead?

985
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:30,361
The radio said he was dead.

986
01:11:33,132 --> 01:11:35,362
Sorry about that, Floyd.

987
01:11:36,669 --> 01:11:39,160
What does it feel like?

988
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:41,172
What does what feel like?

989
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,174
Killing a man.

990
01:11:44,944 --> 01:11:49,005
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

991
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:51,015
What are you, a weirdo?

992
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,017
No.

993
01:11:53,085 --> 01:11:56,521
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

994
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:02,026
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

995
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,964
So?

996
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:10,298
What does it feel like to kill a man?

997
01:12:11,404 --> 01:12:13,338
I'll tell you what.

998
01:12:13,406 --> 01:12:17,342
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up
there, and I'll tell you all about it.

999
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:38,292
So, Esmarelda...

1000
01:12:39,599 --> 01:12:43,000
Villa Lobos...
Is that Mexican?

1001
01:12:43,069 --> 01:12:46,300
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1002
01:12:46,372 --> 01:12:49,671
- That's some handle you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

1003
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:51,676
And what is your name?

1004
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:53,439
Butch.

1005
01:12:53,513 --> 01:12:55,981
Butch.

1006
01:12:56,048 --> 01:13:00,815
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1007
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:03,549
So, moving right along,

1008
01:13:03,623 --> 01:13:05,557
Esmarelda,

1009
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,889
what is it you want to know?

1010
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,829
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1011
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:23,175
Didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1012
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:27,838
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1013
01:13:31,584 --> 01:13:35,020
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1014
01:13:45,998 --> 01:13:48,432
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1015
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:52,437
As soon as the word got out the fix was in,
man, the odds went through the roof.

1016
01:13:52,505 --> 01:13:54,700
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1017
01:13:54,774 --> 01:13:58,210
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1018
01:13:58,277 --> 01:13:59,511
If he never laced up his gloves,

1019
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:02,713
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1020
01:14:04,784 --> 01:14:08,379
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1021
01:14:08,454 --> 01:14:11,389
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1022
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:15,154
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1023
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:18,162
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1024
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,664
All eight?
How long to collect?

1025
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:25,236
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
No, I understand.

1026
01:14:25,304 --> 01:14:28,467
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1027
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:30,771
That is great news, man.

1028
01:14:30,843 --> 01:14:35,041
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1029
01:14:35,114 --> 01:14:38,379
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1030
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:40,385
Okay, my brother.

1031
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:42,421
You're right.

1032
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:44,820
You're goddamn right.

1033
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:48,382
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1034
01:14:48,461 --> 01:14:50,793
Cool, brother.

1035
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:08,379
$45.60.

1036
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,885
And, uh,

1037
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:17,252
here's a little something
for the effort.

1038
01:15:17,323 --> 01:15:21,259
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1039
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:23,261
The truth.

1040
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:26,821
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1041
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:31,134
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1042
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:33,728
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1043
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,784
Whew.

1044
01:15:48,154 --> 01:15:50,145
Keep the light off.

1045
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:53,157
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1046
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,564
Hard day at the office?

1047
01:15:59,632 --> 01:16:01,566
Pretty hard.

1048
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:03,864
Got in a fight.

1049
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:06,097
Poor baby.

1050
01:16:06,172 --> 01:16:08,732
Can you make spoons?

1051
01:16:08,808 --> 01:16:11,743
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1052
01:16:11,811 --> 01:16:15,747
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1053
01:16:15,815 --> 01:16:18,249
Let me take this jacket off.

1054
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:23,946
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1055
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:25,957
I wish I had a pot.

1056
01:16:27,727 --> 01:16:31,663
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror, and you wish you had some pot?

1057
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:34,666
A pot.
A pot belly.

1058
01:16:34,734 --> 01:16:36,895
Pot bellies are sexy.

1059
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:39,267
Well, you should be happy,

1060
01:16:39,338 --> 01:16:41,272
'cause you have one.

1061
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,798
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1062
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:48,745
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."

1063
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:50,748
It's not the same thing.

1064
01:16:50,816 --> 01:16:54,752
I didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1065
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,754
The difference is huge.

1066
01:16:56,822 --> 01:17:00,258
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1067
01:17:00,326 --> 01:17:02,260
No.

1068
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:06,765
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1069
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:09,926
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1070
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:15,440
The rest of you is normal... normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...

1071
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:19,569
But with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1072
01:17:19,645 --> 01:17:22,580
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1073
01:17:22,648 --> 01:17:24,582
to accentuate it.

1074
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,084
You think men
would find that attractive?

1075
01:17:27,153 --> 01:17:30,316
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1076
01:17:30,389 --> 01:17:33,847
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1077
01:17:33,926 --> 01:17:35,860
is seldom the same.

1078
01:17:39,265 --> 01:17:42,860
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1079
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:45,870
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1080
01:17:45,938 --> 01:17:47,872
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1081
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,876
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1082
01:17:51,944 --> 01:17:53,878
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1083
01:17:53,946 --> 01:17:55,914
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1084
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,352
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1085
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:06,023
Oh.

1086
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:11,395
Did you get everything?

1087
01:18:11,463 --> 01:18:14,455
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1088
01:18:14,533 --> 01:18:16,467
Did everything go as planned?

1089
01:18:16,535 --> 01:18:19,265
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1090
01:18:19,338 --> 01:18:21,272
You didn't listen to the radio?

1091
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,639
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1092
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,008
I won, all right.

1093
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:30,048
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1094
01:18:30,115 --> 01:18:32,481
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1095
01:18:33,919 --> 01:18:37,355
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1096
01:18:45,297 --> 01:18:48,164
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1097
01:18:49,735 --> 01:18:52,670
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1098
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,675
But they won't find us,
will they?

1099
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:03,514
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1100
01:19:05,084 --> 01:19:08,747
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's...

1101
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:17,727
Say it.

1102
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:20,390
Fabienne,

1103
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:23,594
I want you to be with me.

1104
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:26,661
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1105
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,775
Do you love me?

1106
01:19:30,843 --> 01:19:32,834
Very, very much.

1107
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,110
- Butch.
- Yes?

1108
01:19:42,554 --> 01:19:45,148
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1109
01:19:46,659 --> 01:19:48,593
Will you kiss it?

1110
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,724
But you first.

1111
01:19:52,798 --> 01:19:55,631
- Okay.
- Okay.

1112
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:08,142
Butch.

1113
01:20:08,213 --> 01:20:11,649
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1114
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:29,740
I think I cracked a rib.

1115
01:20:29,809 --> 01:20:33,245
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1116
01:20:33,312 --> 01:20:36,748
- Don't call me "retard."
- My name is Fabby.

1117
01:20:36,816 --> 01:20:39,307
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1118
01:20:39,385 --> 01:20:41,319
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi...

1119
01:20:41,387 --> 01:20:44,322
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1120
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:47,484
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1121
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,495
I take it back.

1122
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:55,433
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1123
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:59,437
Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1124
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:01,939
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

1125
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:04,942
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1126
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,137
And I took it back.

1127
01:21:07,213 --> 01:21:09,306
Butch?

1128
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:11,315
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1129
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:14,819
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1130
01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:17,014
Wherever you want.

1131
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:18,924
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1132
01:21:19,092 --> 01:21:21,027
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1133
01:21:21,095 --> 01:21:26,030
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1134
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:30,034
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1135
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:33,538
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1136
01:21:33,606 --> 01:21:36,541
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1137
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:40,045
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1138
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:42,046
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1139
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:44,048
But I do not speak Spanish.

1140
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:47,085
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1141
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:49,121
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1142
01:21:49,188 --> 01:21:52,123
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- What does that mean?

1143
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:54,125
Where is the shoe store?

1144
01:21:54,193 --> 01:21:56,127
- ¿Donde esta...
- Spit, please.

1145
01:21:58,197 --> 01:22:01,462
- ¿Donde esta el zapateria?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1146
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:03,559
Mmm.

1147
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:06,935
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1148
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,531
- ¿Que hora es?
- ¿Que hora es?

1149
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:11,769
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1150
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,472
Time for bed.

1151
01:22:14,547 --> 01:22:16,481
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1152
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,124
Butch?

1153
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:33,965
Never mind.

1154
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,568
Aah!

1155
01:22:43,642 --> 01:22:47,703
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1156
01:22:58,157 --> 01:23:02,423
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1157
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:04,428
I'm not sure the name.

1158
01:23:06,332 --> 01:23:09,426
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1159
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:15,333
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1160
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:22,614
- What was it about?
- How should I know? You were the one watching it.

1161
01:23:22,681 --> 01:23:26,674
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1162
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,686
I don't remember.

1163
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,689
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1164
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,726
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1165
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:39,730
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1166
01:23:39,798 --> 01:23:42,426
One more kiss, and I'll get up.

1167
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:47,801
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1168
01:23:47,873 --> 01:23:51,309
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1169
01:23:51,377 --> 01:23:54,437
Ohh. God.

1170
01:23:55,748 --> 01:23:59,275
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1171
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:03,117
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1172
01:24:03,188 --> 01:24:07,557
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?

1173
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,756
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1174
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,764
with maple syrup,

1175
01:24:13,832 --> 01:24:17,268
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1176
01:24:17,336 --> 01:24:19,531
Anything to drink with that?

1177
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:23,268
Wow, that looks nice.

1178
01:24:23,342 --> 01:24:26,675
To drink... A tall glass
of orange juice...

1179
01:24:26,745 --> 01:24:29,179
and a black cup of coffee.

1180
01:24:29,248 --> 01:24:33,810
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1181
01:24:33,886 --> 01:24:37,822
Any time of the
day is a good time for pie.

1182
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:40,825
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1183
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,885
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1184
01:24:43,962 --> 01:24:45,896
Where's my watch?

1185
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:52,633
It's there.

1186
01:24:52,705 --> 01:24:55,299
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1187
01:24:55,374 --> 01:24:59,640
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1188
01:24:59,712 --> 01:25:01,839
You sure you got it?

1189
01:25:01,914 --> 01:25:04,212
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1190
01:25:04,283 --> 01:25:07,446
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1191
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,682
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1192
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:13,623
Well, it should be.

1193
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:17,492
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's
not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1194
01:25:23,068 --> 01:25:26,504
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1195
01:25:28,173 --> 01:25:32,610
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1196
01:25:32,678 --> 01:25:35,013
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1197
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:41,017
All this other shit you could've set on fire,
but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.

1198
01:25:41,086 --> 01:25:42,417
Now think.

1199
01:25:42,488 --> 01:25:46,015
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1200
01:25:46,091 --> 01:25:49,356
"You believe so"? What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1201
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:52,697
Then I did.

1202
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,000
Are you sure?

1203
01:25:57,102 --> 01:25:59,036
No.

1204
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:03,074
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1205
01:26:03,142 --> 01:26:05,508
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'...

1206
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:10,211
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1207
01:26:10,282 --> 01:26:12,216
No!

1208
01:26:14,853 --> 01:26:16,787
It's not your fault.

1209
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,027
You left it at the apartment.

1210
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:33,037
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1211
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,235
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1212
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:42,380
I reminded you about it,

1213
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:47,215
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1214
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:51,313
If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,
I shoulda told you that.

1215
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:53,824
You're not a mind reader.

1216
01:26:53,892 --> 01:26:55,826
Are you?

1217
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,905
I... I'm sorry.

1218
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:11,568
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1219
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,339
Why does it mean that?

1220
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:20,248
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1221
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:23,978
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1222
01:27:24,056 --> 01:27:28,322
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1223
01:27:28,393 --> 01:27:31,624
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1224
01:27:31,697 --> 01:27:33,631
then I'll split.

1225
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:37,999
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1226
01:27:43,275 --> 01:27:46,335
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1227
01:27:46,411 --> 01:27:48,276
Have a nice breakfast.

1228
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:51,783
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie."

1229
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,284
Blueberry pie.

1230
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,514
Maybe not that fast.

1231
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:59,785
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1232
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,190
- Bye.
- Bye.

1233
01:28:02,261 --> 01:28:05,196
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1234
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:07,198
she forgets my father's watch!

1235
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:09,200
I specifically reminded her...

1236
01:28:09,268 --> 01:28:11,395
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1237
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:14,735
I said the words-
"Don't forget my father's watch."

1238
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,658
Visit the
Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...

1239
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:47,966
I EI burro!

1240
01:30:51,641 --> 01:30:53,575
Lookin' good, Butch.

1241
01:33:42,678 --> 01:33:44,737
If I were walkin' in your shoes

1242
01:33:52,288 --> 01:33:57,726
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all

1243
01:33:57,793 --> 01:34:02,230
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1244
01:34:02,298 --> 01:34:05,233
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.

1245
01:34:05,301 --> 01:34:08,532
- Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1246
01:34:08,604 --> 01:34:10,538
Now don't tell me

1247
01:34:12,108 --> 01:34:15,566
Countin' flowers on the wall

1248
01:34:15,645 --> 01:34:19,103
That don't bother me at all

1249
01:34:19,181 --> 01:34:24,710
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one

1250
01:34:24,787 --> 01:34:29,520
Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

1251
01:34:29,592 --> 01:34:32,493
Now don't tell me

1252
01:34:32,562 --> 01:34:34,996
I've nothin' to do

1253
01:34:35,064 --> 01:34:37,362
It's good to see you I must go

1254
01:34:37,433 --> 01:34:39,492
I know I look a fright

1255
01:34:39,569 --> 01:34:42,037
- Anyway my eyes
- Motherfucker!

1256
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:44,470
- Are not accustomed...
- Uhh!

1257
01:34:52,648 --> 01:34:55,082
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1258
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:57,381
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1259
01:35:07,263 --> 01:35:11,199
If you need someone to go to court, I'll be glad to help, okay.
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1260
01:35:11,267 --> 01:35:14,202
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1261
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:16,204
- Who?
- Him.

1262
01:35:20,276 --> 01:35:22,471
I'll be damned.

1263
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:35,657


1264
01:35:38,127 --> 01:35:40,425
Aaaah! I'm shot!

1265
01:35:47,236 --> 01:35:50,637
Sally! Sally!

1266
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:56,077
Aaah!

1267
01:35:58,414 --> 01:36:00,348
Motherfucker!

1268
01:36:02,985 --> 01:36:06,443
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1269
01:36:06,522 --> 01:36:09,457
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now!

1270
01:36:09,525 --> 01:36:11,493
What the fuck you up to?

1271
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,188
Come here, motherfucker!

1272
01:36:14,263 --> 01:36:17,164
You feel that sting, big boy, huh?

1273
01:36:17,233 --> 01:36:19,167
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see?

1274
01:36:19,235 --> 01:36:22,671
You gotta fight through that shit!
Huh?

1275
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:25,730
- You'd better kill me...
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1276
01:36:25,808 --> 01:36:28,368
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to...

1277
01:36:28,444 --> 01:36:30,969
Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1278
01:36:31,047 --> 01:36:34,813
- This ain't none of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1279
01:36:34,884 --> 01:36:37,614
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1280
01:36:37,687 --> 01:36:39,712
Toss the weapon.

1281
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:44,954
It's time

1282
01:36:45,027 --> 01:36:47,723
- To find love
- Take your foot off the nigger,

1283
01:36:47,797 --> 01:36:49,731
put your hand behind your head,

1284
01:36:49,799 --> 01:36:51,858
approach the counter right now.

1285
01:36:51,934 --> 01:36:53,959
This motherfucker's trying to...

1286
01:36:54,036 --> 01:36:55,367
kill me.

1287
01:36:55,438 --> 01:36:59,204
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1288
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,237
If love

1289
01:37:04,313 --> 01:37:06,247
Is shelter

1290
01:37:23,799 --> 01:37:25,733
Zed. Maynard.

1291
01:37:26,902 --> 01:37:29,837
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.

1292
01:37:29,905 --> 01:37:33,341
Whoa, my angel

1293
01:37:35,911 --> 01:37:38,613
Down to you

1294
01:37:38,614 --> 01:37:39,046
Down to you

1295
01:38:17,675 --> 01:38:20,610
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...

1296
01:38:20,678 --> 01:38:23,613
except me or Zed.

1297
01:38:25,883 --> 01:38:27,817
That's Zed.

1298
01:38:40,465 --> 01:38:43,901
- I thought you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1299
01:38:48,206 --> 01:38:51,141
Then how come they're all beat up?

1300
01:38:51,209 --> 01:38:55,475
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1301
01:38:55,546 --> 01:38:59,880
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1302
01:38:59,951 --> 01:39:03,318
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1303
01:39:03,387 --> 01:39:05,981
Huh?

1304
01:39:07,992 --> 01:39:11,052
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?

1305
01:39:11,128 --> 01:39:14,359
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1306
01:39:14,432 --> 01:39:17,026
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1307
01:39:18,503 --> 01:39:22,769
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1308
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:26,605
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1309
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:30,613
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1310
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,654
Get up.

1311
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,870
Get down.

1312
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:39,883
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first?

1313
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:43,682
I ain't for sure yet.

1314
01:40:47,224 --> 01:40:49,886
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1315
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:52,555
catch a nigger...

1316
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:55,224
by his toe.

1317
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:59,065
If he hollers, let him go.

1318
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:03,266
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1319
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,177
My mother said...

1320
01:41:09,246 --> 01:41:12,841
pick the perfect one,

1321
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:15,909
and... you... are...

1322
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,289
it.

1323
01:41:21,626 --> 01:41:24,686
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1324
01:41:24,762 --> 01:41:27,230
Shh.

1325
01:41:29,033 --> 01:41:33,595
- You wanna do it in here?
- No, let's take him back to Russell's old room.

1326
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,401
Sounds good to me.

1327
01:42:00,331 --> 01:42:03,425
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1328
01:42:32,393 --> 01:42:33,853
Yeah!

1329
01:42:36,434 --> 01:42:39,631
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1330
01:42:39,704 --> 01:42:43,140
Now, motherfucker! Aaah!

1331
01:42:43,207 --> 01:42:47,644
Come on! Yeah!

1332
01:42:53,818 --> 01:42:56,912
Yeah!

1333
01:43:03,794 --> 01:43:05,785
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1334
01:43:08,232 --> 01:43:11,668
Yeah! Yeah!

1335
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,105
Yeee!
Yeeee-hah!

1336
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:38,695
Yeah!

1337
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:10,090
Come on!
Get down there!

1338
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:15,961
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!

1339
01:44:33,083 --> 01:44:36,075
Yeah! Yeah!

1340
01:44:51,569 --> 01:44:55,005
Shut the fuck up!

1341
01:44:56,774 --> 01:44:58,708
Fuck him!

1342
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,812
Come on!

1343
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:09,853
Fuck him. Yeah.

1344
01:45:19,964 --> 01:45:22,476
Aaaaah!

1345
01:45:27,014 --> 01:45:29,574
Aaaaah!

1346
01:45:40,594 --> 01:45:42,824
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?

1347
01:45:44,498 --> 01:45:46,432
Huh?

1348
01:45:47,434 --> 01:45:49,368
Go ahead and pick it up.

1349
01:45:51,772 --> 01:45:54,104
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1350
01:45:56,377 --> 01:45:58,868
Come on...
Thatta boy!

1351
01:46:00,447 --> 01:46:04,543
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1352
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:11,849
Step aside, Butch.

1353
01:46:24,104 --> 01:46:27,130
Fuck!

1354
01:46:29,743 --> 01:46:32,678
You okay?

1355
01:46:34,048 --> 01:46:36,209
No, man.

1356
01:46:36,283 --> 01:46:39,218
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1357
01:46:50,397 --> 01:46:53,332
What now?

1358
01:46:55,669 --> 01:46:57,603
"What now"?

1359
01:46:58,973 --> 01:47:02,409
Let me tell you what now.

1360
01:47:02,476 --> 01:47:05,411
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1361
01:47:05,479 --> 01:47:08,414
to go to work
on the homes here...

1362
01:47:08,482 --> 01:47:11,417
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1363
01:47:13,387 --> 01:47:16,083
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1364
01:47:17,358 --> 01:47:19,918
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1365
01:47:19,994 --> 01:47:22,929
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1366
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,135
I meant what now
between me and you.

1367
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:36,608
Oh, that "what now."

1368
01:47:38,045 --> 01:47:41,981
I tell you what now between me and you.

1369
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:46,485
There is no me and you.

1370
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:49,855
Not no more.

1371
01:47:52,926 --> 01:47:54,860
So, are we cool?

1372
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:58,528
Yeah, we cool.

1373
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:00,726
Two things.

1374
01:48:02,503 --> 01:48:05,438
Don't tell nobody about this.

1375
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:10,536
This shit is between me, you...

1376
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:15,071
and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-In-Agonizing-Pain"...

1377
01:48:15,149 --> 01:48:17,083
rapist here.

1378
01:48:18,385 --> 01:48:21,149
It ain't nobody else's business.

1379
01:48:21,314 --> 01:48:22,614
Two...

1380
01:48:23,223 --> 01:48:26,715
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1381
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:29,895
And when you gone,

1382
01:48:29,963 --> 01:48:31,897
you stay gone,

1383
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:34,900
or you be gone.

1384
01:48:34,968 --> 01:48:37,903
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1385
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:41,674
Deal.

1386
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:44,844
Get your ass outta here.

1387
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:14,255
Oh, shit.

1388
01:49:46,555 --> 01:49:48,989
Fabienne!

1389
01:49:50,058 --> 01:49:52,993
Fabienne!

1390
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:56,322
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1391
01:49:56,398 --> 01:49:59,834
- Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1392
01:49:59,901 --> 01:50:03,337
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1393
01:50:03,405 --> 01:50:05,339
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1394
01:50:05,407 --> 01:50:09,343
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1395
01:50:12,848 --> 01:50:14,782
Come on, honey!

1396
01:50:16,852 --> 01:50:19,320
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1397
01:50:19,388 --> 01:50:23,916
- It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Come on, let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1398
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,758
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1399
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:30,229
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1400
01:50:34,803 --> 01:50:38,639
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1401
01:50:38,707 --> 01:50:41,242
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we...

1402
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:44,245
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1403
01:50:45,914 --> 01:50:49,350
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here.

1404
01:50:49,418 --> 01:50:51,352
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1405
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:56,156
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1406
01:50:56,224 --> 01:50:58,359
Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. I didn't mean
to worry you. Everything's fine.

1407
01:50:58,427 --> 01:51:00,361
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1408
01:51:00,429 --> 01:51:02,363
Did you get the pancakes?
The blueberry pancakes?

1409
01:51:02,431 --> 01:51:05,867
They didn't have blueberry pancakes;
I had to get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1410
01:51:05,935 --> 01:51:08,570
Honey, since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1411
01:51:08,638 --> 01:51:11,869
the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life...
Hop on, I'll tell you all about it.

1412
01:51:11,881 --> 01:51:14,606
Come on. Get on.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Come on.

1413
01:51:14,676 --> 01:51:17,440
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1414
01:51:17,512 --> 01:51:20,106
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1415
01:51:20,182 --> 01:51:22,116
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1416
01:51:22,184 --> 01:51:24,744
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1417
01:51:40,936 --> 01:51:43,234
Yes, you did, Brett!

1418
01:51:43,305 --> 01:51:47,532
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...

1419
01:51:47,608 --> 01:51:49,742
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1420
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:52,505
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die. Please.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1421
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:56,517
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1422
01:51:56,584 --> 01:51:58,245
Sorta fits the occasion.

1423
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,619
Ezekiel 25:17.

1424
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:05,990
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides..."

1425
01:52:06,061 --> 01:52:07,995
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1426
01:52:08,063 --> 01:52:11,499
and the tyranny of evil men.

1427
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:16,230
Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1428
01:52:16,304 --> 01:52:19,330
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1429
01:52:19,408 --> 01:52:21,933
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1430
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:24,740
and the finder of lost children.

1431
01:52:24,813 --> 01:52:29,079
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1432
01:52:29,151 --> 01:52:31,312
and furious anger...

1433
01:52:31,386 --> 01:52:35,789
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

1434
01:52:35,857 --> 01:52:39,725
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1435
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:43,196
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1436
01:52:51,273 --> 01:52:53,707
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck.

1437
01:52:53,775 --> 01:52:56,710
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1438
01:52:56,778 --> 01:52:59,713
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1439
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:02,716
- Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1440
01:53:02,784 --> 01:53:06,781
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1441
01:53:07,214 --> 01:53:10,218
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1442
01:53:38,386 --> 01:53:41,822
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1443
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:44,757
Slip your mind?
Did you forget that someone was in there...

1444
01:53:44,826 --> 01:53:46,760
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1445
01:53:46,828 --> 01:53:50,764
You see the size of that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

1446
01:53:55,537 --> 01:53:58,233
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1447
01:53:58,306 --> 01:54:00,240
I know.
We was lucky.

1448
01:54:00,308 --> 01:54:03,436
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1449
01:54:03,512 --> 01:54:07,710
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1450
01:54:07,782 --> 01:54:09,716
You know what
divine intervention is?

1451
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,524
I think so.

1452
01:54:17,592 --> 01:54:21,028
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1453
01:54:21,096 --> 01:54:23,530
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1454
01:54:23,598 --> 01:54:26,567
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1455
01:54:27,802 --> 01:54:29,793
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1456
01:54:29,871 --> 01:54:32,305
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1457
01:54:32,374 --> 01:54:36,310
- What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill, Jules. This shit happens.

1458
01:54:36,378 --> 01:54:39,142
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen."

1459
01:54:39,214 --> 01:54:42,650
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1460
01:54:42,717 --> 01:54:45,151
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1461
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:47,848
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1462
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:52,155
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1463
01:54:52,227 --> 01:54:56,926
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1464
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:07,306
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1465
01:55:10,286 --> 01:55:11,683
You ever seen that show Cops?

1466
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:13,989
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1467
01:55:14,057 --> 01:55:17,993
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1468
01:55:18,061 --> 01:55:21,519
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened.
He didn't hit nothin'.

1469
01:55:21,598 --> 01:55:24,533
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1470
01:55:24,601 --> 01:55:27,934
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1471
01:55:28,004 --> 01:55:32,941
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1472
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:35,944
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1473
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:38,708
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

1474
01:55:38,782 --> 01:55:40,943
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1475
01:55:41,017 --> 01:55:44,077
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1476
01:55:44,154 --> 01:55:47,214
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...
I'm through.

1477
01:55:47,290 --> 01:55:50,225
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1478
01:55:50,293 --> 01:55:54,286
- Yeah, and I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1479
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:58,170
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1480
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:00,194
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1481
01:56:00,157 --> 01:56:04,568
Well, you gotta have an opinion.
I mean do you think that God came down from Heaven and stopped...

1482
01:56:05,598 --> 01:56:06,653
What the fuck's happenin'?

1483
01:56:06,745 --> 01:56:08,384
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1484
01:56:08,511 --> 01:56:11,446
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1485
01:56:11,514 --> 01:56:13,448
I didn't mean to do.
It was an accident.

1486
01:56:13,516 --> 01:56:16,451
- Oh, man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this...
- Chill out, man!

1487
01:56:16,519 --> 01:56:19,454
I told you it was an accident.
We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1488
01:56:19,522 --> 01:56:20,856
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1489
01:56:20,884 --> 01:56:24,857
Hey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.
The gun went off. I don't know why.

1490
01:56:24,928 --> 01:56:28,364
Look at this fuckin' mess, man!
We're on a city street in broad daylight here!

1491
01:56:28,431 --> 01:56:30,466
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1492
01:56:30,534 --> 01:56:34,892
We gotta get this car off the road. You know cops tend to
notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fucking blood.

1493
01:56:34,971 --> 01:56:37,906
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1494
01:56:37,974 --> 01:56:39,508
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1495
01:56:39,577 --> 01:56:43,412
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1496
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,815
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1497
01:56:45,883 --> 01:56:50,010
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- It's just over the hill here, over by Burbank Studios.

1498
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:53,021
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do, man,

1499
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:56,024
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1500
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:59,027
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1501
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:03,031
Me and my homeboy are in some serious fuckin' shit, man.
We're in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1502
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:05,294
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1503
01:57:06,803 --> 01:57:09,738
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1504
01:57:09,806 --> 01:57:12,805
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1505
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:16,445
- If he does, what do we do?
- Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple calls,

1506
01:57:16,513 --> 01:57:19,008
but I don't want it to reach that pitch...
Jimmie's a friend.

1507
01:57:19,016 --> 01:57:21,751
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1508
01:57:21,819 --> 01:57:24,453
Well, just tell him not to be abusive,
that's all.

1509
01:57:24,521 --> 01:57:26,455
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1510
01:57:26,523 --> 01:57:29,686
Put yourself in his position...
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1511
01:57:29,759 --> 01:57:31,693
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1512
01:57:31,761 --> 01:57:34,696
Shit. We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1513
01:57:34,764 --> 01:57:38,700
If that favor means I gotta take shit,
he can stick that favor straight up his ass. I don't care.

1514
01:57:38,768 --> 01:57:42,704
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

1515
01:57:42,772 --> 01:57:45,707
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1516
01:57:45,775 --> 01:57:49,336
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1517
01:57:49,412 --> 01:57:51,346
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1518
01:57:51,414 --> 01:57:52,998
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1519
01:57:53,006 --> 01:57:56,351
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1520
01:57:56,419 --> 01:57:58,954
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this, Vincent?

1521
01:57:59,002 --> 01:58:03,518
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1522
01:58:03,593 --> 01:58:07,029
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1523
01:58:07,097 --> 01:58:11,557
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me in this position, all right?

1524
01:58:11,634 --> 01:58:14,330
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1525
01:58:14,404 --> 01:58:17,339
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1526
01:58:17,407 --> 01:58:20,342
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1527
01:58:22,078 --> 01:58:24,945
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1528
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:27,108
This some serious gourmet shit.

1529
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:29,117
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1530
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:31,153
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1531
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:33,155
Right?

1532
01:58:33,223 --> 01:58:36,158
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1533
01:58:36,226 --> 01:58:38,285
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1534
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:42,388
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is. Okay?

1535
01:58:42,465 --> 01:58:44,956
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1536
01:58:45,035 --> 01:58:46,969
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1537
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:50,666
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1538
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:54,676
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1539
01:58:54,744 --> 01:58:56,905
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1540
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:01,416
- Jimmie, don't even worry...
- Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1541
01:59:01,483 --> 01:59:02,417
When you came pulling in here,

1542
01:59:02,485 --> 01:59:05,682
did you notice the sign on the front of my
house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?

1543
01:59:05,755 --> 01:59:09,691
- Jimmie, you know I ain't seen no shit...
- Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...

1544
01:59:09,759 --> 01:59:11,193
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1545
01:59:11,261 --> 01:59:13,991
No. I didn't.

1546
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:16,999
- You know why you didn't see that sign?
- Why?

1547
01:59:17,067 --> 01:59:21,595
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead
niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1548
01:59:21,671 --> 01:59:24,606
- Jimmie, we're not gonna store the motherfucker...
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you fuckin' realize, man...

1549
01:59:24,674 --> 01:59:29,111
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1550
01:59:29,179 --> 01:59:32,410
Alright, no marriage counselor. No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1551
01:59:32,482 --> 01:59:35,849
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1552
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:40,913
Man, you know, fuck, I mean I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it. Alright?

1553
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:43,083
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1554
01:59:43,159 --> 01:59:47,095
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1555
01:59:47,163 --> 01:59:51,622
There's nothin' that you're gonna say that's gonna
make me forget that I love my wife. Is there?

1556
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:58,934
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1557
01:59:59,008 --> 02:00:02,068
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1558
02:00:02,145 --> 02:00:05,205
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1559
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:09,217
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1560
02:00:09,285 --> 02:00:12,220
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1561
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:15,257
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in. That's all.

1562
02:00:15,325 --> 02:00:18,260
You don't wanna fuck my shit up?
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1563
02:00:18,328 --> 02:00:21,422
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1564
02:00:21,498 --> 02:00:24,990
So just do me that favor, alright?
The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1565
02:00:25,068 --> 02:00:28,003
Well, say she comes home.

1566
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:30,505
What do you think she'll do?

1567
02:00:32,008 --> 02:00:34,442
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1568
02:00:34,511 --> 02:00:36,706
That ain't no kinda answer.

1569
02:00:36,779 --> 02:00:39,839
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1570
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:43,183
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1571
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:44,786
this Bonnie situation is.

1572
02:00:44,854 --> 02:00:48,790
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...

1573
02:00:48,858 --> 02:00:50,792
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1574
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:53,920
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1575
02:00:56,099 --> 02:00:58,033
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1576
02:00:58,101 --> 02:01:00,695
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1577
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:03,405
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1578
02:01:03,473 --> 02:01:07,709
All I want to hear from your ass is,
"You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker."

1579
02:01:07,777 --> 02:01:11,941
Go back in there. Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."

1580
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:15,178
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1581
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:17,378
I'm on the motherfucker.

1582
02:01:17,453 --> 02:01:22,516
Go back in there and chill them niggers out
and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1583
02:01:22,592 --> 02:01:25,026
You sendin' the Wolf?

1584
02:01:25,094 --> 02:01:27,289
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1585
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:29,627
Shit, yeah, negro!

1586
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:32,827
That's all you had to say!

1587
02:01:32,902 --> 02:01:36,099
She the hysterical type?

1588
02:01:36,172 --> 02:01:39,107
When is she due?

1589
02:01:39,175 --> 02:01:41,268
Mm-hmm.

1590
02:01:41,344 --> 02:01:43,278
Give me
the principals' names again.

1591
02:01:43,346 --> 02:01:45,280
Place your bets.

1592
02:01:46,349 --> 02:01:50,012
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1593
02:01:50,086 --> 02:01:52,020
Vincent.

1594
02:01:56,759 --> 02:01:58,693
Jimmie.

1595
02:01:59,929 --> 02:02:02,056
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1596
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:10,567
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1597
02:02:27,384 --> 02:02:30,319
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1598
02:02:30,387 --> 02:02:34,016
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1599
02:02:34,091 --> 02:02:37,026
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1600
02:02:37,094 --> 02:02:39,028
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1601
02:02:39,096 --> 02:02:42,759
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1602
02:02:42,833 --> 02:02:45,267
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1603
02:02:45,335 --> 02:02:48,270
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1604
02:02:48,338 --> 02:02:49,592
Uh, one hundred percent.

1605
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:54,276
- Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., is that correct?
- Uh-huh.

1606
02:02:54,344 --> 02:02:58,838
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds
us here, she wouldn't appreciate it too much.

1607
02:02:58,915 --> 02:03:03,215
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1608
02:03:03,287 --> 02:03:06,723
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1609
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:11,124
Now, you got a corpse in a car,
minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1610
02:03:18,869 --> 02:03:20,803
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1611
02:03:20,871 --> 02:03:24,307
Do me a favor, will ya?
Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1612
02:03:24,374 --> 02:03:27,810
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1613
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:32,214
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1614
02:03:32,282 --> 02:03:34,842
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1615
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:40,356
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1616
02:03:40,424 --> 02:03:43,500
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it? Anything.

1617
02:03:43,527 --> 02:03:47,363
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
- Positive?

1618
02:03:47,431 --> 02:03:50,427
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1619
02:03:50,434 --> 02:03:54,995
- Hey, man. As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1620
02:03:55,072 --> 02:03:57,097
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1621
02:04:02,746 --> 02:04:05,681
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1622
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,454
Mmm.

1623
02:04:13,523 --> 02:04:15,650
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1624
02:04:15,726 --> 02:04:18,661
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1625
02:04:18,729 --> 02:04:21,059
Now Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1626
02:04:21,243 --> 02:04:23,025
That would lead me to believe that in the garage,
under the sink...

1627
02:04:23,073 --> 02:04:25,832
- you got a bunch of cleaners and cleansers and shit like that?
- Yeah, yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink.

1628
02:04:26,038 --> 02:04:28,971
Good. I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1629
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,066
and clean the inside of the car...
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1630
02:04:33,143 --> 02:04:37,079
You need to go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1631
02:04:37,147 --> 02:04:39,682
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1632
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:43,085
Now when it comes to the upholstery, it don't need to be
spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.

1633
02:04:43,153 --> 02:04:47,522
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.

1634
02:04:47,591 --> 02:04:51,687
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1635
02:04:51,762 --> 02:04:54,196
Jimmie, we need to raid
your linen closet.

1636
02:04:54,264 --> 02:04:57,199
I need blankets, I need comforters,
I need quilts, I need bedspreads.

1637
02:04:57,267 --> 02:05:00,896
The thicker the better, the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1638
02:05:00,971 --> 02:05:06,273
We'll need to camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and the back seat and floorboards...

1639
02:05:06,343 --> 02:05:08,277
with quilts and blankets,

1640
02:05:08,345 --> 02:05:12,281
so if a cop stops us, starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1641
02:05:12,349 --> 02:05:15,216
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1642
02:05:15,285 --> 02:05:17,344
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1643
02:05:17,421 --> 02:05:19,184
"Please" would be nice.

1644
02:05:20,657 --> 02:05:23,592
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1645
02:05:25,495 --> 02:05:29,329
Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1646
02:05:31,134 --> 02:05:33,569
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1647
02:05:33,577 --> 02:05:36,571
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1648
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,542
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1649
02:05:40,610 --> 02:05:43,943
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1650
02:05:44,014 --> 02:05:47,549
Mr. Wolf, listen.
I don't mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1651
02:05:47,567 --> 02:05:49,815
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me, that's all.

1652
02:05:49,886 --> 02:05:52,946
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1653
02:05:53,023 --> 02:05:57,653
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1654
02:05:57,727 --> 02:06:01,163
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1655
02:06:05,669 --> 02:06:09,332
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1656
02:06:12,042 --> 02:06:14,738
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1657
02:06:16,813 --> 02:06:18,747
Green.

1658
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:23,285
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1659
02:06:25,489 --> 02:06:27,923
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1660
02:06:29,426 --> 02:06:31,360
Nobody who'll be missed.

1661
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:36,365
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1662
02:06:37,467 --> 02:06:39,401
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1663
02:06:39,469 --> 02:06:42,632
I got it all here, but, uh,

1664
02:06:42,706 --> 02:06:46,142
- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1665
02:06:46,209 --> 02:06:49,736
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1666
02:06:49,813 --> 02:06:51,747
Uh... Uh, no,
thank you.

1667
02:06:51,815 --> 02:06:54,943
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1668
02:06:55,018 --> 02:06:57,953
and it's, uh...
It was a wedding present...

1669
02:06:58,021 --> 02:07:00,455
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1670
02:07:00,524 --> 02:07:04,961
- And they're not with us anymore. I wanna help...
- Let me ask you a question, Jimmie.

1671
02:07:05,028 --> 02:07:07,963
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1672
02:07:09,533 --> 02:07:14,436
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1673
02:07:15,572 --> 02:07:17,506
No.

1674
02:07:17,574 --> 02:07:20,008
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1675
02:07:20,076 --> 02:07:23,534
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1676
02:07:23,613 --> 02:07:26,047
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1677
02:07:26,116 --> 02:07:30,382
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1678
02:07:30,453 --> 02:07:33,581
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1679
02:07:37,561 --> 02:07:41,497
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1680
02:07:42,632 --> 02:07:44,566
How about you, Jimmie?

1681
02:07:45,802 --> 02:07:47,736
You an oak man?

1682
02:07:48,838 --> 02:07:50,772
Oak's nice.

1683
02:07:56,613 --> 02:08:00,481
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1684
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:02,984
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1685
02:08:03,053 --> 02:08:06,489
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1686
02:08:06,556 --> 02:08:09,491
that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?
Have you ever heard that?

1687
02:08:09,559 --> 02:08:11,794
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1688
02:08:11,902 --> 02:08:15,129
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1689
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:19,264
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules, I got a threshold for the abuse that I will take.

1690
02:08:19,336 --> 02:08:22,931
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1691
02:08:23,006 --> 02:08:26,442
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1692
02:08:26,509 --> 02:08:28,443
That's all.
I could blow.

1693
02:08:28,511 --> 02:08:30,445
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

1694
02:08:30,513 --> 02:08:33,448
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1695
02:08:33,516 --> 02:08:36,451
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1696
02:08:36,519 --> 02:08:38,453
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1697
02:08:38,521 --> 02:08:41,456
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1698
02:08:41,524 --> 02:08:44,755
You the motherfucker should be on brain detail!
We're fuckin' switchin'.

1699
02:08:44,828 --> 02:08:47,262
I'm washin' the windows,
and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1700
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,974
Fine job, gentlemen.

1701
02:09:00,310 --> 02:09:02,744
You may get out of this yet.

1702
02:09:02,812 --> 02:09:05,246
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1703
02:09:05,315 --> 02:09:08,751
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1704
02:09:08,818 --> 02:09:12,254
Phase one is complete... Clean the car...
Which moves us right along to Phase two:

1705
02:09:12,322 --> 02:09:14,256
Clean you two.

1706
02:09:15,825 --> 02:09:17,690
Strip.

1707
02:09:17,761 --> 02:09:21,527
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1708
02:09:21,598 --> 02:09:24,692
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1709
02:09:24,768 --> 02:09:27,703
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1710
02:09:27,771 --> 02:09:30,262
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1711
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:32,293
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1712
02:09:32,427 --> 02:09:34,725
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1713
02:09:34,796 --> 02:09:38,232
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1714
02:09:38,299 --> 02:09:41,666
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1715
02:09:45,974 --> 02:09:48,442
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1716
02:09:48,509 --> 02:09:52,946
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for
the garbageman to pick up. You know what I'm sayin'?

1717
02:09:53,014 --> 02:09:57,246
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1718
02:09:58,686 --> 02:10:00,620
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1719
02:10:00,688 --> 02:10:04,180
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1720
02:10:04,258 --> 02:10:07,193
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1721
02:10:07,261 --> 02:10:10,492
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1722
02:10:10,565 --> 02:10:13,500
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1723
02:10:13,568 --> 02:10:16,435
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
- Hey, man. Get this shit out of my hair!

1724
02:10:16,504 --> 02:10:19,405
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um...

1725
02:10:20,475 --> 02:10:22,409
Towel.

1726
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:36,083
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1727
02:10:38,157 --> 02:10:39,422
Perfect.

1728
02:10:39,494 --> 02:10:42,952
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1729
02:10:43,031 --> 02:10:44,965
You guys look like...

1730
02:10:45,033 --> 02:10:47,467
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1731
02:10:47,535 --> 02:10:51,130
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1732
02:10:51,205 --> 02:10:54,697
Ha-ha-ha.
They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1733
02:10:54,776 --> 02:10:57,506
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way right into prison.

1734
02:10:57,578 --> 02:10:59,512
Don't make me beg.

1735
02:11:02,583 --> 02:11:06,019
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules of the road straight.

1736
02:11:06,087 --> 02:11:09,648
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1737
02:11:09,724 --> 02:11:12,659
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1738
02:11:12,727 --> 02:11:14,627
The place is North Hollywood,

1739
02:11:14,695 --> 02:11:18,688
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1740
02:11:18,766 --> 02:11:22,099
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1741
02:11:23,504 --> 02:11:25,438
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1742
02:11:25,506 --> 02:11:29,442
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1743
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:32,604
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
- Right.

1744
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:35,615
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1745
02:11:35,683 --> 02:11:37,947
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1746
02:11:38,019 --> 02:11:40,453
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1747
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:44,057
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1748
02:11:44,125 --> 02:11:48,421
Mr. Wolf, look. The gun went off.
I don't know why. I'm cool. I promise you.

1749
02:11:48,496 --> 02:11:51,131
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1750
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,690
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1751
02:11:53,768 --> 02:11:56,703
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing off two bodies.

1752
02:12:00,541 --> 02:12:02,236
Outta my way, Rex.

1753
02:12:03,811 --> 02:12:06,245
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1754
02:12:06,314 --> 02:12:10,080
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1755
02:12:10,151 --> 02:12:12,779
Someday all this will be hers.

1756
02:12:12,854 --> 02:12:15,721
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1757
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:19,226
You guys going to a
volleyball game or something?

1758
02:12:19,293 --> 02:12:21,727
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1759
02:12:21,796 --> 02:12:24,560
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1760
02:12:24,632 --> 02:12:25,997
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1761
02:12:26,067 --> 02:12:29,503
It's...
It's your future. I...

1762
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:32,334
I see a...
A cab ride.

1763
02:12:32,406 --> 02:12:35,375
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1764
02:12:35,443 --> 02:12:38,378
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1765
02:12:38,446 --> 02:12:40,880
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1766
02:12:40,948 --> 02:12:44,884
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1767
02:12:44,952 --> 02:12:47,887
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1768
02:12:47,955 --> 02:12:49,889
Call me Winston.

1769
02:12:51,459 --> 02:12:54,394
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1770
02:12:54,462 --> 02:12:58,660
- Respect for one's elders shows character.
- I have character.

1771
02:12:58,733 --> 02:13:02,760
Because you are a character doesn't
mean that you have character.

1772
02:13:09,343 --> 02:13:12,278
Wanna share a cab?

1773
02:13:12,346 --> 02:13:16,612
I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1774
02:13:16,684 --> 02:13:19,482
Cool.

1775
02:13:23,524 --> 02:13:26,618
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1776
02:13:26,694 --> 02:13:30,130
- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1777
02:13:30,198 --> 02:13:32,632
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1778
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,134
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1779
02:13:35,203 --> 02:13:39,264
Didn't even, you know, really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1780
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:41,934
Want some bacon?

1781
02:13:42,009 --> 02:13:43,943
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1782
02:13:44,011 --> 02:13:48,047
- Are you Jewish?
- No, I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1783
02:13:48,115 --> 02:13:50,450
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1784
02:13:50,518 --> 02:13:52,452
I don't eat filthy animals.

1785
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:55,956
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1786
02:13:56,023 --> 02:13:58,958
Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1787
02:13:59,026 --> 02:14:01,961
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1788
02:14:02,029 --> 02:14:04,964
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1789
02:14:05,032 --> 02:14:08,968
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1790
02:14:09,036 --> 02:14:13,370
- What about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1791
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:16,774
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1792
02:14:16,844 --> 02:14:19,779
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1793
02:14:19,847 --> 02:14:21,781
but they're definitely dirty.

1794
02:14:21,849 --> 02:14:25,979
- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1795
02:14:26,053 --> 02:14:29,614
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1796
02:14:29,690 --> 02:14:33,626
- Is that true?
- Well, we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1797
02:14:33,694 --> 02:14:37,721
I mean, he'd have to be ten times more
charming than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know I'm sayin'?

1798
02:14:43,337 --> 02:14:45,464
Oh, man, that's good.

1799
02:14:45,539 --> 02:14:49,134
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1800
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:52,202
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1801
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:54,714
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1802
02:14:54,782 --> 02:14:57,717
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1803
02:14:57,785 --> 02:15:01,050
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1804
02:15:02,957 --> 02:15:06,154
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1805
02:15:09,630 --> 02:15:13,464
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1806
02:15:14,502 --> 02:15:16,436
But this morning...

1807
02:15:16,504 --> 02:15:19,234
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1808
02:15:19,307 --> 02:15:23,004
Dont you see, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1809
02:15:23,077 --> 02:15:28,614
I mean it could be God stopped the bullets,
or he changed Coke to Pepsi, found my fuckin' car keys.

1810
02:15:28,682 --> 02:15:31,074
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1811
02:15:31,152 --> 02:15:33,586
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1812
02:15:33,654 --> 02:15:36,817
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1813
02:15:36,891 --> 02:15:40,657
But what is significant,
is I felt the touch of God.

1814
02:15:40,728 --> 02:15:42,662
God got involved.

1815
02:15:42,730 --> 02:15:44,459
But why?

1816
02:15:44,532 --> 02:15:47,558
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1817
02:15:47,635 --> 02:15:50,604
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1818
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:52,605
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1819
02:15:52,673 --> 02:15:55,335
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1820
02:15:55,409 --> 02:15:58,776
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1821
02:16:00,081 --> 02:16:04,313
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1822
02:16:04,385 --> 02:16:07,980
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1823
02:16:08,055 --> 02:16:11,149
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1824
02:16:11,225 --> 02:16:14,661
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1825
02:16:14,729 --> 02:16:17,698
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1826
02:16:17,765 --> 02:16:20,029
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1827
02:16:20,101 --> 02:16:23,400
- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1828
02:16:23,471 --> 02:16:28,408
- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1829
02:16:28,476 --> 02:16:32,139
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1830
02:16:32,213 --> 02:16:34,181
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1831
02:16:34,248 --> 02:16:37,547
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1832
02:16:37,618 --> 02:16:40,553
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1833
02:16:40,621 --> 02:16:43,590
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1834
02:16:43,657 --> 02:16:47,320
And without a job, a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1835
02:16:47,395 --> 02:16:49,329
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1836
02:16:49,397 --> 02:16:52,332
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1837
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:55,233
Garçon! Coffee!

1838
02:16:55,302 --> 02:16:59,796
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1839
02:16:59,874 --> 02:17:03,002
- But water into wine, l...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1840
02:17:03,077 --> 02:17:06,171
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you, Vincent...

1841
02:17:06,247 --> 02:17:08,841
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1842
02:17:11,719 --> 02:17:13,653
I'm gonna take a shit.

1843
02:17:18,424 --> 02:17:20,073
Let me ask you something.

1844
02:17:20,107 --> 02:17:22,534
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1845
02:17:22,609 --> 02:17:26,545
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1846
02:17:26,613 --> 02:17:28,547
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1847
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:32,415
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1848
02:17:32,485 --> 02:17:35,613
Fuck. To be continued.

1849
02:17:47,634 --> 02:17:50,569
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1850
02:17:52,172 --> 02:17:55,107
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1851
02:17:55,175 --> 02:18:00,169
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!

1852
02:18:00,246 --> 02:18:03,647
- You got that? You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1853
02:18:03,717 --> 02:18:06,777
Get on the fuckin'...
Get the fuck down!

1854
02:18:06,853 --> 02:18:11,886
You, you're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth over there, on the count of ten!

1855
02:18:11,918 --> 02:18:16,220
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1856
02:18:16,296 --> 02:18:19,390
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1857
02:18:19,466 --> 02:18:21,934
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1858
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:24,493
Fucking move! Move!

1859
02:18:24,571 --> 02:18:26,835
Move! Get the fuck...

1860
02:18:26,906 --> 02:18:29,932
Get down on the fucking floor!

1861
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:31,944
Grandpa! Down!

1862
02:18:32,012 --> 02:18:35,379
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1863
02:18:35,448 --> 02:18:38,383
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1864
02:18:38,451 --> 02:18:42,478
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1865
02:18:42,555 --> 02:18:47,254
- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1866
02:18:47,327 --> 02:18:49,861
I am not a hero.

1867
02:18:49,929 --> 02:18:52,355
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1868
02:18:52,432 --> 02:18:54,195
The restaurant's ours!

1869
02:18:54,267 --> 02:18:57,202
Just take whatever you want.

1870
02:18:57,270 --> 02:18:59,204
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1871
02:18:59,272 --> 02:19:02,400
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1872
02:19:02,475 --> 02:19:04,443
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1873
02:19:06,746 --> 02:19:08,543
Listen, everybody.

1874
02:19:08,615 --> 02:19:11,140
Be calm, cooperate,

1875
02:19:11,157 --> 02:19:13,652
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1876
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:15,688
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1877
02:19:28,034 --> 02:19:31,470
All right, now, people,
gonna come around and collect your wallets!

1878
02:19:31,538 --> 02:19:34,996
You don't fucking talk.
You just throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1879
02:19:35,075 --> 02:19:37,305
I said, are we fucking clear?

1880
02:19:37,377 --> 02:19:40,312
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1881
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:43,975
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1882
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:46,985
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1883
02:19:47,053 --> 02:19:48,918
In the bag.

1884
02:19:48,988 --> 02:19:51,923
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

1885
02:19:51,991 --> 02:19:54,926
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1886
02:19:54,994 --> 02:19:57,224
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1887
02:19:57,297 --> 02:19:59,231
In the fucking bag.

1888
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:04,258
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1889
02:20:04,337 --> 02:20:06,771
In the bag.
In the bag.

1890
02:20:18,952 --> 02:20:20,886
In the bag.

1891
02:20:36,002 --> 02:20:38,937
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1892
02:20:39,005 --> 02:20:41,530
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1893
02:20:41,608 --> 02:20:44,304
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1894
02:20:44,377 --> 02:20:47,312
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1895
02:20:49,349 --> 02:20:51,715
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1896
02:20:52,785 --> 02:20:55,117
What's going on?

1897
02:20:55,188 --> 02:20:58,646
- Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1898
02:20:58,725 --> 02:21:02,456
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1899
02:21:02,529 --> 02:21:05,930
- If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

1900
02:21:05,999 --> 02:21:08,797
You'll get us all killed!
Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here!

1901
02:21:08,868 --> 02:21:13,100
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your goddamn business!

1902
02:21:13,173 --> 02:21:15,403
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1903
02:21:15,475 --> 02:21:17,568
No problem.
I got it under control.

1904
02:21:19,145 --> 02:21:21,136
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1905
02:21:22,749 --> 02:21:26,685
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1906
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:33,024
We clear?

1907
02:21:36,162 --> 02:21:38,096
One.

1908
02:21:39,933 --> 02:21:42,458
Two.

1909
02:21:42,535 --> 02:21:44,594
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1910
02:21:44,671 --> 02:21:46,730
You win.

1911
02:21:46,806 --> 02:21:48,740
It's yours.

1912
02:21:52,779 --> 02:21:55,509
Open it.

1913
02:21:59,385 --> 02:22:01,615
Hey, what is it?

1914
02:22:01,688 --> 02:22:04,020
What is it?

1915
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:06,684
Is that what I think it is?

1916
02:22:06,759 --> 02:22:09,455
Mm-hmm.

1917
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:13,157
It's beautiful.

1918
02:22:13,233 --> 02:22:15,793
Goddamn it, what is it?

1919
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:20,505
You let him go!
You let him go!

1920
02:22:20,573 --> 02:22:23,242
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1921
02:22:23,309 --> 02:22:26,244
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!" Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny! Be cool!

1922
02:22:26,312 --> 02:22:29,042
- Tell that fuckin' bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1923
02:22:29,115 --> 02:22:32,016
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1924
02:22:32,085 --> 02:22:33,882
- Let go of him!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

1925
02:22:33,953 --> 02:22:37,188
- Alright, now tell it's gonna be all right! Promise her!
- It's gonna be alright. I promise!

1926
02:22:37,256 --> 02:22:39,256
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

1927
02:22:39,325 --> 02:22:41,259
- Alright, now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1928
02:22:41,327 --> 02:22:44,663
Alright, now Yolanda,
we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1929
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:47,365
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1930
02:22:47,433 --> 02:22:50,925
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
And what's Fonzie like?

1931
02:22:53,004 --> 02:22:54,667
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1932
02:22:54,741 --> 02:22:56,675
- What?
- Cool.

1933
02:22:56,743 --> 02:22:59,976
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1934
02:23:00,246 --> 02:23:01,580
We're gonna be cool.

1935
02:23:01,648 --> 02:23:06,551
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1936
02:23:06,619 --> 02:23:08,712
And when I count three,

1937
02:23:08,788 --> 02:23:11,723
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1938
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:15,249
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1939
02:23:16,329 --> 02:23:18,388
And when you do it,

1940
02:23:18,464 --> 02:23:20,523
you do it cool.

1941
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:22,932
You ready?

1942
02:23:23,002 --> 02:23:25,095
One,

1943
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:27,366
two,

1944
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:29,374
three.

1945
02:23:38,049 --> 02:23:39,477
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1946
02:23:39,552 --> 02:23:43,447
I thought you were gonna be cool.
Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1947
02:23:43,522 --> 02:23:45,915
And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

1948
02:23:45,991 --> 02:23:49,925
And when motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1949
02:23:50,863 --> 02:23:54,492
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1950
02:23:54,567 --> 02:23:57,968
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1951
02:23:58,037 --> 02:23:59,971
But I don't want that.

1952
02:24:00,039 --> 02:24:01,973
And you don't want that.

1953
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:05,271
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1954
02:24:05,344 --> 02:24:06,937
So let's see what we can do.

1955
02:24:09,349 --> 02:24:12,580
Now... here's the situation.

1956
02:24:12,652 --> 02:24:16,520
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1957
02:24:16,589 --> 02:24:20,025
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1958
02:24:20,093 --> 02:24:23,028
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1959
02:24:23,096 --> 02:24:27,032
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1960
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:30,035
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1961
02:24:30,103 --> 02:24:33,038
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1962
02:24:33,106 --> 02:24:34,971
Vincent!

1963
02:24:35,041 --> 02:24:38,776
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1964
02:24:38,844 --> 02:24:40,940
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1965
02:24:40,993 --> 02:24:44,977
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1966
02:24:45,051 --> 02:24:48,510
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1967
02:24:48,516 --> 02:24:49,520
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1968
02:24:49,588 --> 02:24:51,122
Tell her it's still cool.

1969
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:54,425
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1970
02:24:55,528 --> 02:24:58,190
I... I gotta go pee.

1971
02:24:58,264 --> 02:25:00,198
I wanna go home.

1972
02:25:00,266 --> 02:25:03,861
Just hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1973
02:25:03,936 --> 02:25:06,871
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1974
02:25:06,939 --> 02:25:10,306
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1975
02:25:10,376 --> 02:25:13,539
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1976
02:25:13,613 --> 02:25:17,549
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1977
02:25:20,086 --> 02:25:24,022
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

1978
02:25:38,283 --> 02:25:41,843
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1979
02:25:41,919 --> 02:25:44,013
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1980
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:51,221
Count it.

1981
02:25:57,535 --> 02:26:00,060
How much is there?

1982
02:26:02,973 --> 02:26:03,907
About 1,500 dollars.

1983
02:26:03,975 --> 02:26:07,172
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1984
02:26:07,245 --> 02:26:10,442
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1985
02:26:10,515 --> 02:26:12,608
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1986
02:26:12,684 --> 02:26:16,586
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars,
and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1987
02:26:16,655 --> 02:26:20,091
No, Yolanda! Yolanda!
He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1988
02:26:20,158 --> 02:26:22,251
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1989
02:26:22,327 --> 02:26:26,195
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1990
02:26:26,264 --> 02:26:29,199
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1991
02:26:29,267 --> 02:26:31,201
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1992
02:26:32,437 --> 02:26:35,634
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1993
02:26:35,707 --> 02:26:40,440
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1994
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:43,208
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1995
02:26:44,282 --> 02:26:46,216
Not regularly, no.

1996
02:26:46,284 --> 02:26:48,718
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1997
02:26:48,787 --> 02:26:52,314
Ezekiel 25:17.

1998
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:55,823
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides..."

1999
02:26:55,893 --> 02:26:57,827
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2000
02:26:57,895 --> 02:26:59,229
and the tyranny of evil men.

2001
02:26:59,897 --> 02:27:02,964
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2002
02:27:02,994 --> 02:27:05,168
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2003
02:27:05,236 --> 02:27:09,332
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2004
02:27:09,407 --> 02:27:14,107
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2005
02:27:14,118 --> 02:27:16,838
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2006
02:27:17,415 --> 02:27:19,941
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2007
02:27:20,018 --> 02:27:23,579
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2008
02:27:24,656 --> 02:27:27,090
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2009
02:27:27,158 --> 02:27:30,321
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2010
02:27:30,395 --> 02:27:33,730
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2011
02:27:33,798 --> 02:27:36,333
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2012
02:27:36,401 --> 02:27:38,835
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2013
02:27:38,903 --> 02:27:42,339
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2014
02:27:42,407 --> 02:27:45,342
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2015
02:27:45,410 --> 02:27:50,279
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2016
02:27:50,348 --> 02:27:53,283
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2017
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:56,912
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2018
02:27:56,988 --> 02:27:58,922
Or it could mean...

2019
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:02,426
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2020
02:28:02,494 --> 02:28:06,430
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2021
02:28:06,498 --> 02:28:08,762
Now, I'd like that.

2022
02:28:08,833 --> 02:28:11,734
But that shit ain't the truth.

2023
02:28:11,803 --> 02:28:13,668
The truth is,

2024
02:28:14,739 --> 02:28:16,673
you're the weak...

2025
02:28:18,076 --> 02:28:21,477
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2026
02:28:22,881 --> 02:28:24,815
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2027
02:28:26,084 --> 02:28:29,019
I'm tryin' real hard...

2028
02:28:29,087 --> 02:28:31,351
to be the shepherd.

2029
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:48,605
Go.

2030
02:29:06,991 --> 02:29:08,725
I think we should be
leaving now.

2031
02:29:09,193 --> 02:29:11,728
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
