1
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,847
That’s them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,212
Just like that.

3
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:41,248
I wouldn’t go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,855
Heard the expression
kick the hornet’s nest?

5
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,549
I’ll stay right here.
Thank you.

6
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,320
Those things
scare me to death.

7
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,993
They been killing
my honey bees.

8
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,192
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,128
they’ll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,492
What are you gonna
do with them?

11
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,230
Well, that’s between
me and them,

12
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,034
if you don’t mind.

13
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:00,168
That’s okay.

14
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:02,434
I understand these things.

15
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:06,603
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,540
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:12,246
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,380
This place was crabgrass
and weeds,

19
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,954
and you brought it
back to life.

20
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,187
You’re a blessing.

21
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:22,586
No one’s ever
taken care of me before.

22
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,527
I’ll, uh...

23
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,168
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:38,503
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,242
- Boss.

26
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:48,980
You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,048
- I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,049
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,986
Get this fucking
hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,188
United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:00,992
How may I help you?

32
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:01,586
Boyd.

33
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:03,621
Uh, hello.
I just got a message saying

34
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,491
that there’s a problem
with my computer.

35
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,328
Don’t you worry.
The message you received

36
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:09,627
is from our United Data Group
antivirus software.

37
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,431
It’s part of
the software package

38
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:13,169
that you pre-installed
on your computer.

39
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,731
I’m sorry.
I’m not a computer person.

40
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:18,438
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:26,512
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,217
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:31,154
So what I’m going to need you
to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:33,057
and install
the latest version.

45
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:34,685
Well, I have no idea
how to do that.

46
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,720
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,095
Well, I would recommend

48
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,723
you take your computer
to an IT specialist.

49
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,065
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,726
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,466
since they’ll have to replace
the hard drive.

52
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,304
I’m pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,406
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:53,506
Okay. There is actually

55
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,343
a software package
that you can download

56
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:57,576
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:01,217
All right.
Tell me what to do.

58
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:04,154
It’s okay. Can you, uh,
can you type this,

59
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,783
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:09,225
Spelled just how it sounds.

61
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,096
Okay. I’m there.

62
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,262
And there should be a button

63
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:14,560
on your screen
that says "install."

64
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,397
Can you click on that button?

65
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:17,365
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,268
So you’re about
to see some windows

67
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,500
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,733
as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.

69
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,406
Okay.

70
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,705
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,739
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:33,381
but not so much that you sound
like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,646
- All right?

74
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:37,253
She has got
10K checking,

75
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:40,454
life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA,

76
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:41,719
teacher’s pension and...

77
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,787
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,262
-  All right.

79
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,099
She is a signatory

80
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,794
on a $2 million dollar
account.

81
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,797
Some, uh...
It’s some fucking charity.

82
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:57,768
All right, kids,
let the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,739
Ooh.
My computer’s going crazy.

84
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:02,773
Totally normal.

85
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,347
Just do not touch
your keyboard.

86
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,223
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,357
I’m going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:16,259
How about that?

89
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,294
I’ve gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,659
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,331
Oh, that’s not my account.

92
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,267
That’s an account
that I manage.

93
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,466
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,699
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,439
Just hold on.

96
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,244
Yes, there’s...

97
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:37,841
There’s a transfer
for $50,000?

98
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:42,318
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,156
- Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,421
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,851
I was supposed
to credit you 500,

102
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,788
but I don’t know,
I got a stuck key here.

103
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:53,164
I’m gonna lose my job here.

104
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:55,166
- I got kids.

105
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,629
I ain’t got fucking kids.

106
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,237
Oh, I don’t want you
to get in trouble, but...

107
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:04,307
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:08,707
I will need
a different password though.

109
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:09,609
One second.

110
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:12,843
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:18,651
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

112
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,192
Um...

113
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,196
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:28,694
I think
I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,498
You know what?
You’re probably right.

116
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:33,468
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:37,307
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:47,680
All my kids’ pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,586
- Okay.

120
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:57,822
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:01,298
That is what
I am talking about! Come on!

122
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:05,335
Let me fucking hear it!
I fucking love you people!

123
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,600
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,441
Hello?

125
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,674
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,552
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,887
- Oh.

128
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,334
Oh.

129
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,947
What did I do?

130
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:59,290
Stupid...

131
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:41,794
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,788
Don’t move.

133
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,824
Don’t you fucking move.

134
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,727
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,864
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:25,739
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:33,450
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,145
...and what are you doing
in my mother’s house?

139
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,425
Verona...

140
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,087
I’m so sorry.

141
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,089
How do you know my...

142
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,798
Mom.

143
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,168
Until we can clear him,
he’s our best and only perp.

144
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,037
Clear him?

145
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:01,940
Agent Parker,
I know that’s your mother.

146
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,941
I understand.

147
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:07,418
But there’s a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,687
Suicide? You can’t be serious.

149
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:16,460
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,693
But by all means,
let’s just completely ignore

151
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,696
the big white dude
in her house with a knife.

152
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,434
Get him up.

153
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,996
Come on.

154
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,672
It’s Clay, right?

155
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:31,970
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,103
I don’t have much to say.

157
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,138
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,909
Like, what the fuck
were you doing

159
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,713
in my mother’s house?

160
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:41,683
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,817
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:46,721
Who the fuck are you?
Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,118
I keep bees.

164
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,462
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,696
I rent some space
in the barn from her.

166
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,027
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:56,027 --> 00:14:00,966
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

168
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,837
She didn’t answer
when I knocked.

169
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,773
I noted her car
in the driveway.

170
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,545
I heard the smoke alarm
and I entered.

171
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:09,744
You "noted"?

172
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:11,911
You got a law enforcement
background?

173
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:15,112
I told you,
I take care of bees.

174
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:01,829
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,689
His hands tested
negative for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:30,022
But the prints on the gun
were your mother’s.

177
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:33,124
It seems, sadly,
it was suicide.

178
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:46,808
Mr. Clay, I need to apologize
for last night.

179
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:50,713
I realize I may have been
a little aggressive.

180
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,751
That’s understandable.

181
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:01,658
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

182
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,090
No.

183
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:08,093
But I’ll sit with you
if you like.

184
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,266
No, thank you.

185
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,942
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,780
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,080
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

188
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,951
Obviously, I could have
done a better job.

189
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,791
Being old
can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:40,697
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,833
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

192
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,737
Part of the hive,
I guess you could say.

193
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:52,203
There’s some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:56,174
I was born there.

195
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:01,080
I hated that she was
out here alone.

196
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,149
She wouldn’t leave.

197
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,725
There’s too many memories.

198
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:14,159
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

199
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,260
You’re just like my brother.

200
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,296
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:23,300
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:27,205
She loved him.

203
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,811
He’d mow the lawn

204
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,110
and you’d think
he invented fire.

205
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,816
You know, while I graduated
the FBI Academy

206
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:37,116
and she said,
"Oh, that’s nice."

207
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,318
She got scammed.

208
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:45,322
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:47,060
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,393
Got every penny.
Maxed out all her cards.

211
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:51,933
She was an educator,

212
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,738
director of a charity
for kids.

213
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,873
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,436
You know who did it?

215
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:03,175
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,111
This crew’s been operating
for two years

217
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,442
and we don’t even have names.

218
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,917
And even if we did, good luck
building an indictment

219
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,248
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:13,218
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,725
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:18,157
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,422
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:22,260
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,801
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:27,232
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,300
there are parents.

228
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,435
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,878
Someone hurts
an older person...

230
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,410
sometimes they’re left to face
the hornets alone.

231
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:44,513
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,385
or no one cares.

233
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,190
I care.

234
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:54,193
And I’m stubborn.

235
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:55,898
And so help me God,

236
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:59,231
I’m going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:06,975
I need to take care
of the hive.

238
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,078
You’ve been up all night.

239
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,443
The hive
is more important.

240
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:30,867
What are you doing?

241
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,167
I thought you retired.
I did.

242
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,037
I need a favor.

243
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,072
What kind of favor?

244
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:40,470
A name and address.

245
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,506
- Easy.
- Not easy.

246
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,949
Even the FBI can’t
find these people.

247
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,313
Well, we’re not the FBI,
are we?

248
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,250
Shoot me the deets
and stand by.

249
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,125
Yeah.

250
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,028
You weren’t kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,964
They’re routing
all over the world.

252
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:02,998
But you found them?

253
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:06,034
Sure.
But who are these people?

254
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,102
I’m gonna find out.

255
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,174
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:16,440
The hell you think
you’re going, pal?

257
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,244
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,443
Don’t know nothing about that.

259
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:22,886
This is private property,
and you’re trespassing.

260
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:24,580
I’m going inside.

261
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,923
I’m going to burn it down.

262
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:28,353
Yeah, that’s not happening, buddy.

263
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,959
You’re not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,588
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

265
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:34,997
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,428
Buddy, I’m counting to three.

267
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:39,936
One, two, three.

268
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:42,136
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,206
You aware
this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,307
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,914
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,510
Do you know
that’s who you work for?

273
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,392
I’m looking
for the call center.

274
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,965
Yeah,
you’re in the right place.

275
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:11,495
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:17,336
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,601
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:22,143
There’s going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,474
Thanks.

280
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,479
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,416
Nah, I’m good, buddy.
I’m just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,221
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:38,027
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry,
I’ll have to

284
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:40,964
call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,264
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:46,101
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,334
I will never steal
from the weak

288
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:49,698
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,537
I sent you
a department download,

290
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:56,012
and we’ll find out
what’s going on...

291
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:11,291
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,491
I will never steal
from the weak

293
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:14,624
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,967
I will never steal
from the weak

295
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,266
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:23,567
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,405
I’m gonna burn this place
to the ground.

298
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:31,080
Might be a good time
to go home.

299
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,609
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:35,546
It’s gas!
Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:38,549
It’s gas!

302
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,354
It’s gas! It’s gas!

303
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,458
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,658
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,199
What the fuck
do you think you’re doing?

306
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,761
I’m a beekeeper.

307
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,071
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:57,667
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,176
This a multi-million dollar
operation, asshole.

310
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:03,211
Okay, so you can’t
come up here,

311
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:05,444
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:11,450
Will you stomp
his ass out, please?

313
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,203
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:31,536
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:43,251
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

316
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:06,340
Mister...?

317
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,143
Uh...

318
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:10,509
Uh, uh,  Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,413
I don’t care if your friends
here live or die.

320
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:17,450
The next call
from your little phishing scam

321
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,484
to this call center

322
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:20,354
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:24,160
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,822
I promise you...

325
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,232
anything alive in here
won’t be.

326
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:37,734
Uh, guys,
we might want to dip out.

327
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:04,695
Hey. What’s going on?

328
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:09,733
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,768
and, uh,
extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:13,143
Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:17,774
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:19,182
Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,514
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,452
Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:27,883
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:30,193
And it’s like I can barely
fucking move.

337
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:33,262
It’s all tweaked.

338
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,594
Oh, those are nice.
Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,827
Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,501
That’s perfect. Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:47,837
What? I’m in a meeting.

342
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,509
You said
hit me on voice

343
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:50,675
if there’s an emergency.

344
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,645
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:57,715
It seems we had
a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:00,718
Uh, I just can’t comprehend
why you’re bothering me.

347
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:02,852
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,886
and start shoving back.

349
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:07,791
Well, yeah, I don’t think
that legal’s gonna help much.

350
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,464
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

351
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:12,598
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:14,402
saying we’re stealing
from people,

353
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:17,372
and he just tears through
all my security guys,

354
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:21,640
like, fucking tissue paper
and, um...

355
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,872
And what?

356
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,710
And he burns the place
to the ground.

357
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,481
Yeah. The call center is gone.

358
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:30,847
I’m standing here staring
at a $30 million building,

359
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:34,917
it’s now
a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,457
Four people didn’t get out.

361
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:37,920
You’re telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,328
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:40,692
and dropped
four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:42,760
Yeah, that’s not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,894
Who did this?
Give me a name right now.

366
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,302
Sir, I don’t have it.

367
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:50,372
All the cameras and the drives
burned up in the fire.

368
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:51,868
He had a hat.

369
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,705
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:54,937
I’m gonna hit you back.
All right?

371
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,643
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

372
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,717
Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:06,751
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,259
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,328
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,825
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:15,661
Get him?

378
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,267
Yeah,
like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:19,995
- Come on.

380
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:20,897
I’ll be an hour.

381
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,438
That’s way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:24,571
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,639
and you’re telling me
you can’t just find

384
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:27,772
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,544
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

386
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:31,677
I just need a name.

387
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,679
Well, you won’t get it
from me.

388
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,319
And you keep me
a million miles away

389
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,848
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,454
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,852
- Yup.

392
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:42,754
So check it out.

393
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:44,426
Daddy can’t hold your hand
on this one.

394
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:47,561
Uh, this is clearly some kind
of crime of passion,

395
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:48,595
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:49,959
someone snapped,
like, whatever.

397
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,466
But, uh,
what we’re going to do is

398
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:52,863
I’m going to send you
some credentials,

399
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:54,370
you’re going
to log into our cloud

400
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,833
and you’re going
to look at anyone connected

401
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,505
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:59,034
Just, I don’t know,
start there.

403
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,839
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

404
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,642
Then what?

405
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:04,479
You get a wrecking crew
together

406
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,678
and you go Goodfellas
on him.

407
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:07,581
I mean, come on,
you’re a connected guy, right?

408
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:08,780
Do you understand?

409
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,488
Yeah. No, I understand.
I, uh...

410
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:15,358
I’ll get it done.

411
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:32,001
It’s called a day off.

412
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,608
V, you good?

413
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,610
Yeah, I’m great. Why?

414
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,580
I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:43,782
Yeah.

416
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,082
What do you want, Wiley?

417
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:48,919
Are you leaving?
Please don’t go.

418
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,493
I’m going to yoga.

419
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:54,694
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:58,830
Go on.

421
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,964
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:06,376
Yeah.

423
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:11,579
Give us a few seconds,
thank you.

424
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:14,549
Where’s mine?

425
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:15,715
It’s an old cup from my car

426
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:18,047
with instant
and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,817
Ew.

428
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:20,148
You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:24,592
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:27,463
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:29,531
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:30,565
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:33,799
This clown car saw everything,
but no one’s talking.

434
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,835
They’re all frequent fliers
with perjury,

435
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:38,639
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:43,105
Fucking scumbags.
I want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:48,011
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:50,882
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,129
Eloise Parker.

440
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:09,736
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:11,771
She’s, uh... she’s Black,

442
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:13,839
widow, just has a daughter
in Boston.

443
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,447
I don’t think this is it,
but, you know.

444
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:22,144
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:25,015
That’s him.

446
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:37,698
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:39,865
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,570
Yeah, dickhead was talking
about them.

449
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,233
I guess he’s a, like,
bee lover.

450
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:46,839
You know what?

451
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,645
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:40,090
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:44,600
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,669
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,844
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:57,976 --> 00:31:59,307
Let’s go!

457
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:08,816
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:12,116
Can someone,
like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,955
Fuck.

460
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:18,628
No! I’m okay.

461
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:22,764
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:23,699
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,701
Let’s just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:28,770
No, no!

465
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:33,368
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,316
So, help me understand
because I’m a little confused.

467
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,955
What’s the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:51,089
Don’t know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,223
So then why are people
just wiring you

470
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:54,356
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:57,392
Must be
your winning personality.

472
00:33:57,392 --> 00:33:58,327
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,263
so maybe
you want to talk to them.

474
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,068
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:05,004
Did you steal it out
of a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:07,072
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,975
Verona, if you’re done
shitting all over

478
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:10,273
this gentleman’s civil rights,

479
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:13,111
can I speak to you
for a moment?

480
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:15,817
That’s a nice shirt.

481
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:20,118
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:22,824
I’m an asshole.

483
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:25,420
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,421
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:30,029
Good, ’cause, uh,
today’s your lucky day.

486
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:31,701
’Cause apparently,
your mother’s house

487
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:34,099
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,298
- Let’s go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:35,298 --> 00:34:38,367
Yeah. Shit’s on fire.
Let’s go.

490
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:56,220
You good?

491
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,321
V, you okay?

492
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,356
Yeah.

493
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:04,228
That’s a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,429
Where’s Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:14,205
- United Data Group.
Well, he’s handsome.

496
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,240
Thank you.

497
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:18,946
Are you okay?

498
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:21,443
Yeah, Wiley, I’m good.
I’m good.

499
00:35:21,443 --> 00:35:23,148
You think there’s
even the remotest chance

500
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:26,415
that the dude who burned down
United Data Group

501
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,087
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,319
from your mother?

503
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,522
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:40,363
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:52,012
Fucking shit.

506
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:06,862
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:08,864
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,901
Yo, what’s up, playa?

509
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,364
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:15,398
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:18,434
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:21,074
I’m so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:22,405
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:23,978
Are you fucking crying
right now?

515
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:27,245
I’m not crying.
I’m bleeding.

516
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,511
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:30,886
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:35,418
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:36,452
He cut them off.

520
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:40,126
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:44,262
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:48,431
I don’t know.
A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:51,335
Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.

524
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:55,042
He fucks with beehives?
What’s he saying about bees?

525
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:56,472
I don’t know.
He said he was, like,

526
00:36:56,472 --> 00:36:58,243
protecting the hive
or something.

527
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:00,949
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,181
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,018
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,217
What do you want from me?

531
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:07,615
You want money?
You want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,188
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,420
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,127
No! Dude,
what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:18,395
Don’t move.

536
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:21,563
I fucking can’t move!

537
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,137
You’re fucking crazy, man.

538
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,238
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:42,419
What the fuck!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:47,061
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

541
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:05,541
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

542
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,578
Fuck you. That’s who.

543
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,250
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,922
fucking call center.

545
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,551
Now I’m going
to burn you down.

546
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,685
You haven’t told me your name.

547
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:19,159
I told you my name.

548
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,325
It’s fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:21,656
You better fucking
remember it.

550
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,295
Because you don’t
burn me down.

551
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,033
I burn you down.
You understand me?

552
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:28,102
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:29,697
You sound young.

554
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,699
I bet you don’t
have estate planning.

555
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:35,703
I’m fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,947
I’m about to show you.

557
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:56,526
Breaking news in Springfield,

558
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:58,264
where three bodies
have been discovered

559
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,497
following an arson fire
at a small farm.

560
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:02,499
There was an office building
explosion...

561
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:07,075
And you say one guy did this?
Yup.

562
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:10,705
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:14,709
Yup. And he said
he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,052
And this is your

565
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:21,991
data mining consumer service
business, right?

566
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,487
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,094
Pulling in 9 million a month
in one office.

568
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:28,063
I’ve got, like, 20.

569
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:30,461
Yeah.

570
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,432
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,467
is he says he’s a beekeeper.

572
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:40,141
Yeah, it’s like
his whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,443
Jesus.

574
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:47,082
What?

575
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:55,486
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:59,523
this might well
be your Mona Lisa.

577
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:01,426
How did I fuck up?

578
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:05,694
I don’t know.
You’ve done something.

579
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,532
You’ve disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:09,665
Oh.

581
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:10,732
Oh, okay.

582
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:11,634
So fucking what?

583
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,207
Why’d I care if the guy
keeps bees?

584
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:15,440
If a Beekeeper
says you’re gonna die,

585
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,441
you’re gonna die.

586
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:20,709
There’s nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

587
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:25,285
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

588
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:27,452
What good are you?

589
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:29,487
Yeah.

590
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:35,625
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

591
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,628
culminating as director
of the world’s

592
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:40,564
premier intelligence agency.

593
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,730
I could have done anything,

594
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,569
but I chose this job
as a favor to your mother.

595
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:49,078
I keep
Danforth Enterprises safe.

596
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:53,247
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

597
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:55,843
It’s my fucking name too,
all right?

598
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:57,614
Oh, sit down.

599
00:40:57,614 --> 00:40:58,714
I put up with you.

600
00:40:58,714 --> 00:41:00,287
I’ve put up
with your tantrums,

601
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:04,423
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

602
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:09,362
The endless stream
of sex workers.

603
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:14,400
You’re a drowning man.
Do you know that?

604
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:16,270
Mm.

605
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,238
You’re scared.

606
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:19,405
Dead right I’m scared.

607
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:22,639
Terrified. So should you be.

608
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,380
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

609
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:33,683
He’s probably
the last pair of eyes

610
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:36,224
that you’re going to sneer at.

611
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,527
Okay, listen.

612
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:44,529
Remember our favorite
burning building?

613
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:45,530
United Data Group.

614
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,894
The guys who work there
are hackers,

615
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:49,798
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

616
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,701
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

617
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:54,539
He’s in the book.
He’s a known mob associate.

618
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:56,706
He’s missing, but I’ve got
PD chasing him down.

619
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:58,840
Okay, so I had some analysts
run some shit,

620
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,876
and I think I’m starting to
get the shape of the animal.

621
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:04,417
Dude, I think
United Data Group

622
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,781
is one of several
call centers.

623
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,882
So there’s got to be
like a central office

624
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:09,422
that’s controlling
all of them,

625
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:11,292
and that’s what
we got to find.

626
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:12,425
Wiley, this could be like

627
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:15,527
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

628
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:16,429
Hello?
- Hey!

629
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,860
Did you hear a single word
I just said?

630
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,598
Yeah.

631
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:23,172
And?

632
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:24,833
I was just thinking
you come in here,

633
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,175
hungover on your day off,

634
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,605
and gain more yardage
on this thing

635
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,739
than the whole squad has
in two years.

636
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:34,216
Yeah, well,
they fucked with my family.

637
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,350
What’d you get on Clay?

638
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,220
Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

639
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,749
He’s a ghost.

640
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:40,948
What?

641
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:43,324
Yeah, all I have
is a birth certificate

642
00:42:43,324 --> 00:42:44,490
and a social.

643
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,360
The guy’s never even

644
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,394
had a bank account,

645
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:49,693
credit card, flown on a plane.

646
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,827
I ran his prints through
every database

647
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:54,335
I can think of, no hits.

648
00:42:54,896 --> 00:42:55,798
That’s bullshit.

649
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:58,240
This dude is former military
all day.

650
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,472
No hits. I’m telling you.

651
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:00,836
Either he’s never
been printed,

652
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:04,312
or Adam Clay doesn’t exist.

653
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:05,874
Which is terrifying to me

654
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,942
because he’s probably
in a classified program.

655
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:12,980
Special Agent Wiley.

656
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:15,488
Okay.

657
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:16,654
Let’s go.
- What?

658
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:18,821
They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

659
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:22,231
They found him. Let’s go.
- Oh, shit.

660
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,399
- Jessica.

661
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:27,698
I think you know
why I’m calling.

662
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:31,339
You know,
I’d do anything for you.

663
00:43:31,504 --> 00:43:34,903
Anything for you.

664
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:36,245
Derek’s scared shitless.

665
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:38,643
I’ve never seen him
this scared.

666
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:41,316
Well, he’s made his bed.

667
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:43,582
I’ll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

668
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:44,814
That’s another million a year.

669
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:48,620
Plus you promised
you’d take care of him.

670
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:52,888
Look, I don’t need that.
I have enough.

671
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:54,626
So you got this?

672
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,301
Yeah. You have my word.

673
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:01,303
Wallace...

674
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,603
I still think of you...

675
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:07,606
- sometimes.

676
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,278
Sometimes.

677
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:25,954
Why are you calling me

678
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,593
on the "never call this line"
line?

679
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:28,825
This is priority one, Janet.

680
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:30,695
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

681
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:32,928
Look, I’m heading downtown
to a POTUS brief.

682
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:33,995
Just hear me out.

683
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:35,766
Now, you know who I work for,
don’t you?

684
00:44:35,766 --> 00:44:38,439
Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.

685
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:39,605
Exactly.

686
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:40,837
Well, Director Harward,

687
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:42,740
my young friend,
seems to have caught

688
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,644
the unwanted attentions of...

689
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,844
I don’t know
how else to say this.

690
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,846
Of a Beekeeper.

691
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,883
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

692
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:54,752
As in.

693
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:57,524
Well, that’s not good.
- No, it’s not.

694
00:44:57,524 --> 00:45:01,462
What’s the body count?
- Seven today.

695
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:04,366
You busy making
funeral arrangements?

696
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:07,501
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

697
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,344
Is that Garnett?

698
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:18,006
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

699
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:20,074
Check this out.

700
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,434
Does this mean you’ve
taken pity on an old man?

701
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:44,472
So your problem?
He’s retired from the program.

702
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:46,441
No longer active.

703
00:45:47,805 --> 00:45:50,038
Well, that changes everything.

704
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,480
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

705
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,581
and is going
to be taking things from here.

706
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,583
You can rest easy, old friend.

707
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,518
Oh, no. Janet.

708
00:45:57,518 --> 00:45:59,949
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

709
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:02,886
who should have been removed
months ago.

710
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,855
God help us now.

711
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:46,567
Get out of here!

712
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:52,507
Shit!

713
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:56,577
- Excuse me.
- You’re cool.

714
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:17,961
You’ve been a busy bee.

715
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,699
You’re supposed to be retired.

716
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,768
I’m assuming
you’re my replacement.

717
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,769
Fuck you!

718
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,725
I need your keys.

719
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:08,577
There’s an issue.

720
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,206
The problem
has not been solved.

721
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,813
Well...

722
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,816
That is a surprise.

723
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:18,950
The Beekeepers
have studied the situation

724
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,953
and have decided
to remain neutral.

725
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:23,251
How can they do that?

726
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,089
He was their man,
for fuck’s sake!

727
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,091
I’m sorry, Wallace.

728
00:49:28,795 --> 00:49:30,830
You’re on your own.

729
00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:34,735
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

730
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,132
I can handle this!

731
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:51,378
Thank you.

732
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:54,216
What you got for us,
Detective?

733
00:49:54,216 --> 00:49:55,283
That’s her vehicle,

734
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,252
registered
to a Anisette Landress.

735
00:49:57,252 --> 00:50:01,157
The ATF are en route inbound
to take care of it.

736
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,291
We’re way cooler than ATF.

737
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,997
I’ll show you
why I called them.

738
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,235
That’s a Minigun.

739
00:50:13,235 --> 00:50:14,874
They use those
on military vehicles.

740
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:18,944
Did you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute?

741
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:19,879
I know.

742
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:22,651
Did you know
that’s 100 rounds a second?

743
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:24,312
Yep, I know.

744
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:26,853
Did you know
that you know a lot?

745
00:50:26,853 --> 00:50:27,788
Yes, I do.

746
00:50:27,788 --> 00:50:29,119
It’s because
I minored in math.

747
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,692
I’m a pretty smart guy
actually.

748
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,386
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

749
00:50:32,386 --> 00:50:34,795
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

750
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:36,126
Someone who doesn’t exist

751
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:38,964
in any commercial
or government database.

752
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:40,031
Someone who’s a ghost.

753
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:43,364
Like our good friend
Adam Clay.

754
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:47,940
"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."

755
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:49,975
Here’s another reason

756
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:51,042
that Anisette Landress

757
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,682
is like our good friend
Adam Clay.

758
00:50:55,046 --> 00:50:57,081
Do you know what’s that way?

759
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:59,919
- Springfield...

760
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:02,955
...where the call center
was torched.

761
00:51:02,955 --> 00:51:06,024
And that way
where Adam Clay’s headed?

762
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:09,126
Boston.

763
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:11,161
Let’s go.

764
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,197
Thank you.

765
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:29,850
How are you, my friend?

766
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,346
Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

767
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:33,755
Yeah, come on,

768
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,185
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

769
00:51:35,185 --> 00:51:36,923
Don’t play with those things.
They go off.

770
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,860
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

771
00:51:41,422 --> 00:51:44,766
When I was sworn in
as director,

772
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:48,869
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

773
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:53,104
Well...

774
00:51:53,302 --> 00:51:59,275
there are programs
even I wasn’t privy to.

775
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:02,410
Like the Beekeepers.

776
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:06,117
The honeybee has always

777
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,790
had a special relationship
with humanity.

778
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,056
A sacred relationship.

779
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:13,795
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

780
00:52:13,795 --> 00:52:16,127
No agriculture,
no civilization.

781
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:20,032
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

782
00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:23,398
with its complex systems
of workers,

783
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:25,070
caretakers, even royalty.

784
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:29,976
If any of the beehive’s
complex mechanisms

785
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:31,538
are compromised,

786
00:52:31,538 --> 00:52:34,783
the hive collapses.

787
00:52:35,014 --> 00:52:36,785
Someone
a long time ago decided

788
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:39,150
that a mechanism was needed

789
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,184
to keep our nation safe.

790
00:52:40,184 --> 00:52:43,187
A mechanism
outside the chain of command,

791
00:52:43,187 --> 00:52:46,223
outside the system.

792
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:51,899
Its one mission,
to keep the system safe.

793
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:55,001
Beekeepers are given
all resources,

794
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:59,203
empowered to act
on their own judgment.

795
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:02,107
For decades,
they have quietly worked

796
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:05,176
to keep the hive safe.

797
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:08,476
That is, until now.

798
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,084
It appears
that a retired Beekeeper

799
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:13,118
has gone off program

800
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:16,187
and is acting
in what he mistakenly believes

801
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,025
is the hive’s best interest.

802
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:20,587
Can’t somebody just
pick up the phone

803
00:53:20,587 --> 00:53:22,864
and tell this yahoo
to stand-the-fuck down?

804
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:25,900
That’s the one thing
Beekeepers don’t do.

805
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,264
Stand down.

806
00:53:27,264 --> 00:53:29,200
Not unlike bees themselves,

807
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,039
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

808
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,975
So he’s basically one of us.

809
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:38,011
No. He’s not like you.

810
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,079
You’re tier one operators,

811
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,610
former SEAL Team Six,
Delta Group.

812
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:46,921
You are, in other words, pussies.

813
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:50,287
- If you were in the same room,

814
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:51,486
he would kill you.

815
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:56,260
With enough of you,
then maybe you just might

816
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,427
in fact be able to kill him

817
00:53:58,427 --> 00:54:01,067
before he accomplishes
his goal.

818
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:03,168
What would that be?

819
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:07,876
To kill his way
to the top of the hive.

820
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:13,277
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

821
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:23,320
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits.

822
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,321
Did you know that?

823
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,323
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

824
00:54:26,323 --> 00:54:28,457
and we’d be fucked
without them.

825
00:54:28,457 --> 00:54:29,557
Listen.

826
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,965
"Some bees are queen slayers,

827
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:32,967
"which will rise up
and kill their queen

828
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:34,001
"if she fails to produce

829
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:36,938
"the right kind
of male offspring."

830
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:38,500
Fascinating.

831
00:54:39,534 --> 00:54:41,943
No.
- Hm. Nope.

832
00:54:41,943 --> 00:54:42,911
- No.
- No!

833
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:45,276
It’s your turn. You can’t...
- No!

834
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:53,482
Special Agent Parker.

835
00:54:55,055 --> 00:54:56,485
Yeah.

836
00:54:57,024 --> 00:54:58,058
Okay.

837
00:54:58,058 --> 00:54:59,587
Thank you.

838
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:04,295
What?

839
00:55:04,295 --> 00:55:08,299
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

840
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:13,436
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

841
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,036
Here’s another
interesting factoid.

842
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:48,729
Thank fuck.

843
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:51,171
You know,
I was getting sick of enjoying

844
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,173
my peaceful thoughts.

845
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:56,638
Sir.

846
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:58,574
Sir,
this is Special Agent Parker,

847
00:56:58,574 --> 00:56:59,773
Special Agent Wiley.

848
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:01,214
They’ll be briefing you.

849
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:02,380
This is Deputy Director Prigg

850
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,251
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

851
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:07,220
Mr. Deputy Director,

852
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,353
my colleague and I believe

853
00:57:08,353 --> 00:57:10,421
that three major crime scenes
in our area

854
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:13,061
are connected
to a single subject.

855
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:13,721
Adam Clay.

856
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,096
He killed six people today.

857
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:17,791
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

858
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,628
and the nature of his alias,

859
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:21,267
we believe
that Mr. Clay is connected

860
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:24,204
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

861
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:26,668
A program that none
of our partner agencies

862
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:27,834
seem willing to acknowledge.

863
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:31,178
Let’s stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

864
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:32,278
Yes, sir.

865
00:57:32,278 --> 00:57:35,611
In any event, this individual
is highly capable

866
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:36,777
and extremely motivated,

867
00:57:36,777 --> 00:57:39,384
and we believe that he’s
on his way to Boston,

868
00:57:39,384 --> 00:57:40,484
if not already here.

869
00:57:40,484 --> 00:57:43,817
And we believe
that this is his next target,

870
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:45,159
Nine Star United,

871
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:46,589
which appears to be the entity

872
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,228
operating the regional
call centers,

873
00:57:48,228 --> 00:57:50,758
like the one
that Mr. Clay burned down.

874
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:54,234
Why is Adam Clay
on this rampage?

875
00:57:54,366 --> 00:57:59,437
He’s, um,
protecting the hive, sir.

876
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:00,669
It’s what Beekeepers do.

877
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:03,276
I have enough
to brief the director.

878
00:58:03,276 --> 00:58:04,871
- What’s your ask?
My ask?

879
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:08,479
Uh, well, a SWAT team,
for starters.

880
00:58:08,479 --> 00:58:12,549
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

881
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:14,650
That shouldn’t be a problem.

882
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,322
Thank you.

883
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,167
Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

884
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,603
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

885
00:58:33,603 --> 00:58:34,637
It’s roll call time.

886
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:36,540
I’m getting ready
for my dick to get hard

887
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,345
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

888
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:41,677
Let’s start with Phoenix.
Where we at?

889
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:43,316
Phoenix is up 201K.

890
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:45,549
200K, I’m gonna
suck your dick. I love you.

891
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:48,189
- New Orleans, show me,

892
00:58:48,189 --> 00:58:49,619
tell me. Where we at?

893
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:50,818
It’s down 93K, boss.

894
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,655
Down? You’re a fucking loser.

895
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:54,624
You give me
a fucking headache.

896
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:55,790
You give me fucking cancer.

897
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:57,759
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

898
00:58:57,759 --> 00:59:01,169
New York City’s up 64 ASCOT.

899
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:04,172
Yeah! I love you, New York!

900
00:59:11,212 --> 00:59:12,345
Gather around!

901
00:59:12,345 --> 00:59:13,907
I want all weapons
front on entry.

902
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:16,481
Everybody give me an oos!
Oos!

903
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:17,350
Let’s go!

904
00:59:21,717 --> 00:59:24,489
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

905
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:26,920
Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

906
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,659
State Department certified
to carry weapons

907
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:31,463
in all 50 states.

908
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,960
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers

909
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,895
to verify.

910
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:38,569
You’re not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

911
00:59:38,668 --> 00:59:41,242
All right, boys, let’s go!

912
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:44,905
Set up a perimeter outside.

913
00:59:44,905 --> 00:59:47,314
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

914
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:50,845
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

915
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:52,847
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

916
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:55,355
Who the fuck are you?
You can’t be in here.

917
00:59:55,355 --> 00:59:57,621
We’re the guys
keeping you alive.

918
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:58,853
Shut it down now.

919
00:59:58,853 --> 00:59:59,986
Everybody, listen up.

920
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:02,230
Anyone who’s
not carrying a weapon,

921
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,231
get the fuck out!

922
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:04,727
Shouldn’t you be killing
bin Laden or something?

923
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:08,764
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

924
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:09,798
No one’s shutting down.

925
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,671
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they’re fired!

926
01:00:14,671 --> 01:00:15,870
I’m sorry to break it to you,

927
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,542
but bin Laden’s been dead
for a while.

928
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:20,380
So I’m going to say this
one last time.

929
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,316
Shut it down.

930
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:24,450
The fuck I am.

931
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:25,979
Call your fucking boss.

932
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:28,454
You want me to call my boss?

933
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:29,620
I’ll do that.

934
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:35,494
And you’ll be so fucked,
it’s gonna be beautiful.

935
01:00:36,495 --> 01:00:38,695
Don’t be shy. Come on.

936
01:00:38,827 --> 01:00:40,730
What about the parking garage?

937
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,468
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

938
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:44,767
I want a body on comms
watching it.

939
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,472
Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

940
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:48,375
Station an agent there too.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,608
Sure there’s no back entrances
into this place?

942
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:52,038
Hey,
there’re no other entrances.

943
01:00:52,038 --> 01:00:54,513
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

944
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:55,844
Move along
at a minimum retreat

945
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:57,384
to a safe distance.
Thank you.

946
01:00:57,384 --> 01:00:58,781
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

947
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:01,850
The other option,
instead of going in

948
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,423
is to smoke them out.

949
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:04,292
Excuse me?

950
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:07,328
I figured I’d give
the firefighters a break.

951
01:01:07,328 --> 01:01:09,297
I’ve put them through
enough already.

952
01:01:09,297 --> 01:01:10,694
What’d you say your name was?

953
01:01:10,694 --> 01:01:12,630
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

954
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,303
Trust me,
if there was a back entrance,

955
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:16,601
I would’ve used it.

956
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:17,866
I don’t want to injure anyone

957
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:19,901
who’s innocent
and non-involved.

958
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,672
But it is what it is.

959
01:01:21,672 --> 01:01:23,641
Somebody detain this guy!

960
01:01:49,964 --> 01:01:52,406
Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!

961
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:03,846
Oh, wow,
if it isn’t the fucking

962
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:04,913
golden goose himself.

963
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:06,651
Sir, I got
Captain Caveman here

964
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:08,818
telling me
to send everyone home.

965
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:09,753
If we do that,

966
01:02:09,753 --> 01:02:12,426
we’re walking away
from a lot of money.

967
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:14,120
Mm. Put him on.

968
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,628
It’s for you.

969
01:02:16,925 --> 01:02:19,059
Why are you fucking
with my business?

970
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:20,731
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

971
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:23,833
to kick some
fucking Beekeeper’s ass.

972
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:25,670
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

973
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,937
which means
that you work for me.

974
01:02:28,937 --> 01:02:29,971
Now, listen, that place

975
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,105
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

976
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:34,041
I’m not gonna
let some crash test dummy

977
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,449
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

978
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:36,747
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

979
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:38,045
Didn’t this character
already burn

980
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,849
one of your centers
to the ground?

981
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:42,049
Well, you know,
they didn’t have you,

982
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:42,951
and that’s why.

983
01:02:42,951 --> 01:02:44,854
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

984
01:02:44,854 --> 01:02:47,054
and don’t tell me
how to do mine, please.

985
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,090
- We got it?
- Copy that.

986
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:54,435
Fall out.
Set up a perimeter outside.

987
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:55,128
Let’s go. Move!

988
01:02:55,128 --> 01:02:56,866
- Round of applause.

989
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,604
Let’s say goodbye
to our good friends.

990
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:02,036
Bye-bye, Admiral.
Go join fucking Space Force.

991
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:06,106
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

992
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,514
Keep walking.

993
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:09,912
Bye-bye, dickhead.

994
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:12,750
What a bunch of jackoffs.

995
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,423
Yeah, we love you!

996
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:26,467
One time amnesty.

997
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:27,996
Whoever doesn’t want to die
this evening,

998
01:03:27,996 --> 01:03:31,703
can in an orderly fashion
leave now.

999
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:34,541
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It’s not happening.

1000
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:35,707
Anybody moves, you’re fired.

1001
01:03:35,707 --> 01:03:38,677
No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1002
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:40,547
Nada. Zero!

1003
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:41,944
Are you fucking nuts?

1004
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,616
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1005
01:03:43,616 --> 01:03:45,750
30 to 40 million a year
in profit.

1006
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,752
So no one is shooting no guns.

1007
01:03:47,752 --> 01:03:50,524
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1008
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:52,185
These assholes?
They’re not innocent.

1009
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,891
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1010
01:03:54,891 --> 01:03:56,123
some of them will get hurt.

1011
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:59,599
Let’s start with this prick
right here.

1012
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,681
On me!

1013
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:25,889
Take right!

1014
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:42,642
Pettis, we got a man down.

1015
01:05:03,058 --> 01:05:06,094
Fire. Fire.

1016
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:09,834
Fire. Fire.

1017
01:05:15,268 --> 01:05:17,941
You know
who you’re working for?

1018
01:05:17,941 --> 01:05:19,107
None of my fucking business.

1019
01:05:19,107 --> 01:05:22,616
I’m just the guy they call
when there’s a problem.

1020
01:05:25,883 --> 01:05:27,951
And you are our problem.

1021
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:30,855
Goddamn right, I’m a problem.

1022
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:55,748
Fire. Fire.

1023
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,278
Fire. Fire.

1024
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,126
Dan, what the hell happened?

1025
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:12,127
Any dead?

1026
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:14,063
Not dead,
but we got our asses kicked.

1027
01:06:14,063 --> 01:06:16,362
- Our guy. What do we know?
He’s in the building.

1028
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:18,364
I’m waiting more men
to roll in.

1029
01:06:18,364 --> 01:06:19,772
I don’t know what this guy is,

1030
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:21,708
but nobody can do
what he’s done.

1031
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,172
He’s just a Beekeeper.

1032
01:06:24,942 --> 01:06:26,779
Bad idea.

1033
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:28,715
I’m not waiting.

1034
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:30,013
V, wait!
- Move!

1035
01:06:30,013 --> 01:06:31,982
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1036
01:06:31,982 --> 01:06:33,720
Fuck.

1037
01:06:46,227 --> 01:06:48,229
We got him!

1038
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:01,242
You done?
- Reload.

1039
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:08,018
Everybody out!

1040
01:07:20,063 --> 01:07:21,064
You’re done.

1041
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:39,951
We should take the stairs.

1042
01:07:39,951 --> 01:07:41,051
Smart.

1043
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:44,252
Subject is in the hallway.

1044
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:48,091
Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?

1045
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,839
Please, please don’t kill me.

1046
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,975
I’m just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1047
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:05,471
I’d respect you more
if you look people

1048
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:08,716
in their eyes
when you steal from them.

1049
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:22,730
Now, you’re making
a lot of money here.

1050
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:25,095
Tell me where it’s all going.

1051
01:08:25,095 --> 01:08:26,129
I don’t know, man.

1052
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:31,805
I know you’re the middle man.

1053
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:36,139
- Who’s above you?
- No. They’ll kill me.

1054
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:41,045
I’ll torture you,
then kill you.

1055
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,349
Come on, guys. You got it.

1056
01:08:48,349 --> 01:08:50,857
Wiley,
get your ass up here!

1057
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:53,222
Yeah, well,
I’m not an Olympian.

1058
01:08:53,222 --> 01:08:55,796
Make it stop.

1059
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:57,490
You can make it stop.

1060
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,932
You’ve stolen
hundreds of millions

1061
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,329
from people
who’ve done nothing

1062
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:03,837
but work hard all their lives.

1063
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,843
She was an educator, a mom.

1064
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:13,275
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1065
01:09:14,474 --> 01:09:16,982
Yesterday, she shot herself

1066
01:09:16,982 --> 01:09:20,986
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1067
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:28,829
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1068
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:34,494
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1069
01:09:34,494 --> 01:09:37,101
Tell me who and where.
- I can’t.

1070
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:38,135
Look, these people,

1071
01:09:38,135 --> 01:09:39,466
they’re untouchable.
I can’t...

1072
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,535
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1073
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:45,406
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1074
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:05,833
I told you
they were untouchable.

1075
01:10:06,966 --> 01:10:09,133
Nobody’s untouchable.

1076
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:15,337
Sometimes when the hive’s
out of balance...

1077
01:10:16,602 --> 01:10:19,176
you have to replace the queen.

1078
01:10:24,214 --> 01:10:25,952
Clay!

1079
01:10:28,086 --> 01:10:30,319
That man is directly
responsible

1080
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:32,288
for your mother’s death.

1081
01:10:35,258 --> 01:10:36,556
I believe you.

1082
01:10:36,556 --> 01:10:40,032
But we have laws
for these things.

1083
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:45,400
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1084
01:10:46,874 --> 01:10:48,535
Then you have me.

1085
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,183
Arrest him!

1086
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:01,284
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1087
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:04,155
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1088
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:06,025
Shut your fucking mouth!

1089
01:11:18,136 --> 01:11:21,304
Whoa. I have four kids.

1090
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:25,572
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1091
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:39,190
Wiley? You okay?

1092
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:41,159
Yeah. He went that way.
You okay?

1093
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,655
Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1094
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:43,964
I’m doing computer nerd shit.

1095
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:45,295
Well, I won’t tell her
if you don’t.

1096
01:11:45,295 --> 01:11:47,198
- Have you been hit?
- No, I’m good, Mom.

1097
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:48,100
Did you get him?

1098
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,937
- Did you?
- No, he’s tricky.

1099
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,598
Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1100
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,006
I guess that’s just evidence.

1101
01:11:53,006 --> 01:11:54,942
Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let’s go.

1102
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:58,440
On me. On me. On me. On me.
Clear!

1103
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:07,955
I want interviews
with all of them.

1104
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:15,391
We’re going to talk.

1105
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,393
Get him out of here.

1106
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,181
Wiley.

1107
01:12:43,254 --> 01:12:44,750
Holy shit.

1108
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,531
Do you mind
if I ask you

1109
01:12:56,531 --> 01:12:58,071
a really boring question?

1110
01:12:58,071 --> 01:13:01,602
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1111
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:03,010
Mm.

1112
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:03,703
That’s deep.

1113
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,706
Oh, I’m so sorry. Excuse me.

1114
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:09,643
Oh, God. Uh...

1115
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:13,317
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Come upstairs.

1116
01:13:15,385 --> 01:13:19,191
You said these guys
were the fucking best. Uh...

1117
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,160
Why are they all dead?

1118
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:22,524
You kicked the beehive

1119
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:25,758
and now we have
to reap the whirlwind.

1120
01:13:27,034 --> 01:13:29,102
- Unless...
-  Unless.

1121
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:32,105
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1122
01:13:32,105 --> 01:13:34,635
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1123
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:38,738
I’m paying you
so much fucking money

1124
01:13:38,738 --> 01:13:41,312
and your advice
is to call my mother?

1125
01:13:41,378 --> 01:13:44,117
He can’t make his move on us

1126
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:47,549
if we’re in her proximity,
can he?

1127
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:49,287
Her people.

1128
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:56,822
You’re a fuck.

1129
01:13:56,822 --> 01:13:59,198
- You’re scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1130
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:00,562
...and you want
to use my mother

1131
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:01,629
as a human shield.

1132
01:14:01,629 --> 01:14:04,566
Just call her.
Just call her. Come on.

1133
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:06,370
It’s not a game now.

1134
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,306
Oh, it’s all a game.

1135
01:14:08,372 --> 01:14:09,736
Come on.

1136
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,276
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1137
01:14:11,276 --> 01:14:13,113
Hey, Mom. No, nothing.

1138
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:14,774
I was just, you know,
thinking about you.

1139
01:14:14,774 --> 01:14:18,844
I miss you. I was hoping
to maybe see you this weekend.

1140
01:14:18,844 --> 01:14:20,087
I’m at the beach house.

1141
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:21,451
You’re welcome to join
if you behave.

1142
01:14:21,451 --> 01:14:23,618
I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,

1143
01:14:23,618 --> 01:14:25,554
you know,
get together with some of my

1144
01:14:25,554 --> 01:14:27,127
tech homies and stuff,
if that’s, uh,

1145
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:28,722
if that’s cool with you.

1146
01:14:28,722 --> 01:14:29,624
Fine. No drugs.

1147
01:14:29,624 --> 01:14:32,858
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1148
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,794
Derek’s joining me
this weekend.

1149
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:35,828
Help me keep him sober.

1150
01:14:35,828 --> 01:14:37,830
Yes, ma’am.
I love babysitting.

1151
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,865
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1152
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:41,768
Hello. Good to meet you.

1153
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:42,703
Sola Oyemade.

1154
01:14:42,703 --> 01:14:44,705
Sola, thank you so much
for coming.

1155
01:14:44,705 --> 01:14:45,607
Susan Aneno.

1156
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,576
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1157
01:14:47,576 --> 01:14:48,511
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1158
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:51,349
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma’am.

1159
01:14:57,553 --> 01:15:00,622
You don’t have to do this,
you know?

1160
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:03,823
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1161
01:15:05,165 --> 01:15:08,333
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1162
01:15:15,835 --> 01:15:18,145
Wherever it’s headed...

1163
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:20,741
I swore an oath.

1164
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:24,316
I can’t stand by
and watch it happen.

1165
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,753
Even if he’s right?

1166
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:40,266
Even if he’s right.

1167
01:15:41,729 --> 01:15:44,666
Apologies.
Damn plane was delayed.

1168
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,733
What have you got?

1169
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:48,934
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay’s true intentions.

1170
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:52,773
He seems to be
following the money.

1171
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:53,939
What money is that?

1172
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:57,382
Usually it’s from people
with no heirs, no family.

1173
01:15:57,382 --> 01:15:59,780
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1174
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,916
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1175
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:06,655
There’s another
company involved, sir,

1176
01:16:06,655 --> 01:16:09,856
a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1177
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,264
and to the Justice Department.

1178
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,629
In fact,
we use this company’s software

1179
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:14,927
in this very office

1180
01:16:14,927 --> 01:16:18,535
to identify financial fraud.

1181
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:22,275
Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?

1182
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:28,875
Danforth Enterprises.

1183
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,351
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1184
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:36,223
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1185
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,852
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1186
01:16:38,852 --> 01:16:41,789
as President
of the United States.

1187
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:43,692
She self-financed
her campaign.

1188
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:47,366
Yeah.
None of that money was clean.

1189
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:49,368
Who else knows this?

1190
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:51,304
Us three.

1191
01:16:51,304 --> 01:16:53,669
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1192
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:55,869
Let’s, uh,
keep the circle small,

1193
01:16:55,869 --> 01:16:58,443
until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.

1194
01:16:58,443 --> 01:17:01,512
Not a word of this to anyone.
Understood?

1195
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:02,447
Yes, sir.

1196
01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:04,251
And, Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count

1197
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:05,351
is steadily rising.

1198
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:07,012
In a beehive,
there is something

1199
01:17:07,012 --> 01:17:08,321
called a "queen slayer."

1200
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:12,292
It’s a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

1201
01:17:12,292 --> 01:17:14,459
if she produces
defective offspring.

1202
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,758
I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.

1203
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:20,366
Right. Yes.
Not that Beekeepers exist.

1204
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:23,831
But Mr. Clay
does keep honey bees.

1205
01:17:23,831 --> 01:17:25,305
He admires their willingness

1206
01:17:25,305 --> 01:17:29,375
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1207
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:33,940
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1208
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,679
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1209
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:40,353
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1210
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:43,422
and become a queen slayer.

1211
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:48,658
Adam Clay’s next victim
is Derek Danforth’s mother?

1212
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,792
President Danforth, sir.

1213
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:54,796
You have a blank check.
Good luck.

1214
01:17:56,028 --> 01:17:57,766
Thank you.

1215
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,552
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. This is a private event.

1216
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:16,620
I’m gonna need you
to turn around, go away.

1217
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,622
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1218
01:18:18,622 --> 01:18:20,327
We’re good.
We have invites right here.

1219
01:18:20,327 --> 01:18:21,889
All right. You’ll need
to excuse my partner.

1220
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:24,023
He’s recently concussed
and hasn’t slept in two days.

1221
01:18:24,023 --> 01:18:25,992
We’re on the access list.

1222
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:28,599
We’re good, boss.

1223
01:18:55,593 --> 01:18:57,958
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1224
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:58,992
I don’t want them here.

1225
01:18:58,992 --> 01:19:00,994
They’re C team.
B team at best.

1226
01:19:00,994 --> 01:19:03,832
Uh, Mom’s detail is not going
to like that.

1227
01:19:03,832 --> 01:19:07,099
Well, if Mom’s detail
gets in the way

1228
01:19:07,099 --> 01:19:08,133
of what’s coming for us,

1229
01:19:08,133 --> 01:19:10,740
they’re dead men
and so are we.

1230
01:19:10,938 --> 01:19:13,479
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1231
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:14,139
Yes, sir.

1232
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,585
He has a little talent,
doesn’t he?

1233
01:19:20,585 --> 01:19:22,521
He’s absolutely
fucking terrifying.

1234
01:19:22,521 --> 01:19:23,654
Yeah.

1235
01:19:23,654 --> 01:19:25,821
Good men,
but clearly not good enough.

1236
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:27,691
Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1237
01:19:27,691 --> 01:19:30,397
How’d you piss this oak off, huh?

1238
01:19:30,397 --> 01:19:31,090
I...

1239
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,026
You’re looking at me?
Mm-hmm.

1240
01:19:33,026 --> 01:19:35,435
How is any of this my fault?

1241
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:37,030
Wasn’t your super secret CIA

1242
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,867
data mining software
supposed to,

1243
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:40,066
I don’t know, maybe filter out

1244
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,738
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1245
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:43,135
Don’t you fuck with me,
young man!

1246
01:19:43,135 --> 01:19:44,873
Any other life,
you’d be in jail.

1247
01:19:44,873 --> 01:19:48,580
Hey, this is the fucking
Beekeeper!

1248
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:53,618
Yeah, you know
I killed one once.

1249
01:19:53,618 --> 01:19:54,553
Oh, you see?

1250
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:56,181
Yeah. Only ’cause I was lucky.

1251
01:19:56,181 --> 01:20:00,526
And un-fucking-lucky.
Oh, jeez.

1252
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:04,530
Yeah, don’t piss your pants, bruh.

1253
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:06,433
My team will be out shortly.

1254
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:07,467
If anyone can knock

1255
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:09,436
this guy’s dick in the dirt,
it’s them.

1256
01:20:09,436 --> 01:20:12,901
Ain’t that right, money man?

1257
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:16,575
Yeah.

1258
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:33,152
I’m supposed to be
at a kids’ birthday party

1259
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:34,890
with my wife.

1260
01:20:37,794 --> 01:20:39,994
You are at a kids’
birthday party.

1261
01:20:39,994 --> 01:20:42,062
And I’m your work wife.

1262
01:20:55,911 --> 01:20:58,650
Madam President,
you look spectacular.

1263
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,520
When the fuck are you
going to tell me

1264
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,885
what’s going on, Wallace?

1265
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:07,989
Good. Go through.

1266
01:21:08,187 --> 01:21:09,991
Tell that guy
to hurry up.

1267
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:13,093
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1268
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,939
Six up.

1269
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:26,040
Good to go.

1270
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,746
Let’s go. Let’s go.

1271
01:21:39,823 --> 01:21:42,287
Come on. Move it up.

1272
01:21:58,006 --> 01:22:01,306
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1273
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,829
Go!

1274
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:48,353
We got eyes
on the second floor.

1275
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:58,066
All right, you’re good.
Coming through.

1276
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:22,057
Oh.

1277
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:26,028
Hey. When, uh, did you get in?
What a surprise.

1278
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:30,065
You didn’t hear
the giant Marine helicopter

1279
01:23:30,065 --> 01:23:32,067
land on the front lawn?

1280
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,365
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1281
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:36,104
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1282
01:23:36,104 --> 01:23:38,810
Uh, I wouldn’t unless
you want to go

1283
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,878
talk with the machine elves.

1284
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:45,751
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1285
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:49,348
I mean,  power,
it just looks so good on you.

1286
01:23:49,348 --> 01:23:51,856
Doing blow
on your father’s desk.

1287
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:53,418
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1288
01:23:53,418 --> 01:23:56,663
so I could kill him.

1289
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:00,359
Stop picking your face.

1290
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,265
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1291
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:07,366
What have you done to the man?

1292
01:24:07,366 --> 01:24:10,237
Mm, I wouldn’t know, Mother.

1293
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:12,074
Well, he’s there
to protect you

1294
01:24:12,074 --> 01:24:13,878
if you’ll let him.

1295
01:24:15,913 --> 01:24:19,444
You’re a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1296
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:22,821
What does that mean?

1297
01:24:23,085 --> 01:24:27,386
It means that God doesn’t give
with both  hands.

1298
01:24:27,386 --> 01:24:30,224
Uh, okay.
I love you too, Mom.

1299
01:24:30,224 --> 01:24:31,423
Hm.

1300
01:24:31,423 --> 01:24:34,063
Gotta go run the free world.

1301
01:24:34,063 --> 01:24:35,999
Don’t burn it down.

1302
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,908
Fucking fantastic!

1303
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:53,307
Wiley, look.

1304
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:55,111
Oh, shit.

1305
01:25:55,111 --> 01:25:57,476
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1306
01:25:57,476 --> 01:26:01,183
Look at her body language.
Bad vibes.

1307
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,955
She got caught riding dirty.

1308
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:05,792
What have we done?

1309
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:09,092
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1310
01:26:09,092 --> 01:26:09,994
It’s gonna pop.

1311
01:26:09,994 --> 01:26:12,326
They’re minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1312
01:26:12,326 --> 01:26:14,130
- Okay.
- I’ll connect your wallet.

1313
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,967
May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1314
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:18,530
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1315
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:21,302
Sorry.

1316
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:25,273
Uh, who’s this?

1317
01:26:25,273 --> 01:26:27,979
Jackson Prigg.
He’s number two at the FBI.

1318
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,178
Have a seat.

1319
01:26:29,178 --> 01:26:30,212
Uh, I’m cool. I’ll stand.

1320
01:26:30,212 --> 01:26:31,818
What is this, like,
an ambush or something?

1321
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:33,116
This feels weird.
I don’t like it.

1322
01:26:33,116 --> 01:26:34,579
No, you’ll sit.

1323
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:39,122
I’ll sit.

1324
01:26:41,586 --> 01:26:43,192
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1325
01:26:43,192 --> 01:26:44,930
It’s okay, ma’am.
I can take notes.

1326
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:47,229
I need you to step outside.

1327
01:26:54,203 --> 01:26:57,503
The deputy director
has flagged his, uh, concerns

1328
01:26:57,503 --> 01:26:59,010
about some
uncomfortable things

1329
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:01,408
happening inside
the family company.

1330
01:27:01,408 --> 01:27:02,948
Like what?

1331
01:27:02,948 --> 01:27:04,081
Uncomfortable things about

1332
01:27:04,081 --> 01:27:06,919
the source
of my campaign funds.

1333
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:10,153
Sounds serious. What’s up?

1334
01:27:10,615 --> 01:27:11,517
Deputy Director.

1335
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:17,160
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1336
01:27:17,589 --> 01:27:19,998
United Data Group.

1337
01:27:19,998 --> 01:27:22,561
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1338
01:27:22,561 --> 01:27:25,630
I invested in that.

1339
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:26,873
I invest everywhere.

1340
01:27:26,873 --> 01:27:28,138
I mean, there’s...
It’s everywhere.

1341
01:27:28,138 --> 01:27:29,909
It’s very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1342
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:33,880
How about, uh,
Nine Star United?

1343
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,147
Yeah, that was, uh...

1344
01:27:37,147 --> 01:27:39,512
that’s more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1345
01:27:39,512 --> 01:27:41,987
It’s block chain issues.
And you probably...

1346
01:27:41,987 --> 01:27:45,023
I don’t want to bore you
with all that.

1347
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:49,423
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1348
01:27:49,423 --> 01:27:50,897
data mining software package

1349
01:27:50,897 --> 01:27:54,527
developed by
the intelligence community?

1350
01:28:08,145 --> 01:28:09,278
He’s here.

1351
01:28:09,278 --> 01:28:11,379
All stations, target’s
in the building. East wing.

1352
01:28:11,379 --> 01:28:13,480
Give me everything you got.

1353
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,921
He’s in the house!

1354
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,516
Assault team, saddle up!

1355
01:28:16,516 --> 01:28:18,584
Let’s move, boys!
Get a move on!

1356
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:19,552
Let’s move! Come on!

1357
01:28:19,552 --> 01:28:23,259
Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1358
01:28:23,259 --> 01:28:25,525
Break-break!
Package is in the house!

1359
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:26,592
Level three, side four.

1360
01:28:26,592 --> 01:28:30,134
Blue over blue, you see him,
you fucking get him!

1361
01:28:30,134 --> 01:28:34,171
Hey!
Put your fucking hands up.

1362
01:28:35,337 --> 01:28:37,944
Now turn the fuck around.

1363
01:28:41,475 --> 01:28:44,214
- Fuck.
Fuck.

1364
01:28:45,952 --> 01:28:48,020
He’s outside.
Target’s outside.

1365
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,087
Move! Move!

1366
01:28:49,087 --> 01:28:50,253
Let’s get this fucking guy!

1367
01:28:50,253 --> 01:28:52,288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1368
01:28:52,288 --> 01:28:54,488
- Negative.

1369
01:28:54,488 --> 01:28:56,325
- Clay!
- That’s right.

1370
01:28:58,063 --> 01:29:01,561
That’s right.
Now, on your knees!

1371
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:03,563
On your knees!

1372
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:07,336
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1373
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:12,473
Down on your knees now!

1374
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:14,310
Do it now!

1375
01:29:19,315 --> 01:29:23,550
Beekeeper, huh?
God’s right hand?

1376
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,518
You aren’t shit.

1377
01:29:24,518 --> 01:29:25,552
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1378
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:27,125
Hey,
take a step back.

1379
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:29,523
I’m putting this asshole’s
brains on the lawn.

1380
01:29:29,523 --> 01:29:31,756
What are you doing?
He’s not even armed.

1381
01:29:31,756 --> 01:29:32,559
Armed?

1382
01:29:32,559 --> 01:29:35,166
As long as this motherfucker’s
breathing, he’s armed.

1383
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:38,070
You’re not fucking
executing him.

1384
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,699
Nice crowd
you’re rolling with.

1385
01:29:48,047 --> 01:29:49,576
Watch me.

1386
01:29:49,576 --> 01:29:51,578
V, what the fuck is going on?

1387
01:29:51,578 --> 01:29:54,185
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1388
01:29:54,185 --> 01:29:57,287
Isn’t that
the bloody question?

1389
01:29:57,485 --> 01:29:59,454
I think I’ll take

1390
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:00,653
- to "bee."

1391
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,237
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1392
01:30:13,237 --> 01:30:15,074
Yeah.
- Go.

1393
01:30:16,669 --> 01:30:19,342
Get off me!

1394
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:21,806
He’s fucking mine!

1395
01:30:21,806 --> 01:30:24,248
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1396
01:30:33,389 --> 01:30:34,456
He’s here!

1397
01:30:34,456 --> 01:30:37,195
Go! Go! All stations!

1398
01:30:39,263 --> 01:30:41,463
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1399
01:30:46,204 --> 01:30:47,205
Go with the flow.

1400
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:48,470
Not clear.
He’s not clear.

1401
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:50,307
Hang tight.

1402
01:30:50,307 --> 01:30:51,605
On me.

1403
01:31:10,393 --> 01:31:13,462
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1404
01:31:15,662 --> 01:31:18,566
You understand you did this, right?

1405
01:31:18,566 --> 01:31:19,600
You broke the rules.

1406
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,602
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1407
01:31:21,602 --> 01:31:23,736
I was just trying
to get you into office, Mom.

1408
01:31:23,736 --> 01:31:25,408
How else do you think
you got elected?

1409
01:31:25,408 --> 01:31:27,311
I was going to win
with or without your help.

1410
01:31:27,311 --> 01:31:31,117
We were already rich.
Your father built an empire.

1411
01:31:31,117 --> 01:31:32,514
Yeah. And you were going
to fucking

1412
01:31:32,514 --> 01:31:34,417
break it up into pieces
and sell it off.

1413
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:35,781
Well, in the name
of public service

1414
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:39,257
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1415
01:31:39,257 --> 01:31:40,159
Okay. Right.

1416
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:41,853
Yeah, because
you hate the fact

1417
01:31:41,853 --> 01:31:42,788
that being the president

1418
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,559
is just like
an endless cocktail party.

1419
01:31:44,559 --> 01:31:46,132
You realize
that you were behind

1420
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:48,266
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1421
01:31:48,266 --> 01:31:49,333
15 of 20 counties!

1422
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:52,666
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1423
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,701
and not terrorists.

1424
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:57,572
You didn’t hear that.

1425
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,916
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1426
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:14,721
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1427
01:32:14,721 --> 01:32:16,690
Now I know
where the money came from...

1428
01:32:17,592 --> 01:32:18,857
...and all the people
you hurt.

1429
01:32:18,857 --> 01:32:20,628
Okay, whatever.
It’s computer data, Mom.

1430
01:32:20,628 --> 01:32:21,893
Somebody in this family
has to have

1431
01:32:21,893 --> 01:32:23,367
their fucking feet
on the ground

1432
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:24,863
to actually get shit done.
You understand that?

1433
01:32:40,186 --> 01:32:44,718
Mom, the wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1434
01:32:44,718 --> 01:32:47,523
What are you going to do
to fix this?

1435
01:32:50,658 --> 01:32:52,396
Tell the truth.

1436
01:32:53,727 --> 01:32:54,662
The fucking...

1437
01:32:54,662 --> 01:32:56,400
What does that even mean?

1438
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,204
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1439
01:32:58,204 --> 01:33:00,239
- You have an entire building

1440
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,240
full of PR people

1441
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,769
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1442
01:33:02,769 --> 01:33:04,639
That guy who’s coming
to kill us, that Beekeeper,

1443
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,774
I’m telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1444
01:33:07,774 --> 01:33:09,776
Then I’m telling
the entire nation.

1445
01:33:09,776 --> 01:33:12,515
And if it costs me everything,

1446
01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:14,451
well, so be it.

1447
01:34:27,524 --> 01:34:29,460
You fucking git!

1448
01:34:35,026 --> 01:34:36,731
Fuck!

1449
01:34:41,065 --> 01:34:42,869
You’re just a man.

1450
01:34:43,342 --> 01:34:44,739
I know.

1451
01:35:37,627 --> 01:35:40,498
- Thank you.

1452
01:36:13,993 --> 01:36:17,931
Jesus. Looks like
a tornado came through here.

1453
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,102
What’s your plan here, huh?

1454
01:36:24,102 --> 01:36:25,939
You’re going to tell this guy
the fucking truth

1455
01:36:25,939 --> 01:36:27,809
and hope that he spares you
and kills me instead?

1456
01:36:27,809 --> 01:36:29,140
No, Derek,
I’ll tell him the truth

1457
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,944
because it’s the truth.

1458
01:36:39,557 --> 01:36:42,956
It’s gone far enough.
You’ve proved your point.

1459
01:36:42,956 --> 01:36:46,663
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1460
01:36:47,565 --> 01:36:49,160
I’m retired.

1461
01:36:49,798 --> 01:36:51,800
This is personal.

1462
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:54,539
All the more reason to stop.

1463
01:36:55,067 --> 01:36:57,707
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1464
01:36:57,707 --> 01:37:00,512
Making honey
for your neighbors.

1465
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:02,206
That’s all I wanted.

1466
01:37:02,206 --> 01:37:05,583
- My neighbor’s dead.
- I know. I’m sorry.

1467
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:08,179
But do you live
in the real world

1468
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:10,720
or just protect it?

1469
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:14,526
What does it matter to you

1470
01:37:14,526 --> 01:37:17,463
how presidents
come to be elected?

1471
01:37:17,463 --> 01:37:20,026
- Hm?
- It doesn’t.

1472
01:37:20,026 --> 01:37:22,534
What does matter to you?

1473
01:37:22,732 --> 01:37:24,569
Right and wrong.

1474
01:37:24,734 --> 01:37:26,769
It’s not fashionable.

1475
01:37:26,769 --> 01:37:28,232
I believe there’s good
in the universe.

1476
01:37:28,232 --> 01:37:33,710
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that’s my view.

1477
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:36,482
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1478
01:37:36,482 --> 01:37:38,781
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1479
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:42,884
We wouldn’t need Beekeepers
if it wasn’t for men like you.

1480
01:37:42,884 --> 01:37:44,215
Don’t do that.

1481
01:37:44,215 --> 01:37:46,052
Sir, you might want
to step back.

1482
01:37:46,052 --> 01:37:46,822
No.

1483
01:37:46,822 --> 01:37:49,253
I don’t want you to get hurt.
- I’m sorry. I can’t do that.

1484
01:37:51,497 --> 01:37:53,224
Now, have a seat.

1485
01:37:56,095 --> 01:37:59,670
Nah, fuck the truth, man.
The truth...

1486
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,133
Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1487
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:03,740
...comes out
of your fucking...

1488
01:38:03,971 --> 01:38:04,906
Jesus Christ!

1489
01:38:04,906 --> 01:38:06,270
That’s fucking real
right there.

1490
01:38:19,085 --> 01:38:22,022
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1491
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,579
You decide who you work for.

1492
01:38:41,976 --> 01:38:43,912
For the law

1493
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:47,245
or for justice.

1494
01:38:49,819 --> 01:38:51,216
Fuck this.

1495
01:38:51,216 --> 01:38:52,888
Bye, Mom.

1496
01:38:58,597 --> 01:38:59,961
Go! Go!
Move. Move.

1497
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:01,831
Move it out. Out of the way.
You’re okay.

1498
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:06,231
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1499
01:39:07,133 --> 01:39:08,772
Clay!

1500
01:39:11,137 --> 01:39:12,941
Come with us right now!

1501
01:39:12,941 --> 01:39:17,077
No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1502
01:39:17,143 --> 01:39:17,814
No!

1503
01:39:17,814 --> 01:39:19,684
You need to come
with me. Come on.

1504
01:39:19,684 --> 01:39:22,016
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1505
01:39:22,016 --> 01:39:24,788
Give me your hand. Come on!
No!

1506
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,638
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1507
01:39:39,638 --> 01:39:43,334
- Keep eyes on! Let’s go!
