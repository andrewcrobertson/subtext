00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,867
he wanders
the world each night,

722
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,869
searching for children

723
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,913
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

724
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,958
-Not just any children...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

725
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,960
Let me guess.

726
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,920
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen
to their parents or...

727
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,880
Wrong, Patty. (SCOFFS)

728
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,591
It's the good kids he wants.

729
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,011
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

730
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,890
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

731
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,601
he won't rest
until he has them

732
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,312
slung over his bony shoulder.

733
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,773
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

734
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,863
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

735
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,239
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

736
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,532
And scared you better be!

737
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,950
Wander too close,
he'll drag you in

738
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,493
and make pencils
out of your fingers,

739
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,203
and gobble
the rest of you down!

740
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,999
Are you with me, boy?

741
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,795
Good.

742
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,463

743
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,158

744
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,078
Yep.

745
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,218
BARBARA: That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

746
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,929
Pat's was so intense,

747
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,431
I felt it was crucial
to give him

748
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,850
as much context as possible

749
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,478
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

750
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:02,530
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

751
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,617
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

752
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,454
Curiously, his methodology,

753
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,165
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

754
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,669
are remarkably consistent.

755
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,129
He has the power to paralyze

756
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,966
and incapacitate
parents and adults

757
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,468
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

758
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,888
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

759
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,976
It sustains him, nourishes him.

760
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,397
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

761
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,650
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

762
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,195
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

763
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,698
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

764
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,116
On the contrary.

765
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:50,161
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

766
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,831
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

767
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,418
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

768
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,962
you're projecting
the supernatural

769
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,880
onto something...

770
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,842
-all too painfully real.

with the real stuff

772

bubbling up for you,

773
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,932
the anger,

774
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:15,020

and violation,

775

with you and Liam at the mine?

cut off a lock of my hair.

we ran home screaming.

A lock of your hair?

815
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,599
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

817

where to find you.

No matter where
you try to run or hide.

Your father was something else.

822

I think in his own way
he was just trying
to protect me.

A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

was Mom was furious

825

'cause every night
I was convinced

826
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,883
he was tapping on my window.

827
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,844
And then one night,

828
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,430
the old man came in
and he said,

829
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,102
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing
as Bagman."

830

I can't do that.

What I can do...

832
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,074
is tell you a secret

he'll rot away.

than anything else
in the world.

842
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,611
Something they love so much,

843
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,907
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

844
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,201
And believe you me,

a child's love...

846
