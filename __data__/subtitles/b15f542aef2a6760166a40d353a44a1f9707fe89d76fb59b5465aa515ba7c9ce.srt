1
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,045
Do you think we're close?

2
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,257
They're almost impossible to find.

3
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,051
No one's ever captured one alive.

4
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,972
I agreed to provide security for you...

5
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:58,684
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

6
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,310
Well, it's worth the wait.

7
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:02,937
Dead specimens show that

8
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,190
the peptides in the
spider's venom, they...

9
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,279
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

10
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:14,615
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

11
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,993
like <i>Las Arañas.</i>

12
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,619
<i>Las Arañas?</i>

13
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,623
The, uh, mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

14
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:23,833
and punish evil men

15
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,002
with their black,
poisoned touch?

16
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:28,254
I like to base my research
in science,

17
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,006
not legends, Mr. Sims.

18
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,800
Those powers are wasted here.

19
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,302
These little spiders

20
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,596
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

21
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:37,680
It could...

22
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:41,018
- Are you okay?
- No.

23
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,812
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

24
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:47,024
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

25
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,318
Not when I'm this close.

26
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,614
Perhaps you should rest.

27
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,742
I don't have time.

28
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,037
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,122
For the umbrella.

30
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,250
I found it.

31
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:48,876
I found the spider.

32
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:55,007
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

33
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,801
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

34
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:58,928
Something so small
yet have so much power.

35
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,766
Okay.

36
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,811
What are you doing?

37
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,020
I don't...

38
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,188
I don't understand.

39
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,607
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

40
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:14,026
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

41
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,528
I'm not interested
in helping people.

42
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,656
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

43
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,533
My road was
not as clear as yours.

44
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,118
We didn't have the same choices.

45
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,494
You're making
the wrong decision.

46
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:24,578
- Give me the spider!
- No.

47
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:25,830
You're making
the wrong decision.

48
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,416
- Give it to me.
- No.

49
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,625
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

50
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,226
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

51
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,139
No.

52
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,592
Her journey will not be easy...

53
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,219
but she is strong.

54
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,513
She will come back
when she needs answers.

55
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,140
And when she does...

56
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,310
I will be here for her.

57
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,247
Come on!

58
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,875
Whoa!

59
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,753
Move!

60
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,047
All right!
All right!

61
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:44,093
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

62
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:45,553
Code three.

63
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:47,847
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

64
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:50,266
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

65
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,143
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

66
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,937
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

67
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,574
Come on.

68
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
How you doing back there?

69
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,504
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

70
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:21,630
I was being shot at.

71
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,924
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

72
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,218
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

73
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,887
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

74
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,941
Shouldn't you be in school?

75
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,904
Who flips off an ambulance?

76
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,238
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

77
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,741
Jesus.

78
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,368
Kids.

79
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,710
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

80
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:01,629
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

81
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,839
Mm-mmm, I know how
these things work, Ben.

82
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,257
Oh, do you?
How do you know?

83
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,550
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

84
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:09,845
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

85
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,848
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

86
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:13,433
She's gonna be okay.

87
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,644
Who?

88
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,605
Your patient.

89
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:21,149
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

90
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,735
Um...

91
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,569
You know what,

92
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,250
Mr. Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

93
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,365
Just take it.

94
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,991
Take it.

95
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:32,577
Just take it.

96
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,371
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

97
00:08:35,372 --> 00:08:36,892
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,792
I'll take you in to see her.

99
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,502
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

100
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:42,878
I'm her stepdaughter.

101
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,547
I think she might prefer...

102
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,174
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

103
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:49,678
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

104
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,595
Okay.

105
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:52,681
Come on, buddy.

106
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,556
Let's go see Mommy.

107
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:57,434
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

108
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,355
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

109
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,607
What am I supposed
to do with this?

110
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,401
Just put it in your pocket

111
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,612
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

112
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:11,616
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

113
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:15,620
Ugh, come on.

114
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,915
We both hate family stuff.

115
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,126
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

116
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,711
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

117
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,629
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

118
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,548
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

119
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:28,799
You know, I might sleep in.

120
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,135
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

121
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,261
You don't have a dog.

122
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,846
I might adopt one.

123
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,014
Return the favor.

124
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,976
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

125
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,955
I don't know
what you're talking about.

126
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,021
I was a model foster kid.

127
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,648
I peed outside and everything.

128
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:46,818
So, um...

129
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,489
I kinda met someone.

130
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:53,240
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,658
What's this one's name?

132
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:01,081
Oh.

133
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,168
Serious.

134
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,468
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

135
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:14,929
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

136
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,807
Oh!
"You have a winning personality."

137
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,100
I guess I got yours by mistake.

138
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:22,311
You're an asshole.

139
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,396
Here.

140
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,775
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

141
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,486
What if I don't wanna know?

142
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:31,780
Well, it's just a cookie.

143
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,078
"You will."

144
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,121
You will what?

145
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,833
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

146
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,419
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

147
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,297
It means that
their printer is broken.

148
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:51,590
We can't eat here anymore.

149
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,168
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

150
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,147
You think
I can manage both of these?

151
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:08,232
I think so, yeah.

152
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,566
<i>We'll have it for you tomorrow.</i>

153
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,444
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheck.

154
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:13,278
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

155
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,363
I haven't seen him in a while.

156
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:15,614
Maybe we can work something out.

157
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,950
He's not home right now, actually.

158
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,451
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.

159
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:21,245
But no more excuses.

160
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,746
I swear.
We'll have it.

161
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,707
All right.

162
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:05,081
Us strays
need to stick together.

163
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,750
Somebody's hungry.

164
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,125
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

165
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,049
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

166
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:44,472
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

167
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,224
MVA, three vehicles.

168
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,977
<i>One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.</i>

169
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,770
<i>Copy that.
Sending backup to your location.</i>

170
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:52,939
It won't open.

171
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:55,233
All right, sir.

172
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,234
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

173
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,068
Just don't move.

174
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,945
Hi, sir.

175
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,280
Can you tell me your name?

176
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,739
Robert.

177
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,908
Robert, I'm Cassie.

178
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:06,952
I'm gonna help you out today, okay?

179
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,287
You're gonna be all right.

180
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:09,454
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seatbelt.

181
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:10,622
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

182
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:12,249
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

183
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,001
on that side, okay?

184
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:15,837
Three, two, one.

185
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,047
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

186
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:20,132
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,926
One, two, three.

188
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,053
Okay.
You're gonna be okay, sir.

189
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,174
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

190
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,349
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

191
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,268
- Cassie!
- Ben!

192
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,170
<i>79 over 55.</i>

193
00:14:58,171 --> 00:14:59,671
<i>Dial it back, I'm fine.</i>

194
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:01,590
<i>You need a real workup
at a real hospital.</i>

195
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:03,592
<i>No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.</i>

196
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,136
<i>Games!</i>

197
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:06,803
<i>You guys are ice-cold.</i>

198
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:09,557
<i>Cassie!</i>

199
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,267
<i>This place has always
been a death trap.</i>

200
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,775
<i>You can't save all three!</i>

201
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:20,859
<i>...you can use the web</i>

202
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,820
<i>to be in more than one place
at the same time.</i>

203
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,740
<i>You are the only one
who can change the future.</i>

204
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,991
<i>No!</i>

205
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,076
<i>Cassie!</i>

206
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,535
<i>That's it, Cassie, breathe!</i>

207
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:31,745
Come on!

208
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,833
You're okay.
You're okay.

209
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,045
Did I die?

210
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,170
Yeah.

211
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,673
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

212
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:44,592
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,095
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

214
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,606
You're not goin' anywhere.

215
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,191
79 over 55.

216
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,403
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

217
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,113
with a real doctor.

218
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:07,281
I don't need a doctor.

219
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,325
I trust you.

220
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,494
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

221
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:14,622
Slightly above that of a dead fish.

222
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,916
Ah!

223
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,795
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

224
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,006
Jump back in the water anytime.

225
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,346
You're not goin' anywhere.

226
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:33,056
79 over 55.

227
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:36,101
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

228
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:38,019
with a real doctor.

229
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,772
Seriously, Ben,
dial it back.

230
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:41,941
I'm fine.

231
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,861
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to get your oxygen levels.

232
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,071
Again?

233
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:48,655
What are you talking about?

234
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:50,158
My O2 is 89.

235
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,286
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

236
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:56,664
Oh, you're right.

237
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,585
Are you okay?

238
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,961
What the hell
happened down there?

239
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,046
I'm fine.

240
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,674
I just wanna go home
and watch <i>Idol.</i>

241
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,509
Please stay where you are.

242
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,638
Wow.

243
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:38,515
Great apartment.

244
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,878
<i>Where's my spider?
They took my spider.</i>

245
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,890
<i>Who are you?</i>

246
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:51,213
No!

247
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,434
Bad dream?

248
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,645
It's not a dream.

249
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,648
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

250
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,817
Oh, wow,
that's a buzzkill.

251
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,365
The same three faces.

252
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,327
Every night, the same vision.

253
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:23,954
It's a curse.

254
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,997
But we all die someday.

255
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:28,166
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

256
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,544
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

257
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:33,547
you'd try to stop them.

258
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,258
Okay...

259
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,595
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

260
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:43,473
of dying over and over again.

261
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:44,892
And I can't escape it.

262
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,979
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

263
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:54,402
I will find them
and kill them first.

264
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,612
So you know who did it...

265
00:20:57,613 --> 00:21:01,074
I mean, will do it?

266
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:05,287
It's always those three faces.

267
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,583
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

268
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,087
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

269
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,840
Huh.

270
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,509
But as the years pass...

271
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,512
there have been
technological advances.

272
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,599
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

273
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:29,811
The kind of technology
I've heard...

274
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,731
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

275
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:50,332
What are you doing?

276
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:53,960
How are you poisoning me?

277
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:55,463
What's your password?

278
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,257
I can't tell you.
Oh, please!

279
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,469
Is "please" your password?

280
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:05,889
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

281
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,349
and I'll stop the poison.

282
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:21,447
Q-9-2-0...

283
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:25,284
B-3-7-5.

284
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:31,582
Oh, God.

285
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:39,005
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

286
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:41,383
today was the day
you were going to die.

287
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:56,231
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

288
00:22:56,232 --> 00:22:58,108
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

289
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,192
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

290
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:00,276
You know what you're doing.

291
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:01,820
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

292
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:02,904
Cassie!

293
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:05,031
- Hey!
- Hi.

294
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:06,908
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

295
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:08,701
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

296
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:11,246
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

297
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,040
Are you pressing the burgers?

298
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,416
I'm releasin' the fat.

299
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,751
That's called flavor, man.

300
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,419
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

301
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,820
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

302
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:22,632
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

303
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,759
I could use a beer?

304
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,761
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

305
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:30,181
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

306
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:32,433
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

307
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:33,560
That's boring.

308
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,395
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

309
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,479
No, there's...

310
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,356
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

311
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:39,440
It was cardiac arrest.

312
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:42,153
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

313
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,071
Really?

314
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,073
Dead, huh?

315
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,741
Did you see a white light or...

316
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:53,746
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

317
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,040
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

318
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,793
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

320
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:00,128
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

321
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,462
Yeah, they're ruined now.

322
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:02,882
Take that.
For you, sir.

323
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,675
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:07,677
- We're ready to start.
- What?

325
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,012
What?

326
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:11,222
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

327
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:13,308
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

328
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,059
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

329
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,145
Have fun.

330
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,899
- ...for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

331
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,109
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

332
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,527
Okay.
This is crazy.

333
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:25,820
Well, I couldn't decide, so I got two.

334
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,072
Yeah, that's like...

335
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,283
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,117
Cassie Webb.

337
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:32,827
Um, thanks for having me.

338
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:36,122
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

339
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,749
Nice to meet you.

340
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,418
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

341
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,045
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

342
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:44,131
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

343
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,132
Where is it this time?

344
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:47,717
He's in Mumbai...

345
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,929
Shanghai...
I can't keep track.

346
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:55,558
Never stops
leaping around in there.

347
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,644
And always hungry.

348
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:59,897
Does it have a name?
The...

349
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,086
We're saving that
for one of the games.

350
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,736
- Games?
- Games!

351
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:11,659
Games!

352
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,828
Okay.

353
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:19,458
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

354
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:22,669
Chloe, is that you?

355
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,672
Yes.

356
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:28,591
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

357
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,385
It was years
before I figured that one out.

358
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,391
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

359
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,893
Whose is this?

360
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:41,562
Oh, it's mine.

361
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:44,649
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

362
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,611
Um, well, my mother actually
died, uh, in childbirth.

363
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,782
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

364
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:55,618
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

365
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,288
She died.

366
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:01,792
Uh, but, um,
I grew up totally healthy.

367
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,712
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

368
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:09,299
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

369
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,426
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

370
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:14,429
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

371
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,431
Okay, so let's, um...

372
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:17,682
let's move on to the next game.

373
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:21,936
Uh, guess the name
of Mary's baby.

374
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:23,438
Oh, yes!

375
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:25,982
Okay, I'll kick things off.

376
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,609
- Sam.
- Nope.

377
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,902
Steven.

378
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,904
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

379
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:33,614
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

380
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:39,079
Baby sausage?

381
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,080
Richard Junior?

382
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:42,457
Richard wishes.

383
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,251
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

384
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:47,254
Cassie... what's your guess?

385
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:51,091
Um... Mmm.

386
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:53,260
Um...

387
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:54,844
Do that thing
where you throw it up

388
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,928
and catch it on the...

389
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:58,556
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

390
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,880
- Look at that.
- The name is...

391
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:07,358
Baby sausage?

392
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,985
Richard Junior?

393
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,279
Richard wishes.

394
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:15,656
Come on, get your hamburger.
Get your...

395
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,283
Cassie... what's your guess?

396
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:18,618
Put five dollars down, let's go.

397
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,370
Wait.
We just did this.

398
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,080
Do that thing where you throw it up

399
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:23,165
and catch it on the...

400
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,961
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

401
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,964
Uh, sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

402
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,549
Fire down at the docks.

403
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,635
So...

404
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,513
You okay?

405
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:42,558
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

406
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,686
I got you, man.

407
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:46,521
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

408
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,231
The ones
who got out, come on. This way.

409
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:49,357
Get her out.
Come on.

410
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:50,858
Grabbin' a woman
on A-side here.

411
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:53,653
Go. Go. Go.

412
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:54,946
We need
more pressure in the line.

413
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:56,947
Keep pressure
on the leg here, okay?

414
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,659
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

415
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,744
Otherwise stable.

416
00:28:02,746 --> 00:28:04,873
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

417
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:10,545
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

418
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:11,755
Let's go.
Come on.

419
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:18,553
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

420
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:19,637
No, it's not safe.

421
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:20,597
The structure's unstable.

422
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:21,557
Hey, the people are trapped.

423
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:23,474
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

424
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:25,810
The place is packed with explosives.

425
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:28,104
Industrial grade fireworks.

426
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,785
It could blow up any minute.

427
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:34,695
It could blow up any minute.

428
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,239
<i>- Cassie!</i>
- It could blow up any minute.

429
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:39,241
<i>Cassie!</i>

430
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,789
This place has
always been a death trap.

431
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,624
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

432
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,709
Otherwise stable.

433
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,879
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.</i>

434
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:55,673
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

435
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:56,757
Let's go.
Come on.

436
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,181
I gotta get my guys in there.

437
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:04,348
The structure's unstable.

438
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:05,558
Hey, the people are trapped.

439
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,768
The place is
packed with explosives.

440
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,187
Industrial grade fireworks.

441
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:10,605
This place has
always been a death trap.

442
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:12,982
Cassie!
Cassie.

443
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,734
I need you at the triage.

444
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:16,360
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

445
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:18,279
Sir, you're okay.
You're okay.

446
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,072
He's stable.
Ready to transport.

447
00:29:20,073 --> 00:29:21,073
Yeah, copy that.

448
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:21,992
We need every
able body down here.

449
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,075
You're gonna be okay.

450
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:24,785
Stabilize the head while
I get the longboard set up.

451
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:26,871
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

452
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:28,122
Copy that.

453
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,373
Hey, what is it?
I gotta roll.

454
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:31,000
Will you let me drive?

455
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,168
What are you talking about?

456
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,129
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

457
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,465
Cassie, I need you over here.

458
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,091
Will you just let me drive?

459
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:41,261
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

460
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:43,993
I don't think
that's what's happening.

461
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,809
Don't let it
mess with your head.

462
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,936
Cassie, come on!

463
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:01,113
<i>This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.</i>

464
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:02,199
<i>Headed back...</i>

465
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:28,349
O'Neil, come on.

466
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:33,939
Come on.
O'Neil.

467
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,440
Come on!

468
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,705
Let's get it!
Come on, let's go!

469
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:40,779
Wake up!

470
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,155
O'Neil, come on.

471
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,949
<i>Did you see a white light or...</i>

472
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,326
<i>O'Neil, come on.</i>

473
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:48,954
<i>Cassie! Cassie!</i>

474
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,165
Come on. Come back.

475
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,669
Come on, come on.

476
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,671
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

477
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,799
It's all right.
It's okay.

478
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:03,676
It's okay.
Okay?

479
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:06,095
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

480
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,718
So, was it worth the trouble?

481
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,261
The scale of the NSA surveillance

482
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:48,721
is unprecedented.

483
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:50,515
They can access everything.

484
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,309
There's nowhere to hide.

485
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,644
That's the idea.

486
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,897
The potential is infinite.

487
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,107
It's intoxicating.

488
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:02,527
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

489
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:05,154
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

490
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,948
It's gonna change everything.

491
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:11,077
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

492
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,162
before they get their powers.

493
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,039
This is what
they look like in your visions

494
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,458
as well as you can recollect.

495
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:19,960
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

496
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:22,254
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

497
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:25,634
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

498
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,637
Here's what
they should look like now.

499
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:35,143
They're younger than I thought.

500
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,688
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

501
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:41,524
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

502
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:44,276
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

503
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:46,696
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

504
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:49,365
I will not give up
everything I've built...

505
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:51,076
and have my life cut short.

506
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:55,913
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

507
00:32:55,914 --> 00:32:57,373
go to a museum...

508
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,000
get money from an ATM...

509
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,086
wherever they are
in the world...

510
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:03,380
Find them.

511
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:05,590
I pay you a fortune.

512
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:07,300
Yeah, I'll find them.

513
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,138
Still no blurriness.

514
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:13,806
No double vision.

515
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,016
No discoloration at all.

516
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,310
Your eyesight is good,

517
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:20,147
and all your other vitals
check out.

518
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:23,817
Um, but what about the visions?

519
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:26,819
How am I seeing that stuff?

520
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,488
Um, sometimes when
we experience trauma,

521
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:31,031
it can have a lasting effect.

522
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,950
This isn't trauma.

523
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,745
I knew he was gonna die.

524
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:37,204
I saw it.

525
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:38,998
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

526
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,542
from your other consultations.

527
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:44,420
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

528
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,963
The scan showed no abnormalities.

529
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,798
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

530
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,759
but I don't understand
what's happening.

531
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,011
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

532
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:53,471
Get some rest.

533
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:54,639
Watch old movies.

534
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:56,348
If you still have concerns,

535
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:58,560
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

536
00:33:58,935 --> 00:33:59,935
But I'm sure

537
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:02,016
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

538
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,109
<i>I am in the presence</i>

539
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,862
<i>of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.</i>

540
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,573
<i>And you're going to show me
shadows of things</i>

541
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:14,868
<i>that have not yet happened
but will happen.</i>

542
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,787
<i>Spirit of the Future,</i>

543
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:19,997
<i>I fear you more than
any other specter I've seen.</i>

544
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:24,044
<i>But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.</i>

545
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:25,503
<i>I cannot change.</i>

546
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:27,297
<i>Whose funeral
were they talking about?</i>

547
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,387
<i>Hey, Cass, it's me again.
Uh, Ben.</i>

548
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,765
<i>I know you're there.
Just pick up.</i>

549
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,516
<i>I ought to be there
this time of day.</i>

550
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:40,392
<i>Okay, well, uh,</i>

551
00:34:40,393 --> 00:34:43,103
<i>O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.</i>

552
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,396
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

553
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:47,608
<i>I know it's the last place
you wanna be...</i>

554
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:50,736
<i>but it would help Susan
if you came.</i>

555
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,696
<i>It might help you too.</i>

556
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:54,698
<i>Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

557
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:56,910
<i>Cassie?</i>

558
00:34:58,203 --> 00:34:59,204
<i>Cass?</i>

559
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:07,795
<i>Before I draw
nearer to that stone,</i>

560
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:09,130
<i>answer me one question.</i>

561
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:12,008
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be...</i>

562
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,637
<i>or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

563
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:17,429
Hate to break it to you, Scrooge...

564
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:21,017
...but you can't change anything.

565
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:26,355
Ah!

566
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:59,890
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be?</i>

567
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,184
<i>Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

568
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:12,903
This isn't gonna
change anything.

569
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:37,510
Guess you didn't die after all.

570
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:06,289
<i>Please keep</i>

571
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,748
<i>all personal belongings with you</i>

<i>throughout your trip.</i>

573
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,255
Come on, guys.
This way.

574
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:16,006
Come on.
Let's go down the ramp.

575
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:17,592
Yeah, awesome.

576
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:35,402
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

577
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:39,071
<i>...New Haven now ready.
Track 25. All aboard.</i>

Anya Corazón is now moving
onto the platform.

581
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:46,871
She's on her own.

582
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:51,960
Julia Cornwall is
on the concourse, also alone.

Shit.

586
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:01,885
Um, what are the odds of them

587
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,512
all being in the same place
at the same time?

588
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:04,973
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

589
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,766
<i>There must be something
that connects them.</i>

590
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,977
Or...

591
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:11,645
something that will.

592
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,147

00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:22,407

- Get up!
- Me?

- That man is trying to kill you.
- And how do you...

- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

653

We don't have
tickets for this train.

Hey, help.
Over here.

673
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:03,455
I've never been so happy to see cops.

674
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:04,664
You guys
need to call for backup.

675
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:06,750
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

676
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:07,834
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

677
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:08,919
No. You don't understand.

678
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,587
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

679
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:11,838
You're safe.

680
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:14,342
Run! Go!

681
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:15,842
Run!

682
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:22,349
Run!
Run!

683
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,768
Go! Go! Go!

684
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,460
Come on.

685
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:54,589
- Get in.
- What?

686
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,674
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:56,758
Thank you so much.
This is for you.

- Move. Slide over.

689
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,679
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

690
00:45:00,888 --> 00:45:02,514
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

691
00:45:02,515 --> 00:45:03,515
That guy was nuts.

692
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:04,808
Do you guys think
he killed those cops?

693
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,601
Uh, he could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

694
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:08,437
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

695
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:09,771
There's not enough
frictional force

696
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:11,273
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

697
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:12,357
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

698
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:13,317
What the hell is going on?

699
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:14,401
...much less the ceiling.

700
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:15,861
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

701
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:16,945
so what good is it?

702
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:19,114
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

703
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:20,740
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

704
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:22,742
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

705
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:23,869
Your voices are, like,

706
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,579
drilling in the center
of my skull...

707
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,664
and I need to think.

708
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:35,213
I'm Cassie.
Okay?

709
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,340
What are your names?

710
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,258
What are your names?

711
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:39,385
I'm Julia Cornwall.

712
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:41,887
My dad lives here in New York,

713
00:45:41,888 --> 00:45:43,221
and my mom lives
back in L.A., but...

714
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:44,849
We don't need
your whole life story.

715
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:48,936
I'm Anya Corazón.

716
00:45:49,604 --> 00:45:50,605
Mattie Franklin.

717
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:52,939
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

718
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,024
I'm not... That's not...

719
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:55,567
That's not
what's happening here.

720
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:58,362
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

721
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,405
Your parents can handle this.

722
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:02,157
My parents
are on a business trip.

723
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:03,950
Uh, yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

724
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:05,327
Um, my dad
is busy working, so...

725
00:46:05,328 --> 00:46:06,287
Oh, my God.

726
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:07,537
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

727
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:08,622
Well, where do your friends live?

728
00:46:08,623 --> 00:46:09,582
I'll drop you off first.

729
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:10,500
<i>...are asking</i>

730
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,250
<i>for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest</i>

731
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:15,378
<i>seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...</i>

732
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:16,963
<i>at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.</i>

733
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:18,965
That's great.
Good.

734
00:46:18,966 --> 00:46:22,677
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

735
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:24,804
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

736
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:26,181
<i>She is also
the same person</i>

737
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:27,307
<i>police are seeking to question...</i>

738
00:46:27,308 --> 00:46:28,391
<i>in the possible abduction...</i>

739
00:46:28,392 --> 00:46:29,310
She?

740
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:30,477
<i>...of the three teenage girls.</i>

741
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:33,313
<i>Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.</i>

742
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:34,773
<i>The public has been asked
for any information...</i>

743
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:35,857
What?

744
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:37,067
<i>...and to keep
an eye out for these girls.</i>

745
00:46:37,068 --> 00:46:39,986
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

746
00:46:39,987 --> 00:46:41,112
And he was crawling on the ceiling.

747
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:42,197
What about that guy?

748
00:46:42,198 --> 00:46:43,782
I mean, you saw.
I...

749
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:44,991
No one saw ceiling guy.

750
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,535
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

751
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:48,036
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

752
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:49,579
I didn't know
what was happening.

753
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,790
Okay, guys.

754
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:53,208
My uncle, Jonah, can totally help us.
I'm gonna call him.

755
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:54,709
You have a phone?

756
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,503
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

757
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:58,046
No, you can't...

758
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,507
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

759
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:01,800
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

760
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,051
What is your problem?

761
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,135
- What do you mean?
- Please.

762
00:47:04,136 --> 00:47:05,720
I'm just trying to help.

763
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:08,306
Okay. Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

764
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:09,808
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

765
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:11,310
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

766
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:14,145
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

767
00:47:14,146 --> 00:47:16,189
because you guys
are the only ones

768
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,733
that know
what actually happened.

769
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:23,655
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

770
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:26,117
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

771
00:47:27,326 --> 00:47:28,327
And, um...

772
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:30,848
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

773
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:35,543
You know...

774
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:39,296
This is still not a kidnapping.

775
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:40,840
Okay?

776
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:43,509
Feels like a kidnapping.

777
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:47,679
How did they get away?

778
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,889
It's like they knew I was coming.

779
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,475
<i>No hits at the train station,
bus depot,</i>

780
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:53,686
<i>or any of the bridges.</i>

781
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,146
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

782
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:58,398
<i>The police don't have
this technology.</i>

783
00:47:58,399 --> 00:48:01,610
<i>You have access
to every camera in the city.</i>

784
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:02,694
<i>We should be ahead of them.</i>

785
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:06,323
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

786
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:08,284
Use them better.

787
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,785
I've always wanted to be a Girl Scout.

788
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:11,871
Of course you did.

789
00:48:13,122 --> 00:48:14,706
Anybody else starving?

790
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:16,292
All I have is gum.

791
00:48:17,585 --> 00:48:20,504
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

792
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:22,881
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

793
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:24,132
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

794
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:27,094
Okay, I hope you're good at, um,
catching squirrels.

795
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,597
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

796
00:48:30,598 --> 00:48:32,682
I told you, I don't know.

797
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:34,059
I've never seen him before.

798
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,143
Then how did you know
he was coming?

799
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:36,227
Oh, my God.

800
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:39,022
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

801
00:48:39,023 --> 00:48:41,316
I don't know.

802
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:43,943
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

803
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:45,988
Stop asking me.
Okay?

804
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,074
Wait.
You're the paramedic.

805
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:50,867
You saved my stepmother,

806
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:52,870
then you were
super awkward about it.

807
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:57,540
That does sound like me.

808
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,751
Wait.
I recognize you too.

809
00:48:59,752 --> 00:49:01,044
What?

810
00:49:01,045 --> 00:49:03,214
Yeah.
You live in my building.

811
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:05,965
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

812
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:08,009
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

813
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,638
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

814
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:12,431
You don't think this is weird?

815
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:14,683
That we both know you?

816
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,767
It's honestly, like,

817
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,978
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

818
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:22,608
What?

819
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,112
Total stranger.

820
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:28,739
No.

821
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:30,991
You flipped me off.

822
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:33,159
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

823
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,954
You guys, this is so freaky.

824
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:37,206
Who are you?
What is going on?

825
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:41,669
I can see the future.

826
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:44,130
Kind of.

827
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,136
I mean...

828
00:49:51,137 --> 00:49:52,638
Oh!

829
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:53,805
What the hell?

830
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,891
See?
She didn't see that coming.

831
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:57,976
It doesn't work like that.

832
00:49:57,977 --> 00:50:00,228
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

833
00:50:00,229 --> 00:50:02,397
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

834
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:04,400
did you see us...

835
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,943
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

836
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:10,113
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

837
00:50:10,114 --> 00:50:12,700
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

838
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:15,035
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

839
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:18,497
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

840
00:50:19,123 --> 00:50:21,250
So, you're welcome.

841
00:50:23,502 --> 00:50:24,628
How does it work?

842
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:28,548
It just happens.

843
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:30,509
Can you do it now?

844
00:50:31,802 --> 00:50:33,219
I can't control it.

845
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,264
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

846
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:37,808
Uh, no, he can't.

847
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:40,728
He was using his hands.

848
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:42,645
Why are you like this?

849
00:50:42,646 --> 00:50:45,064
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

850
00:50:45,065 --> 00:50:47,026
It was like a spider...

851
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:49,652
person.

852
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:01,457
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

853
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,751
Where are you going?

854
00:51:04,752 --> 00:51:07,754
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

855
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:10,548
You can't just leave us here.

856
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:12,801
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

857
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:14,761
Oh, yeah, sure. Just three
teenagers alone in the woods.

858
00:51:14,762 --> 00:51:16,930
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

859
00:51:16,931 --> 00:51:19,141
You are way safer out here.

860
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:23,853
Just, you know,
be, um, like a Girl Scout girl.

861
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:25,897
Be that.
Just be that.

862
00:51:25,898 --> 00:51:28,066
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

863
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:29,151
Cassie.

864
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:33,239
Can we trust you?

865
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:36,616
Three hours.
Okay?

866
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,870
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

867
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,503
Seriously.
Don't do dumb things.

868
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:52,131
She was talking to you.

869
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:54,300
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

870
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,726
I know tae kwon do.

871
00:52:03,394 --> 00:52:04,395
You?

872
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:07,564
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

873
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:08,940
when my parents were divorcing.

874
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:12,319
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

875
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,363
- Ha!
- Uh...

876
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:18,951
That's what I thought.

877
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:33,776
One second, cat.

878
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:38,280
Come on.

879
00:53:42,326 --> 00:53:44,787
Research on Amazonian spiders...

880
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:48,748
peptides, more peptides.

881
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:50,209
Come on.
Where is it?

882
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:54,004
Ah, spider people.

883
00:53:54,713 --> 00:53:56,215
<i>Las Arañas.</i>

884
00:53:57,883 --> 00:53:59,592
Have you ever heard
of <i>Las Arañas?</i>

885
00:54:01,303 --> 00:54:02,304
Me neither.

886
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:07,184
"According to local folklore...

887
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:12,022
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

888
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:16,944
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

889
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,239
"and they can
climb like spiders."

890
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:23,909
Just like ceiling guy.

891
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:31,874
How would you know...

892
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:35,838
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

893
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:55,190
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

894
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:07,327
<i>"Las Arañas</i> are said to possess
a sixth sense...

895
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,539
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

896
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:25,721
Oh, my God.

897
00:55:44,531 --> 00:55:45,865
Hey, who's got the jerky?

898
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:46,950
You ate it all.

899
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:49,285
I had, like, three pieces.

900
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:51,496
- Out of five.
- You counted?

901
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:53,540
You also ate all mine.

902
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:57,585
- What's this?
- Stop.

903
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,837
Stop.
Just...

904
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:00,964
Jeez.

905
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:04,634
Okay, forget jerky.

906
00:56:04,635 --> 00:56:08,012
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

907
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:09,472
Let's just go there
and get real food.

908
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:11,974
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

909
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:13,184
She bailed on us.

910
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:15,394
We don't have any money, genius.

911
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:17,231
Well, I have money, so...

912
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,700
You have money
so we should do what you want?

913
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:21,276
You got something to say?

914
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:24,779
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

915
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,447
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

916
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:28,741
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

917
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:30,744
So sad about Martha Stewart.

918
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:35,540
My parents are in Beijing...

919
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:36,874
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

920
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,876
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

921
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:41,087
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

922
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:42,547
So...

923
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:43,923
I talk to them on Mondays.

924
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:45,134
So who do you live with?

925
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:47,219
The housekeeper.

926
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:51,056
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

927
00:56:52,141 --> 00:56:53,642
I bet you have
your own room at least.

928
00:56:54,434 --> 00:56:57,436
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

929
00:56:57,437 --> 00:56:59,773
- What about your mom?
- Uh, she's...

930
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:02,525
not really around.

931
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:03,902
She bailed on you?

932
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:07,072
Right.
So, diner?

933
00:57:08,448 --> 00:57:10,199
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

934
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,284
Yay.

935
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:13,453
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

936
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,457
Julia, you in?

937
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:20,418
Hey.

938
00:57:20,419 --> 00:57:22,087
We have
to take care of ourselves.

939
00:57:29,595 --> 00:57:30,596
Yeah.

940
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:33,932
You're right.

941
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:36,768
Let's go do this.

942
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,438
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

943
00:57:40,439 --> 00:57:41,690
I heard that.

944
00:57:43,483 --> 00:57:45,818
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

945
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:47,613
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

946
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:50,031
Who says we like you now?

947
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,951
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

948
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:58,706
Shit.

949
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:00,125
Do you think there's ticks?

950
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:03,002
Can we walk

951
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:04,712
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

952
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:06,631
You said this was a shortcut.

953
00:58:06,632 --> 00:58:08,841
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

954
00:58:08,842 --> 00:58:10,134
You know
where you're going?

955
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:11,220
Yeah. Actually, I do.

956
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:15,307
Ow! Shit!

957
00:58:19,311 --> 00:58:21,563
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

958
00:58:22,147 --> 00:58:23,147
We're in the middle of nowhere.

959
00:58:23,148 --> 00:58:24,565
No one's gonna
track us down here.

960
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,359
Just don't make eye contact.

961
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,612
I hope they have cherry pie.

962
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:40,874
Let's sit at the bar.

963
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:48,966
There you go.

964
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:51,468
Here.

965
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,136
Should we make a game plan?

966
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:56,348
Eat first, strategize later.

967
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:01,144
Okay.
Here you go.

968
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:05,065
Mmm.
Keep it coming.

969
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,901
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

970
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:10,444
Absolutely, great idea.

971
00:59:10,445 --> 00:59:11,530
Uh, right after cherry pie.

972
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:15,117
No. No cherry pie.

973
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:19,788
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

974
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:23,541
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

975
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:26,335
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

976
00:59:26,336 --> 00:59:28,212
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

977
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:30,253
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

978
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:37,389
We should go over there
and talk to them.

979
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:39,057
Really?

980
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:41,934
No. Uh, we...

981
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:43,519
Should we?
We can't.

982
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,396
Come on.
You know you want to.

983
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:46,480
No.

984
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:49,150
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

985
00:59:49,151 --> 00:59:50,443
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

986
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:51,819
Just hold on a second.

987
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,945
What is this?

988
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:54,226
Do you want the Reuben?

989
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:57,491
It's just
a little confidence boost.

990
00:59:57,492 --> 00:59:59,202
This isn't really my style.

991
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:02,455
So what?
You look cute. Come on.

992
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:04,958
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

993
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:06,667
Okay.

994
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:08,169
Hi. Hey, guys.

995
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,962
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

996
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:11,339
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

997
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,840
We've been saving these seats for you.

998
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,051
Awesome.

999
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:16,427
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

1000
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:17,511
Nice to meet you too.

1001
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:18,596
<i>...for your information.</i>

1002
01:00:18,597 --> 01:00:20,389
<i>Can you just confirm your location?</i>

1003
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,850
<i>4 Star Diner.
Daves Road, Route 206.</i>

1004
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:23,769
Hey.

1005
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:24,728
<i>Church Hill, New Jersey.</i>

1006
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:26,187
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

1007
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,428
<i>Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.</i>

1008
01:00:28,774 --> 01:00:30,192
Yeah.
Patching you in now.

1009
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:42,870

01:00:44,498 --> 01:00:45,873
<i>Go ahead, 2-2-3.</i>

1012
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:47,376
No need to send backup.

1013
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:51,504
These aren't
our missing persons.

1014
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:54,800
Code four.
Repeat.

1015
01:00:55,384 --> 01:00:57,260
These are not our missing persons.

1016
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:08,814
Girls!

1017
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:19,408
Girls!

1018
01:01:24,037 --> 01:01:25,288
Oh, God damn it.

1019
01:01:43,306 --> 01:01:44,307
Girls!

1020
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:54,651
Let's go. Let's go!

1021
01:01:55,152 --> 01:01:56,861
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1022
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:57,945
I know you know the words.

1023
01:01:57,946 --> 01:01:58,946
Come on, get up here.

1024
01:01:58,947 --> 01:01:59,947
You should get up there.

1025
01:01:59,948 --> 01:02:01,867
So much
for not attracting attention.

1026
01:02:11,835 --> 01:02:13,669
No. Please. Please, stop.

1027
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,254
Don't touch me, okay?

1028
01:02:15,255 --> 01:02:16,589
Can you...

1029
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,757
What are you doing?

1030
01:02:18,758 --> 01:02:19,967
- What are you...
- What is that?

1031
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:21,386
We have to go.

1032
01:02:25,056 --> 01:02:26,183
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:30,020
Get down!

1034
01:02:31,396 --> 01:02:32,980
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

1035
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:34,107
You left us.

1036
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:36,776
I'm so sorry.

1037
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:40,779
Julia!

1038
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,240
Julia!

1039
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,471
Julia, get back!

1040
01:02:55,253 --> 01:02:56,253
Come on!

1041
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:57,463
No! Mattie!

1042
01:02:58,507 --> 01:02:59,591
No.

1043
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,472
<i>This track is going to be huge.</i>

1044
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:50,767
<i>Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.</i>

1045
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,647
Let's try that again.

1046
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:08,868
I love this song.

1047
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:13,373
Guys.

1048
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:16,167
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

1049
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:22,674
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

1050
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:25,176
Right.
Okay.

1051
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:35,270
Oh, my God.
Come on.

1052
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,609
Seriously, dude.

1053
01:04:51,828 --> 01:04:52,911
Come on.
Let's go.

1054
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:54,830
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1055
01:04:54,831 --> 01:04:55,956
I know you know the words.

1056
01:04:55,957 --> 01:04:57,834
Come on, get up here.

1057
01:04:58,418 --> 01:05:00,210
Hey!

1058
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:01,651
You should totally
get up there, dog.

1059
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:03,340
Come on.

1060
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:14,434
Hey!

1061
01:05:18,563 --> 01:05:20,482
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

1062
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,908
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

1063
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:32,452
Leave everything. Run!

1064
01:05:33,244 --> 01:05:34,953
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

1065
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:36,664
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

1066
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:37,832
Ah!

1067
01:05:55,308 --> 01:05:56,393
God!

1068
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:00,979
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

1069
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,315
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

1070
01:06:03,316 --> 01:06:05,442
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

1071
01:06:05,443 --> 01:06:06,527
and you don't listen!

1072
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:07,903
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

1073
01:06:07,904 --> 01:06:09,072
Don't even say anything!

1074
01:06:09,906 --> 01:06:10,907
God!

1075
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:13,201
Your futures were almost...

1076
01:06:13,993 --> 01:06:15,120
so different.

1077
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:18,706
You're lucky I saw them.

1078
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:19,915
I'm so sorry.

1079
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,000
Yes.

1080
01:06:21,918 --> 01:06:25,088
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

1081
01:06:27,424 --> 01:06:28,425
God!

1082
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:53,866
Amaria, where did they go?

1083
01:06:53,867 --> 01:06:55,744
<i>I'm running checks now.</i>

1084
01:06:56,953 --> 01:06:58,746
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

1085
01:06:58,747 --> 01:07:00,547
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

1086
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,333
I'm not interested in her.

1087
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,668
Focus on finding those girls.

1088
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:06,129
Cassandra Webb.

1089
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:08,923
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

1090
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:10,675
Did you say, "Webb"?

1091
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:13,469
Uh, yeah.
Do you know her?

1092
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:14,971
That's not possible.

1093
01:07:17,557 --> 01:07:18,558
Come on.

1094
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:25,315
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

1095
01:07:26,483 --> 01:07:29,277
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

1096
01:07:31,154 --> 01:07:33,072
But you can see the future.

1097
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,492
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

1098
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:38,411
I don't know
how to control them.

1099
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,496
It's useless.

1100
01:07:40,497 --> 01:07:42,373
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

1101
01:07:42,832 --> 01:07:43,833
Is your hand okay?

1102
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:46,586
It's fine.

1103
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:52,550
First thing in the morning,

1104
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:53,676
I'm taking you all home.

1105
01:07:54,093 --> 01:07:55,512
Your parents can deal with this.

1106
01:07:56,888 --> 01:07:58,013
No, they can't.

1107
01:07:58,014 --> 01:07:59,057
Ugh.

1108
01:08:02,018 --> 01:08:03,311
My mom's in a psych ward.

1109
01:08:05,688 --> 01:08:07,439
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

1110
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,234
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

1111
01:08:10,235 --> 01:08:12,028
and I don't think
that they want me there.

1112
01:08:15,532 --> 01:08:17,242
I wondered if they missed me...

1113
01:08:18,952 --> 01:08:20,161
if I ran away.

1114
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:22,914
Hmm, so you did.

1115
01:08:23,623 --> 01:08:25,183
My parents aren't around either.

1116
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:28,253
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

1117
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:29,837
I don't think they're gonna

1118
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:31,255
fly back from China
to deal with this.

1119
01:08:31,256 --> 01:08:33,341
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

1120
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,051
I'm on my own.

1121
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:39,931
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

1122
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:42,934
- go to the police.
- No.

1123
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,148
My dad got deported
six months ago.

1124
01:08:50,275 --> 01:08:52,443
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

1125
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:53,986
What about your mom?

1126
01:08:53,987 --> 01:08:55,864
My mom died when I was five.

1127
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:57,532
It's just me and my dad.

1128
01:08:58,658 --> 01:09:00,409
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

1129
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,411
So, I've just been
living by myself

1130
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:03,662
at our apartment since then.

1131
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:04,747
You're on your own?

1132
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:08,459
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

1133
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:11,907
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

1134
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,217
So, I can't go to the police.

1135
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:18,303
Okay?

1136
01:09:18,803 --> 01:09:21,180
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

1137
01:09:22,682 --> 01:09:24,808
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

1138
01:09:24,809 --> 01:09:27,228
Or going into the foster system.

1139
01:09:30,023 --> 01:09:31,107
Well...

1140
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,986
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

1141
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:40,491
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

1142
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:42,035
Right.

1143
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:46,831
Cassie, please help us.

1144
01:12:08,347 --> 01:12:11,600
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

1145
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:13,561
You won't be so lucky next time.

1146
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,897
Why are you doing this?

1147
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:18,691
I need to stop them
from killing me.

1148
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,320
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

1149
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:24,571
In the future,
they become much more.

1150
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:28,868
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

1151
01:12:30,536 --> 01:12:32,080
Those girls cannot exist.

1152
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:34,582
How come you get to decide?

1153
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,043
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

1154
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,467
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

1155
01:12:46,344 --> 01:12:47,511
Would I?

1156
01:12:47,512 --> 01:12:50,806
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

1157
01:12:50,807 --> 01:12:52,557
The only thing I know is that,

1158
01:12:52,558 --> 01:12:54,852
in the future,
they also have powers.

1159
01:12:56,896 --> 01:13:00,232
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

1160
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:02,567
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

1161
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:05,488
Your mother underestimated me.

1162
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:08,699
The power of the spider.

1163
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,577
Don't make the same mistake.

1164
01:13:12,078 --> 01:13:13,162
Tell me where they are!

1165
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:15,151
They don't mean anything to you.

1166
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:18,167
You could just walk away.

1167
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,641
What is this?

1168
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:21,230
Rise and shine.

1169
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:24,274
Okay, so this guy's hands

1170
01:14:24,275 --> 01:14:26,943
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

1171
01:14:26,944 --> 01:14:29,571
and it is painful.
I was lucky.

1172
01:14:29,572 --> 01:14:31,198
The longer he holds on to you,

1173
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,366
the more poison
gets into your system.

1174
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:34,452
Then what happens?

1175
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,205
Then your heart stops.

1176
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:41,834
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

1177
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,546
So you interlock your hands
like this.

1178
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:47,590
You lock your elbows...

1179
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:50,258
and then you place
the heel of your hand

1180
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:52,594
right on the sternum.
Okay?

1181
01:14:52,595 --> 01:14:53,678
And then you pump.

1182
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,015
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

1183
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:59,227
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

1184
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:00,936
You ready?

1185
01:15:00,937 --> 01:15:03,147
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

1186
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:06,524
Okay.
And when do I stop?

1187
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:08,361
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

1188
01:15:08,986 --> 01:15:10,654
- Oh!
- And if you get tired,

1189
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:12,365
then you need
somebody to take over.

1190
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,449
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

1191
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,618
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mm-hmm.

1192
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:19,579
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1193
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,664
- Yeah.
- Ready?

1194
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:21,999
- Yep.
- And go.

1195
01:15:25,336 --> 01:15:27,420
Great.
Nice, Mattie.

1196
01:15:27,421 --> 01:15:28,506
Not cool.

1197
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:33,094
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

1198
01:15:34,303 --> 01:15:35,304
Get ready.

1199
01:15:37,431 --> 01:15:40,558
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

1200
01:15:40,559 --> 01:15:41,936
Nice job, Anya.

1201
01:15:44,438 --> 01:15:46,649
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

1202
01:15:47,566 --> 01:15:48,734
but you're a good teacher.

1203
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:54,865
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

1204
01:15:57,076 --> 01:15:58,369
About my mom.

1205
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,460
Wait, so you do know this guy.

1206
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:08,670
My mom did.
I think.

1207
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:10,005
That's her.

1208
01:16:10,006 --> 01:16:11,382
She's really pretty.

1209
01:16:15,678 --> 01:16:17,513
So this is because of you?

1210
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:22,810
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

1211
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,645
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

1212
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:30,483
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

1213
01:16:30,484 --> 01:16:32,278
What kind of crazy stuff?

1214
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:35,656
Climb like spiders.

1215
01:16:37,283 --> 01:16:39,994
So is he one of them?

1216
01:16:40,786 --> 01:16:42,413
I need more information.

1217
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,209
You're leaving.

1218
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:53,424
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

1219
01:16:53,924 --> 01:16:54,925
How?

1220
01:16:57,928 --> 01:16:59,305
You have to go to Peru.

1221
01:17:02,767 --> 01:17:03,767
I'll be gone a week.

1222
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:04,851
I don't wanna leave them,

1223
01:17:04,852 --> 01:17:06,269
but he's out there
looking for them...

1224
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:07,354
and they're relying on me,

1225
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:08,730
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

1226
01:17:08,731 --> 01:17:11,107
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

1227
01:17:11,108 --> 01:17:12,317
while Richard's out of town.

1228
01:17:12,318 --> 01:17:14,528
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

1229
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:18,448
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

1230
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:20,909
Just be careful, okay?

1231
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,243
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1232
01:17:22,244 --> 01:17:24,329
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

1233
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:26,248
Okay, well, neither did you.

1234
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:55,856
You have come back
looking for answers.

1235
01:19:59,902 --> 01:20:00,902
Back?

1236
01:20:00,903 --> 01:20:03,072
I promised your mother
I would be here.

1237
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:09,035
My mom thought
<i>Las Arañas</i> were a myth.

1238
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:10,328
What do you think?

1239
01:20:10,329 --> 01:20:13,039
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

1240
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,541
She came here

1241
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:17,418
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

1242
01:20:17,419 --> 01:20:19,546
She thought she was being protected.

1243
01:20:19,547 --> 01:20:20,838
By Ezekiel Sims?

1244
01:20:20,839 --> 01:20:22,840
His motives were selfish.

1245
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:24,717
He used your mom to find us.

1246
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:26,427
But, because
he stole the spider...

1247
01:20:26,428 --> 01:20:27,638
he was cursed.

1248
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,350
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1249
01:20:38,232 --> 01:20:39,858
This is where my mom died?

1250
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:42,361
And where you were born.

1251
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:51,120
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

1252
01:20:52,037 --> 01:20:54,247
To see the future clearly...

1253
01:20:54,248 --> 01:20:56,541
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

1254
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:57,667
That sounds like literally

1255
01:20:57,668 --> 01:21:00,086
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

1256
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:02,630
You have to go
back to your beginning

1257
01:21:02,631 --> 01:21:04,007
and keep going past that.

1258
01:21:04,008 --> 01:21:05,133
There are powers

1259
01:21:05,134 --> 01:21:07,386
you don't even know
you're capable of.

1260
01:21:08,554 --> 01:21:11,682
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1261
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:16,562
Do you trust me?

1262
01:21:18,981 --> 01:21:20,941
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

1263
01:21:29,491 --> 01:21:30,825
<i>You could just walk away.</i>

1264
01:21:30,826 --> 01:21:33,412
<i>Your thread did not start
when you were born.</i>

1265
01:21:34,622 --> 01:21:36,582
<i>They're almost
impossible to find.</i>

1266
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,917
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1267
01:21:39,918 --> 01:21:41,210
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

1268
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:42,712
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

1269
01:21:42,713 --> 01:21:44,881
Why did you hate me so much?

1270
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:45,965
Thank you.

1271
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:47,301
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1272
01:21:48,427 --> 01:21:50,067
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

1273
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:51,471
I found it.

1274
01:21:51,472 --> 01:21:52,556
I found the spider.

1275
01:21:53,432 --> 01:21:54,849
Incredible, isn't it?

1276
01:21:56,935 --> 01:21:58,853
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

1277
01:21:58,854 --> 01:21:59,937
Give it to me.

1278
01:21:59,938 --> 01:22:01,022
<i>You're making
the wrong decision.</i>

1279
01:22:01,023 --> 01:22:03,383
- You could just walk away.
- <i>No, you're making the wrong...</i>

1280
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:18,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

1281
01:22:18,832 --> 01:22:21,502
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:22:23,504 --> 01:22:25,464
Las Arañas <i>could not stand by.</i>

1283
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:28,175
<i>We tried to save you both.</i>

1284
01:22:46,068 --> 01:22:48,027
Her journey will not be easy...

1285
01:22:48,028 --> 01:22:50,572
...but she is strong.

1286
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:01,791
Your test results came back.

1287
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:02,959
I'm sorry to tell you

1288
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,628
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

1289
01:23:05,629 --> 01:23:08,715
It's a genetic neuromuscular disorder.

1290
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:10,508
<i>But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.</i>

1291
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:13,302
Life expectancy varies.

1292
01:23:13,303 --> 01:23:15,138
Do you need a tissue?

1293
01:23:15,139 --> 01:23:16,931
No. No.
I need a cure.

1294
01:23:16,932 --> 01:23:19,518
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1295
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:22,187
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

1296
01:23:22,688 --> 01:23:24,106
<i>It's experimental...</i>

1297
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:26,607
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

1298
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:28,318
That's why you went there?

1299
01:23:28,819 --> 01:23:29,819
For me?

1300
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:32,321
I have to advise you against
traveling in your condition.

1301
01:23:32,322 --> 01:23:35,408
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

1302
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:37,326
I know this is hard to accept.

1303
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:38,911
No, no, I am...

1304
01:23:38,912 --> 01:23:43,000
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

1305
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:46,336
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

1306
01:23:55,971 --> 01:23:56,972
You did it.

1307
01:23:58,849 --> 01:23:59,933
You did it.

1308
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:03,311
I never knew I was sick.

1309
01:24:03,312 --> 01:24:06,523
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

1310
01:24:09,443 --> 01:24:11,945
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1311
01:24:56,615 --> 01:24:58,867
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

1312
01:24:59,618 --> 01:25:03,205
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1313
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:09,503
I was there.
I was in the room...

1314
01:25:10,212 --> 01:25:12,548
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

1315
01:25:13,006 --> 01:25:14,006
<i>You</i> did that.

1316
01:25:14,007 --> 01:25:17,051
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

1317
01:25:17,052 --> 01:25:20,138
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

1318
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:23,266
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

1319
01:25:25,018 --> 01:25:27,854
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1320
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:30,940
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1321
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:32,650
But I can't do what he can do.

1322
01:25:32,651 --> 01:25:37,196
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

1323
01:25:37,197 --> 01:25:40,241
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

1324
01:25:40,242 --> 01:25:42,660
or the ability
to release poison...

1325
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:47,456
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

1326
01:25:47,457 --> 01:25:50,251
Your mind
has infinite potential.

1327
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:53,671
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

1328
01:25:53,672 --> 01:25:56,842
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

1329
01:25:57,467 --> 01:26:00,637
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1330
01:26:01,889 --> 01:26:04,308
And when you take on
the responsibility...

1331
01:26:05,475 --> 01:26:07,686
great power will come.

1332
01:26:24,953 --> 01:26:26,203
Every day that goes by,

1333
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:28,624
my appointment with death
gets closer.

1334
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31,668
And you still
have found nothing?

1335
01:26:32,252 --> 01:26:33,252
How can she have kept

1336
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:35,463
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1337
01:26:35,464 --> 01:26:37,381
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

1338
01:26:37,382 --> 01:26:39,258
scanning CCTV camera.

1339
01:26:39,259 --> 01:26:40,343
I have hacked

1340
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,178
police and emergency services
frequencies.

1341
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:44,180
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

1342
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:46,141
including friends and family.

1343
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,101
Still nothing.

1344
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:51,188
Do you understand?

1345
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:53,564
Huh?

1346
01:26:53,565 --> 01:26:55,775
Those girls cannot exist.

1347
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:57,568
They will try to destroy me,

1348
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:00,364
as I will you
if you don't find them.

1349
01:27:02,157 --> 01:27:03,575
She can't hide them forever.

1350
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:10,998
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there. Uh...

1351
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:12,792
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

1352
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:14,627
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

1353
01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:15,711
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

1354
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,921
- after ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

1355
01:27:16,922 --> 01:27:18,089
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

1356
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,215
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

1357
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:20,591
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

1358
01:27:20,592 --> 01:27:22,218
- is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

1359
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:24,095
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

1360
01:27:24,096 --> 01:27:26,056
or my water broke.

1361
01:27:28,433 --> 01:27:29,517
Ew!

1362
01:27:29,518 --> 01:27:31,143
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

1363
01:27:31,144 --> 01:27:32,979
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

1364
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,063
Richard's not here,

1365
01:27:34,064 --> 01:27:36,857
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

1366
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:39,318
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

1367
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:40,945
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay. Uh...

1368
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:45,074
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for, whoa,

1369
01:27:45,075 --> 01:27:46,158
the ambulance.

1370
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,244
The baby is not waiting.

1371
01:27:48,245 --> 01:27:50,538
He's coming now.
Ow.

1372
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:51,956
Now.

1373
01:27:51,957 --> 01:27:54,458
Uh, like, here?
In the dining room?

1374
01:27:54,459 --> 01:27:57,253
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1375
01:27:57,254 --> 01:27:58,338
Okay.
Uh...

1376
01:27:59,131 --> 01:28:00,007
Ah!

1377
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,675
Uh, get in the car.

1378
01:28:05,345 --> 01:28:06,385
Keep your head down.

1379
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:11,768
It's gonna be okay.

1380
01:28:13,061 --> 01:28:14,061
Okay.
Come on.

1381
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:15,147
Okay, okay.

1382
01:28:17,357 --> 01:28:19,109
- Ah!
- Everyone okay?

1383
01:28:19,568 --> 01:28:21,069
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

1384
01:28:21,653 --> 01:28:22,654
Seriously?

1385
01:28:23,363 --> 01:28:24,488
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1386
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:25,699
Uh, never mind.

1387
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,577
Ah!

1388
01:28:29,578 --> 01:28:31,580
All right, let's step on it.

1389
01:28:49,514 --> 01:28:51,348
<i>10-58 in progress.
30-relo-5.</i>

1390
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:52,433
I might have something.

1391
01:28:52,434 --> 01:28:53,685
<i>Woman in labor.</i>

1392
01:28:54,895 --> 01:28:56,437
<i>20-Edward copy.
En route.</i>

1393
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:57,688
<i>- 13-Edward, go ahead.</i>
<i>- 10-4.</i>

1394
01:28:57,689 --> 01:28:58,815
<i>Possible D&D in progress.</i>

1395
01:29:00,525 --> 01:29:02,359
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

1396
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,444
St. Timothy's.

1397
01:29:03,445 --> 01:29:04,695
Track the route.

1398
01:29:04,696 --> 01:29:05,781
Tracking.

1399
01:29:43,819 --> 01:29:44,819
<i>The baby is not waiting.</i>

1400
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,487
<i>...doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...</i>

1401
01:29:46,488 --> 01:29:47,571
<i>Get out, get out, get out!</i>

1402
01:29:47,572 --> 01:29:48,949
- <i>Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!</i>

1403
01:29:49,324 --> 01:29:50,866
<i>What? What?</i>

1404
01:29:50,867 --> 01:29:52,118
<i>Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!</i>

1405
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,202
Shit!

1406
01:30:05,173 --> 01:30:06,383
Sorry, guys.

1407
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:10,595
Hey!

1408
01:30:14,891 --> 01:30:16,226
Thank you.

1409
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:23,190
So the last one was

1410
01:30:23,191 --> 01:30:25,901
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

1411
01:30:25,902 --> 01:30:27,862
Uh, so that means

1412
01:30:27,863 --> 01:30:30,866
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

1413
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:34,994
21.6 seconds.

1414
01:30:34,995 --> 01:30:37,246
That's pretty fast.

1415
01:30:37,247 --> 01:30:38,998
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

1416
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:40,083
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

1417
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:42,626
<i>He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.</i>

1418
01:30:42,627 --> 01:30:45,213
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

1419
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:46,922
Drive faster.

1420
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:49,383
Let's go.
Let's go, please.

1421
01:30:57,976 --> 01:30:59,519
Hack into traffic control.

1422
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,730
<i>Turn the lights green.</i>

1423
01:31:03,607 --> 01:31:04,940
<i>Amaria, now.</i>

1424
01:31:04,941 --> 01:31:06,735
Turning all traffic lights to green.

1425
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:11,530
Why is no one stopping?
Hey!

1426
01:31:11,531 --> 01:31:12,866
Ben, watch out!

1427
01:31:14,451 --> 01:31:16,012
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

1428
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:17,161
Whoa, whoa.

1429
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:18,955
Ben!

1430
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:22,833
Everyone okay?

1431
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:23,918
Yeah.

1432
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:25,294
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1433
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:26,379
I'm fine.

1434
01:31:29,549 --> 01:31:30,549
Um...

1435
01:31:31,259 --> 01:31:32,802
What is that?

1436
01:31:36,848 --> 01:31:38,433
Oh, my God, it's him.

1437
01:31:39,184 --> 01:31:40,185
Guys.

1438
01:31:52,864 --> 01:31:54,156
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

1439
01:31:54,157 --> 01:31:55,637
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

1440
01:32:26,815 --> 01:32:27,816
Cassie!

1441
01:32:28,316 --> 01:32:29,900
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

1442
01:32:29,901 --> 01:32:31,443
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

1443
01:32:31,444 --> 01:32:34,738
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

1444
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:37,116
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

1445
01:32:37,117 --> 01:32:38,493
Well, what about you?

1446
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:41,246
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

1447
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:05,520
You're showing off.

1448
01:33:06,646 --> 01:33:07,646
Not yet.

1449
01:33:07,647 --> 01:33:09,941
Uh, I think we lost him.

1450
01:33:15,238 --> 01:33:17,240
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

1451
01:33:17,866 --> 01:33:19,034
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

1452
01:33:21,578 --> 01:33:23,163
Okay, press "charge."

1453
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,873
Am I having a heart attack?

1454
01:33:25,874 --> 01:33:26,957
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

1455
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,500
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

1456
01:33:28,501 --> 01:33:29,752
Hey, man!

1457
01:33:29,753 --> 01:33:31,463
Okay, get ready.

1458
01:33:33,214 --> 01:33:34,757
Get it close to the ceiling.

1459
01:33:34,758 --> 01:33:36,760
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

1460
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:39,554
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

1461
01:33:42,807 --> 01:33:44,267
Wait.
Wait.

1462
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:46,393
Now.

1463
01:33:53,818 --> 01:33:54,985
Sorry.

1464
01:33:54,986 --> 01:33:56,195
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1465
01:33:56,196 --> 01:33:57,571
- You okay?
- You okay?

1466
01:34:00,116 --> 01:34:01,201
Okay.

1467
01:34:02,327 --> 01:34:03,536
Now you're showing off.

1468
01:34:04,412 --> 01:34:05,413
Maybe a little.

1469
01:34:35,318 --> 01:34:36,319
Now what?

1470
01:34:37,153 --> 01:34:38,654
<i>Those girls cannot exist.</i>

1471
01:34:38,655 --> 01:34:40,239
<i>- ...doesn't look safe.</i>
<i>- It's a death trap.</i>

1472
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,533
<i>...infinite potential.</i>

1473
01:34:42,283 --> 01:34:43,951
<i>This place has
always been a death trap.</i>

1474
01:34:43,952 --> 01:34:45,327
<i>...packed with explosives.</i>

1475
01:34:45,328 --> 01:34:46,621
<i>Get down!</i>

1476
01:34:48,748 --> 01:34:49,749
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1477
01:34:51,501 --> 01:34:52,751
<i>Jump! Come on!</i>

1478
01:34:52,752 --> 01:34:53,962
<i>Get in the helicopter.</i>

1479
01:35:01,344 --> 01:35:04,680
I have a code 30.
PD-36-307.

1480
01:35:04,681 --> 01:35:07,684
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

1481
01:35:08,685 --> 01:35:09,686
<i>Copy that.</i>

1482
01:35:10,145 --> 01:35:11,146
Okay.

1483
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,733
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1484
01:35:16,734 --> 01:35:18,236
It's already crazy.

1485
01:35:18,695 --> 01:35:19,904
You didn't bail on us.

1486
01:35:20,738 --> 01:35:21,780
Whatever happens,

1487
01:35:21,781 --> 01:35:23,450
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1488
01:35:24,075 --> 01:35:25,534
We'll protect each other.

1489
01:35:25,535 --> 01:35:26,695
Yeah, we're in this together.

1490
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:28,371
Right?

1491
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:29,831
Yeah.

1492
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:32,584
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

1493
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:35,627
I know.
It's not cool.

1494
01:35:35,628 --> 01:35:37,087
Let's go.
Out the back.

1495
01:35:37,088 --> 01:35:38,298
- What?
- Go, go, go.

1496
01:35:49,184 --> 01:35:50,809
This doesn't look safe.

1497
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:53,812
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1498
01:35:53,813 --> 01:35:55,731
That doesn't <i>sound</i> safe.

1499
01:35:55,732 --> 01:35:57,358
It's a death trap.

1500
01:35:58,193 --> 01:35:59,735
And that's a good thing?

1501
01:35:59,736 --> 01:36:01,654
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

1502
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:04,615
No matter what happens...

1503
01:36:04,616 --> 01:36:07,118
we need to work together, okay?

1504
01:36:08,786 --> 01:36:10,746
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

1505
01:36:10,747 --> 01:36:12,624
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1506
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,459
Are we ready?

1507
01:36:19,923 --> 01:36:22,758
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

1508
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:25,093
Here.
Take these.

1509
01:36:25,094 --> 01:36:27,430
Put them in as many crates as you can.

1510
01:36:32,435 --> 01:36:33,436
Okay?

1511
01:36:34,437 --> 01:36:35,812
You two, go that way.

1512
01:36:35,813 --> 01:36:37,606
We need to slow him down.

1513
01:36:37,607 --> 01:36:39,943
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

1514
01:36:45,573 --> 01:36:46,741
I got this one.

1515
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:48,660
Come on, Julia.
Let's go.

1516
01:37:01,381 --> 01:37:02,465
Anya, go.

1517
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:07,220
Go.

1518
01:37:18,648 --> 01:37:21,192
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

1519
01:37:26,072 --> 01:37:28,074
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

1520
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:31,744
Now!

1521
01:37:35,498 --> 01:37:36,623
Whoa!

1522
01:37:36,624 --> 01:37:37,709
Go! Run!

1523
01:37:39,002 --> 01:37:40,482
Now you're really showing off.

1524
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,130
Come on, upstairs.

1525
01:37:53,808 --> 01:37:55,058
I knew.
I knew she had a plan.

1526
01:37:55,059 --> 01:37:56,144
- Hey!
- Hey!

1527
01:37:56,644 --> 01:37:57,645
- Hey!
- We're here!

1528
01:37:58,104 --> 01:37:59,480
Down here!

1529
01:38:01,149 --> 01:38:03,443
<i>Make your way
to the south side.</i>

1530
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:06,946
Come on.

1531
01:38:09,907 --> 01:38:11,075
Wait.
Get down!

1532
01:38:13,286 --> 01:38:16,205
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

1533
01:38:17,165 --> 01:38:18,416
Anya, stop!

1534
01:38:27,675 --> 01:38:29,761
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

1535
01:38:37,477 --> 01:38:39,269
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

1536
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,772
Get down!

1537
01:38:42,523 --> 01:38:44,359
Go to the ladder. Go!

1538
01:38:46,402 --> 01:38:47,403
Come on, come on!

1539
01:38:52,033 --> 01:38:53,368
<i>Use the web.</i>

1540
01:39:06,964 --> 01:39:08,164
Get to the helicopter.

1541
01:39:08,466 --> 01:39:10,760
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

1542
01:39:13,012 --> 01:39:16,098
<i>It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.</i>

1543
01:39:16,099 --> 01:39:17,474
Guys, this way.

1544
01:39:17,475 --> 01:39:19,560
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

1545
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:25,441
Anya, jump.

1546
01:39:26,943 --> 01:39:28,736
Jump now!
Julia, get back!

1547
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:37,120
Julia, get down!

1548
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:48,172
Ah!

1549
01:39:50,049 --> 01:39:51,050
Oh, God!

1550
01:39:52,135 --> 01:39:53,636
You should have walked away.

1551
01:39:55,888 --> 01:39:57,013
You can't protect them.

1552
01:39:57,014 --> 01:39:58,099
Cassie!

1553
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:04,772
Over here, asshole.

1554
01:40:07,275 --> 01:40:08,818
Mattie!

1555
01:40:14,574 --> 01:40:15,824
Ah!

1556
01:40:19,412 --> 01:40:20,913
Don't hurt her!

1557
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:29,505
Anya!

1558
01:40:31,841 --> 01:40:33,676
Cassie!

1559
01:40:51,277 --> 01:40:52,737
You can't save all three.

1560
01:40:55,615 --> 01:40:57,867
<i>And when you take on
the responsibility...</i>

1561
01:40:58,493 --> 01:41:00,286
<i>great power will come.</i>

1562
01:41:06,751 --> 01:41:09,127
Julia, I got you.

1563
01:41:09,128 --> 01:41:10,213
Come on.

1564
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:13,840
Mattie.
You're gonna be okay.

1565
01:41:13,841 --> 01:41:15,843
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

1566
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,544
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

1567
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:54,632
What makes you so sure?

1568
01:42:01,973 --> 01:42:03,974
Come on.
Come on, come on.

1569
01:42:03,975 --> 01:42:05,433
You're just like your mother.

1570
01:42:05,434 --> 01:42:07,270
Yes, I am.

1571
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:32,003
You've been trying
to change your future.

1572
01:42:33,754 --> 01:42:36,007
But the girls
were never your future.

1573
01:42:37,675 --> 01:42:38,717
I was.

1574
01:42:52,773 --> 01:42:54,650
No!

1575
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:09,123
Uh...
Uh!

1576
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,550
No.
Cassie!

1577
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,604
She's not breathing.

1578
01:44:14,605 --> 01:44:16,725
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

1579
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:18,067
Beginning compressions.

1580
01:44:19,193 --> 01:44:21,611
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

1581
01:44:21,612 --> 01:44:22,989
Come on, guys.
Come on!

1582
01:44:24,573 --> 01:44:26,117
Keep going.
We don't stop.

1583
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:28,035
Come on, Cassie.

1584
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,328
I'm getting a little tired.

1585
01:44:30,329 --> 01:44:31,747
Okay.
I'm right here.

1586
01:44:32,832 --> 01:44:34,249
Cassie, wake up!
Please.

1587
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,010
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

1588
01:44:37,837 --> 01:44:39,717
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

1589
01:44:40,339 --> 01:44:42,259
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

1590
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:45,803
Oh, my God!

1591
01:44:46,512 --> 01:44:47,513
Cassie.

1592
01:44:48,848 --> 01:44:50,432
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1593
01:44:50,433 --> 01:44:51,517
Oh, my God.
We did it.

1594
01:44:56,522 --> 01:44:57,773
We did it.

1595
01:45:18,878 --> 01:45:19,879
Hi.

1596
01:45:22,339 --> 01:45:23,590
Hello.

1597
01:45:23,591 --> 01:45:24,675
Hi.

1598
01:45:26,969 --> 01:45:28,679
Oh, he's perfect.

1599
01:45:29,555 --> 01:45:30,556
He is.

1600
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:32,683
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

1601
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:41,692
We're still here, Cassie.

1602
01:45:42,485 --> 01:45:43,986
Yeah.
We're not leaving you.

1603
01:45:44,987 --> 01:45:45,987
I wouldn't be here

1604
01:45:45,988 --> 01:45:47,490
if it weren't
for the three of you.

1605
01:45:48,115 --> 01:45:49,492
Right back at ya.

1606
01:45:49,992 --> 01:45:50,992
Ben said to tell you

1607
01:45:50,993 --> 01:45:52,495
that the baby
is doing really well.

1608
01:45:53,287 --> 01:45:54,872
And he's loving being an uncle.

1609
01:45:55,998 --> 01:45:59,001
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1610
01:46:00,086 --> 01:46:01,587
That's what he thinks.

1611
01:46:04,799 --> 01:46:07,134
Are you all immediate family?

1612
01:46:07,593 --> 01:46:08,803
Yes.

1613
01:46:10,012 --> 01:46:11,430
They're all mine.

1614
01:46:18,521 --> 01:46:20,021
Can we get you anything?

1615
01:46:20,022 --> 01:46:21,107
No.

1616
01:46:22,024 --> 01:46:24,110
I have everything I need
right here.

1617
01:46:53,305 --> 01:46:54,765
No.

1618
01:46:58,352 --> 01:47:01,563
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

1619
01:47:01,564 --> 01:47:04,816
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

1620
01:47:04,817 --> 01:47:06,526
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

1621
01:47:06,527 --> 01:47:07,903
How'd you know?

1622
01:47:08,654 --> 01:47:09,737
Bless you, Anya.

1623
01:47:09,738 --> 01:47:10,822
What?

1624
01:47:13,367 --> 01:47:14,368
Thank you.

1625
01:47:18,205 --> 01:47:19,205
Mattie!

1626
01:47:19,206 --> 01:47:21,708
What?
I told you I'm starving.

1627
01:47:21,709 --> 01:47:23,459
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

1628
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,295
...wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

1629
01:47:25,296 --> 01:47:27,173
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1630
01:47:28,465 --> 01:47:29,466
How's your eyesight?

1631
01:47:30,009 --> 01:47:31,676
I can see better
than I ever have.

1632
01:47:31,677 --> 01:47:32,761
Oh, yeah?

1633
01:47:33,387 --> 01:47:35,681
Can you see us in the future?

1634
01:47:36,599 --> 01:47:37,725
Yes.

1635
01:47:38,976 --> 01:47:40,186
I can see you.

1636
01:47:42,062 --> 01:47:44,063
<i>Standing up for what you believe.</i>

1637
01:47:49,613 --> 01:47:50,905
<i>Never giving up.</i>

1638
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:57,785
<i>Discovering you were always</i>

1639
01:47:57,786 --> 01:47:59,371
<i>more powerful than you thought.</i>

1640
01:48:01,123 --> 01:48:02,917
Nothing I didn't already know.

1641
01:48:05,628 --> 01:48:07,046
I don't know about you two...

1642
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:09,840
but that totally
makes sense to me.

1643
01:48:10,424 --> 01:48:12,343
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

1644
01:48:14,929 --> 01:48:16,430
What?
I'm being serious.

1645
01:48:20,351 --> 01:48:22,686
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

1646
01:48:31,987 --> 01:48:33,530
<i>Whatever the future holds...</i>

1647
01:48:39,578 --> 01:48:40,788
<i>we'll be ready.</i>

1648
01:48:43,082 --> 01:48:44,959
<i>And you know the best thing
about the future?</i>

1649
01:48:47,086 --> 01:48:49,004
<i>It hasn't happened yet.</i>
