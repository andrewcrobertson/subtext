1
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,279
Another glass of...

2
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:47,644
...rosé?

3
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:52,781
No.
The hour is long past.

4
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:53,848
Check.

5
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,117
Check!

6
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,849
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,049
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,391
Do not advance!

9
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,019
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,230
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,529
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:40,697
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:52,841
Oh, God.

14
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,165
Go.

15
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,027
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,963
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

17
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,305
<i>Leave a message.</i>

18
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:51,669
<i>Hey, Jamie.</i>

19
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,165
<i>Are you there?</i>

20
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,035
<i>Just wondering,
are you and Sukie</i>

21
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,103
- <i>going to shot night tonight?</i>
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,380
<i>I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.</i>

23
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,513
<i>Maybe Carla's going.</i>

24
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:02,009
<i>Do you know if Carla's going?</i>

25
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,076
Are you going?

26
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:05,650
<i>Anyway,
call me if you would.</i>

27
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,113
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,851
<i>Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.</i>

29
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,820
<i>Miss you, friend. It's Marian.</i>

30
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:15,396
Hey. Marian.

31
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,728
Hi, Bart.

32
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,698
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,161
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,503
What?

35
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,439
Phish concert.

36
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,738
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:30,301
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,302
P-H.

39
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,447
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,240
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,946
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,212
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,214
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,490
That's fine.

45
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,426
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,461
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,397
- What expression?
-"Anyhoo."

48
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:51,762
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,434
What is it?

50
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:56,096
A word.

51
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,098
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,639
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,036
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,675
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,545
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,074
It's very good.

57
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,944
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:11,353
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,422
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,921
People don't usually
call them "engagements."

61
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,528
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,926
Yes.

63
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,631
The fact remains.

64
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,028
The engagement.

65
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:28,667
That's right.

66
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,317
Oh, my.

67
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,055
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,354
My God!

69
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,769
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

70
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,035
<i>Leave a message.</i>

71
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:09,202
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,775
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,337
<i>During sex?</i>

74
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,175
- Hi, Sukie.
<i>- Wow.</i>

75
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,751
- Who? Here?
<i>- Yes, there.</i>

76
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,523
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:25,416
- I was just masturbating.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

78
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,659
Me... me time.

79
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,729
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:42,807
No.

81
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,743
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,580
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,109
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,376
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,553
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,885
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,151
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,757
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,594
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,057
Why else would you be here?

91
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,663
To socialize.

92
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,258
Hello, girls.

93
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:10,395
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,397
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,465
Why not 2K?

96
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,469
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:24,409
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,883
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:28,248
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,624
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,254
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,828
So, first lick...

103
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,425
Here.

104
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,736
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:44,803
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,464
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,334
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,645
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,746
Ooh!
Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,507
Here.

111
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,313
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,019
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,757
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,352
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,222
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,564
Here.

117
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,765
She's a free spirit.

118
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:14,195
I admire her.

119
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,900
Free.
Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,496
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,805
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:24,942
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:28,473
Pull that out!

124
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,783
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,148
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,351
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,958
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,894
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:45,325
20th-- soon-to-be 21st--
century lesbian.

130
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,228
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,835
- This right here is
what it gets you.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,672
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,003
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:54,301
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

135
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,709
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,172
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:59,042
What problems?

138
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,538
Internal.

139
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,111
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,816
I don't know
how else to put it.

141
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,082
Problems with
what I feel internally.

142
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,985
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,987
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:13,155
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:17,192
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,997
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,198
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,937
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,071
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,809
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,405
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,012
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,717
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:37,784
Where are you going?

155
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,379
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,689
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,350
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,989
Can't she move?

159
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,057
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,059
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,588
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,833
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,066
There's good birding.

164
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,738
Birding?

165
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,465
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,071
It's very pleasant.

167
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,074
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:06,175
I've been unhappy,

169
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,408
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,849
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,643
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,348
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,185
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,220
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,058
We get our shit together, together.

176
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,829
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,359
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,734
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,736
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,397
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,739
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,741
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,072
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,173
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,879
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,244
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:45,247
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

188
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:48,217
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:50,054
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,825
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,256
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,763
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:56,830
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,260
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,626
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,134
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,697
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,204
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:09,876
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,109
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,474
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,476
You said
she wouldn't be here.

204
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,919
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,448
That was a gift.

206
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,021
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:27,586
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,962
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:31,524
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,295
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,967
I never liked her.

212
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,661
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,103
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,599
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,636
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,781
It's your dildo,
Susanne.

217
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,181
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,249
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,613
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,955
<i>Okay,
it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

221
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,682
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,552
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

223
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,753
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>- To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

224
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:03,831
Right.
<i>- Tallahassee.</i>

225
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:04,997
Sure.
<i>- You got it?</i>

226
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:06,625
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,935
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

228
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,728
By tomorrow.
<i>- No later.</i>

229
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,235
Uh-huh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

230
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:14,336
Okay.
<i>- Over and out.</i>

231
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:18,241
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,310
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,707
A reference?

234
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:24,544
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,744
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,449
His balls.

237
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,287
Can the reference
be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

238
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,487
No kidding.

239
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,160
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

240
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,130
Tallahassee?

241
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,429
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

242
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,101
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

243
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:44,234
I think Curlie here...

244
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,972
Don't call me Curlie.

245
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,909
Isn't your name Curlie?

246
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,075
My name is Curlie.

247
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,879
We just met. It's too familiar.

248
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,947
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

249
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,245
No, I got good sense.

250
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,017
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

251
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,547
Okay. Is that a good car?

252
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,120
Not really.

253
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,750
You sell those shirts?

254
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,785
There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

255
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,754
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

256
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,965
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

257
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,824
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

258
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,034
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

259
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,332
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

260
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,498
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

261
00:13:17,498 --> 00:13:18,763
Down and across.

262
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,270
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

263
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,832
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

264
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,570
Direct route, down and across.

265
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,243
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

266
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:29,048
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

267
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:31,413
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

268
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,921
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

269
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,351
The interstate is not life.

270
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,287
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

271
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,223
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

272
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:40,587
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

273
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,589
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

274
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,063
He said it was a rush job.

275
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,196
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

276
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:46,560
Tomorrow can wait a day.

277
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,067
We could even go to Miami.

278
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,332
Bikinis and high heels.

279
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,072
A medical doctor?

280
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,667
Or a reverend?

281
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,836
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

282
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,014
No, not for medical doctors, either.

283
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,708
Make up your mind--
which are you?

284
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,513
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

285
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,956
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

286
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,321
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

287
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,962
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

288
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:18,526
Well, we're here.

289
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,067
Okay. Who are you?

290
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,697
- The car.
- The car?

291
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,369
The Dodge Aries.

292
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,635
The Dodge Aries?

293
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,977
What are you, a mynah bird?

294
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,143
I'm Curlie.

295
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,013
I understand that.

296
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,674
You're not the Dodge.

297
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,744
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

298
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,756
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

299
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,297
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

300
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:56,531
And once we get to Tallahassee,
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

301
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,731
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

302
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,370
- soap and water.
- It won't.

303
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,339
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

304
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,803
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

305
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,871
Marian, it's art.

306
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,213
Stop saying it's art.

307
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,874
That doesn't end all discussion.

308
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,084
We're gonna be driving through

309
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,152
some conservative towns--
the South.

310
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,945
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

311
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,914
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

312
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,685
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

313
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,951
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

314
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,393
That's "Peck-us,"
honey darling.

315
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:26,000
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,232
My project.

317
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,267
What's your project?

318
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,974
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

319
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,372
How long's it been?

320
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,145
Weeks?

321
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,346
Months?

322
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:44,612
Oh, my God, Marian.

323
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,977
Don't tell me it's been years.

324
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:48,913
H-How many years? Who was it?

325
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,256
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

326
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:52,851
Donna.

327
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,358
Yeah, Donna.

328
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:59,099
Oh, my God.

329
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:01,761
Oh, my God. Donna?

330
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,929
She work for Al Gore now?

331
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,304
Nader.

332
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:08,636
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

333
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,375
Wait a minute.

334
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,313
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

335
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,976
Yes, I did.

336
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,320
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

337
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,816
and then these broads come in

338
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,291
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

339
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,326
You gave them the car.

340
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,130
You don't know who they were?

341
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,824
I told you their names.

342
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,265
Their names, yes, but...

343
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:35,102
This place is a dump.

344
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,203
They drive the car
instead of you.

345
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,369
Is that bad?

346
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:39,931
Bad if they find the goods.

347
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,406
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

348
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,001
I like clutter.

349
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,343
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

350
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,575
Sterile doesn't work for me.

351
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:48,247
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

352
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,809
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

353
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,041
I'm a dick-yank?

354
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,449
Don't antagonize.

355
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,044
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

356
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,980
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

357
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,586
And you would?

358
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,951
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

359
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:02,822
Not per se.

360
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,296
"Per se"?!

361
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:06,760
They left a local number.

362
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,895
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

363
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,666
Someone whose balls I can break.

364
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,079
Now you've gone and done it.

365
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:26,043
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

366
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,554
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

367
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,326
Tomorrow.

368
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,232
This is great.

369
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,597
This is so slutty.
I love this.

370
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,303
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

371
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,206
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

372
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,405
The Butter Churn awaits.

373
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,802
Jamie,
I think I'd prefer to...

374
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,771
No. No, don't even.

375
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,036
You come with me.

376
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,807
I'll show you how this is done.

377
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,752
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

378
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,358
It's a dyke bar.

379
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,592
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

380
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,529
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

381
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,531
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

382
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:17,666
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

383
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,669
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

384
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,345
Hello?

385
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,550
Confidence.

386
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,113
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

387
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:38,489
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

388
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,458
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

389
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,196
Jamie, I have done this before.

390
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:43,791
It's just like this.

391
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,298
One message.

392
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,861
You dig the female body.

393
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,203
Your body.

394
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,238
You're like this.

395
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,032
Not like this.

396
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,101
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

397
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,168
I have done this before.

398
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,576
I am not a schoolmarm.

399
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,138
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

400
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,074
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

401
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,779
Three years.

402
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,617
And four months and 14 days.

403
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:12,523
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter ♪</i>

404
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:14,085
Okay.

405
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,427
<i>♪ Yeah, it tasted real good,
but it stuck to my teeth... ♪</i>

406
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:17,088
You feeling your body?

407
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,925
Very much so.

408
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,531
Okay.

409
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,501
Who looks good to you?

410
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,801
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter... ♪</i>

411
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:28,308
They all look fine.

412
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,409
Fine?

413
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:31,707
Like, "You'll do"?

414
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,577
"Please, please
come home with me, baby.

415
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:35,040
"You seem totally okay.

416
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,745
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

417
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,384
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

418
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,748
I said they all looked fine.

419
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,520
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

420
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,358
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

421
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,261
Why are you jousting with me?

422
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,659
I'm not jousting.

423
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:50,891
I'm asking which of these women

424
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,629
you want to throw up
against the wall

425
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,191
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

426
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:56,435
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

427
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,305
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

428
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,801
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

429
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,067
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

430
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,233
They sense it,

431
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,575
whether you want to fuck them

432
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,038
or you think they're just fine.

433
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,512
I have to be me.

434
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,547
It has to be done
with authenticity.

435
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:11,549
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

436
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,244
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

437
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:15,751
You don't know
what our life was like.

438
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,489
You know nothing
about its worth.

439
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,919
Then why didn't
the two of you move

440
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,921
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

441
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,087
That didn't happen.

442
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,188
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

443
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,530
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

444
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,927
No, I'm not.

445
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:28,863
This is not me.

446
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,996
You're right.
I can't do this.

447
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,899
No, Marian.

448
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,771
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

449
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,377
You can do this.

450
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,313
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

451
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:40,611
Your best self.

452
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:41,876
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

453
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,581
but this really isn't
right for me.

454
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:46,518
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

455
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,884
<i>♪ Yeah, come on,

456
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,182

00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,261
Right here. Look.

461
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,603
Hold it. Better.

462
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,770
Great. Turn.

463
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,641
Oh.

464
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,809
Hello.

465
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,317
Good evening.

466
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,782
I'm Amber.

467
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,586
Marian.

468
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,590
What you reading?

469
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:29,253
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

470
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,893
Wow. Thick one.

471
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,831
Hello, Marian.

472
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,438
Hello.

473
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,871
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

474
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:43,905
No.

475
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,874
No, no.

476
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,107
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

477
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,549
Rats.

478
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,751
Well...

479
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,589
I'll just...

480
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,545
How was it?

481
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,207
Bouncy.

482
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,751
How's your book?

483
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:35,885
Good.

484
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:38,085
It's about two free spirits

485
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,054
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

486
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:43,860
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

487
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,423
That is why we are going
the other way.

488
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,831
Although there was
this one chick

489
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:49,503
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

490
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,164
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

491
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,331
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

492
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,904
No, I'm not kidding.

493
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:56,807
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

494
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,545
in India supposedly
who can do that.

495
00:23:58,545 --> 00:24:00,547
Black belts in cunnilingus.

496
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:02,912
They can even
cunniling themselves.

497
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:05,211
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

498
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,520
You got to ask the librarian.

499
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,478
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

500
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,117
Who wrote your book?

501
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:13,659
Henry James...

502
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,892
American writer.

503
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:18,059
Famous family. His brother, too.

504
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,126
Rick?

505
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,601
No, I'm kidding.

506
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,460
I know who Henry James is.

507
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,000
White and uptight.

508
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:29,301
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

509
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,171
Boy, that was a great read.

510
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:34,174
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

511
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,979
That's a very apt simile.

512
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:39,652
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:42,083
Put me off the whole book thing.

514
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,316
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

515
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,384
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

516
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,595
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't think
you should've brought
someone back to the room.

517
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,488
Okay.

518
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:52,830
I knew this was coming.

519
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,568
How do you think I felt?

520
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,163
You told me to have
a night on the town.

521
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,396
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

522
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,706
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

523
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:02,070
We operate on
a handshake basis.

524
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,940
- What does that mean?
-"Hiya. How you doing?

525
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,304
"How much for that Cadillac car?

526
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,339
How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

527
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,945
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

528
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:10,177
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

529
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,476
- Well, then why'd you ask?

Why are you sorry?

539
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:36,500
You're good. I'm a little...

Uh-huh.

546
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,153
I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:53,286
Uh-huh.

548
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,958
They're very committed lesbians,

549
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,124
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

550
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:57,763
which is practically on our way.

551
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,061
Not exactly.

552
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,766
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

553
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,130
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

554
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,198
Forget the map.
After today's game,

555
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,464
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

556
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,806
And guess who's invited.

557
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:09,236
I'm sure you are.

558
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,303

I just asked. She answered.

683
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,971
But you cannot relate
to the public,

684
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,281
which, in a service profession,
is a big fucking handicap.

That's my point.

693
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:06,057
Well, real life
is not like that.

694
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,466
You only see it that way
because you're not nourished

695
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,634
by human contact, the human
give-and-take, so forth.

696
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:13,636
Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

697
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:15,066
That's what you're
comfortable with.

698
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,573

- Caveman shit.

699
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:17,937

the whole person.

700
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:20,071

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,432
<i>Marian Pallavi was picked up
for vagrancy</i>

710
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,797
<i>last night in Marietta, Georgi.</i>

711
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,931
<i>- Just north of Atlanta.</i>
- On it.

712
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,571
Georgia.

713
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,750
Thank you.

714
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:03,818
For what?

715
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,656
Just picking me up.

716
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:08,493
Am I not gonna pick you up?

717
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:10,319
Hard not to.

718
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:12,629
"Ma'am, your friend here
is in the hoosegow.
Care to come get her?"

719
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:14,433
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

720
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:16,325
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

721
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:18,536
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

722
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:21,671
And so I say thank you.

723
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:29,679
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

724
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,275
and I've been careful
not to ask,

725
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,750
but damn, Marian,

726
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,281
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

727
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,283
I think it was jail,
not prison.

728
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,823
Oh. I'm sorry.

729
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:44,221
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

730
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,025
It wasn't hell-raising.

731
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:47,796
Sorry to disappoint.

732
00:38:47,796 --> 00:38:50,667
A policeman didn't like my tone.

733
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,965
Oh.

734
00:38:52,803 --> 00:38:54,638
You copped some attitude.

735
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:56,904
I don't have attitude.

736
00:38:58,578 --> 00:39:00,512
Marian, if I may,

737
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,778
there are certain things in life

738
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:05,583
which you got to sense
and understand

739
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,717
in order to live life,

740
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:10,753
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

741
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:13,085
well, all these
funny little creatures

742
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:15,560
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

743
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,122
we call 'em human beings.

744
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,927
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

745
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:22,468
And your whole social situation,

746
00:39:22,468 --> 00:39:23,931
you got to understand
what that is.

747
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:24,833
Uh-huh.

748
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,263
You know what that means?

749
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,605
"Social situation"?

750
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:29,508
I know what
"social situation" means.

751
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:30,707
Okay, good.

752
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:32,676
So, the whole thing
with a cop is--

753
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:34,942
and you should remember this
for future reference--

754
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:38,407
when you're in
a social situation with a cop,

755
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:40,310
there ain't no social situation.

756
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,247
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

757
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,315
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

758
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,383
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

759
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:48,890
for two years now, and...

760
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,595
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

761
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:52,993
Thank you. I understand.

762
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,160
But if authority
is being abused,

763
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,767
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

764
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,803
Florida.

765
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,776
Lesbian...

766
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:11,583
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

767
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:34,100
You okay?

768
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,036
Spare tire.

769
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:52,056
What?

770
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,826
Something burning?

771
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:14,877
Jamie, it's cold.

772
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,683
Don't touch it.

773
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:21,983
I saw this movie once where

774
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,590
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

775
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,086
and they opened the box,

776
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:29,892
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

777
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,041
Head!

778
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,316
No, I'm kidding.

779
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:01,088
It was a minor traffic accident.

780
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,551
Fast stop.

781
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:05,829
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

782
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,996
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

783
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,736
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

784
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,003
That's right.

785
00:42:15,003 --> 00:42:17,874
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

786
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:20,712
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

787
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:22,538
Just drove off
with something we need.

788
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:24,144
Didn't even know they had it.

789
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:26,949
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

790
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,348
Just making out.

791
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:32,251
Oh, yeah?

792
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:33,758
With who?

793
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,092
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

794
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,162
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

795
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:45,033
sample case back.

796
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:47,838
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

797
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:49,433
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

798
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,073
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

799
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,339
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

800
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:00,543
No, no.

801
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:01,885
We should just call the cops.

802
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:03,282
We will, Jamie.

803
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:06,516
First, we should see
what's in here.

804
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:08,056
Why? I don't want to look.

805
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,091
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

806
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:12,522
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

807
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,095
This might tell us
who they are,

808
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,064
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

809
00:43:16,064 --> 00:43:18,429
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

810
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,233
Protect us?

811
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,565
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

812
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:24,039
What do we lose by looking?

813
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:26,943
Look.

814
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:30,078
I just want to know
what's going on.

815
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:33,081
This might tell us.

816
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:35,182
I bet it's locked.

817
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:01,912
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

818
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,276
That was awful.

819
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,245
You just said
not to call the cops.

820
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:06,851
In ignorance.

821
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,248
No, what you said was true.

822
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,019
The cops could think
you're involved.

823
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,581
You just spent
the night in jail.

824
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:13,022
For vagrancy.

825
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:15,420
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

826
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,762
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

827
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:17,994
Here's what we do.

828
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:19,996
First, we get to Tallahassee.

829
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,426
Bye!

830
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:25,936
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

831
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:27,465
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

832
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,236
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

833
00:44:29,236 --> 00:44:31,139
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

834
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:32,404
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

835
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:33,911
the address
where they're headed?

836
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:36,144
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

837
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:38,047
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

838
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:40,082
Bye!

839
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:45,890
Welcome to El Conquistador.

840
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,453
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

841
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,895
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

842
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:53,458
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

843
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,866
You take the Rainbow Card?

844
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,428
Uh, I'm sure we do.

845
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:58,496
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

846
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,366
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

847
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,467
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

848
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,007
You do that, right?

849
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:05,239
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

850
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,779
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

851
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:08,374
for sensitive materials?

852
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:09,815
We do have in-room safes

853
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:11,850
for any valuables
that you may have.

854
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,610
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

855
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,414
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

856
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:17,317
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

857
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:18,384
Do you have ice?

858
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:27,624
<i>♪ I've been waitin' on you,
girl... ♪</i>

859
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,329
This is it?

860
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:32,266
They said Farm Road 80.

861
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:34,807
What's the matter?

862
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:36,974
Afraid of the stuff of life?

863
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:40,307

Is this, um... Slappy's?

869
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:04,034
That's right.

870
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:10,766
Have you seen two, um,
nonlocal women come in here?

871
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:12,207
That's one of them.

872
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:15,441
I was sittin' here listening

873
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:17,146
to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

874
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:20,413
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

875
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:23,515
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

876
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,619
Now, that's true.

877
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,522
Love will bite your ass.

878
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,661

879
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,037

880

Oh, I can send Sukie.

881
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,174
But why would these people
just be waiting there

882
00:46:45,174 --> 00:46:46,637
in the drive-away office?

883
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,913
Well, clearly, this was not

884
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:49,541
your garden-variety
decapitation.

885
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,048
This was some kind of a...

886
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:52,984
Well, I don't know what it was,

887
00:46:52,984 --> 00:46:55,646
but they know
we have their stuff.

888
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,889
Yeah?

889
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,584
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

890
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:02,257
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

891
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:04,160
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

892
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,327
But why would we get
in touch with them?

893
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:09,231
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

894
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:11,827
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

895
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:13,235
Jamie.

896
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:14,940
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

897
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,942
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

898
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:18,339
She hates you.

899
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:21,408
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

900
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,575
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

901
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:26,952
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

902
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:29,383
Attorney?
Are you a college boy?

903
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:32,551
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

904
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,883
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

905
00:47:34,883 --> 00:47:36,588
I'm running booking, jackass.

906
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:38,722
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

907
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,328
and kick your number-running ass

908
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,330
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

909
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,168
Who's running booking?

910
00:47:45,168 --> 00:47:46,939
- You are.
- Who is?

911
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:49,073
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

912
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:50,734
- Shink!
- Yeah.

913
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,109
Telephone.

914
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,837
Sergeant Shinkleman.

915
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:56,806
Hey. It's me.

916
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:58,511
<i>Oh, what a lovely surprise.</i>

917
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:00,843
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

918
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:03,318
Did the two creeps find you?
<i>- What?</i>

919
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:05,287
The two weirdos looking for you.

920
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:06,552
I tried to be helpful.

921
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:09,456
Uh, but who were they?
<i>- How should I know?</i>

922
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:11,359
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

923
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,229
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

924
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:16,034
<i>- George and Lennie.</i>
- George and Lennie?

925
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:19,895
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

926
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:21,567
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

927
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,437
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

928
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,736
"Break a big murder case"?

929
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,541
<i>Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.</i>

930
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,576
Curlie's Drive-Away?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

931
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,348
<i>And you ask Curlie about...</i>

932
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:35,713
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

933
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:38,815
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

934
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,191
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

935
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:42,753
Jamie, that is about

936
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,459
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

937
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,461
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

938
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,034
I guarantee you someone's there.

939
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,630
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

940
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,072
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

941
00:48:54,072 --> 00:48:55,898
I'll take Alice.

942
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,504
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

943
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:59,737
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

944
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,509
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

945
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,611
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

946
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,646
Wetumpka, Alabama.

947
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:09,285
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

948
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:10,550
They hadn't been there,

949
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,982
but a very personable
music lover

950
00:49:13,982 --> 00:49:15,654
told us of another juke joint

951
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:17,557
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

952
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:18,756
Stop!

953
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,527
Called Ike's.

954
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:23,398
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

955
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,136
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

956
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,303
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

957
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:29,173
I think the soccer team
was just confused

958
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:31,175
about which joint
these girls were going to,

959
00:49:31,175 --> 00:49:32,737
so we're gonna drive...

960
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,443
Stop saying words.

961
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:38,116
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

962
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,678
They arrived in Tallahassee

963
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:43,220
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

964
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,420
Tallahassee.

965
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,059
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

966
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,160
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

967
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,656
Not a juke joint.

968
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,295
You should arrive
by early morning.

969
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:53,428
I'll meet you there.

970
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:55,694
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

971
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:57,663
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

972
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,599
We have not slept
since the night before last,

973
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,700
and we...

974
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,306
Hello?

975
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,738
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

976
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,213
Certainly.

977
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:11,149
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

978
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,579
or right here at the hotel,

979
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,120
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

980
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,748
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

981
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:19,784
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

982
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,226
Maybe we should stay here.

983
00:50:22,226 --> 00:50:23,755
Replenish the ice.

984
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:30,366
This is great, but how...

985
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,764
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

986
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:36,438
Rainbow.

987
00:50:36,438 --> 00:50:37,571
Yes.

988
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:40,035
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

989
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:41,773
Like, a really, really good one?

990
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:42,840
Of course.

991
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,877
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

992
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,483
Theoretically.

993
00:50:56,922 --> 00:50:58,163
So...

994
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,201
I've been thinking
about it, and...

995
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,063
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

996
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:11,770
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

997
00:51:12,608 --> 00:51:14,674
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

998
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:17,677
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

999
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:19,613
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1000
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:22,451
but I usually have stuff to do.

1001
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,256
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1002
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,786
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1003
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:32,329
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1004
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:34,331
Something I decided

1005
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:35,827
last night
while I was lying in bed

1006
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,830
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1007
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,098
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1008
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:44,572
Especially since, with you,

1009
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:46,607
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1010
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:47,675
Am I right?

1011
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:51,183
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1012
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,252
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

1013
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:55,781
Yes, please.

1014
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:57,981
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1015
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,587
I mean, we're good friends,

1016
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:01,589
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1017
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,019
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1018
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,627
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1019
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,597
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1020
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:11,797
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1021
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:13,766
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1022
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:16,373
She was always saying
that this or that

1023
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,243
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1024
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:20,509
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1025
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,446
the sex was great.

1026
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:25,316
Ladies, have we decided?

1027
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:29,716
Don't rush us, buddy.

1028
00:52:30,455 --> 00:52:33,753
First, we'll dance.

1029
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,570
Maybe I do overthink things.

1030
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:51,573
Yeah.

1031
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,577
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1032
00:52:59,548 --> 00:53:02,782
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1033
00:53:02,782 --> 00:53:04,113
Ah, you know Debbie.

1034
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:07,182
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1035
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:08,755
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1036
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:11,923
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1037
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,694
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1038
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:16,125
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

1039
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:21,504
<i>♪ Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle ♪</i>

1040
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,971
<i>♪ Just remember, darling ♪</i>

1041
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,512
<i>♪ All the while ♪</i>

1042
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:36,288
<i>♪ You belong to me... ♪</i>

1043
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,365
One accomplishment.

1044
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:12,609
Huh? Name me one.

1045
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:15,073
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1046
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:17,009
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1047
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:20,815
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1048
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,553
on a creaky porch swing

1049
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:24,280
on a warm summer evening--
crickets, so forth?

1050
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,591
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1051
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:29,461
trousers around your ankles,

1052
00:56:29,461 --> 00:56:31,859
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1053
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,598
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1054
00:56:34,598 --> 00:56:36,633
Yes, people might stroll by

1055
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,162
and see you
looking foolish up there

1056
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,603
slapping ham on the veranda,

1057
00:56:39,603 --> 00:56:42,639
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1058
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:45,169
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1059
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:47,809
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1060
00:56:47,809 --> 00:56:50,845
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1061
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:52,209
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1062
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,552
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1063
00:56:54,552 --> 00:56:56,488
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1064
00:56:56,488 --> 00:56:58,182
that I've been carrying
on my back

1065
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,459
all the way from Philadelphia!

1066
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:20,204
Help.

1067
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:30,720
"Big case."

1068
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,118
That woman.

1069
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:39,421
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1070
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:02,213
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1071
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,885
Yes, sir.

1072
00:59:24,704 --> 00:59:27,804
Honey, we eating soon?

1073
00:59:27,804 --> 00:59:29,641
Okay.

1074
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,876
Oh. All right.

1075
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,437
Jamie?

1076
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:12,409
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1077
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,655
Jamie, no!

1078
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,390
Jamie, why?

1079
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:34,035
Oh, my God.

1080
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:35,366
Marian.

1081
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:38,270
Sir?

1082
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,876
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1083
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:42,879
Tallahassee, sir.

1084
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,640
Where to, exactly?

1085
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,851
Yes, um...

1086
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,787
The track.

1087
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,855
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1088
01:00:51,855 --> 01:00:53,648
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1089
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,122
Oh, come on now.

1090
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:57,960
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1091
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,896
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1092
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:02,195
No. I like this one.

1093
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:05,770
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1094
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:07,596
Last night was beautiful,

1095
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:09,268
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1096
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:10,874
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1097
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:12,700
Okay! -All right!

1098
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,109
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1099
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:17,045
We're here for two things.

1100
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:20,180
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1101
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,885
Screw you!

1102
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:23,711
We're here for two items.

1103
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:25,119
Whoa. She's naked.

1104
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,517
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1105
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,892
We're here for two items.

1106
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:31,026
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1107
01:01:31,026 --> 01:01:33,127
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1108
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:34,931
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1109
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:36,999
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1110
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:39,034
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1111
01:01:39,034 --> 01:01:41,663
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1112
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:43,907
Let's get this show on the road.

1113
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,845
Yeah, baby.

1114
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:55,083
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1115
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:58,889
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1116
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,387
Whoa.

1117
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,796
This is so groovy.

1118
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:07,799
Now I can love you forever.

1119
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:09,427
Whoa.

1120
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:10,835
And ever

1121
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:15,400
and ever and ever

1122
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,537
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1123
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:25,014
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1124
01:02:25,014 --> 01:02:29,117
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1125
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:33,748
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1126
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:38,060
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1127
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:41,789
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1128
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:45,463
Never to wilt...

1129
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,007
Took 'em straight here.

1130
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,173
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1131
01:02:52,173 --> 01:02:54,175
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1132
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,477
This is all they had?

1133
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:01,215
What's all they had?

1134
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,891
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1135
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:08,926
What are you talking about?

1136
01:03:08,926 --> 01:03:11,159
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1137
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,656
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1138
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,328
Come on, girls.

1139
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,033
Where's the last phallus?

1140
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,533
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1141
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:24,502
I-I...

1142
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:26,141
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1143
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,044
What have you done, jerk-off?

1144
01:03:28,044 --> 01:03:29,914
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1145
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:31,377
They gave you the combination,

1146
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,379
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1147
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:35,084
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1148
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:36,888
past the first number.

1149
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:53,267
The senator is a good man.

1150
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:57,040
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1151
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,404
Many of us did.

1152
01:03:58,404 --> 01:04:00,912
It was a different time.

1153
01:04:00,912 --> 01:04:03,981
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1154
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:06,511
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1155
01:04:12,651 --> 01:04:13,958
Housekeeping.

1156
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:20,228
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1157
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,264
...thing.

1158
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,566
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1159
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,703
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1160
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,948
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1161
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:39,577
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1162
01:04:41,647 --> 01:04:42,877
He was just a kid.

1163
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:50,192
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1164
01:04:50,192 --> 01:04:52,326
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1165
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:55,230
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1166
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,629
You saw him, sort of.

1167
01:05:13,545 --> 01:05:16,845
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1168
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:19,485
Think of it: eBay,

1169
01:05:19,485 --> 01:05:23,786
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1170
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:26,261
Comments, reviews.

1171
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:28,659
Think of what
it would do to him.

1172
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:33,037
His children, his family,
his career.

1173
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:39,241
We're not unreasonable.

1174
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:41,012
We'll gladly pay for it.

1175
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,970
We just...

1176
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,939
Will you please shut up!

1177
01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:46,149
That wasn't my idea!

1178
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,777
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1179
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,844
I was experimenting.

1180
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,120
But you liked it.

1181
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,418
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1182
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:53,156
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1183
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,586
Drunk on cock.

1184
01:05:54,586 --> 01:05:56,390
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1185
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,062
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1186
01:05:58,062 --> 01:05:59,954
- To understand life.
- No!

1187
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:02,561
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1188
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:08,072
God, man,
what are you doing?!

1189
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:42,568
Mommy.

1190
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:06,229
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1191
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:07,725
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1192
01:07:07,725 --> 01:07:08,990
Then we switch hotels.

1193
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,102
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1194
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:12,532
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1195
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:14,930
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1196
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,174
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1197
01:07:24,346 --> 01:07:26,513
Next customer, please.

1198
01:07:26,513 --> 01:07:29,318
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1199
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,045
Don't ask me why.

1200
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,621
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1201
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:37,458
I need to speak to the senator.

1202
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:40,989
<i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1203
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:43,398
Someone who has his...

1204
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:47,105
...personal effects.

1205
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:20,534
<i>Who is this?</i>

1206
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:21,865
Senator?

1207
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:24,340
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1208
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:27,211
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1209
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:30,808
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1210
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:32,447
Everybody's things.

1211
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:35,219
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1212
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,221
If you're not alone,

1213
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:39,256
believe me, I'll know it.

1214
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:50,498
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1215
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:52,093
made a phone call
from here last night.

1216
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:53,369
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1217
01:08:54,999 --> 01:08:56,867
Well, this is for her.

1218
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:58,308
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1219
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,573
You've missed them.

1220
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:02,312
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1221
01:09:22,268 --> 01:09:23,894
Done.

1222
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:26,930
With what?

1223
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,273
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1224
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,638
Want to join me?

1225
01:10:01,098 --> 01:10:02,636
Jamie.

1226
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,376
I want...

1227
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:07,971
Uh-huh?

1228
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:11,040
I... I-I want...

1229
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,548
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1230
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:18,146
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

1231

the president

1281
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:07,210
of Little Miss Liar Pants, Inc.?

1282

Oh, this? No, I just, uh...

1283
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:23,930
'Cause we thought
they didn't know where we were,

1284
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,635
but somehow they did,
and this morning,

1285
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:27,263
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1286
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,067
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1287
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:30,937
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1288
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:32,741
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1289
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:35,975
Well, you've had a full day.

1290
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:41,145
She's yours now.

1291
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,184

1292
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,970

1293
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,651

1294
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:16,081
Yeah.

1295
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,149
We forgot to tell you about

1296
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:20,382
the suave guy's head
in the hatbox.

1297
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,700
Boy, I think
I could win against him.

1298
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,702
And now we get to just
keep on going.

1299
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:35,133

01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,676

1303
01:15:42,074 --> 01:15:46,144
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1304
01:15:46,144 --> 01:15:48,509
but I have to admit,

1305
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:50,379
I'll miss his...

1306
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,787
No worries, girl.

1307
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,284
I made a cast.

1308
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:55,923
And two copies.

1309
01:15:57,696 --> 01:15:59,157

1310
01:15:59,157 --> 01:16:00,730

1311
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,325

01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:04,492

1313
01:16:04,492 --> 01:16:06,527
Can we get our car?

1314
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,003
You know, hers and hers.

1315
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,008
Aunt Ellis.

1316
01:16:16,308 --> 01:16:17,813

1317
01:16:17,813 --> 01:16:19,408
- She's your aunt?
- Uh-huh.

1318
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,816
Uncle John met her in church.

1319
01:16:20,816 --> 01:16:22,609

She's very religious.

1320
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:24,853

1321
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,053

1323
01:16:28,659 --> 01:16:30,155

1324
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:32,927

and what a beautiful city.

1325
01:16:32,927 --> 01:16:35,732
- Not like Miami.
- Oh, no, no.

1326
01:16:35,732 --> 01:16:37,965

No, unfortunately...

1329
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,102
Right after birding,
we're off to Massachusetts.

1330
01:16:43,102 --> 01:16:45,170
- We just decided last night.
- Jamie.

1331
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,974
Well, what do they have
in Massachusetts

1332
01:16:46,974 --> 01:16:49,570

in North Florida?

1333
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,682
