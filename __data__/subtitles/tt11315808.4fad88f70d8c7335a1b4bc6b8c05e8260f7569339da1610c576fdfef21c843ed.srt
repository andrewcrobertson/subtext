1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
commercial concert

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Gee him in his hand.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm there, huh?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, yeah, and then what part?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm facing Tr See

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Whoa.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I need to get heavy

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What the world needs now is love, sweet love is the only thing

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That is just to know what the world needs now

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It is love, sweet love, you know my death for so

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But for everyone, tell me about it

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well I don't need another mountain

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There are mountains and the inside is enough to cry

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are oceans and rivers and not to cross

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Enough to last until the end of time

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What the world needs now is love, sweet love

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is the only thing that is just to know what the world needs now

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It is love, sweet love

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:37,000
TF

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, sorry.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nothing good about it.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Get out!

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, it's all right.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No, get out.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go, boys. Let's get this shoulder over.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get out of here.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get out of here.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Get out of here.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We need to find a mess on him.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get out of here.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Put your clothes on.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What the fuck?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You got a joke for me today?

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, my God.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, let's go, guys.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Fuck.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fuck.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Fuck.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Get him out the ground.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Move this fucking ass!

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Move this fucking ass!

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Fuck you!

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Get the fuck out of here, Sam!

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out of here, boys!

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, it's been a crazy career, what?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't make it down the mountain.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You got a big day today. You better put on a heavy face.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go, Arthur.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on, Fleck.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If only you're fancy lawyer, blame him and leave your late.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She knows what you like me, right?

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Take Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, it's been a while, hasn't it?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's go!

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Back to fuck up, Kevin.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
From the line.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fleck, you.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Fleck, you got a joke for me.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All the kids done since he got here is fucking smile.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Today, all of a sudden he bites Moran.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because nobody likes Moran, he was a guy for a stay for like eight years before he got here.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's still a fucking tent.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fleck, you got a joke for us today?

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I already asked.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I got a joke for you.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog was Patrick?

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Clean yourself up.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You like that one, Arthur?

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog?

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why didn't you tell me the dog was a cat?

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why?

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The other half lives.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Could have been all yours if you hadn't killed Findings, no.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I love the show and it's portfolio.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm gonna get it.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Moira.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Come on.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jesus Christ, you couldn't get him a fucking umbrella.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get her on there.

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Today we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Remember her.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She's gonna be videotaping you this time

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
so we can show it at your competency hearing next week.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And if they find you competent,

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and they will, they always do.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Then we're going to trial.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You need to be in an actual hospital

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
with actual doctors.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Not as department of corrections.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bullshit.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Those thugs.

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Dr. Beatty thinks

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that with everything that happened to you

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
in your childhood,

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it caused a split.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This fragmentation in you

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to help me cope with your pain.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
She believes you have another person

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
living inside of you.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it was this other person

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
who committed those crimes.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you understand what that means, Arthur?

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll be asking you a few questions today,

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Arthur, okay?

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe you don't remember some things

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
or you're confused about what you did.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm here to help you try and sort out what happened.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Arthur, I'm not here only to help with your defense.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm here for you.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But for me to do my job,

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I need you to be candid with me.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Does that make sense?

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Can I have a cigarette?

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Of course he can.

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can I have a cigarette?

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who?

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah!

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's start with the first incident, okay?

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The three men who have costed you on the subway will bully you.

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Did you feel like they triggered something painful from your past, your childhood?

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you remember any of what happened?

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Did you black out, see bright lights?

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How about Marie Franklin?

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What if anything do you remember about that night?

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The music.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's good?

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
After that is good?

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Can I tell you what I remember about that night?

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I remember.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You came out just as Joker.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I remember Joker dancing to that music.

153
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right?

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I really like his band.

155
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My mom and I used to watch it.

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They show together.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They show together.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She like Marie Franklin as well.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They stole a handsome look at those bare-wood ones here.

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is that your mother's voice?

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you often hear her voice in your head?

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was alright.

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Did it change at all after she died?

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What does that mean?

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Did you...

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This other part of you...

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Joker...

168
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Did it come out more after she died?

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You lived together, right? In a one-bedroom apartment?

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Maybe I could talk to Joker about it.

171
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Would he like to talk to me?

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey Arthur!

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Arthur!

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The guard said, you wanted to show me how to kiss.

176
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They said Joker's a really good kisser.

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Nobody's ever gave me a kiss before.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know, Ricky knows no one in.

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No hesitation.

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I gotta be honest with you Arthur.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I wouldn't have took you for a hopeless romantic.

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's go!

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You chose it. Line up back to him.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're a really serious...

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I haven't been serious.

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
In the Bible.

187
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It wasn't that hard either.

188
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And since they made that TV movie about you,

189
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
everybody's still a thing here to star.

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How about you Arthur?

191
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you still think you're a star?

192
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I bet you do, don't you?

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I said that's life.

194
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not right now, sir.

195
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's a million.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's life.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's a lot of people say.

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm a king.

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I've been up and down and over and out.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I know one thing.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Each time I find myself in flames, I know my face.

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I just take myself up and get back in the race.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And I'm funny, and I'm funny.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I can't deny it.

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Many times I thought I'd come now.

206
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But my heart was fine.

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But if there's no winch, it'd come to see a drive.

208
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.

209
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In my...

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.

211
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's go.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's go.

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You are the...

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Shut down at the cannon this morning.

215
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll let these things...

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go.

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, when the saints go marching in...

218
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I wanna be in that number when the men are at the party day.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is a time when the men are happy.

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We're singing together again.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We're singing together.

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A group I want you to welcome Arthur to play.

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Now I know it's odd to have an inmate from E-Warden here,

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I've been assured he's been a model patient without any incidents.

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know this might feel strange, Mr. Flick, a new environment.

227
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You see, we use music in this class to make us whole,

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to balance the conflicting forces, the...

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
the fractures within ourselves.

230
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
All I ask is that you sing, if and when you're ready to sing.

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, let's go.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm on this radio.

233
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't wait.

234
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I know it's...

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Is it really you?

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah?

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, I want to go.

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, I can't sing.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I got the world on a string, second on a rainbow.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Got this string around my finger.

241
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And then we'll sleep.

242
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Arthur.

243
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I know.

244
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So what's a nice guy located in a place like this?

245
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't find people.

246
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
More in my financial television.

247
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What about you?

248
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I set fire to my parents apartment building.

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Actually...

250
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm six.

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No, we must probably come in my mother.

252
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I should have done that.

253
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
My mother had me committed.

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She says I'm psychotic.

255
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know, most of us, that TV movie they made about you like 20 times.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah.

257
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Really bad?

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't want to let me watch it.

259
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It was good.

260
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It was really good.

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I grew up in the same neighborhood.

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Me and my friends used to take that staircase to school every day.

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
My parents didn't give a fuck about me either.

264
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
My father beat the shit out of me.

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, guess what?

266
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Knock knock.

267
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Sorry, kid.

268
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Your dad was killing a car accident.

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Sorry.

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, my God.

272
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If only those friends could see me now.

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When I first saw Joker,

274
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
when I saw you and Murray Franklin,

275
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the whole time I was watching, I kept thinking,

276
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I hope this guy blows his brains out.

277
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And then you did.

278
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And for once in my life,

279
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I didn't feel so alone anymore.

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Forget your troubles.

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Come on.

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Get happy.

283
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Better chase all your cares than play.

284
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
See, hallelujah.

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Come on.

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Get happy.

287
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And before the judgment.

288
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Son, you're shining.

289
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Come on.

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Get happy.

291
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Lord, he's waiting to take your hand.

292
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Sing hallelujah.

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Come on.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Get happy.

295
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hey, Jackie.

296
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You wanna know what I've ever read most from being on Murray Franklin show?

297
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What's that?

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That I didn't shoot first to let him ask me questions later.

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That a joke, Arthur.

300
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

301
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How long it took was you getting a little old-fashioned?

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Thanks, pal.

303
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's good to medication.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Not guilty by reason of insanity makes no sense in this case.

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And his...

306
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
A flag.

307
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He acts violent.

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're in the noise.

309
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm in the noise.

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm in our city.

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I'm in our city.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm in the noise.

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm in the noise.

314
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm in the noise.

315
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm in the noise.

316
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm in the noise.

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm in the noise.

318
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm in our city.

319
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But all over the country.

320
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm in the noise.

321
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Our friends are million people.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Judge says he's confident to stand trial.

323
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm still in the noise.

324
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He's fucking new.

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
These people...

326
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of...

327
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Marvin.

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, he's not.

329
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Arthur Fleck is a monster for you exactly what he was doing.

330
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And our office will be seeking the death penalty.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Thank you.

332
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you.

333
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh, that's...

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, sir.

335
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You hear that, Fleck?

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The death penalty.

337
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They're gonna fry you out of here.

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
How does that feel?

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
For once in my life,

340
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I have someone who needs me.

341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Someone I've needed so long.

342
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
For once,

343
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm afraid

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I can go where life leads me.

345
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Somehow, I'll know I'll be strong.

346
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
For once I can touch

347
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
For my heart used to dream of

348
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Long before I knew

349
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Someone more like you

350
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Make my dreams come true

351
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
For once in my life,

352
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I won't let sorrow hurt me

353
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Not like it's hurt me before

354
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
For once I have someone

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I know will desert me

356
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I'm not alone anymore

357
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
For once I can say this is mine

358
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You can't take it

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Long as I know I've got love

360
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I can take it

361
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
For once in my life,

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I've got someone who needs me.

363
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
For once I can say this is mine

364
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You can't take it

365
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Long as I know I've got love

366
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I can make it

367
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
For once in my life,

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I've got someone who needs me.

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
For once I can say this is mine

370
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You can't take it

371
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Long as I know I've got love

372
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I can make it

373
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
For once in my life,

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I've got someone

375
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Who wants in my life,

376
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I've got someone who wants in my life

377
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm entering Arthur

378
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How's it make you feel?

379
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You scared?

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
No.

381
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Stay.

382
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No.

383
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We died, don't you?

384
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Ha ha ha ha ha

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ha ha ha ha

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Ha ha ha ha

387
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Ha ha ha

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Ha ha ha ha

389
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Ha ha ha

390
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No, you cannot give any statements to the press, even if Kellerman asked you to.

391
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You know they've been out there all week.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
This evening, they want to talk to me.

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I told you before, I forgot that an exclusive interview next month, right before trial.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Okay, but, but Kellerman asked me to make a statement now.

395
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He was letting me go to this meeting night. You're like an old person.

396
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What are you telling me you have?

397
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Come on, last time.

398
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Okay, um, yeah, I'm sorry, after that.

399
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I told you.

400
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay, let's move it.

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Hang on, Frank. He's signing my book.

402
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Like a quick Arthur, I don't want to miss the beginning.

403
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But, in court, the fortune when they rise in the house.

404
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Easy now.

405
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Let's go.

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm using the whole musical. I'm sick of these articles and barriers between the musical and the drama.

407
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Well, then you certainly don't need me.

408
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes, we do, because you can be greater than you ever were.

409
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We are going to make her explode on the fear to seem like a skyrocket,

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
not just in the old tray barf with the top hat diet tails, but a great asset to the degree of his power.

411
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Then you've told me a hundred.

412
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm not kidding.

413
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Don't you?

414
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I know that.

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Everything's going to work out.

416
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Shh.

417
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, what do you think I am? What do you think they are?

418
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What do you think they're the other? Is it all entertainment?

419
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Believe me.

420
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There is no difference between the magic rhythms of Bill Robinson's immortal feet you said before.

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
All right, all right.

422
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, what did Bill Robinson do? He doubts him the stairs, didn't he?

423
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Now, I happened to play either, but the King of the same stairs was the difference when all the ideas were.

424
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Show me the laws, let those comic and burn, let's deny, show you, let's entertain her.

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We're all, and uh...

426
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Aah!

427
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Look at this song.

428
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Everything that happens in life can happen in a show.

429
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You can make a laugh, you can make a cry, anything, anything can go.

430
00:28:37,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

431
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Once MedUSHED And the H ASAP smiteenerrrrah

432
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's go!

433
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah!

434
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's go!

435
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah!

436
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:56,000
They could see me now, that little king of mine.

437
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Ohhhhhh!

438
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm looking at your smile and it's a healthy sign.

439
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'd like the stumble bones to see for a friend.

440
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The kind of tough, poor, first free,

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm going to show you how you do it.

442
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I can't believe that.

443
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I told you when we get out of here.

444
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That crazy.

445
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
All I can say is, wow, just look at where I am.

446
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Tonight I landed in pop, right in my car, love jam.

447
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What I said, I'm the only gal.

448
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll never believe it if my friends could save me.

449
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, fuck!

450
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
God, this is me.

451
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Susan, this is our family now, won't it?

452
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
If they could see me now, that little dusty group.

453
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Chicks around this million dollar to give to a Roman elbow

454
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and the cream of the prop to ever send their ain't no one at the time.

455
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm going to think the same as that,

456
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
which I must say is,

457
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
each to pick an unknown gal,

458
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
which I'll look down at me,

459
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but I'll still go well,

460
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
calling gal, no, never believe it if my friends could save me,

461
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
if my friends could save me,

462
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
if they all could go to jail.

463
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh!

464
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Get the fuck off!

465
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No!

466
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
No!

467
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No!

468
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's all.

469
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's the bottom of the left.

470
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I want to play games on my watch, Arthur.

471
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Who weeks is all of you?

472
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh!

473
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Julia, stay.

474
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:41,000
MUSIC

475
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Take my hand

476
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Stay here, my friend.

477
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll find my way back to you.

478
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Here and all, I know somehow

479
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
we tell a story that's true.

480
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
In our minds, we'd be just fine

481
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
if it were only us two.

482
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There might say that we're crazy,

483
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but I'm just still alive with you.

484
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
There's my guy.

485
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm in a row right here.

486
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah.

487
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
One of the cards let me in.

488
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'd do anything for you,

489
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but we don't have a lot of time.

490
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Come here.

491
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Come here.

492
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Can you get up?

493
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Come into the light.

494
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
They're sending me home.

495
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Why?

496
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
They're saying you're a bad influence on me.

497
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Good.

498
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This is going to be good for us.

499
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Now I can be at your trial every day.

500
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I can see you every day until you get up.

501
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
No, no, no.

502
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm not.

503
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm not.

504
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We're going to build a map.

505
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Wait a minute.

506
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You're perfect.

507
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I want to see the room.

508
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm not.

509
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Look what they did here.

510
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's just us now.

511
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You need to start taking your medication.

512
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm over to you.

513
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm over here.

514
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Keep going.

515
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Here.

516
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm over here.

517
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
What are you going to ask me about?

518
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Besides, no.

519
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Hopefully about your life and your conditions are really like in this place.

520
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'd ask you about me.

521
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
She's been out there giving a lot of interviews about you and about herself.

522
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Good.

523
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I love her.

524
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
She gets me.

525
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Arthur, this is a chance for you to show a different side.

526
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Show a different side of yourself.

527
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The public can see who you really are.

528
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I don't think you should smoke.

529
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think it makes you a cavalier.

530
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
We need to use this time to show people that you're human.

531
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
They need to understand you are sick, delusional.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You're not joker or girth or fleck.

533
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hmm?

534
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't worry.

535
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You're going to be great.

536
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Arthur!

537
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Are you okay?

538
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's not too late to cancel.

539
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So, uh, you want me to call you Arthur or the joker?

540
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Mr. Myers, you know we have an agreement you can't call him joker, it's Arthur.

541
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Arthur, fleck.

542
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Are you ready, buddy?

543
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
She has to leave now.

544
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You can watch from behind the glass, but you can't be in here.

545
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Brain's up.

546
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, Patty, um...

547
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I was going through a lot back then.

548
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Um, I don't really remember much from that night.

549
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Uh, blacked out, saw bright lights.

550
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I was having a hard time knowing the difference between what was real or not.

551
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, please?

552
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You did it on live TV pal.

553
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It wasn't getting any more real than that.

554
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
How do you all remember from that night is I was going to kill myself on television.

555
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I thought Murray was playing a part in my show, but he was a bad actor.

556
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So he got what he deserved.

557
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The last joke, if we can call it a joke.

558
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You get what you bleeping deserve, that's what you said.

559
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That's not funny, that's not funny.

560
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You're right, I thought it's a little better one.

561
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You're trying to be funny now?

562
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.

563
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Do you deserve to die?

564
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The DA is calling for the death penalty.

565
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You just said that you wanted to kill yourself on TV, so tell us.

566
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You still want to die?

567
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Well, at the time it certainly could have had these dreams for a little bit.

568
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Um, but that's not me anymore.

569
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That's not...

570
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's not who I am?

571
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That wasn't really you.

572
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
No, that's not...

573
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's funny, that's straight.

574
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's not what I'm saying.

575
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Your defense is...

576
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It was the Joker who did it.

577
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
An insanity.

578
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Okay, I don't know what other defense...

579
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
This alternate personality, this killer clown in you killed Murray.

580
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Who am I speaking to now?

581
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Which one of you is here?

582
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The poor, low IQ author Fleck, or the Joker who go to the bunch of no-bit punks?

583
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Do you really care?

584
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You don't.

585
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You just like Murray, you just like everyone.

586
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You just...

587
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You want sensationalism, you don't care about...

588
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You just want something about my mistakes, and what's about the things that I did in the past,

589
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
what about who I am now?

590
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Not how I'm different now.

591
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That's what we should be talking about, Patty.

592
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay, okay.

593
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We should take a break.

594
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We're not taking a break.

595
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Come on.

596
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, so...

597
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Tell us.

598
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
What's changed, Arthur?

599
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'll tell you what's changed, Patty.

600
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm not alone anymore.

601
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Right.

602
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The girl who was singing, the night you tried to escape.

603
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I wanted to try to escape.

604
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Miss Harley Quenzel.

605
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You two put on quite a performance that time.

606
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh...

607
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
She didn't really sign through, isn't she?

608
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You told me.

609
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I mean, don't you think it's all...

610
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't think it's a little too much.

611
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
A little much.

612
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
She's a fool, and I won't hide in her head.

613
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But a fool can have her trust.

614
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm in love, and don't ask her with.

615
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I thought they'd been on.

616
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Those the same old sad sensation.

617
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Really, I've not slept a wink.

618
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Since this half-punt.

619
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:18,000
In the torsion, put me on the blink.

620
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm wild again.

621
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Be wild again.

622
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
A semperine when we're in,

623
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
child again.

624
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
He wished...

625
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Father, and be wilder.

626
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Have I?

627
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That's my heart, but what of it?

628
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
She is cool.

629
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I agree.

630
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
She can love, and I love it.

631
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, wrong, wrong love, song.

632
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'll sing to her.

633
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Things spring to her.

634
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And long for the day,

635
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that I cling to her.

636
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Be wild.

637
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'll ever have you well knew.

638
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Hey!

639
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You're not mine.

640
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We'll be back with more of Arthur Fleck.

641
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And from what was was her son?

642
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The murder trial of Arthur Fleck will begin today.

643
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Assistant DA Harvey Dent is preparing his opening remarks

644
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
in what some are calling the trial of the century.

645
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And once the protests, please will be on high alert,

646
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
to closing surrounding streets and setting up barricades for crowds that can reach in the thousands.

647
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And be asking me, this is what you can when there's a complete breakdown in social services,

648
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and don't get me started on this media frenzy.

649
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
All right, Denise, you're on the air.

650
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Thank you for taking my call.

651
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Enough is enough.

652
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This idiot doesn't deserve a trial.

653
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
He should be sent straight to the chair.

654
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
An example should be made out of.

655
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And we have a problem with you, too.

656
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Good evening.

657
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Home?

658
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But away from her.

659
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh

660
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh

661
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh

662
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh

663
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Listen

664
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Okay

665
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There is

666
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Hey, shut the fuck up

667
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I

668
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Court is now in session the honorable judge Herman Rothwax is decided

669
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Morning ladies and gentlemen, please be seated

670
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
William please invite the jury in

671
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Are you all right mr. Flack

672
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Everything okay? Here's your majesty. I'm just looking for someone

673
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Please mr. Flack sit down I

674
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Realize there's a lot going on

675
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But this is still a court of law

676
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Any and all outbursts will not be tolerated and applies to everyone in this courtroom

677
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Cindy please call the case the people of the state of New York versus Arthur Flick case number GC

678
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Oh

679
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Walling down

680
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
actor

681
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Where the hell would this mean?

682
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's entertainment

683
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
The lights on the lady and ties on the bride

684
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
With the guy on the side or the fold

685
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Where she gives it a role

686
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It's my view that there is absolutely no evidence that Arthur Fleck suffers from multiple personality disorder

687
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Or that he ever behaved in the role of joker as a separate personality dissociated from himself

688
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Doctor? In your opinion, concerning the work he did on this case

689
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers from a mental disease or defect?

690
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,000
No. In my opinion, he's not psychotic or unable to test reality

691
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think he was sane when you committed these crimes

692
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
In fact, I believe he fakes his mental illness

693
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Why?

694
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And if he's, uh, faking it, as you say

695
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Then what is your opinion on the defendant's mental condition?

696
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I believe he has four relatively minor and quite common mental disorders that involve long standing sadness

697
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Narcissistic self-centeredness, friendlessness

698
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And indifference to the feelings of others

699
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
This is a very disturbed individual

700
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But I can't give you any kind of psychiatric defense

701
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
For you. Thank you, Dr. Love

702
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Nothing further, Your Honor

703
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Your witness, Ms. Stewart?

704
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Dr. Lou, good morning

705
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Good morning

706
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
How long did you interview Arthur Fleck for?

707
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
About two hours

708
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
About two hours

709
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's actually 89 minutes

710
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Tell me, how can you say for certain that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

711
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:10,000
How can you be so sure after just 89 minutes that this joker isn't a distinctly separate and split personality from him?

712
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That that's not who he is

713
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Well, I also reviewed all the test results, psychological tests, neurological and medical tests

714
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And in my view, it's just a performance

715
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Did you read the records from the Department of Social Services

716
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That show that when Arthur was seven years old, they returned him to his abuser's home

717
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
His mother's home

718
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I did, yes

719
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And when you interviewed him for 89 minutes

720
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Did you ask him why social services didn't believe the horrific stories a seven year old boy told him about the physical and sexual of abuse he suffered?

721
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah

722
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Applause

723
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Applause

724
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Applause

725
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Applause

726
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Applause

727
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Yeah

728
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Applause

729
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Applause

730
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
No, I didn't ask him about that

731
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So you want us to believe that after spending just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck and reading through his records and tests from the same government agencies that abandoned him

732
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You want us to believe that you can say with absolute certainty that Arthur doesn't suffer from any serious mental illness

733
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That he didn't need to retreat into fantasy and create another identity to protect that scared, vulnerable

734
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Seven year old boy from all the trauma and abuse he suffered

735
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And that that identity didn't come out again

736
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
When he was attacked and tormented by three drunk bullies on the subway

737
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Applause

738
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
After I woke up this morning, I thought, Murray, Murray, Murray

739
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And then there's Murray, funny, right?

740
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Then I remember Sophie, I had enough of it

741
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Your Honor, again, my client's personal diary is privileged

742
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Overroaled, again, as long as Mrs. Kane limits her comments to Mr. Fleck's personal private jokes to remember my quiet

743
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
These are your words, she's reading

744
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And it's up to the jury to determine what to make of them

745
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Please proceed

746
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Mrs. Kane, please continue reading from the highlighted portion

747
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Then I remember Sophie had another dream about her, forgot it

748
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I almost never dreamed, what do I got to do to remember?

749
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That's Sophie Dumont, Mr. Fleck's neighbor whom he was obsessed with

750
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
What was that date? November 17

751
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Well, the record show, November 17th is the date of Mr. Fleck stabbed Randall Kleinman Hoffer to death

752
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
The very same day that he shot and killed Murray Frank

753
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Now, I know it's not your area of expertise, but you have read all of Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?

754
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yes, I have

755
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And, in your opinion, does this sound like a different voice?

756
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Like a different personality, wrote this?

757
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No, it sounds like Arthur

758
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Go on

759
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
He often wrote about his fantasies

760
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And the women he had imaginary relationships with

761
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And of course his jokes

762
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There are always a lot of these unfunny jokes

763
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
There's justice, so I don't think she's even qualified to do that

764
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You know, you're making him out to be a fucking idiot in there

765
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
He's never gonna get out if he keep this shit up

766
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Ask her why she has me sitting so far away from him

767
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Let's not do this here

768
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Do you see all those people out front?

769
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Who do you think they're here for?

770
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
How many T-shirts is Arthur Glenn on?

771
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
How many signs?

772
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's the tale of the century and she doesn't even know who her own client is

773
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Can you see how sick he is?

774
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
How much help he needs?

775
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
He's not sick

776
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
He's perfect

777
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You don't really think he's just gonna walk out of here, do you?

778
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, he's gonna walk right out of here

779
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
With me by his side

780
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And they want

781
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And then we're gonna build him out

782
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
A what?

783
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And a little help

784
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
What does that mean?

785
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You're not listening

786
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We can win in this case

787
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And she's gonna fuck it all up

788
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
No, you're not listening

789
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Please look now for me

790
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
She had a chance what I've been through

791
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What are you talking about?

792
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
We're from the same neighborhood

793
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
She lost her father, you know

794
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Her mom was awful to her

795
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
She had a commitment

796
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So just give her a break

797
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Okay, leave care of us about you, sure

798
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I know

799
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
She didn't grow up in your neighborhood

800
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
She lives on the Upper West Side with her parents

801
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Her father is not dead

802
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
He's a doctor

803
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
She voluntarily committed herself to the hospital

804
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And then just checked herself out

805
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
When she wanted to

806
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
She didn't check herself out

807
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Arthur

808
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I was a bad influence on her, so they separated us

809
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Did she mention she went to grad school for psychiatry?

810
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You wouldn't get it

811
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
My point is

812
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
She's playing you for a fool

813
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm sorry, I just

814
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I know what it's like to love somebody

815
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But I don't think he can believe a word she says

816
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
From MTV Studios

817
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's the

818
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's the

819
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The

820
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
The

821
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
There's a light

822
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I'm turning on a light

823
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
There's never a shot on me

824
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
All of the holes I've to be

825
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Living with you

826
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Living with you

827
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
There's a way

828
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Everybody says

829
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
To do each and every little thing

830
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
What the dust brings

831
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
If I ain't got you

832
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
If I ain't got you

833
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Oh you don't know what it's like

834
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Baby you don't know what it's like

835
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
To love somebody

836
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
To love somebody

837
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The way I love you

838
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Baby baby baby baby baby

839
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
You don't know what it's like

840
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Baby you don't know what

841
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
What happened?

842
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Well you weren't even looking at me anymore

843
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You were making it all about yourself

844
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And the song is about loving me

845
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Now look who's making it all about themselves

846
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So you're saying it's not about us?

847
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
It is

848
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But we're singing for them

849
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That's why we're here honey

850
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
As I got the speech suspicion

851
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That we're not giving the people what they want

852
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's okay baby

853
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You're right

854
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Let's give the people what they want

855
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Use it

856
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Let's take a moment to

857
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
As the honeymoon over

858
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
First night

859
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Everything went back

860
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
If you knew what it is

861
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Just talk to me

862
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's chiels

863
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I can't look for anything

864
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm in the back

865
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I've always Braised

866
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You don't know what to do

867
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
�

868
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Just though

869
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Pause

870
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Okay

871
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Look

872
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I love you.

873
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
A couple of weeks back on TV and already acting like you're on the joint.

874
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
What the fuck are you two doing sitting on our bleachers?

875
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
We said they're your bleachers.

876
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Rippy, what the fuck has gotten it to you?

877
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You heard me.

878
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Up.

879
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Just so I just saw you in front.

880
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
A little lady friend.

881
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I'm not a lady.

882
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm a lady.

883
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm a lady.

884
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm a lady.

885
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm a lady.

886
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm a lady.

887
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
A little lady friend.

888
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
All right, enough. Get up, both of you.

889
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
In fact, get a visit.

890
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
You're acting like I tell you.

891
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Moving.

892
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Every day of the casual.

893
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You're a fucking wack job, flack.

894
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm a wack job.

895
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'm a wack job.

896
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm a wack job.

897
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm a wack job.

898
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'm a wack job.

899
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm a wack job.

900
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hey.

901
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Five minutes.

902
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
How you holding up?

903
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Everything okay?

904
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Did you, did you hide in me?

905
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Sure.

906
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I mean, everybody lies a little.

907
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I'm a wack job.

908
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I mean, everybody lies a little.

909
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Maybe not from the same neighborhood as me.

910
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Dad's a doctor.

911
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You rich?

912
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I just wanted you to like me.

913
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You really checked yourself in here?

914
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yeah.

915
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That's crazy.

916
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Just because you wanted to meet me?

917
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Just to meet you.

918
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And you could just really let her.

919
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Then said what? I'm nobody.

920
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I've been done anything with my life like you have.

921
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You really watched that TV movie made about me 20 times?

922
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Probably more like four or five.

923
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It wasn't actually good or do you lie about that too?

924
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It was great.

925
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
My lawyer says you're playing me for a four.

926
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You're in a four.

927
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Can't you say what she's doing?

928
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
They're laughing at you in there.

929
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
She doesn't care about you.

930
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I do.

931
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Do you know I moved into your old apartment building to make us a home for when you get up?

932
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Did you learn to tell you that?

933
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You did?

934
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I don't want to live there.

935
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I'm pregnant.

936
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
What?

937
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Why do birds suddenly appear?

938
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Every time you are near.

939
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Just like me.

940
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:27,000
They love to be close to you.

941
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Why do stars fall down from the sky?

942
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Every time you walk by.

943
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Just like me.

944
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,000
They long to be close to you.

945
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:04,000
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to make a dream come true.

946
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So they sprinkled mondust in your hair, cold and starlight in your eyes of moon.

947
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

948
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Just like me.

949
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,000
They long to be close to you.

950
01:09:46,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Just like me.

951
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:25,000
They long to be close to you.

952
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Did you think he was going to hurt you or your daughter?

953
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I did.

954
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Yes.

955
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You believe he was dangerous?

956
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
He broke into my apartment.

957
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You call it police?

958
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No.

959
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:57,000
His mother told me that he had problems his whole life, but that he wouldn't hurt a fly.

960
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And was the man who broke into your apartment that night?

961
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Was he different in any way from the Arthur Fleck you and you?

962
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I didn't really know him.

963
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I saw him in the lobby, the elevator a few times.

964
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Like I said, I knew his mother a little bit. She was really sweet to my daughter.

965
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I missed your mond. Why is it that you didn't want to come here and testify today?

966
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Why did you initially ignore our subpoenas?

967
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Well, after Arthur did what he did, the press wanted to talk to me about it.

968
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And then I was a character in that awful TV movie they made.

969
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And then all these people, some foreigners I guess, like the people outside started showing up at my work.

970
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And harassing me, blaming me for what happened to Arthur.

971
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So I was afraid for my safety, for my daughter's safety, we moved out of the city.

972
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Well, then why did you finally decide to comply?

973
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I should have called the police that night.

974
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Then maybe all those people wouldn't have been.

975
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Maybe they wouldn't be dead now if I did.

976
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Thank you. No more questions?

977
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Your witness, Miss Stewart.

978
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Miss Duman, what happened after you asked Arthur to leave your apartment bed?

979
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
He told me he was having a bad day. The name he left.

980
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So, he never heard or even threatened your daughter?

981
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,000
No. And did you watch him on TV on Marie Franklin the following week?

982
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
He did.

983
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And did that seem like the same man who was sitting in your apartment that night?

984
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Did he sound the same or even look the same?

985
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
No, I mean, he was wearing clown makeup.

986
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And while Arthur's mother was being so sweet to your daughter,

987
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
what was she telling you about her own son?

988
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
She told me that there was something wrong with Arthur, and that he lived in a fantasy world and that he had this laugh.

989
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
She told you it was a dumb laugh.

990
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
That's what she called it. His dumb laugh.

991
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes.

992
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
What else did she tell you?

993
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:51,000
That she made up a story when he was a kid, so that he would feel better about it.

994
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
So that he would stop crying so that he wouldn't kill himself.

995
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:01,000
What was the story that he was put on this earth to bring joy?

996
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Something like that. So I should call him happy.

997
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And she couldn't believe that he faced his whole life around this made up story.

998
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
He was a straight clown and he wanted to be comedian.

999
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
She made fun of him for doing that.

1000
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
She just thought it was ridiculous that he thought he'd make people laugh.

1001
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And she said Arthur was funny at all.

1002
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But she told you that he had been giving out a test to teach us all about it.

1003
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's always the token.

1004
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:51,000
In her pack, there's always a lonely cloud.

1005
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,000
The poor laughing through the folds on his back.

1006
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And everyone laughs when he's down.

1007
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
There's always the fun about him again.

1008
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
But he's only funny by mistake.

1009
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
And everyone looks at him.

1010
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Just the same.

1011
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They don't see his lonely heartbreak.

1012
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:48,000
They don't care as long as they're just a fool.

1013
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
As foolish as he can be.

1014
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
There's always a joke about that's the rule.

1015
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But fate feels better than I seem.

1016
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The joke for me.

1017
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:26,000
They don't care as long as they're just a fool.

1018
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
As foolish as he can be.

1019
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
There's always a joke about that's the rule.

1020
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
But fate feels better than I seem.

1021
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
The joke for me.

1022
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
The joke for me.

1023
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The joke for me.

1024
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
The joke for me.

1025
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
The joke for me.

1026
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
As me.

1027
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah.

1028
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
That he had never had a girlfriend.

1029
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And he thought he was probably his first ever.

1030
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I can't do this anymore.

1031
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Don't you want to be a pooch eventually?

1032
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
No, you may not.

1033
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I want to borrow my lawyer.

1034
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Excuse me.

1035
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I'd like to represent myself.

1036
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You're fired.

1037
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Arson, let me do this.

1038
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
This is fail.

1039
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
You don't even believe in fail.

1040
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

1041
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
David.

1042
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
David.

1043
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
David.

1045
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
David.

1046
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

1047
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

1048
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm sorry.

1049
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I'm sorry.

1050
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

1051
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I'm sorry.

1052
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

1053
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I'm sorry.

1054
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
David.

1055
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's great.

1056
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Thank you.

1057
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Hey, go touchy.

1058
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1059
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:39,000
You should see it out there. They're all going crazy for you.

1060
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You did it.

1061
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I know. We've asked you to read a walk or something.

1062
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
You know I never went to a first school.

1063
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I said no touching.

1064
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You can do anything you want. You're Joker.

1065
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You're a good guy.

1066
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Good evening. It's 40 degrees at 6 o'clock on this Wednesday, November 8.

1067
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm Stan L. Brooks and here's what's happening.

1068
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Chocking developments at the trial of Arthur Fleck downtown today.

1069
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Fleck the accused killer, also known as Joker, interrupted testimony

1070
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
in the court.

1071
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Then he kissed her goodbye.

1072
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Afterward Fleck was extensively questioned by Judge Herman Rothwax.

1073
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
The right of self representation is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom.

1074
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You can hear all your emotions, Mr. Fleck.

1075
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Judge Rothwax reluctantly approved Fleck's request to represent himself.

1076
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
As long as he agreed to stand by counsel, a decision that both Fleck's now

1077
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and his report and assistant DA Harvey Dent disagree with.

1078
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It's really tragic. Arthur believes he has all of these supporters, but they don't care about him.

1079
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They care about Joker.

1080
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
He is not dealing with reality. He's mentally ill.

1081
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It just convinced him it got him, but would have won this case.

1082
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Fleck knows what he's doing. He knows he's losing.

1083
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
We can't look at it.

1084
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
He's a kid.

1085
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
It's almost like Arthur's flying.

1086
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
He has a little bit of a try on the most of the month, but he's weird.

1087
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Very weird.

1088
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Hey, sit down.

1089
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Sit down.

1090
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1091
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1092
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1093
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.

1094
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.

1095
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.

1096
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I'm gonna have to get in a hot, win the same thing.

1097
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I'm gonna have to get out.

1098
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Get out.

1099
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
All right, so's over.

1100
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Hell, no.

1101
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And the same thing for our game.

1102
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
One, two, three.

1103
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So far, it's the same.

1104
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
One, two, three.

1105
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
One, two, three.

1106
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Oh, my God, the same thing for our game.

1107
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And the same.

1108
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
One, two, three.

1109
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
No, no, no, no.

1110
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
No, no, no, no.

1111
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1112
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
No, no, no.

1113
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:23,000
After reviewing all the case law that offers precedent, Jensen versus Superior Court being

1114
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:30,000
the most relevant, I've reluctantly decided that Mr. Fleck does have the right as an

1115
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,000
attorney to dress himself how he likes as long as he doesn't cause disorder or

1116
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:42,000
interfere with the functioning of the court. I will not allow this proceeding to become

1117
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
as unruly as it is outside and I will not let you turn this into any more of a

1118
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:57,000
circus than you already have. Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

1119
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
The state calls Gary Puddles.

1120
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Beleth, you please escort Mr. Puddles to the stat.

1121
01:23:38,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Please raise your right hand. You solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give

1122
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
is the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help you God.

1123
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Good morning Mr. Puddles. Thank you for being here.

1124
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It's one last question sir. The person who you saw stabbed Randall Kleinman Hoffer to death.

1125
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Are they in this courtroom here today? Yes.

1126
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Can you point them out to all of us and describe this clothing?

1127
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You said right there at the table wearing a red suit and clown makeup.

1128
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:53,000
May the record reflect the identification of the accused, Your Honor.

1129
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Yes it will. Nothing further, Your Honor.

1130
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Your witness Mr. Flack.

1131
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Mr. Puddles. Gary Puddles?

1132
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Tell me sir, is that your God given name?

1133
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yes.

1134
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Hey, Billy, your last name is Puddles.

1135
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Why sounds like a joke.

1136
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Well it's not.

1137
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
You expect us to believe that your last name is Puddles. Puddles?

1138
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Mr. Flack, where is this going?

1139
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
As I said, I'm not going to let you turn my courtroom into a circus.

1140
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Okay, but with all the respect your holding on, you think it's a little late?

1141
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Don't try my patience.

1142
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Mr. Puddles.

1143
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:15,000
This afternoon you testified that you saw me stab Mr. Kleinmanman Hoff in the neck a couple of tops. Correct?

1144
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Kleinman Hoff, yes, I saw you.

1145
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Mm, and what else did you see that day?

1146
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You're stabbing him in the eye and blessing his head into the wall many, many times.

1147
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yes, but Randall was a bit of a bully wasn't he?

1148
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Didn't this end, Don?

1149
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
No.

1150
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Never mind.

1151
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Gary, did you catch my ass on the lorry-freitling show later that time?

1152
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
No, I didn't.

1153
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
No?

1154
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
But I remind you that you were under oath.

1155
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I was locked up at the police station in an interview room.

1156
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So I thought you might come and kill me.

1157
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I was there, they went there, they kept me there all night.

1158
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Isn't that cone beaming, Mr. Puddles?

1159
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
You didn't see the show?

1160
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
You didn't see anything?

1161
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I had to say, I can't believe it.

1162
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Mr. Fleck, okay.

1163
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
When you were in my mama's apartment, God rest your soul.

1164
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:40,000
When as you say you saw me, bass Mr. Kleinman, whatever's heading to the wall many, many times,

1165
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
did I seem crazy to you?

1166
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Did I seem like a different person or was I the same old joker that I own?

1167
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Oh, so don't do this to yourself, it isn't you.

1168
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It isn't me.

1169
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So you don't think this is me?

1170
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Or maybe, maybe it can really was.

1171
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But I'm inside of it.

1172
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So maybe you want a million, maybe no one was.

1173
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Because nobody knew I existed.

1174
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,000
But look around, look at all these people, everyone outside, these cameras.

1175
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Who do you think they see, Mr. Puddles?

1176
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Joker.

1177
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Oh, sweet child, what you are proving here today is that you are no different than any of those people that underestimated me.

1178
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:53,000
From Murray Franklin to those goddamn fat stupid girls in awesome, I think that they could treat me like trash.

1179
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But I will no longer allow you or you or you or any of you to keep me down.

1180
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I am free!

1181
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Why are you doing this to me, Arthur?

1182
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
What?

1183
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Gary, I like you.

1184
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I told you I wouldn't hurt you and I didn't.

1185
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Not hurt me.

1186
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I couldn't go back to work.

1187
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I still can't sleep.

1188
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I'm scared all the time.

1189
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I never used to be scared.

1190
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I'm scared right now, here.

1191
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
It's you in front of me.

1192
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I couldn't do anything that day.

1193
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I felt so small.

1194
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It was reminding me how powerless I really am.

1195
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Oh, you got a flare for the dramatic.

1196
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
You're tugging at my heartstrings, little Gary.

1197
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
No more questions, Harlan?

1198
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Do you know what that feels like, Arthur?

1199
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,000
You were the only one at work who never made fun of me.

1200
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
You were the only one who was nice to me.

1201
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I said, no more questions, Harlan.

1202
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Very well, Mr. Post.

1203
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I never thanked you for your testimony.

1204
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Please step down, you're excused.

1205
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Mr. Dent, call your next witness.

1206
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
We're not calling anymore witnesses, your Honor.

1207
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
That is the state's case.

1208
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
The state rest.

1209
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Very well.

1210
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
All right, Mr. Fleck.

1211
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:05,000
At this point, you may mount your defense.

1212
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
The defense rest is very, Your Honor.

1213
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Are you?

1214
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Mr. Fleck, you don't want to put on any defense.

1215
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
No, Your Honor, the defense rest.

1216
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
No, no, no, no, no. That's all, folks.

1217
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
All right, all right.

1218
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
All right.

1219
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's enough. This is the court of law.

1220
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Both sides having rested.

1221
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
This court will recess until tomorrow morning at 9.30.

1222
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Man, I'm too short of it.

1223
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
What about the idiot?

1224
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
You're gonna fight with your myself.

1225
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
They gotta stop it?

1226
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
No, they don't get down everywhere!

1227
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And they'll stop it here once a year?

1228
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
They got in there, right back?

1229
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
They don't get down away.

1230
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That's enough.

1231
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
It's really when they chain up your defense.

1232
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
What's with this role?

1233
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Be careful, you just don't get up there.

1234
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
No, I want to increase the force faster.

1235
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I want to make a difference.

1236
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Now, for six.

1237
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You press the cover.

1238
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Well, you know that every stop DNA is going to Mauiplier now.

1239
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
We're gonna move forward.

1240
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:19,000
They start, oh, I will

1241
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Gonna build a mountain

1242
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Gonna build a night

1243
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I don't know how we're gonna do it

1244
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Only know I could not try

1245
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Gonna build a so heavy

1246
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
From a little hell

1247
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Gonna build a so heavy

1248
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And I know long way out

1249
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And it comes in that mountain

1250
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1251
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'll take you up the mountain

1252
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And have you been waiting for them?

1253
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Gonna build a mountain

1254
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000

1325
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000

1326
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000

Let's go

1329
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
At the goal we have big shot on TV

1330
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
We need not to sell that

1331
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Stand him up

1332
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Alright

1333
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:19,000
You want your joke right?

1334
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You really think

1335
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I'm not gonna dance in that suit

1336
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I'm not gonna hear face makes you panicking

1337
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
You have no fucking idea

1338
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
What it takes

1339
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
But a little bit of joy into this fucking place

1340
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Let me tell you what I used to do about my mother

1341
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You could drop the act

1342
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Because we know it's only after the day

1343
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Okay

1344
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It's only to be some guys

1345
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yes, alright

1346
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And I asked her

1347
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I said mom

1348
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Why are you just playing with your abusive boyfriend

1349
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And she said

1350
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
He's not on a beat

1351
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I told you that right man

1352
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
He's almost on your own

1353
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I'm gonna try to get off of her by the joke first

1354
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Let's go there, go

1355
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Get up, get up

1356
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Get up, get up

Get up, get up

1361
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Get up, get up

1362
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Get up, get up

1363
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Fuck off

1364
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Okay, let's fucking ride

1365
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Get up, get up

1366
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Get up, get up

1367
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Get up, get up

1368
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000

You're business, fuck off

01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
What'd you do to him?

1371
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Let the fuck off, Ricky

1372
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Thanks for coming, Jackie

1373
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
This guy's coming

1375
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000

1389
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm not getting asked for you

1390
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Are they talking now?

1391
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
He's up?

1392
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I'm going to go

1393
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Can't break out of the shot

Fuck off

01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That's a ticket

1398
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
He's up

1399
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Hey

1400
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000

What's going on?

1411
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
How are you?

1412
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Docy

1413
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Hoo

1414
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Doesak

1415
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
thin

1416
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I've got the world on a stream, said no in a rainbow,

1417
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:29,000
thought that string around my finger,

1418
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:38,000
what a world, what a life I'm in love.

1419
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I've got a song that I sing, I can make the rainbow,

1420
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:58,000
anytime I move my finger, lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?

1421
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold that string,

1422
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I'd be a silly, so I'm sore, if I should ever let it go.

1423
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I've got the world on a stream, in love, said no in a rainbow,

1424
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:38,000
thought that string around my finger, what a world.

1425
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Yeah, there ain't no other girl that I need.

1426
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Roll, roll, roll, roll, light, hey, now I'm falling down.

1427
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Mr. Plight, your closing statement.

1428
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:35,000
A word of caution, this is not a comedy club, you are not on stage.

1429
01:42:35,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Excuse me.

1430
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:21,000
You need a short recess, sir.

1431
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I'm not on stage, I'm not on stage, I'm not on stage,

1432
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I can't do this anymore, because I can't be, are you want me to be?

1433
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:05,000
It was all just a fantasy.

1434
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:18,000
There is no joke of it, it's just me.

1435
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I killed six people, I wish I didn't, but I did.

1436
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Nobody knows, but I also killed my mother, but I'm tall over her face, and smother her dead.

1437
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I just want to blow it all up, and start a new life.

1438
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Not, not, who's there?

1439
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
What the fuck?

1440
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
All right, there's a fuck, who?

1441
01:45:48,000 --> 01:46:05,000
He is probably leaving left to death a beam, and left your reporter, and which case you can just fuck off. Thanks.

1442
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Hi, it's me, Arthur.

1443
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:22,000
The jury's already come back with a verdict, to about less than an hour, so, you know,

1444
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I didn't let me call you to see if you'd come back, because I want you here.

1445
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And then we need to go.

1446
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:58,000
If you go away from a sunny day, and you might as well take us on away, all the birds that flew, and the bright blue sky,

1447
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:12,000
when our love was new, and our hearts were bright, and the day was young, and then I was long,

1448
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:19,000
and I'm a little bit stressed still, but the night bright's on.

1449
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:39,000
If you go away, but if you stay, I'll make you a day like no day has been, or we'll be again, or out of the rain,

1450
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:53,000
we'll sail on your touch, I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much, and if you go, go I won't cry,

1451
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:14,000
all the good is gone, and the world could find you away, and get the power of going.

1452
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And so we will now take as we wait to hear the word and do a trial of our peace, and I think it will be the first time.

1453
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:39,000
If you go away, as I know you are, there'll be nothing left, and the world will all be lost, just to empty,

1454
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:51,000
all of these days, at the empty home, I'll sail on your face,

1455
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I'll live in the shadow of your dark, I'll talk it, I'll get me, not inside.

1456
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Go away.

1457
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:23,000
As a reminder, regardless of the verdict, I will not tolerate any outbursts of any kind.

1458
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
For a person, you may begin.

1459
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:38,000
In the matter of the people of the state of New York versus author flick, case number GC07193.

1460
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:51,000
As to count one, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the first degree against Maurice Franklin, so say we all.

1461
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:04,000
As to count two, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the second degree against Randall Klimann Hopper, so say we all.

1462
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:17,000
As to count three, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the second degree against Randall Klimann Hopper, so say we all.

1463
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Go away.

1464
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Stand down.

1465
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Hey, let's get them out of here.

1466
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Need it.

1467
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Need it.

Need it.

Need it.

1478
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Need it.

1479
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Need it.

1480
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Need it.

1481
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Need it.

1482
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Need it.

1483
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Need it.

1484
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Need it.

1485
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Need it.

1486
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Need it.

1487
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Need it.

1488
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Need it.

1489
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Need it.

1490
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Need it.

1491
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Need it.

1492
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Need it.

1493
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Need it.

1494
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Need it.

1495
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Need it.

1496
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Need it.

1497
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Need it.

1498
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Need it.

1499
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Need it.

1500
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Need it.

1501
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Need it.

1502
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Con

1503
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Where's the body of your ass?

1504
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Hey, get down!

1505
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Stay down!

1506
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Get down, dude!

1507
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Down the fucking ass!

1508
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Try it!

1509
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Stop!

1510
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Get down!

1511
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000

Get down!

1519
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
We have devastating news to report right now.

1520
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
A massive car bomb has gone off in downtown Gotham,

1521
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
exploding just outside the county courthouse.

1522
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Over thousands have turned out to hear the verdict of the Arthur Fleck trial.

1523
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Details are still coming in.

1524

01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Put around it!

1528
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It's red, it's okay!

1530
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000

1542
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Mark!

1543
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
No!

1544
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
We haven't got the ahead of you,

1545
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Sam!!

1546
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yeah this is the Ntimeur plays at home now the sale.

1547
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:37,000
cabin?

1548
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Okay, it's you.

1549
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:55,000
You got your hair.

1550
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Someone below the courthouse.

1551
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I'm free.

1552
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
We can go.

1553
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
You hear me?

1554
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Someone below the courthouse.

1555
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
We can go.

1556
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I escaped.

1557
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
We're not going away, Arthur.

1558
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,000
All we had was the fantasy, and you came up.

1559
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:45,000
We were never going anywhere.

1560
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Now that's what I'm going to fall in love with,

1561
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I'm going to see you by them, or are you friendly?

1562
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
No.

1563
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
No, you're not.

1564
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
There is no joker.

1565
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That's what you said, isn't it?

1566
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I can't.

1567
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I can't.

1568
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I can't.

1569
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I can't.

1570
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Please, we're having a baby.

1571
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:32,000
The show that is really shown, sounds you out.

1572
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I stop.

1573
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
With a kind of glow when you say,

1574
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
As you go on your way,

1575
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
That's entertainment.

1576
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I don't want to say anymore.

1577
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,000
A song that is winging along for this.

1578
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,000
With a touch of the minutes.

1579
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
That's not true.

1580
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
In all that we had dreamed,

1581
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:20,000
That's entertainment.

1582
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Goodbye, Arthur.

1583
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Don't you?

1584
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Is it not?

1585
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Come, my little bit of a brainer.

1586
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I will end you.

1587
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Don't you? Is it not?

1588
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Come, my little bit of a brainer.

1589
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I will end you.

1590
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Oh, I'm all going to do.

1591
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It is true.

1592
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Thank you.

1593
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Thank you.

1594
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Oh, my God.

1595
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I'm coming.

1596
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Nice shot, Arthur.

1597
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
What? Let's go.

1598
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
We got a visitor.

1599
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,000
No phone.

1600
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
No phone.

1601
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
No phone.

1602
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Let's go.

1603
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Hey, Arthur.

1604
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Hold up.

1605
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Can I tell you a joke I came up with?

1606
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Is it quick?

1607
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Yeah, I can make it quick.

1608
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:21,000
So, a psychopath walks into a bar and sees this famous clown sitting there, all alone.

1609
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

1610
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I can't believe you're here, he says.

1611
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
What a disappointment.

1612
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I used to watch you on TV.

1613
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
What can I get you?

1614
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
And this clown turns and says,

1615
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Well, if you're buying you can get me anything.

1616
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Perfect.

1617
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Psychopath says, how about I get you what you fucking deserve?

1618
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Stop!

1619
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
