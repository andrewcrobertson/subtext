Speed. I am speed.

[Cars whizzing past]

5
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,783
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,218
I eat losers for breakfast.

[Car accelerating]

8
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,955
Breakfast.

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,428
Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

10
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,229
[Cars whizzing]

11
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,665
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

12
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,330
I am lightning!

McQueen is in the wreckage.

39
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,804

can make it through!

41
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,787

by Lightning McQueen!

heads into the pits,

[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

53
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,754
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

54
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,888
He's not pitting!

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,920
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

McQueen's not going into the pits!

crew chief. The third this season!

- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

60
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,939
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

we're coming to the restart!

You need tires, you idiot!

[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

68
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,480
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,383
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

70
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,521
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,801
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

73

He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

79
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,219

Can he make it?

- You fool!
- [Grunts]

81

He's blown a tire!

- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]

84
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,672
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

86
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,111
Come on. [grunting]

87
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,581
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

88
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,518

is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

rounding turn four.

92

[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

93
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,168
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

94
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:16,970
Lightning!

95
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,907
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

96
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,277
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

97
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,312
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

[Slow motion drone]

100
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,592
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

101
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,928
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

102
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:42,620
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

103
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,431
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

104
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,400
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

105
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,134
Tell me about it!

106
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,303
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

107
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,207
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

108
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,411
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

109
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,680
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,615
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

111
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,218
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

112
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:05,885
What?

113
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,521
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

114
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,990
Live from Victory Lane,

115
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,926
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

116
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,295
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

117
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:19,766
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.  - What?  - Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

118
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:25,105
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

119
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,940
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

120
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,770
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

121
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:31,544
[Crowd laughs]

122
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,547
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

123
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,510
Whatever, I knew that.
 - Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

124
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,654
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

125
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,856
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,359
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

127
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,162
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

128
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,367
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

129
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,202
In your dreams, Thunder.

130
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,239
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

131
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,800
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

132
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,810
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

133
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,212
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

134
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,914
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

135
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,382
Right in the lens.

136
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,618
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

137
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,854
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

138
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,240
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

139
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,861
[revving] A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

140
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,896
Yes!

141
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,666
[Bob]... we have a three-way tie.

142
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,501
- [Crowd cheers]
- [Cameras flash]

143
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,775
[Chuckling] Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

144
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,545
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

145
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,682
[Bob] Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

146
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:47,253
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

147
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,690
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

148
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,294
[Whispering] Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

149
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,464
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

150
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,604
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

151
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,276
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

152
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,879
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

153
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,547
Huh?

154
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,319
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

155
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,855
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

156
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,257
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

157
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,559
Gotta make your personal appearance.

158
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,595
No. No! No, no, no, no!

159
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,164
Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.

160
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:35,335
And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

161
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,905
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.

162
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,641
Wow! Look at that shine!

163
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,679
Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!

164
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,113
Ka-chow!

165
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,949
[Both laughing]

166
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,419
I met this car from Swampscott.

167
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,455
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

168
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,258
- You could see his dirty undercarriage.
- [Crowd laughs]

169
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:02,862
[Groaning] I hate rusty cars.

00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,519
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

344
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:36,923
I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

345
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,893
[German accent] Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!

346
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,296
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?

347
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,134
[Groaning] Oh, boy.

348
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,836
Where am I?

349
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,572
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

350
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,676
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

351
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,450
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

352
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,248
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

353
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:07,153
- What's going on here?
- [Chuckling] You're funny.

354
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:10,230
I like you already. My name's Mater.

355
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,759
Mater?

356
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,595
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

357
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,732
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

358
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:19,532
Uh...

359
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:23,536
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

360
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,704
What?

361
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,142
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

362
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,711
Where are you? Shoot!

363
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,380
You're in Radiator Springs.

364
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,283
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

365
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,387
Oh, great. Just great!

366
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,157
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

367
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:48,361
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

368
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,297
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

369
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:53,967
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

370
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,803
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

371
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,338
- Cool!
- Mater!

372
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,174
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

373
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,676
To not to.

374
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:07,130
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

375
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,820
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

376
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,885
[Chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

377
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:13,860
Ah!

378
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:16,723
[Sheriff] The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

379
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,994
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

380
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,396
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

381
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,431
- Fascist!
- Commie!

382
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,100
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

383
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,868
I gotta get to California, pronto.

384
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,360
Where's your lawyer?

385
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:33,239
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

386
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:38,211
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

387
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,213
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

388
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,584
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

389
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,288
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

390
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,230
Show-off.

391
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,460
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- [Door banging]

392
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,160
- [Gasping]
- All right,

393
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:57,230
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

394
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,599
I want his hood on a platter!

395
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,202
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

396
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:05,905
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

397
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,476
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

398
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,110
I'm...

399
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,315
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

400
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,585
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

401
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,253
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

402
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,489
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

403
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,957
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

404
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:29,496
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

405
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:33,400
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

406
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,334
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

407
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,469
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

408
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,606
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

409
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,100
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

410
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,645
- What the? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

411
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,882
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

412
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,985
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

413
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,870
- [Revving]
- Agh! Ow!

414
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,423
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

415
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:58,658
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

416
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,529
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

417
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:05,398
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

418
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:09,169
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

419
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,670
Ka-ching!

420
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,238
Ah!

421
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,406
I'll keep that in mind.

422
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,843
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

423
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:19,713
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

424
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,140
You know her?

425
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:23,717
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

426
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,251
What?

427
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:29,356
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

428
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:33,259
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

429
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,861
What do you want, Sally?

430
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,465
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

431
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,735
No. I know his type. Racecar.

432
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,903
That's the last thing this town needs.

433
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:48,541
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

434
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:52,445
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

435
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,470
Here she goes again.

436
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,750
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

437
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,353
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

438
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:04,491
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

439
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,693
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

440
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,395
Ignore him.

441
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:11,965
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

442
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,401
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

443
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,837
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

444
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,272
And if no one can get to you?

445
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:23,510
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

446
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:26,279
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

447
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:29,616
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

448
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:33,530
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

449
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,489
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

450
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:40,293
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

451
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,595
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

452
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,699
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

453
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,802
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

454
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,438
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

455
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,540
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

456
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:54,908
Oh, he can do it.

457
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,677
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

458
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,145
[All] Fix the road!

459
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:02,615
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

460
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:03,917
[All cheer]

461
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:07,530
[Honking] Order in the court!

462
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,423
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

463
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,293
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

464
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,794
[VW van] Nice ruling.

465
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,164
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

466
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:22,102
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

467
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,337
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

468
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,730
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

469
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,975
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

470
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,479
Customers!  We have customers!  Customers!

471
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,783
Comeon,  Everyone, I know it's been a long time, 
but we're all ready.

472
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,854
Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out.
You all know what to do.

473
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,189
Clear?  All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

474
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,558
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

475
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:51,231
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

476
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,699
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

477
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,568
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

478
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,405
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

479
00:28:58,638 --> 00:28:59,172
How can we help you?

480
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:03,877
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

481
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,546
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

482
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:09,282
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

483
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,318
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

484
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,122
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, Thanks.
- What you really need

485
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:19,693
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

486
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,428
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

487
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,431
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

488
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:27,600
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

489
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,836
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

490
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,872
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

491
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,909
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

492
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,913
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

493
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:43,283
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

494
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:47,854
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

495
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:48,988
No we just topped off.

496
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,759
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

497
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,195
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

498
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,465
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

499
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:01,568
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

500
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,837
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

501
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,171
Maybe ghost flames!

502
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:07,707
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

503
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:11,511
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

504
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,948
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, Thank you.

505
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,383
Ow!

506
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,886
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

507
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,222
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

508
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,260
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

509
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,629
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

510
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,898
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

511
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:34,934
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

512
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,700
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

513
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,939
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,608
No, not really. But listen.

515
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,145
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

516
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,647
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

517
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:51,384
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

518
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,189
- [Locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

519
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,992
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

520
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:02,328
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

521
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,564
I'm becoming one of them!

522
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:05,799
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

523
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,935
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

524
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,103
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

525
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:13,640
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

526
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,642
- That's good.
...after a Piston Cup update.

527
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:21,414
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

528
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,616
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

529
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:26,553
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

530
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:30,256
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

531
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,725
[Electronic music]

532
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:33,493
[Laughing]

533
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,261
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

534
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,202
Ha-ha!

535
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah!

536
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,576
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

537
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,118
[Girls chattering and giggling]

538
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:00,553
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

539
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:02,722
[Gasping] Oh!

540
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,224
Mater, let me get this straight.

541
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:07,360
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

542
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:11,398
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

543
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,333
I got a road to finish.

544
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,136
[Grunting and revving]

545
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,646
- He's done!
- Done?

546
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:28,982
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

547
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,200
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

548
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,856
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

549
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:41,361
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

550
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,663
Oh!

551
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:47,801
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

552
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,371
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

553
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,841
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

554
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,110
Red.

555
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,181
Who do you think you are?

556
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:04,718
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

557
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:08,188
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

558
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:10,590
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

559
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:14,661
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

560
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:15,995
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

561
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:20,400
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

562
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:24,337
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

563
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,506
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

564
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,509
If I win, you do the road my way.

565
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,440
Doc, what're you doin'?

566
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:32,979
I don't mean to be rude Doc,

567
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:36,983
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

568
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,719
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

569
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:43,957
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

570
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,395
[Sheriff] Listen,
this will be a one-lap race.

571
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:53,660
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

572
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:56,703
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

573
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,639
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

574
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:04,344
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

575
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:06,790
and no lollygaggin'.

576
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,914
Speed. I'm speed.

577
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:10,450
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

578
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:11,484
[Luigi laughs]

579
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:16,222
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

580
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,725
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

581
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:22,362
The race is only one lap, guys.

582
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:24,731
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

583
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,401
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

584
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:33,273
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

585
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:35,442
Gentlemen...

586
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,645
...start your engines!

587
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,647
[Engine sputters]

588
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,452
[Revving furiously]

589
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,721
- IHijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

590
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,291
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

591
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:52,892
Luigi?

592
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:56,290
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

593
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,231
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

594
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:04,304
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

595
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,506
[Giggling]

596
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,976
[Cheering]

597
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,147
Huh?

598
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,183
Doc... the flag means go.

599
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,453
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

600
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,156
Doc, what are you doing, man?

601
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:27,160
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

602
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:30,196
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

603
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:33,266
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

604
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:36,469
You got your tow cable?

605
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,571
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

606
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,774
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

607
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:53,530
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

608
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:55,889
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

609
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,792
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

610
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:00,226
[Revving]

611
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:08,134
Kid! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

612
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,937
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

613
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,600
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

614
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,142
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

615
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:20,947
[Gasps] Ah!

616
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,984
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

617
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:28,822
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

618
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:37,630
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

619
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:40,467
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

620
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:42,736
and asked me if he could
come down here.

621
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:45,238
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

622
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,800
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

623
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,412
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

624
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:57,830
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

625
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,651
I'll keep an eye on him.

626
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:03,390
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

627
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,726
[Engine revving]

628
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:12,432
[Screaming]

629
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,269
[Spitting]

630
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,406
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

631
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:22,375
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

632
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,679
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

633
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:29,516
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

634
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,452
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

635
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:35,622
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

636
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:37,557
I'll put it simple.

637
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:41,594
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

638
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:48,201
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

639
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,170
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

640
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,274
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

641
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:59,913
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

642
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,116
[Groans]

643
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,122
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

644
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:12,459
Hmm...

645
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:13,860
Whoa!

646
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,297
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

647
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:21,534
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

648
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,239
[Screaming] Ow!

649
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,611
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

650
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,714
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

651
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:38,118
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

652
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:42,880
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

653
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:52,832
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

654
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:57,604
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

655
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,940
[Grunts, passes gas]
Oh my!

656
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,276
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

657
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,612
You watch the prisoner tonight.

658
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:09,215
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

659
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,851
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

660
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,521
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

661
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:16,856
[Groaning] Oh...

662
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,160
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

663
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:22,862
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

664
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:25,965
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

665
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,334
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

666
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,837
You make-a such a nice new road.

667
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,540
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

668
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,941
Even though you not a Ferrari.

669
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,811
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

670
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,249
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

671
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:46,753
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

672
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:50,590
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

673
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:53,693
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

674
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,829
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

675
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:57,997
Ramone, Ramone!

676
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,500
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

677
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,570
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass.

678
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,700
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

679
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,611
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

680
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,981

[Exhales deeply]

682
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:17,751
Ah!

683
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:20,530
What are you doing?...

684
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,656
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

685
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,657
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

686
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:28,928
Stop, stop! That's cold!

687
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:31,364
Help! Please! Stop!

688
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:34,667
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

689
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,270
What was that for?

690
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,873
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

691
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,241
If you do, you gotta be clean.

692
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:43,777
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

693
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,545
What, I? I don't get it.

694
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,181
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

695
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:51,418
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

696
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:56,122
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

697
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,193
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

698
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:02,495
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

699
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,965
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

700
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,169
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

701
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:12,405
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

702
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,143
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

703
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,547
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

704
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:24,284
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

705
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:27,821
Cone number one, if you want.

706
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,324
Oh...

707
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,962
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

708
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:39,165
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

709
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:40,900
[Both chuckle]

710
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,138
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

711
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,800
[chuckles] ... Yeah.

712
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,281
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

713
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:57,500
Good-lookin' girl.

714
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,286
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

715
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:03,690
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

716
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:07,127
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

717
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:11,297
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

718
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:15,602
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

719
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:19,439
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

720
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:21,741
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

721
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:24,770
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

722
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,746
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

723
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:28,581
I can handle anything.

724
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:32,819
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

725
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:38,658

- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

726
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,360
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

727
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,364
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

728
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,299
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

729
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,868
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

730
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:50,303
Wait, Mater!

731
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:54,740
OK, here's what you do.

732
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,100
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

733
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,846
And they do the rest. Watch this.

734

00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,707
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

740
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,543
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

741
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,549

I don't even have a horn.

- Hey, can you believe it, man?

835
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:14,881
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

836
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:17,817
That's so too much!

837
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,889
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

838
00:50:23,256 --> 00:50:24,424
I don't know.

839
00:50:29,562 --> 00:50:31,464
Whoa! Yes.

840
00:50:44,477 --> 00:50:47,347
- [Sputtering]
- [Laughing]

841
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:49,816
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

842
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,420
- Bleah!
- [Chuckling]

843
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:56,790

[Laughing]

846
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,753
[Chuckles] Oh!

[Spitting]

848
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:23,877
[Lightning] Wow. What is this place?

849
00:52:24,544 --> 00:52:25,845
Wheel Well.

850
00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:29,683
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

851
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,455
This place?

852
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,791
[Horns beeping]

853
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:40,894
[Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.

854
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:45,899
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

855
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:49,769
You know, I don't get you.

856
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,839
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

857
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:55,208
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

858
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:59,512
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

859
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,416
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

860
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:06,353
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

861
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,323
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

862
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:11,558
And you know what?

863
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,729
It never felt... happy.

864
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,899
Yeah. I mean... really?

865
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,469
Yeah. So I left California.

866
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:25,705
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

867
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,808
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

868
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:32,245
Well, they all did. And I never left.

869
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,150
Yeah. You know, I understand.

870
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,784
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

871
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:41,454
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

872
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,859
[Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

873
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:49,295
- Oh.
- Yep.

874
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,200
- Corvette?
- No.

875
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,409
I fell in love with this.

876
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:17,857
Whoa. Look at that.

877
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,528
Look, they're drivin' right by.

878
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:23,296
They don't even know
what they're missing!

879
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:26,700
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

880
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,169
Oh, yeah?

881
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:33,306
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

882
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:35,141
Really?

883
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:38,478
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,

884
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:41,214
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

885
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:43,616
How do you mean?

886
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:47,120
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

887
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:51,391
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

888
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,994
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

889
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,766
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

890
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:03,200
They drove on it to have a great time.

891
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:06,606
[~ James Taylor: Our Town]

892
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,905
Well, what happened?

893
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:42,475
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

894
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:11,531
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

895
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:14,768
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

896
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:19,105
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

897
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:22,442
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

898
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:23,943
I had a great time.

899
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:27,147
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

900
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:29,282
You're welcome.

901
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,186
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

902
00:57:33,386 --> 00:57:35,422
[Chuckling] Wha... what?

- [Mooing]

907
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:05,180
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

908
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:08,922
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

909
00:58:09,122 --> 00:58:11,324
- [Sheriff] Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

910
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:14,394
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

911
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:18,365
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

912
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:19,833
There's one goin' this way.

913
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,101
I got it.

914
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,274
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

915
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,443
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

916
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:31,978
No, no, no, no, come here.

917
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:34,547
What are you doing?

918
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:37,830
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

919
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,452
...alone.

920
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:56,703
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?

921

922
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,345

924
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:23,223
Ah... Yeah.

925
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:25,225
- Wow.
- Huh?

926
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:26,760
You're amazing!

927
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:30,663
[Coughing] What are you doin'?

928
01:00:31,197 --> 01:00:32,832
Doc, wait!

929
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,469
[Trucks mooing]

930
01:00:36,536 --> 01:00:38,872
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

931
01:00:42,242 --> 01:00:45,311
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

932
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:48,548
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

933
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,817
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

934
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:53,586
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

935
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:55,388
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

936
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:58,525
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

937
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:01,628
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

938
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,799
You think I quit?

939
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,800
[Lightning] Right.

940
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,550
Your big wreck in '54.

941
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:26,486
They quit on me.

942
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,490
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

943
01:01:30,557 --> 01:01:33,360
You know what they said?
"You're history."

944
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:36,863
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

945
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,234
There was a lot left in me.

946
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:44,804
I never got a chance to show 'em.

947
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:50,510
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

948
01:01:51,644 --> 01:01:54,681
I just never expected that
that world would...

949
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,850
...would find me here.

950
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:00,954
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

951
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:02,155
No, I'm not.

952
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,925
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

953
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:11,531
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

954
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:15,350
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

955
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:20,400
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

956
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,443
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

957
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:26,413
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long

958
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:28,915
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

959
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,251
Who's caring about only himself?

960
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:33,987
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

to miss that race of his.

01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:21,187
Blackwall tires.

Whitewall tires!

1007
01:05:24,891 --> 01:05:29,829
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."

1008
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:31,631
All right, you're the expert.

1013
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:55,689
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1014
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:57,524
Eh... No.

1015
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:04,431
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?

1016
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,599
It's a conspiracy, man!

1017
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:09,350
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!

1018

They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

OK, I'll take a case.

you've helped everybody in town.

Yeah, everybody except one.

- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?

1038
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,743
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?

1039
01:07:23,977 --> 01:07:26,790

supposed to do after that?

1044
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,625
Just like in its heyday, right?

1045
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:15,929
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1047

01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,193
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1050
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:53,233
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1051
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,700
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1055
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:14,854
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1056
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:18,591
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

01:12:02,622 --> 01:12:04,324
Just give me a second here, Harv.

Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:08,975
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1165
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,311
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1166
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:18,385
[All shouting]

1167
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:21,870
[Gulping]

1168
01:15:29,329 --> 01:15:30,697
Uh-oh

1169
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:37,370
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

1170
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:44,100
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1171
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:46,179
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1172
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:49,549
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1173
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,180
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1174
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:55,221
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1175
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:59,325
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1176
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:00,493
[Chuckling]

1177
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,430
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1178
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:06,366
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1179
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:08,968
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1180
01:16:09,102 --> 01:16:11,705
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1181
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:20,780
Agh! Shoot!

1182
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:23,850
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1183
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:30,523
[Crowd cheering]

1184
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:32,759
Come on, you can do it!

1185
01:16:32,826 --> 01:16:34,794
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1186
01:16:35,962 --> 01:16:38,998
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1187
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,168
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1188
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:46,673
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1189
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:49,175
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1190
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:50,910
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1191
01:16:50,977 --> 01:16:53,179
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1192
01:16:57,751 --> 01:17:00,620
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

1193
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:02,689
[Breaks squealing]

1194
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,758
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1195
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:05,792
[All gasp]

1196
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:11,531
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1197
01:17:11,531 --> 01:17:14,901
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

1198
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:15,869
[Groans]

1199
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:19,439
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1200
01:17:19,706 --> 01:17:21,740
I don't think I...

1201
01:17:21,341 --> 01:17:24,577
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1202
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:25,679
Doc?

1203
01:17:28,915 --> 01:17:31,584
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1204
01:17:31,685 --> 01:17:35,255
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1205
01:17:35,555 --> 01:17:37,570
You said you'd never come back.

1206
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:41,610
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1207
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,797
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1208
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:45,432
[Chuckles]

1209
01:17:45,732 --> 01:17:49,102
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1210
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:52,205
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1211
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:54,374
Now, get back out there!

1212
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,746
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1213
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:01,681
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1214
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:04,851
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1215
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:07,870
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1216
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,590
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1217
01:18:19,632 --> 01:18:21,935
[Murmuring]

1218
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,837
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1219
01:18:23,903 --> 01:18:27,507
Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1220
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:30,110
[Bob] Darrel, it appears McQueen
has got himself a new pit crew.

1221
01:18:30,176 --> 01:18:32,879
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1222
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:35,882
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1223
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:39,652
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It's Hudson Hornet.

1224
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:43,523
[Crowd cheering]

1225
01:18:43,823 --> 01:18:45,759
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

1226
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,628
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1227
01:18:49,262 --> 01:18:50,597
Hey, Doc!

1228
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:54,667
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1229
01:18:59,939 --> 01:19:03,760
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1230
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,179
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1231
01:19:06,346 --> 01:19:09,149
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1232
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:10,750
Vai! Vai, vai!

1233
01:19:11,184 --> 01:19:13,586
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1234
01:19:13,887 --> 01:19:17,757
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1235
01:19:17,957 --> 01:19:18,925
[All laugh]

1236
01:19:18,992 --> 01:19:20,360
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1237
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:24,300
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1238
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,681
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1239
01:19:42,882 --> 01:19:44,117
What do you think of this?

1240
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:47,187
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1241
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:51,191
What?

1242
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,594
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1243
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:59,666
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1244
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:02,302
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1245
01:20:02,402 --> 01:20:06,740
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1246
01:20:11,344 --> 01:20:14,714
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1247
01:20:20,587 --> 01:20:22,422
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1248
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:24,591
No, you don't.

1249
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:26,393
[Tire blows]

1250
01:20:28,294 --> 01:20:29,796
Doc, I'm flat!

1251
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:32,699
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1252
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:36,336
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1253
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:41,207
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1254
01:20:41,274 --> 01:20:43,710
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1255
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,979
Guido! It's time.

1256
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,986
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1257
01:20:55,188 --> 01:20:57,590
[Air wrench whirring]

1258
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:04,164
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1259
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:05,832
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1260
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:08,368
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1261
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:10,700
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1262
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:14,400
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

1263
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:16,760
[Darrell] He's back in!

1264
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:18,311
Peet stop.

1265
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:21,548
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1266
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,766
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1267
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:42,435
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1268
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:45,939
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1269
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,240
This is it, kiddo.

1270
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,809
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1271
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:52,212
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1272
01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:53,646
- Go!
- [Revving]

1273
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:57,317
We'll see about that!

1274
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:00,253
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1275
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:06,260
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1276
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:19,773
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1277
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:23,143
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1278
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:27,213
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1279
01:22:30,183 --> 01:22:33,190
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1280
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:35,121
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1281
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:40,727
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1282
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,837
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]

1283
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,949
[Breaks screeching]

1284
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,354
[Engine idling]

1285
01:23:10,323 --> 01:23:12,425
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1286
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:16,960
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1287
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,366
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1288
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,943
[Grunting, moaning]

1289
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:32,450
What are you doin', kid?

1290
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:35,215
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1291
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:41,121
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1292
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:44,657
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1293
01:23:44,724 --> 01:23:46,459
It's just an empty cup.

1294
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:50,830
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1295
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,434
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1296
01:23:54,968 --> 01:23:57,170
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1297
01:23:57,237 --> 01:23:59,839
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1298
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:02,642
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]

1299
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:04,110
[Laughing]

1300
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,915
[Crowd cheers wildly]

1301
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,761
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1302
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:24,230
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1303
01:24:24,464 --> 01:24:29,502
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1304
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:34,641
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1305
01:24:34,641 --> 01:24:35,975
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1306
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,812
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1307
01:24:39,145 --> 01:24:41,981
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1308
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,184
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1309
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:48,588
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1310
01:24:48,955 --> 01:24:52,125
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Ka-chicka!

1311
01:24:52,192 --> 01:24:53,593
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1312
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,228
- Boo!
- Boo!

1313
01:24:55,295 --> 01:24:58,264
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1314
01:24:58,331 --> 01:25:00,367
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1315
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:08,208
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1316
01:25:10,744 --> 01:25:13,790
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1317
01:25:13,146 --> 01:25:15,480
You're The King! Yeah!

1318
01:25:15,515 --> 01:25:17,717
[Crowd cheers]

1319
01:25:23,256 --> 01:25:25,959
[Laughing and cheering]

1320
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:30,130
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1321
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:35,235
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1322
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:37,537
Thanks, Doc.

1323
01:25:38,605 --> 01:25:39,906
Hey, Lightnin'.

1324
01:25:39,973 --> 01:25:42,509
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1325
01:25:43,376 --> 01:25:46,279
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1326
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:49,150
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1327
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,210
But I didn't win.

1328
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,625
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1329
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:01,561
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1330
01:26:01,628 --> 01:26:05,632
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]

1331
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:07,367
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1332
01:26:07,934 --> 01:26:11,504
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1333
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:14,374
I'm gonna stick with them.

1334
01:26:14,574 --> 01:26:17,444
Well, I sure can respect that.

1335
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,512
Still, you know,

1336
01:26:19,512 --> 01:26:23,216
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1337
01:26:23,216 --> 01:26:25,652
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1338
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,390
Actually, there is one thing.

1339
01:26:30,824 --> 01:26:31,791
Whoo-hoo!

1340
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:33,226
Yeah!

1341
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:36,996
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', I'm flyin!

1342
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:45,472
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1343
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,643
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1344
01:26:54,214 --> 01:26:58,151
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world to get tires.

1345
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:01,254
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1346
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:07,794
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1347
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:09,963
A real Ferrari!

1348
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:12,198
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1349
01:27:12,332 --> 01:27:16,360
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1350
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:20,600
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

1351
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,676

Just passin' through?

1355
01:27:40,827 --> 01:27:42,595
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1356
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:45,932
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1357
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:50,303
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1358
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:52,839
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1359
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,875
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1360
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:58,440
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1361
01:27:58,778 --> 01:28:02,816
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1362
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:04,684
- blah, blah, blah.
- [Lightning chuckles]

1363
01:28:04,884 --> 01:28:08,154

K-i-s-s...uh... i-n-g!

1365
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,610
Great timing, Mater!

He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?

1368
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:24,771
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1369
01:28:24,904 --> 01:28:27,207
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1370
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,442
Hmm... Nah.

1371
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:34,280
Yeah! Ka-chow!

[Sniffing] Ah-choo!

1376
01:29:46,519 --> 01:29:49,389
[Mater] All right, everybody
please keep together now.

1377
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:54,127
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.

1378
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,130
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

1379
01:29:57,497 --> 01:30:01,368
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1380
01:30:01,634 --> 01:30:04,871
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1381
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:08,608
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.

1382
01:30:12,312 --> 01:30:15,348
- [Lightning] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Doc] Yeah!

1383
01:30:15,515 --> 01:30:17,951
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.

1384
01:30:18,184 --> 01:30:21,121
