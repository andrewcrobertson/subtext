1
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,960
- I'm starting a new life.

2
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,280
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

3
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,120
And almost no one knows me.

4
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,570
Poor Jerry.

5
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,080
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

6
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,670
They say I'm cured now.

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,550
But I still have intrusive
thoughts.

8
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,600
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,650
People are abused all over the
world

10
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,690
every day

11
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,440
much worse than me

12
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,940
and they do fine.

13
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,740
- Your tail light's out, Miss.

14
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,750
- Oh, thank you for letting me
know.

15
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,330
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

16
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,500
- I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,630
- Thank you, Officer.

18
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,720
- You drive safely.

19
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,200
- When Jerry left me,
I devoured everything

20
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,460
I could about how to get your
man back.

21
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,920
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

22
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,550
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

23
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,850
You have to be very tricky.

24
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,690
- Elaine?

25
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,860
Hi, I'm Trish.

26
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,690
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet
you.

27
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,610
- Oh, you're so pretty.

28
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,650
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

29
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm married and everything.

30
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,700
- No, I didn't think anything.

31
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,950
- Well, let me help you with
your bags.

32
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Is this all you've got?

33
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,540
- For now.

34
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,710
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

35
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,920
- So you're an artist?

36
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
- Yes, I am.

37
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,130
- I'm an interior decorator.

38
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,210
- Oh, really?

39
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
- Yes.

40
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,850
That's how I met Barbara.

41
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,100
I decorated this apartment.

42
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,390
It was lucky I still had the
keys.

43
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,310
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

44
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,450
How do you know Barbara?

45
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,710
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

46
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,790
- Oh, really?

47
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,170
Well, I hope you like the
apartment.

48
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,140
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

49
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,180
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth Tarot deck

50
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,520
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

51
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,770
for me to hang.

52
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,810
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

53
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,690
Well, this is it.

54
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,870
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

55
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,910
It's just beautiful.

56
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,950
- Really?

57
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,540
Oh, I'm so glad.

58
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,960
I thought I may have overdone
it.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,540
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

60
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,290
- You must be exhausted.

61
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm sure you want to lie down.

62
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,300
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

63
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,380
Do you know of a place around
here?

64
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,970
- There's the Victorian Tea
Room.

65
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,600
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,270
- Oh, how fantastic.

67
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,310
Where can I freshen up?

68
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,100
- The bedroom is through there.

69
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,100
- I'll only be a moment.

70
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,970
- What a lovely room.

71
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,770
- Yes, isn't it?

72
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,480
I love Victoriana.

73
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,650
- Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

74
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,400
- Do you have fairy
princess fantasies, Elaine?

75
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
- Of course.

76
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,570
We may be grown women, but
underneath

77
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,740
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

78
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,160
by a prince on a white horse.

79
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,450
- Yes, I suppose so.

80
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,620
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

81
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,340
- I don't think I've found
my Prince Charming yet,

82
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,630
but I think I found the formula.

83
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,110
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

84
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,260
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

85
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,810
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

86
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,940
Then Jerry would have never left
me.

87
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,110
- Who's Jerry?

88
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,900
- My ex-husband.

89
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,030
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

90
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,210
But then I was reborn as a
witch.

91
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,090
Barbara and Gahan brought me
back to life.

92
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,260
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

93
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,340
Men are like children.

94
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,970
They're very easy to please

95
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,680
as long as we give them what
they want.

96
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,190
♫ I dreamed of a fairy
lady in a strange land

97
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,910
♫ She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men

98
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,420
♫ She wore a gown

99
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,500
♫ Of pink and purple roses

100
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,510
♫ It was so tra la la and so la
di da ♫

101
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,140
- Where were we?

102
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,390
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,310
Well, what do men want?

104
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,820
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

105
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,610
and to make them feel like a man

106
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,800
and to give them total freedom

107
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,450
in whatever they wanna do or be.

108
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,160
- But what about what we want?

109
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,790
How are we going to be equals
with men

110
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,330
if we keep catering to all of
their needs?

111
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,710
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

112
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,880
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

113
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,510
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

114
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,680
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

115
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,850
I'll admit, I used sex to get
this,

116
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,440
but I'm not proud of it.

117
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

118
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,740
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

119
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,990
I'd be a wreck.

120
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,570
- Poor Richard.

121
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,660
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

122
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,080
You have to give a man his
fantasy.

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920
- His fantasy?

124
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,500
- Yes, his fantasy.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,840
But what I'm really interested
in

126
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
is love.

127
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,100
You might say I'm addicted to
love.

128
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,390
I wonder if all women feel that
way?

129
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,940
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

130
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,810
A husband isn't a prince,
Elaine,

131
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,190
and life isn't a fairy tale.

132
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,240
We have to face that fact.

133
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
- Why?

134
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,090
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

135
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,200
if you pleased your husband
more.

136
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,950
- I don't
need to please Richard.

137
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,080
Richard loves me for myself.

138
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
- Of course.

139
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,290
Perhaps you did find your Prince
Charming.

140
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,630
- Perhaps I did.

141
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,890
- Guess who.

142
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,480
- Richard, what are you doing
here?

143
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,980
This tea room is for ladies
only.

144
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,270
- Oh, I went to visit you at
work

145
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,530
and Julie said you were here.

146
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,110
I thought we could have lunch
together.

147
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,320
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

148
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

149
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,200
Elaine, this is my husband,
Richard.

150
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,040
- I've heard so much about you,
Richard.

151
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,670
- Nothing too horrible, I hope.

152
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,960
- On the contrary.

153
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,720
- Goddess, please,

154
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,940
send me a beautiful, sweet man

155
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,940
to love me as I love him.

156
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,320
To love me, love me,

157
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
love me,

158
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,330
love me,

159
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
love me,

160
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,170
love me,

161
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
love me,

162
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
love me.

163
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,660
Hi, are you Wendy?

164
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,580
- Yes, what can I do for you?

165
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,660
- I'm Elaine.

166
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,660
We spoke on the phone.

167
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,500
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

168
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,920
- Elaine, right.

169
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,670
Thanks for coming by.

170
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,380
Mind if I have a look?

171
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
- Please do.

172
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,300
- These are nice.

173
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Really nice.

174
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,060
I think these will do well in
the store.

175
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,650
- Then you'll take them?

176
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,400
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

177
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,870
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

178
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,910
Sound good?

179
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,540
- Yes, fantastic.

180
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,330
Thank you, Wendy.

181
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,580
- Sure, Elaine.

182
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,250
Bright blessings.

183
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,750
- People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

184
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,880
I tell them it's because I
want to have magical powers.

185
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,970
But it's not like it sounds.

186
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,140
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

187
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
- Hi.

188
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
- Hi.

189
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,510
- It's a beautiful day.

190
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,600
- Yes, it is.

191
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,390
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

192
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,230
- Oh, you like nature?

193
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,650
- Very much.

194
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,270
You seem like a nature type too.

195
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,200
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

196
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,530
- That's right.

197
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,990
How'd you know?

198
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,530
- I can just tell.

199
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,240
Nature is where your heart is.

200
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,250
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

201
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,420
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

202
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,210
- I'm talented that way.

203
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,180
- Well, you're right about the
city.

204
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,050
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods

205
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,060
about an hour from here.

206
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

207
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,270
just think and read.

208
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,020
- Do you take your wife up
there?

209
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,780
- No.

210
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm not married.

211
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,340
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

212
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,700
once in a while.

213
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,450
- I do.

214
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,290
I do, once in a while.

215
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,290
- You wanna take a girl up there
now?

216
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,960
What do you mean?

217
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,420
- Well, I'm new in town

218
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,010
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

219
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,350
I'll make you a nice dinner.

220
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,060
- Yes, okay, sure.

221
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,940
Uh, my car is right over there.

222
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
- Okay.

223
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Let's go.

224
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,330
You know what I'd like to do
right now?

225
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,500
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

226
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,420
just like we were kids.

227
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,720
- Wait, wait.

228
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,140
You want some?

229
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,140
- What is it?

230
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,430
- Something I made.

231
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,070
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

232
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
- Finish it.

233
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,970
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

234
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,930
Not here.

235
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,680
Let's go inside.

236
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,990
This is beautiful.

237
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll start the dinner.

238
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
- Wow.

239
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,300
This looks delicious.

240
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
- To nature.

241
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,950
- This is really nice, isn't it?

242
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,490
I like to come up here a lot

243
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,120
at the end of the semester to
unwind.

244
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,500
- Are you a teacher?

245
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,210
- Yeah, I teach at the
university.

246
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,210
- Oh, what do you teach?

247
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,880
- English and French literature

248
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,630
with a focus on the 18th
century.

249
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,800
- So, you must be quite a
libertine.

250
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,970
- A libertine?

251
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,760
Why would you say that?

252
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,140
- Oh, you know.

253
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,690
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.

254
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,060
Not to mention Casanova.

255
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,690
- Well, there
were a lot of books written

256
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,360
in the 18th century.

257
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,940
- Well, is it true?

258
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,070
Are you a libertine?

259
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
- Yes I am.

260
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,410
I love women.

261
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,910
Does that bother you?

262
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,410
- On the contrary.

263
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,380
I feel strange, dizzy.

264
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,890
What was in that drink you gave
me?

265
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,810
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

266
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,230
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

267
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,610
Oh, baby.

268
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,690
You are really wild.

269
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,250
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

270
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,330
- Not at all.

271
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,520
- What the hell?

272
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Your coat.

273
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,780
It's so bright.

274
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,870
- I always line my clothing.

275
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,330
- You have two selves.

276
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,960
Dark and quiet that you show the
world.

277
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,170
Who do you give that to?

278
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
The rainbow?

279
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,840
- I give the rainbow to you.

280
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,430
Right now.

281
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Oh God.

282
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Oh, Elaine.

283
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,270
Look at you.

284
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,360
- You can make love to me now.

285
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,550
- Aw, okay.

286
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,970
- What is it, Wayne?

287
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,010
What is it, baby?

288
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,350
- Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.

289
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,230
- It's all right, you're with
me, shhh.

290
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,110
- Elaine.

291
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,620
No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

292
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,450
- Life has been tough, huh?

293
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,210
- Yeah, in a way.

294
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,550
You're not like any other woman
I've met.

295
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,300
No games, no agendas.

296
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,640
You just seem to take life as it
is.

297
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,100
- Is there any other way to take
life?

298
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,850
- Well, the women I've been
with,

299
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,290
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

300
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,780
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

301
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,820
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

302
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
It's crazy.

303
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,820
- I know, baby.

304
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
I know.

305
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,960
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

306
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,460
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

307
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,840
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

308
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,430
they're never bright enough.

309
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,060
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

310
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,890
- That seems like quite a
problem.

311
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,520
- It is.

312
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,940
I feel my whole life as a loner,

313
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,900
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

314
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,870
But now I'm not so sure.

315
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,830
Oh, Elaine,

316
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,250
I have never felt real
love like this before.

317
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,090
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

318
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,760
Elaine, I'm scared.

319
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

320
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,980
I can't take it, I can't take
it.

321
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,400
Elaine, I'm sick.

322
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,150
I'm sick.

323
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,570
- Hey, it's all right.

324
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
I've got you.

325
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,990
I love you.

326
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,210
And I'll always be here for you.

327
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,170
Try to get some sleep.

328
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,350
- Elaine.

329
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,810
Elaine, where are you?

330
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,310
Elaine, where are you?

331
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,610
- What a pussy.

332
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,490
What a baby.

333
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
I thought I'd found a real man,

334
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,790
but he's just like a little
girl.

335
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,540
- Elaine!

336
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,850
- No one was ever there for me

337
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,040
when I was crying my heart out.

338
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,630
No one ever comforted me.

339
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
No one.

340
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,210
- Good morning, Wayne.

341
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,170
- Hi, Elaine.

342
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,300
- Here, drink this.

343
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,270
- I had such horrible dreams
last night.

344
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,320
- What did you dream about,
baby.

345
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,990
- I dreamt that I was calling
your name

346
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,900
and you didn't answer.

347
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,070
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

348
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,120
Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't
you?

349
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,750
- Of course, I love you.

350
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,920
- Oh God, oh God, Elaine.

351
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,760
- Are you hungry?

352
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,850
- I don't know what I am.

353
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,690
- Well, try to get some sleep.

354
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
- Elaine.

355
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,190
Don't leave me.

356
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,440
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

357
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,030
I'll be right here.

358
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,430
Wayne, wake up.

359
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,970
It's late.

360
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Wayne.

361
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,230
Wayne, baby, wake up.

362
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Wake up.

363
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Wayne.

364
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,440
- Tampons aren't gross.

365
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,860
Women bleed and that's a
beautiful thing.

366
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,070
Do you know that most men have
never even seen a used tampon?

367
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,210
Part of me can be with Wayne
now.

368
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Always.

369
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,010
I don't really mind death.

370
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,180
I've buried people before.

371
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,180
People I really cared about.

372
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,980
In the end we're all just
compost anyway.

373
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,480
Everything regenerates.

374
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,570
I'd like to come back as a cat.

375
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,950
I've been so depressed since my
cat died.

376
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,370
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

377
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,460
He was my best friend.

378
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,860
- I give the rainbow to you.

379
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Right now.

380
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,540
Just a minute.

381
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Oh hi Trish.

382
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Come on in.

383
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,100
- Hey, Elaine.

384
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,680
You look gorgeous.

385
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,390
I love what you've done with
your hair.

386
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,430
- Thank you.

387
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,560
What's up, honey?

388
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,910
- Well, I haven't been able to
reach you,

389
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,900
so I thought I'd come over

390
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,020
to see if everything was all
right.

391
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,070
- I'm fine.

392
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,570
Really.

393
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,610
Can I offer you something?

394
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,200
I just made some tea and cake.

395
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,030
- Just tea, thank you.

396
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,170
- Cream and sugar?

397
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,340
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

398
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,990
So, what have you been so busy
with?

399
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,150
A man, I hope.

400
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,200
- Yes, it was a man.

401
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,580
But, it didn't work out.

402
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,120
- I'm Sorry.

403
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,710
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

404
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,250
I thought that he was the one.

405
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,250
- Well, maybe next time.

406
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,260
- Are you sure you won't have
some cake?

407
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,930
- Oh, no, thank you.

408
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,680
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

409
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
- Good bye?

410
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,730
Why, where are you going?

411
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,730
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

412
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,320
- Is Richard going with you?

413
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,030
- No, it's just a business trip.

414
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,110
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

415
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,190
- Sam, give me two whiskeys on
the rocks.

416
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,740
- Sure thing, Jane.

417
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,030
Did you see the papers today?

418
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,070
- No, why?

419
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,080
- They found a body in the Eel
River.

420
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
- A murder?

421
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,750
- Maybe.

422
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,040
They found a symbol carved in
his chest.

423
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,630
Here.

424
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,590
- It's a pentagram.

425
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,760
- It's them witches again.

426
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,390
- That's what I was thinking
too, Lyle.

427
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,560
- So yeah, Barbara, that's
everything.

428
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,570
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

429
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,730
They couldn't prove anything.

430
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,700
They actually thought that I
killed him.

431
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,280
Can you believe it?

432
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,450
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

433
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,700
after you left.

434
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,040
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

435
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,040
- Well, it was perfect timing.

436
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to
greet you.

437
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,630
That's all right.

438
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,470
Trish has been lovely.

439
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,510
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

440
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,850
But I had this experience last
weekend

441
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,850
that really shook me up.

442
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,680
- Why, what happened?

443
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,770
- Well, I met this great-looking
guy.

444
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,150
And I used love magic on him.

445
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,730
Then he got really weird on me.

446
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,530
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

447
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,830
Then he got really

448
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
sick.

449
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,460
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

450
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,330
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

451
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,540
It was probably just too much
for him.

452
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,470
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

453
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,880
- I guess that's what it was.

454
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,970
But, I don't know.

455
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,260
- Honey, you have to be more
careful.

456
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,740
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

457
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,140
in the first place, you know.

458
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,020
- Merry Meet, Elaine.

459
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,150
- Bright blessings Gahan.

460
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,920
- I heard you discussing love
spells.

461
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,840
You do have to be careful,
Elaine.

462
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,680
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

463
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,220
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

464
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,520
What's it been now, a year?

465
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,400
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

466
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,730
Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,

467
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,360
for the blessings that we share.

468
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,610
- Blessed be, Hurrahya!

469
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,580
- Go home, witches.

470
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Go home.

471
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,580
- Just ignore them.

472
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,290
They're always giving us
trouble.

473
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,040
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

474
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:45,340
- Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

475
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,800
But it's not bad for a small
town.

476
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,590
Not all of them embrace our
methods

477
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,470
of practicing witchcraft.

478
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,310
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

479
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,640
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

480
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,900
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

481
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,440
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

482
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,360
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

483
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,530
And it was fun.

484
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,700
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

485
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,630
- What have you been teaching?

486
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,960
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on sigil magic

487
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,510
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

488
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,840
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

489
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,680
energy grounding,
Earth-based spirituality,

490
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,510
pagan arts and crafts,

491
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,680
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

492
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,610
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

493
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,070
- Oh, are you still teaching
that?

494
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,280
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

495
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,280
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

496
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,120
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

497
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,460
- Are you still dancing?

498
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,380
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on Amateur Night.

499
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,710
You should come.

500
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,210
- Hi, Barbara.

501
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,260
Hi, Gahan.

502
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,760
Sorry we're late.

503
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,890
- Hello lovely ladies, please
have a seat.

504
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,180
Elaine, this is Star and her
sister Moon.

505
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,230
They're our students for
tonight.

506
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,730
Girls, this is our dear friend
Elaine.

507
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,770
- Hi.

508
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
- Hi.

509
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,690
- I was just pointing out that
dancing

510
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,610
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

511
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,160
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

512
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,660
so you could learn about that.

513
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,830
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

514
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,040
These men would do anything for
her.

515
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:52,050
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

516
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,300
Then let us begin.

517
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,010
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

518
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,060
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

519
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,890
lies in her sexuality.

520
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:08,860
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

521
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,530
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

522
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,030
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

523
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,080
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

524
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,910
with the fear of female
sexuality.

525
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,130
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

526
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,420
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

527
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,760
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

528
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,930
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

529
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,930
never asking us what we wanted.

530
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,440
- They teach us that a
normative human being

531
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,270
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

532
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,230
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

533
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,070
that need to be cured.

534
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,700
And we believe that men
and women are different

535
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,790
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

536
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,790
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

537
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,580
our primal power as goddesses.

538
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,460
We need to teach men how to love
us

539
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,260
using ways they can understand.

540
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,380
So goddesses, use perfume,

541
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,640
wear high heels and makeup,

542
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,930
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

543
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:29,020
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

544
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,980
Be a mother and a lover.

545
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,280
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

546
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,370
- Use sex magic to destroy his
fear of you

547
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,950
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

548
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,670
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

549
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,210
with all of your inner beauty.

550
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,630
Then, when his heart is open to
love,

551
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,630
you may do with him what you
will.

552
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,280
- I love you, Elaine.

553
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,660
You know that, don't you?

554
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,750
I love you very much.

555
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,670
But you need to be more careful.

556
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,380
Dinner was late three times this
week.

557
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,640
And that house is a total
pigsty.

558
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,890
Do you know that I found an old
hot dog

559
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,180
under the bed this morning?

560
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,770
And why don't you ever brush
your hair?

561
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,940
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

562
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,070
I'm embarrassed to have people
over.

563
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,740
I've been really patient up
until now,

564
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,580
but you need to step up your
game.

565
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,000
- I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

566
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,750
What?

567
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,420
You're not crazy?

568
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,470
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

569
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,300
Which is it?

570
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,850
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

571
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,100
And you could lose a few pounds.

572
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,600
You're looking a little fatty.

573
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,730
- Oh my God, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

574
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,400
You have such a hot body now.

575
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,700
Do you like it when I touch you
like this?

576
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,780
Or like this?

577
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,790
I wanna make you come.

578
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,290
- Don't be frightened, Elaine.

579
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,210
I would never hurt you.

580
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,800
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

581
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,470
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

582
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,680
- Hast thou the courage to make
the essay?

583
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,850
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

584
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,750
- Assist me to erect the ancient
altar

585
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,080
at which in days past all
worshiped.

586
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,550
For in the old times, a woman
was the altar.

587
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,010
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

588
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,340
of the circle, the origin of all
things.

589
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,270
Therefore, should we adore it.

590
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,010
- Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

591
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,140
Congratulations on your
promotion.

592
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,550
- Thanks, Connie.

593
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,850
Is there any coffee.

594
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,520
- Yeah, I just made some.

595
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,440
I made it just the way you like
it.

596
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,690
- Is there anything you don't do
well?

597
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,440
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

598
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,490
- How's the coffee, Steve?

599
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:35,910
- Uh, too strong.

600
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,790
- Well, I like it strong.

601
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,630
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

602
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,050
- Why, have you been keeping
late nights?

603
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,090
- Maybe so.

604
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,930
- But, now that you've been
promoted,

605
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,970
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

606
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,470
- Me, you kidding?

607
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,650
- Sergeant Meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

608
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,400
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

609
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,570
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

610
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,330
- Yes, of course.

611
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,870
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

612
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,540
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

613
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,920
- Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

614
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,720
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

615
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,720
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

616
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,180
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

617
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,190
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

618
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,600
- Wayne used to spend weekends

619
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,440
up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

620
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,070
He used to take dates there.

621
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,940
- Oh, Jesus.

622
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,670
- Hey Griff, look.

623
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,090
- Good lord.

624
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,850
- What the hell is this?

625
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,060
- I don't know.

626
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,480
We're going to have to dig,
Steve.

627
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,530
- I know.

628
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,040
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

629
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,150
this cake is absolutely
fantastic.

630
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,200
And what a great dinner.

631
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,240
- Thank you.

632
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,200
I enjoy cooking.

633
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,330
Hope you don't mind my calling
you.

634
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,330
Sometimes it's so hard to be
alone.

635
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,420
- Not at all.

636
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,090
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trish is out of town.

637
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,270
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

638
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,480
- 10 years this September.

639
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
- 10 years!

640
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,020
It's really amazing.

641
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:40,200
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

642
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,580
- What about your husband?

643
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,210
- My husband never loved me.

644
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,290
He couldn't wait to get away
from me.

645
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,130
- I'm sorry.

646
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,850
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

647
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:12,730
- Poor baby.

648
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,480
Poor, poor baby.

649
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,600
So, tell me, what turns you on?

650
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:54,310
- What turns me on?

651
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:57,810
Wow, no one's ever asked me that
before.

652
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,900
Let me think.

653
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,990
You know what really turns me
on?

654
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,280
Flying.

655
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,990
- Flying?

656
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,160
- Yeah, flying a plane.

657
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,120
You don't know what kinda high
it is.

658
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,080
You're soarin' up there above
everything.

659
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,790
You're in control.

660
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,460
- Oh, how fantastic.

661
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,050
- It really is.

662
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,260
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

663
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,430
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

664
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,690
I feel like my life is slipping
away

665
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,150
and there's so many things I
haven't done.

666
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,190
- Like what?

667
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,030
- I've never had any sordid love
affairs

668
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,360
or gotten into any mischief.

669
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,030
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

670
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,280
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

671
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,930
and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those

672
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:57,080
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

673
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,300
Or those Westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

674
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,840
and then go visit the local
prostitutes.

675
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,880
It's sounds stupid, I know.

676
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,260
- No, it doesn't.

677
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,760
It's very sweet.

678
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,810
- Really?

679
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,690
Trish doesn't think so.

680
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:23,570
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

681
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:27,240
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

682
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,780
I understand you perfectly.

683
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:32,870
- You do?

684
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,030
- Of course.

685
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,830
You wanna have a sordid love
affair.

686
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,460
You wanna get into some
mischief.

687
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,360
Who are you?

688
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,320
What are you doing to me?

689
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,570
- I'm the love witch.

690
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,530
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

691
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,990
- That's right.

692
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
That's right.

693
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,380
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

694
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,420
- Who?

695
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,880
- Professor King.

696
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,640
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

697
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,470
He might be able to help me

698
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,300
identify some of the items we
found.

699
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:59,560
- It's great.

700
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,270
Did you get the lab report?

701
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,940
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like
heart failure.

702
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,190
But the toxicology report
showed traces of Jimson weed

703
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:12,360
also known as Devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

704
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,610
- It's unbelievable.

705
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,570
You want me to come with you?

706
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:19,280
- No, this will only take a few
minutes.

707
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,910
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

708
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,250
- Mustard, mayo?

709
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,540
- Yeah and cole slaw.

710
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:26,960
Thanks.

711
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
- Done.

712
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,100
- Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

713
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,600
- Glad to meet you, Professor.

714
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,310
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

715
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:52,480
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

716
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,070
- Interesting, yes.

717
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,450
Just as I thought.

718
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:00,370
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

719
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,580
- A witch bottle?

720
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,760
- Yes, witches used to make them

721
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,410
for protection against curses.

722
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,920
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

723
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,790
along with herbs and something
sharp

724
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:15,010
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

725
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:17,070
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearths

726
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:18,720
of very old houses.

727
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,430
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

728
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,470
was a witch?

729
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,470
- It's very likely.

730
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,770
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

731
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:29,190
has taken root again in cities.

732
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,190
There have several rituals per
year.

733
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:35,440
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

734
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,280
Other rituals celebrate
Summer Solstice, Litha,

735
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,120
or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

736
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:49,170
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

737
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,000
in a mockery of Christian
rituals.

738
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,170
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices
a child.

739
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,050
- Does this stuff really go on
today?

740
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,220
- Yes, indeed.

741
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:05,140
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

742
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,140
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

743
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,520
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

744
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,860
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

745
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,980
but they've been unsuccessful.

746
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:18,150
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

747
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:20,610
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

748
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,780
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

749
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,990
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

750
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,500
of both black and white witches

751
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,080
who practice the ancient rites.

752
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:05,200
- I invoke and call upon
thee, Mighty Mother of us all.

753
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:11,040
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

754
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,710
and priestess.

755
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,250
- Of the Mother Darksome and
Divine

756
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,840
here I charge you in this sign.

757
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,010
- Listen to the words of the
Great Mother.

758
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:32,690
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

759
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,440
Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
Isis,

760
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,360
and by many other names.

761
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,410
- Whenever ye have need of
anything,

762
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,580
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

763
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,870
who am Queen of all witches.

764
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:58,590
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

765
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,630
all sorcery.

766
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:05,260
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

767
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,180
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

768
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:13,350
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

769
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,110
Bagabi lacha bachabe.

770
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:26,570
Lamac cahi achababe.

771
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:30,830
Hurrahya! Hurrahya!

772
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,080
- Arise.

773
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,920
Eko, Eko, Azarak

774
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,260
Eko, Eko, Zomelak

775
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,970
Eko, Eko, Cernunnos

776
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,640
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

777
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,670
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

778
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,170
What's the matter?

779
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:27,550
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

780
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,970
- Well, have a drink and relax.

781
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:33,470
Nothing's that dire, at least
not for you.

782
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,850
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

783
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,730
- What victims?

784
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,480
- There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

785
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:46,530
- Please, don't touch me.

786
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:53,870
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

787
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,290
- Merry meet, Elaine.

788
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,500
How's it going?

789
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,500
- I'm back in the dating pool
again.

790
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,830
- What happened?

791
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,850
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

792
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,170
the married man.

793
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,260
- No, I broke it off.

794
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,970
He just became really obsessive,
morose,

795
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:13,720
and his aura became really
murky.

796
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,890
He didn't even wanna make love
anymore.

797
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:22,060
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

798
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,440
There was no polarity.

799
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,980
But, I should have known.

800
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,150
He's a Pisces.

801
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
- Richard?

802
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,000
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

803
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,400
when I'm working.

804
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,650
What do you want?

805
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,880
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

806
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,660
and I'm taking a pill.

807
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,050
Are you coming to bed?

808
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,340
- No.

809
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,560
I have some more work to do.

810
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,610
- All right, see you tomorrow,
then.

811
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,710
- Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

812
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,750
I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

813
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:29,790
- Okay.

814
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,470
- Does this look familiar to
you?

815
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,350
- It's a witch bottle.

816
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,650
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

817
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,060
- No, no I don't.

818
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,200
- Ever seen any of these in here
before?

819
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,320
- Yeah, we have some witch
bottles.

820
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,820
I'll show you one.

821
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,040
Here's one.

822
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,630
- How common are these bottles?

823
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,020
- I've never seen 'em in here
before until

824
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,930
a girl started supplying 'em to
us.

825
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,760
- Who is this girl?

826
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:27,020
- Her name is Elaine, Elaine
Parks.

827
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:55,210
- Who is it?

828
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,010
- Sergeant Meadows, Police
Department.

829
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,410
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

830
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,480
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

831
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,560
- About what?

832
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,770
- Well, it's a potential
homicide case.

833
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,520
Just a routine check.

834
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,030
I thought you might be able to
help us.

835
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,490
- Of course.

836
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,620
Please come in, Sergeant.

837
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,290
So you say there was a homicide.

838
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:36,750
How horrible.

839
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,380
Who was killed?

840
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,630
- A man named Wayne Peters.

841
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,930
Did you know Wayne Peters?

842
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:44,970
- No.

843
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,640
- Here's a picture of him.

844
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,180
Ever seen him before?

845
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,230
- No.

846
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,810
I guess I can't help you,
Sergeant.

847
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,690
Good bye.

848
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:57,190
- Ms. Parks, wait.

849
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:07,740
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

850
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,950
- It's a Magic Bottle.

851
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,370
I made it myself.

852
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,500
- Have you ever seen one
containing urine?

853
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,540
- Urine?

854
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,750
No.

855
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:33,520
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

856
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,150
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

857
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,110
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, Sergeant?

858
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,990
- Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

859
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,370
- Yes, I am.

860
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,040
Is there a law against that?

861
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,880
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

862
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,170
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

863
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,090
capable of murder even?

864
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,680
- No, I wasn't trying to
imply...

865
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,890
- Sergeant Meadows, do
you know what it's like

866
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,310
to really suffer?

867
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:14,310
You have to fight and fight

868
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:17,440
until you're too exhausted to go
on.

869
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,440
Witchcraft is my religion,
Sergeant.

870
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:25,240
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

871
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,400
saved my life.

872
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:44,760
- Ms. Parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

873
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,510
I didn't realize.

874
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,060
- That's all right, Sergeant
Meadows.

875
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,480
- You can call me Griff.

876
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,820
- Griff?

877
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:10,280
I know I've seen you before.

878
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,990
I just don't know where.

879
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,330
- I have that same feeling.

880
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,040
- I know.

881
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,590
You're the man in the cards.

882
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,170
You're my fate.

883
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:32,300
- What do you mean, I'm your
fate?

884
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,390
- I did a Celtic Cross reading.

885
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:38,810
For my future card I got Knight
of Wands.

886
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:45,150
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

887
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:48,690
I would soon meet the man
that I'm going to marry.

888
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,530
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

889
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,780
Do you like animals, Griff?

890
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,410
- Why yes, I love animals.

891
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,370
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

892
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,000
I'm very fond of.

893
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,670
You know, tomorrow is my day off

894
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,340
and it's supposed to be quite
nice out.

895
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:12,380
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

896
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,720
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

897
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,690
- Oh Patchouli, you're such a
sweetheart.

898
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,670
- How's my girl?

899
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,880
- Am I your girl?

900
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,090
- For today you are.

901
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,810
You're my girl and there's
nobody around

902
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,550
to tell me otherwise.

903
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,470
- Except me.

904
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,390
- And what's that supposed to
mean?

905
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:42,640
- Nothing.

906
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:45,440
Kiss me.

907
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,700
- What's that sound?

908
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,450
- I don't know.

909
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,080
Let's go see.

910
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:27,830
- Now is the time of the Summer
Solstice.

911
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:30,960
The strength of the Oak King is
waning.

912
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,130
And the Holly King stands
ready to challenge him

913
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,880
for the hand of the Green
Maiden.

914
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,720
- Let the battle begin.

915
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,720
- Your season is over old man.

916
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,600
- Oh never.

917
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,110
- I will have her.

918
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,210
- Never have her.

919
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,070
- Never.

920
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:07,830
- Holly King, I name you the
victor.

921
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:09,870
The Green Maiden is yours.

922
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:10,910
- M'lady.

923
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,460
Come on.

924
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,880
- Elaine.

925
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,220
- You know these people?

926
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,010
- Well yes, in a way.

927
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,260
- All hail, fair Lord and Lady.

928
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:29,270
Welcome to our little gathering.

929
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,310
- All hail.

930
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,080
- We are the good people
of the Renaissance

931
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,230
and Medieval players and we
are celebrating the Midsummer.

932
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,730
Won't you join us?

933
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:41,320
- To be sure, fair consorts.

934
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,700
- They are charming, are they
not?

935
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,540
- Yes, quite charming.

936
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,500
- I see two people in love.

937
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,750
This calls for a wedding.

938
01:23:57,790 --> 01:23:58,750
- A wedding?

939
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,010
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you
will.

940
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,170
To honor the gods of love.

941
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:14,730
♫ Love is a magical thing

942
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:19,360
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

943
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,950
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

944
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:28,120
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

945
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,750
♫ Love is a magical thing

946
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,340
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

947
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:43,590
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

948
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:47,590
♫ But pretending is also real

949
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,850
♫ There's a lady in a castle

950
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:57,190
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

951
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:01,070
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

952
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:04,280
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

953
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,160
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

954
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,780
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

955
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:14,080
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

956
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,670
♫ Just to have you near me

957
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,800
♫ Love is a magical thing

958
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,970
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

959
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,470
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

960
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:36,640
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫

961
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:06,670
- Okay.

962
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,050
- Now, ye are wed.

963
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,520
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

964
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:15,220
- I'm not in love.

965
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,100
It's not that I don't have
sentiment,

966
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,010
it's just that love is soft.

967
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,100
You need guts in this business.

968
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,410
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

969
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:25,060
and got soft inside.

970
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:27,360
I want an heir some day

971
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,980
and then I would need to have a
wife,

972
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,190
but love is something else.

973
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:34,030
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

974
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:36,610
It's like he's not even a man
anymore.

975
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,870
I never wanna get like that.

976
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,660
- When you really love him,

977
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,370
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

978
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:49,290
You love all the little quirks
about him.

979
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,710
The way he slurps his cereal.

980
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:55,050
The way his mouth is a little
crooked.

981
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:59,180
Those details about him
become your whole life.

982
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,770
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

983
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:06,810
and you realize that you
have more love to give

984
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:09,730
than you ever thought was
possible.

985
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,860
'Cause the more you know him,

986
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,900
the more you love him.

987
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,880
- The more
you get to know a woman,

988
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:21,490
the less you can feel about her.

989
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:24,080
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

990
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,420
who fulfills all you're wildest
fantasies.

991
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:30,460
Then she starts to reveal little
flaws

992
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,380
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

993
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:37,970
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

994
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,850
No woman could ever fulfill it.

995
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:45,020
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

996
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:49,020
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

997
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,070
drowning in estrogen.

998
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,360
The most awful feeling.

999
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,830
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

1000
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:08,160
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

1001
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,420
Some other time.

1002
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:18,780
- Hey Griff, I got more
information

1003
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,390
on that Elaine Parks girl.

1004
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,680
- You leave it on my desk.

1005
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,930
- Don't you wanna hear it?

1006
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:27,350
- Steve, Captain wants
us to lay off the case.

1007
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,770
- Are you serious?

1008
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:32,440
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1009
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,860
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1010
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,690
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

1011
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,530
- Even if they murder?

1012
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:41,220
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

1013
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,780
was a heart attack.

1014
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,580
I think so too.

1015
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,870
- Has everyone gone crazy around
here?

1016
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,040
Let me at least tell you what I
found.

1017
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:01,760
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1018
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,760
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1019
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,510
Two years later they were
divorced

1020
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,100
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1021
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,270
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1022
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:12,730
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1023
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:22,360
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1024
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,030
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1025
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:29,200
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1026
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,580
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1027
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,170
The police questioned Elaine

1028
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:37,960
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1029
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,760
- Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1030
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,720
what happened there is
none of our business.

1031
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,430
- Are you serious?

1032
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,890
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1033
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,970
and you better watch her.

1034
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,640
- You mean because she's a
witch?

1035
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,520
That doesn't mean anything.

1036
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:57,570
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1037
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:59,000
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters

1038
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:00,740
got the Devil's weed?

1039
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:04,030
- I questioned Ms. Curtis about
that.

1040
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:06,990
There was Devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1041
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,700
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1042
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,830
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1043
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:13,210
We have a possible murder here

1044
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:15,880
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1045
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,250
- I told you, we're laying off
her.

1046
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:21,010
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1047
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,420
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1048
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,800
Get the hell off my back.

1049
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:32,890
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1050
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:08,890
- Richard.

1051
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,430
Richard!

1052
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,980
Richard!

1053
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,390
Richard!

1054
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,650
- Thank you for meeting me,
Elaine.

1055
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,570
It's not good for me to be alone
too much.

1056
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:10,160
I know you're busy.

1057
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,200
- Of course.

1058
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,160
I wanted to come.

1059
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:19,120
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1060
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,380
- You can't blame yourself.

1061
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,380
You were a good wife to Richard.

1062
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,300
- I tried to be.

1063
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:31,970
I tried so hard to please him,

1064
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,310
but I should have tried harder.

1065
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:39,480
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1066
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,810
Maybe you were right.

1067
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,690
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1068
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:53,240
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1069
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,700
Maybe I was being naive,

1070
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,540
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1071
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,790
But now, now I wish...

1072
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,680
- You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1073
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:12,550
You have to let go.

1074
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:17,220
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1075
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:20,730
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1076
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:23,730
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1077
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:27,480
I hated him so much for that.

1078
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,650
I wanted to kill them both.

1079
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,490
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1080
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:39,540
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1081
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:44,250
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1082
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:46,790
- Hey,

1083
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,750
hey.

1084
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:52,470
- Enough about me.

1085
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:56,260
What's going on with you?

1086
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,010
- Trish, I'm in love.

1087
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,640
- Who is he?

1088
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:06,110
- He's a detective and he's
everything

1089
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,320
a woman could ever want.

1090
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,820
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1091
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:17,950
I just know that he's the one.

1092
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,160
He even gave me this ring.

1093
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:23,410
I call it my magic ring.

1094
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,420
It's not an engagement ring

1095
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:29,590
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1096
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:46,270
- When we first came here

1097
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,770
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1098
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,690
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1099
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,110
It's too painful.

1100
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:00,490
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1101
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:03,950
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1102
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,710
The first day we met,

1103
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,880
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1104
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,800
and you were all alone.

1105
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,470
Now it's the reverse.

1106
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,260
Life is funny, isn't it?

1107
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:23,720
- Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta
go.

1108
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:26,640
Would you like to walk out with
me?

1109
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:30,400
- No, I'd like to stay and
finish my tea.

1110
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,440
- All right.

1111
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,740
Take care, love.

1112
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:17,950
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1113
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:20,450
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1114
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:23,910
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1115
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:25,580
See you in a minute.

1116
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:50,110
- You bitch.

1117
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:53,780
You killed my husband.

1118
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:59,450
Bitch, skank, whore.

1119
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,890
You'll burn for this.

1120
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:28,020
- Crash, crash, crash.

1121
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:33,780
Die, die, die.

1122
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,700
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1123
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:41,580
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1124
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:45,290
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

1125
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:49,380
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1126
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:53,380
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1127
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:24,620
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1128
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,880
with a heady lovers' brew.

1129
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,380
Even should they strive to flee

1130
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:33,960
they'll cling for all eternity.

1131
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:46,810
- Scotch.

1132
01:46:03,790 --> 01:46:05,540
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1133
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,340
Who are those new girls?

1134
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,970
They can't dance at all.

1135
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:18,470
And they're weird.

1136
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:27,640
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1137
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,770
- They're friends of the
witches.

1138
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:32,020
I seen them come in together
before.

1139
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,690
- Yeah, the witches.

1140
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,690
They're everywhere.

1141
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:38,860
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1142
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,030
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1143
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:42,660
- Did you read about the teacher

1144
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,200
buried in the back yard of his
cabin?

1145
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,500
They said it was done by the
witches.

1146
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,000
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1147
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:52,170
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1148
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:54,460
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1149
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,500
Creepy.

1150
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,900
- Sit down, Elaine.

1151
01:47:22,490 --> 01:47:25,700
Elaine, the DNA came back from
the lab.

1152
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,830
It connects you with Wayne
Peters.

1153
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:36,130
Patricia Manning came by the
station.

1154
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,880
With some things of yours.

1155
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,970
Including this.

1156
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:46,640
She said you drove her husband
to suicide.

1157
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,980
- So, I was a bad girl.

1158
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,900
Are you going to punish me?

1159
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:59,820
- What sort of person are you,
Elaine?

1160
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:03,490
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1161
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,030
- Why are you so negative?

1162
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:07,780
I didn't kill anyone.

1163
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,700
Wayne died of heart failure

1164
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:14,330
after a beautiful night of
lovemaking.

1165
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,880
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1166
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:21,590
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1167
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,970
that they were experiencing with
me.

1168
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:26,600
- Are you saying these men died
of love?

1169
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,760
That's insane.

1170
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:31,640
What about the spells and the
drugs?

1171
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,190
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1172
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:38,150
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1173
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:41,190
It can only work with
what's already there.

1174
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:44,860
I just use sex magic to create
love magic.

1175
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:48,490
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1176
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:51,620
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1177
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,660
- Love?

1178
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:56,170
What do you know about love?

1179
01:48:56,540 --> 01:49:00,670
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1180
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:02,590
or worse.

1181
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:04,970
- Don't diagnose me.

1182
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,260
Maybe you're a narcissist who
can't love.

1183
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:12,100
You think that I'm sick

1184
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:15,310
because you've never loved like
I have.

1185
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:18,650
Well, I would do anything for
love.

1186
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:24,440
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1187
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:28,620
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1188
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,530
it's not enough for you.

1189
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:32,620
You're like a bottomless hole.

1190
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:36,790
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford Wife thing

1191
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:40,920
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1192
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,050
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1193
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,090
I don't love you.

1194
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,350
- How can you stand there and
boast

1195
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:59,600
about being immune to love?

1196
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:04,360
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1197
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:08,320
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1198
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:11,280
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1199
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,950
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1200
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:20,080
If you would just love us for
ourselves,

1201
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:23,920
but you won't.

1202
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,590
My ex-husband was just like you.

1203
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:33,640
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1204
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:37,640
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1205
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:41,770
except when men wanted to use my
body.

1206
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,230
So, I decided to find my own
power.

1207
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:50,570
And I found that power through
witchcraft.

1208
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,410
That means that I take
what I need from men

1209
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:56,830
and not the other way around.

1210
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:01,370
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1211
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,960
It won't work this time.

1212
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:09,930
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1213
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:10,970
- What for?

1214
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:15,810
Marrying a lover according to my
religion?

1215
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:17,720
Seducing a married man?

1216
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:20,730
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned

1217
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:23,810
for a thing like that, but not
today.

1218
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:28,530
- No, not burned,

1219
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,530
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1220
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:38,410
and we'll find out more.

1221
01:51:39,870 --> 01:51:43,670
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1222
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:48,210
- Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live.

1223
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,260
- Burn the witch.

1224
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:56,470
- Burn the witch.

1225
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:58,640
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1226
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,860
- Burn!

1227
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:49,690
- Burn her.

1228
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,530
- Burn.

1229
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,570
Burn.

1230
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:18,050
- Poor baby.

1231
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:20,430
Poor, poor baby.

1232
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,440
Don't worry, everything will be
okay

1233
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:33,940
because I love you so much.

1234
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:06,540
- I love you, Elaine.

1235
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,710
- I love you, Elaine.

1236
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,630
- I love you, Elaine.

1237
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,030
- I love you, Elaine.

1238
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:30,120
I've never loved anyone but you.

1239
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,580
I want to marry you.

1240
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,380
♫ Love is a magical thing

1241
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,130
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

1242
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:34,720
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

1243
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:38,890
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

1244
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,570
♫ Love is a magical thing

1245
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:50,110
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

1246
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:54,320
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

1247
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:58,290
♫ But pretending is also real

1248
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:04,630
♫ There's a lady in a castle

1249
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:07,800
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

1250
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:11,590
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

1251
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:14,970
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

1252
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:17,890
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

1253
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:21,350
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

1254
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:24,810
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

1255
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:28,400
♫ Just to have you near me

1256
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:33,450
♫ Love is a magical thing

1257
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:38,700
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

1258
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:42,870
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

1259
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:47,250
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫
