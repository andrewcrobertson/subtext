awful bag a' his.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

722
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,557
Let me guess.

723

don't listen to their parents or...

724
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,558
Wrong, Patty. (SCOFFS)

725
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,297
It's the good kids he wants.

726
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,630
The shiny ones and the dreamers.

727
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,568
Once they catch his
eye, or grab his fancy,

728
00:52:24,502 --> 00:52:26,334
he won't rest until he has them

729
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,076
slung over his bony shoulder.

730

that's never gonna come.

731

732
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,984
Damn right, I'm trying
to scare you, boy.

out of your fingers,</i>

736
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:44,688
and gobble the rest of you down!

737
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,659

00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,503

740

741
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:26,766
Yep.

742
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:40,751
BARBARA: That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

743
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,615
Pat's was so intense,

744
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:46,183
I felt it was
crucial to give him

745
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:48,584
as much context as possible

746
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:50,952
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

747
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,268
As you can see, the
so-called Bag or Sackman,

748
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:05,307
is a figure common to
almost every culture.

749
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,210
Curiously, his methodology,

750
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:11,742
even the phenomena that
accompany his presence,

751
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:15,410
are remarkably consistent.

752
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:17,677
He has the power to paralyze

753
00:54:17,678 --> 00:54:20,516
and incapacitate
parents and adults

754
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,223
leaving their young
ones vulnerable.

755
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:26,421
And he feeds off the
child's fear and anxiety.

756
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:30,727
It sustains him, nourishes him.

757
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:34,928
He can lure children to his
lair with toys or candy...

758
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:38,403
And when the child is
at their most terrified,

759
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:41,772
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

760
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,238
Are you trying to
make us feel stupid?

761
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,741
On the contrary.

762
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:49,910
I never told Karina about
the Bagman, Barbara,

763
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,582
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

764
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,155
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

765
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:58,726
you're projecting
the supernatural

766
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:00,422
onto something...

767
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:03,592

with the real stuff

769

771
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:14,569

vulnerability, and violation,

with you and Liam at the mine?

A lock of your hair?

Yeah. Bagman
supposedly always snips

one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

where to find you.

I think in his own way he was
just trying to protect me.

A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

821
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:46,457
All I remember was
Mom was furious

822
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,293
'cause every night
I was convinced

823
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:49,564
he was tapping on my window.

824
00:57:50,528 --> 00:57:52,595
And then one night,

825
00:57:52,596 --> 00:57:54,965
the old man came in and he said,

826
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,806
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing as Bagman."

What I can do...

829
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:14,754
is tell you a secret he
don't want you to know.

832
00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:23,994
he has weaknesses as well.

Escape his grasp long
enough, he'll rot away.

that means more to them than
anything else in the world.

839
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:51,087
Something they love so much,

840
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,597
it literally becomes a
piece of who they are.

841
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:57,896
And believe you me,

842
00:58:58,695 --> 00:59:00,030
a child's love...

843
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,568

humblest object...
