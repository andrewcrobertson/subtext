1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,700
<i>There is a creature alive today,</i>

2
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:08,457
<i>who has survived millions
of years of evolution</i>

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,269
<i>without change, without passion,</i>

4
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,438
<i>and without logic.</i>

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,664
<i>It lives to kill.</i>

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,195
<i>A mindless eating machine.</i>

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,474
<i>It will attack and devour...</i>

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:27,003
<i>â€œanything-</i>

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,987
<i>It is as if God created the Devil</i>

10
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,378
<i>and gave him jaws.</i>

11
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:50,591
<i>This is Universal's
extraordinary motion picture version</i>

12
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,651
<i>of Peter Benchley's best-selling novel:</i>

13
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,380
Jaws.

14
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:58,272
<i>I just</i> found out

15
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,709
<i>that a girl got killed here last week.</i>

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,393
<i>And you knew it.</i>

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,873
<i>You knew there was a shark out there.</i>

18
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,660
<i>You knew it was dangerous.</i>

19
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,885
<i>But you let people go swimming anyway.</i>

20
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:21,307
Did you see that?

21
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,435
Everybody out!

22
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,686
<i>It's all psychological.</i>

23
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,202
You yell, "Barracuda!" and
everybody says, "Huh? What?"

24
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:33,789
You yell, "Shark!"

25
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,163
<i>We've got a panic on our
hands on the Fourth of July.</i>

26
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,210
Is it true that most people get attacked

27
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,210
by sharks in three feet of water

28
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,996
about 10 feet from the beach?

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,083
Yeah.

30
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:48,848
<i>What we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.</i>

31
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:52,293
We have to close the beach
and hire someone to kill the shark!

32
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,488
Bad fish.

33
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,708
But I'll catch him and kill him.

34
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,401
Did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

35
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,914
This shark, swallow you whole.

36
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,232
You're going to need a bigger boat.

37
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,187
That's a 20-footer.

38
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,560
Twenty-five.

39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,843
Three tons of him.

40
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,002
He's coming straight for
us. Don't screw it up now.

41
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,006
Don't wait for me.
Now!

42
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,666
<i>Show.</i>

43
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,848
Watch the keel!

44
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,481
Give him room.

45
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,215
I can't, it's trying to run!

46
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,536
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!

47
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,708
Hurry!

48
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,874
We're breaking up!

49
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,448
<i>Everybody out of the water.</i>

50
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,718
<i>None of man's fantasies of evil</i>

51
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,293
<i>can compare with the reality of Jaws.</i>

52
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,474
<i>See it before you go swimming.</i>
