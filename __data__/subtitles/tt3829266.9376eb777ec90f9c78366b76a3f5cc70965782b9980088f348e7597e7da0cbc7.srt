00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,828
(predator clicking)

3
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,787
(crackling)

4
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,628
(insects trilling)

5
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,218
HAINES (on radio): Picket One, copy.

6
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,686
Do you got eyes on the hostages?

7
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,355
Still negative.

8
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,790
DUPREE (on radio): 20 bucks says they don't show.

9
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,759
You two morons really making bets

10
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,595
on whether a drug cartel has executed these hostages?

11
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,329
DUPREE: Abso-fucking-lutely.

12
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,964
HAINES: I believe that was implied. Yeah.

13
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,799
Just checking. I'm in for 20.

14
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,886
(indistinct chatter)

15
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,321
QUINN: I got two hostages.

16
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,427
No crosswind.

17
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,797
I'm not waiting. 10-50, out.

18
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,237
(spaceship whirring)

19
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,943
-(gunshot) -(groans)

20
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,889
(grunting)

21
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,029
(yells, grunts)

22
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,907
(grunts)

23
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,676
(radio beeps)

24
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,545
Bluebill Two, are you out there?

25
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,280
Over.

26
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,398
(engine slowly powering down)

27
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,912
-(rustling) -(gasps)

28
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,682
Goddamn it!

29
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,052
Dupree, Jesus!

30
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,021
(pants) Where's Haines?

31
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,856
Don't know. Comm's not fucking working.

32
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,992
Give me the pack.

33
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,832
It's evidence.

34
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,767
Ain't nobody gonna believe this one.

35
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,674
The fuck is that, Cap?

36
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,078
It's above our pay grade.

37
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,548
-(radio beeps) -Haines! Come in. Over.

38
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,049
(grunts)

39
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,654
Haines, goddamn it, come in. Over! (echoes)

40
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,623
(clicking sound)

41
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,691
Sir?

42
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,827
(quiet crackling)

43
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,562
PREDATOR (distorted voice): The fuck is that, Cap?

44
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,663
The fuck is that, Cap?

45
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,064
Comm's not fucking working.

46
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,603
-(birds squawking) -(gasps)

47
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,641
Haines?

48
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,846
Light it up!

49
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,814
(gun firing)

50
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,454

51
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,091

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,697

56
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,038

57
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,714
(helicopter whirring)

58
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,090

59
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,235
(panting)

60
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,213
(indistinct radio chatter)

61
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,725
Gentlemen, remember...

62
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,794
they're large, they're fast,

63
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,129
and fucking you up's their idea of tourism!

64
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:18,965
Go!

65
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,800
SOLDIER: Eyes up! Come on!

66
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,302
I want the passenger. I want the pod.

67
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,270
If it's not from here...

68
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,671
-You want it. -...I want it.

69
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,717
(mariachi music playing)

70
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,784
(clears throat)

71
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,291
(speaks Spanish)

72
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,099
(in English) I need help.

73
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,967
And I have money.

74
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,203
(speaks Spanish)

75
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,306
(in English) All right.

76
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,351
(gasps)

77
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,393
I need you to mail this for me.

78
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,361
You send it to this address.

79
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,731
Mail what's in the pack, not the backpack.

80
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,199
Ahora. Go!

81
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,006
(sirens blaring in distance)

82
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,342
Okay.

83
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,784
-(thudding) -(cops shouting indistinctly)

84
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,252
COP: Back up!

85
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,020
GIRL: It was so amazing!

86
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,288
Yeah, it was.

87
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,825
Bye, Mom!

88
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,084
(exclaims)

89
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,222
-(laughs) Do it, man. -No, you do it.

90
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,290
Okay.

91
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,759
-Do it. -(both laughing)

92
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,294
(alarm blaring)

93
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,131
(alarm continues blaring)

94
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,033
(whimpering)

95
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,339
(continues whimpering)

96
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,907
(both laughing)

97
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,377
Oh, shit.

98
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,080
Looky, looky, loo.

99
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,782
Hey, EJ, you hungry?

100
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,184
I'm hungry for an ass-burger.

101
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,719
Mmm. Sounds delicious.

102
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,122
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

103
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,224
-EJ: Oh, yeah. -(whimpering)

104
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,761
The hell are you doing?

105
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,997
-DEREK: He's a goner. -All right.

106
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,418
-(dog barking) -(gasps)

107
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,392
(door closes)

108
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,970
(doorbell rings)

109
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,944
Hi, there.

110
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,279
Does, uh, Quinn McKenna live here?

111
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,483
His post office box payments are past due.

112
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,552
Department of Defense.

113
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,021
He works for the government, does he?

114
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,458
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

115
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,927
Military designation.

116
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,430
-Ah. -He kills people...

117
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,366
so you can be a mailman.

118
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,148
Dr. Brackett?

119
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,191
I understand you enjoy stargazing?

120
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,428
My men will take care of your dog.

121
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,596
Will you come with me, please?

122
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,409
What am I looking at?

123
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,246
It's exactly what you think it is. Yeah.

124
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,450
They've been here before.

125
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,619
'87. '97.

126
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,425
Lately, the visits are increasing in frequency.

127
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,306
EMILY: Rory, I'm home! Hey, I got you something.

128
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,474
Hey.

129
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,080
Did you do one of these after school?

130
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,582
I did all of them.

131
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,084
Oh. Okay.

132
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,055
Well, I got you two options.

133
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,324
We have...

134
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,160
pirate, or...

135
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,563
Frankenstein.

136
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,968
Frankenstein, you know, green skin?

137
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,303
Threw a girl to see if she would float?

138
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,506
No. Okay.

139
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,909
Well, let's go with pirate. Yeah?

140
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,444
This is dumb.

141
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,513
The guys will...

142
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,049
They will still be able to see.

143
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,385
See what?

144
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,387
That it's me.

145
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,125
PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once quoted as saying,

146
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,194
"I dropped from my mother's womb...

147
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,196
I hit the floor...

148
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,031
and I started crawling

149
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,433
through hostile territory toward my grave."

150
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,335
(laughing)

151
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,670
QUINN: About right, yeah.

152
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,739
-That's badass. -It's pretty morbid.

153
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,040
It's pretty dark.

154
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,477
What's with the polygraph?

155
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,945
I thought this was a psych eval.

156
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,314
We need to know if you pose a threat.

157
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,482
Oh, I'm a sniper.

158
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,418
Isn't posing a threat kind of the fucking point?

159
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,322
You spend most of your time now in-country...

160
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,624
estranged from your wife and son?

161
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,296
(sighs)

162
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,098
Look, I get it.

163
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,069
Something went down in Mexico and nobody wants any witnesses.

164
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,037
Excuse me?

165
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,572
You're not here to find out if I'm crazy.

166
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,375
You wanna make sure the label sticks.

167
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,977
So, you feel you're being railroaded?

168
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,413
I can see the tracks on the floor!

169
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,749
I don't see tracks on the floor, for the record.

170
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,718
You feel like you're a stranger

171
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,286
on your own planet, don't you, Captain?

172
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,157
Like an alien, you mean?

173
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,095
That's what you wanted.

174
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,732
Do I get a cookie now?

175
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,667
He saw something.

176
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,002
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah.

177
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,782
Wow!

178
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,596
Ow.

179
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,139
(beeps)

180
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,552
(device trilling)

181
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,392
(exhales deeply)

182
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,829
You shove me again, I'm gonna break your neck.

183
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,165
Did I say that out loud?

184
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,137
-(Quinn clears throat) -McKenna.

185
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,141
OFFICER: Last one.

186
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,576
Thanks for your kindness. Thank you.

187
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,550
(sighs)

188
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,153
(keys jangling)

189
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,428
Oh, yeah?

190
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,299
(Baxley mumbles)

191
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,901
(clicks and sniffs)

192
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,870
You all right over there?

193
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,905
No, don't worry about him. He's just got Tourettes.

194
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,907
-He can't control it. -Fuck you, Coyle.

195
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,476
You get used to it, bro.

196
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,449
Welcome to Group Two.

197
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,817
Oh, yeah? What's that?

198
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,952
Like a unit?

199
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,687
No, group. Group Two.

200
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,655
Group therapy, room two.

201
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,191
Oh.

202
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,759
-McKenna. -Nebraska Williams.

203
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,894
That's your real name?

204
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:49,761
Gaylord.

205
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,164
-That's a good call, then. -Yeah, I thought so.

206
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,599
(chuckles)

207
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,867
Where did you serve?

208
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,469
Operation Enduring Freedom, '03.

209
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,739
Went for the Taliban, stayed for the opium.

210
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,808
(laughing)

211
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,246
That's Coyle. Friendly fire incident.

212
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,215
Got turned around, fired at one of his own vehicles.

213
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,584
Now, he tells jokes.

214
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,719
(Coyle clears throat)

215
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,854
-(thuds) -(grunts) That's Lynch.

216
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,490
Got a medal for blowing up half a mountain in Mosul.

217
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,392
Entropy.

218
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,427
That's my game.

219
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,630
Things like to fall apart

220
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,698
and I... make it happen.

221
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,701
Just... Just like that.

222
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,937
-(gasping) -Ooh! Wow! Oh.

223
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,840
-Hey. -Hey. Don't.

224
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,843
Don't.

225
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,444
That's Nettles.

226
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,780
(stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.

227
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,882
Did three tours flying Hueys.

228
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,318
He loves his Bible. Hey, Netty?

229
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,853
Is it end times yet?

230
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,087
Yeah, laugh all you want.

231
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,490
But when you're standing at attention before your Maker...

232
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,525
I always stand at attention before I make her.

233
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,327
-(whistles) -(laughter)

234
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,795
God makes shitty people.

235
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,597
Yeah.

236
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,832
I mean, why do you think people make war?

237
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,434
Why, Baxley? Why do we make war?

238
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,770
-Come on, Baxley! -Because fuck-cock-cock!

239
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,772
-Because we fuck cock-cock? -Yes, we fuck cocks.

240
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,006
That's it, because we fuck cocks,

241
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,474
that's why. We get upset.

242
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,944
How'd you snag a ticket on this shitmobile?

243
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,279
Put a bullet in a CO.

244
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,682
Any particular reason?

245
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,651
He was an asshole.

246
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,009
Keep your head down.

247
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,719
Here, throw this on.

248
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,925
(bell rings)

249
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,829
Is it just your imagination?

250
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,432
Or is this haunted room actually stretching?

251
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,068
Every fucking time?

252
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,504
(elevator dings)

253
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,673
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your attention, please.

254
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,377
The GRC meeting has been moved to section 3, room A.

255
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,479
Aha! There you are!

256
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,349
Welcome. I'm Sean Keyes.

257
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,852
Wow. I heard you basically wrote the book

258
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,420
on evolutionary biology.

259
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,988
Um, I'm sorry, can I just...

260
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,490
Is that...?

261
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,694
Oh, my God!

262
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,731
(chuckles nervously) Holy shit.

263
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,767
That's alien technology.

264
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,737
This is what you brought me here to see?

265
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,040
KEYES: Well, yeah.

266
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,510
Can I... Can I see this? Can I get into this?

267
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
Doc.

268
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,780
Let's go.

269
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,882
(indistinct PA announcement)

270
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,361
-TRAEGER: Everything good? -Yes, sir.

271
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,697
TRAEGER: What is it?

272
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,766
Dr. Brackett.

273
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,035
Would you like to meet a Predator?

274
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,137
(chuckles) Come on.

275
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,081
WOMAN (on PA): Please observe

276
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,949
decontamination protocol.

277
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,652
KEYES: So, how'd they rope you into this?

278
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,121
I wrote a letter to the president when I was six.

279
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,656
Told him how much I loved animals,

280
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,124
and that if NASA ever found a space animal,

281
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,726
they should call me.

282
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,795
Couple years ago, I was put on a short list

283
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,630
for a paper I wrote on hybrid strains.

284
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,167
Computer cross-referenced the letter, and... here I am.

285
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,471
(machine whirring)

286
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,110
Dr. Brackett.

287
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,746
Thanks for coming.

288
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,013
I'm sure you have questions.

289
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,883
-Oh. Just two, actually. -Okay.

290
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,852
Why do you call it "the Predator"?

291
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,054
It's a nickname.

292
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,657
You know, the data suggests that it tracks its prey.

293
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,126
Exploits weakness.

294
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,894
Seems to...

295
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,629
well, enjoy it.

296
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,131
Like a game.

297
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,166
That's not a predator, that's a sports hunter.

298
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,467
Sorry?

299
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,703
A predator kills its prey to survive.

300
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,607
I mean, what you're describing is more like a bass fisherman.

301
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,609
Well, we took a vote. Predator's cooler, right?

302
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,544
-SAPIR: Fuck yeah. -Fuck yeah.

303
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,679
Found his escape pod in Mexico.

304
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,448
Still looking for the ship he came in.

305
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,683
He's heavily sedated.

306
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,758
You are one beautiful motherfucker.

307
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,595
I'm gonna guess your second question is, why are you here?

308
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,867
Our test results yielded something a little... odd.

309
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,171
(scoffs) Is this a joke?

310
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,073
KEYES: We ran the genome sequence ten times.

311
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,009
This specimen has...

312
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,777
-Human DNA? -Yeah.

313
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,611
Yeah.

314
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,781
Look, we know about spontaneous speciation.

315
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,249
Mostly plants and insects, but...

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,019
But some mammals, sheep, goats, uh...

317
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:14,753
Yeah.

318
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,788
KEYES: The red wolf is known to be a hybrid

319
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:17,856
between the coyote and the grey wolf...

320
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,559
Or possibly some form of recombinant technology...

321
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,828
Guys, guys, guys. I get it, I get it.

322
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,497
You wanna know if someone fucked an alien?

323
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,834
Yeah.

324
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,738
Okay, it's got some kind of atmospheric mask,

325
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,473
biohelmet, and...

326
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,042
What are these? Like, some kind of wrist gauntlets?

327
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,109
Exactly.

328
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,979
So, where's the helmet and the other gauntlet?

329
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,013
We've looked, believe me.

330
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,784
Who is this?

331
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,587
He made first contact with the Predator.

332
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,255
Great. I'd like to talk to him.

333
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,692
Well, he's being evaluated, so...

334
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,063
Okay.

335
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,564
Well, before you lobotomize him,

336
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,166
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

337
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,170
MAN (on radio): We have a request to reroute.

338
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,806
OFFICER: Read you five-by-five. Destination?

339
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,975
Starkweather Dam. Proceed at once.

340
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,877
You'll be met by military personnel. Over.

341
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,913
COYLE: Hey, Baxley!

342
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,648
Question for ya.

343
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,983
All right, here we go.

344
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,085
How do you circumcise a homeless man?

345
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,186
Here it comes.

346
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,121
Kick your mom in the chin. (chuckles)

347
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,856
Fuck your mother... Fuck your mother...

348
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,758
-(imitates barking) -(laughter)

349
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,827
-Shut the fuck up! -WILLIAMS: All right.

350
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,061
You shut the fuck up.

351
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,997
(laughter)

352
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,666
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Y'all going too fucking much.

353
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,701
I just wanna know who this motherfucker is.

354
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,069
Why are you here?

355
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,841
Come on, man, this is the loony bus.

356
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,376
-Look at this motherfucker. -LYNCH: Loonies!

357
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,777
Loonies, yeah. (ululates)

358
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,279
Ah... (sighs)

359
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,081
I had a run-in with a space alien.

360
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,284
Oh, shit!

361
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,185
(all laughing)

362
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,820
-No, let him... -COYLE: Okay, that guy wins.

363
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,955
That's the best story I've ever heard.

364
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:57,722
Classic story...

365
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,025
That's the winner right there. Fuckin' hell.

366
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,960
Would you shut the fuck up?

367
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,228
Oh.

368
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,365
They want to put a lid on it,

369
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,935
so here I am.

370
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,236
Stuck in Group Two.

371
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,371
The sequel to Group One, only stupider.

372
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,707
Oh, huh.

373
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,977
(laughing)

374
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,211
NETTLES: Give this man a fuckin' cigar.

375
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,279
Shut the fuck up.

376
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,214
"Would you shut the fuck up?"

377
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,750
(laughter continues)

378
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,053
COYLE: It's a conspiracy.

379
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,322
The goddamn space aliens, huh?

380
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,978

381
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,384

385
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,133
EMILY: What are you doing down there, Rory?

386
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,237
Uh, just... just playing games.

387
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,839
EMILY: Well, dinner's getting cold.

388
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,807
(trilling)

389
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,844
Major?

390
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,779
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

391
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,082
One second it's on the grid, the next it's ghosting.

392
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,051
GENERAL (sighs): Damn it.

393
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,153
We need something in the air.

394
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,755
Get me NORAD.

395
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,424
I feel like I'm missing something in the research.

396
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,825
There's something I'm just not seeing.

397
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,062
Look, if this is the blood, okay, I think--

398
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,231
can you just tell me what that is?

399
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,932
Because I was trying

400
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,868
to get into this earlier, but somebody stopped me.

401
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,403
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

402
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,438
-That guy actually. -KEYES: Hold that thought.

403
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,240
Sir, NORAD's reporting a 202 anomaly

404
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,741
possibly heading our direction.

405
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,176
Is it coming here?

406
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,177
God, I hope not.

407
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,382

408
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,521

410
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,694
How far away are we talking about?

411
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,962
MAN: Unknown. But it's definitely heading your way.

412

This is not a drill.

455
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,178
Sit tight. There's been a breach.

456
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,413

Don't let him get away.

Alien.

Your green boy?

Yep.

474
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,275
Goddamn space aliens.

475
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,410
What? What?

476
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,178
Did you not just fucking see that, man?

Nettles, be quiet.

Hey!

That's the thing that killed my men.

Yeah, they'll do that.

485
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,395
We gotta get off this thing. We gotta move.

486

Brother, it's a bus.

487
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,666
It moves.

488
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,305
Hey, Baxley!

489
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,741
If your mom's vagina were a video game,

490
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,510
it'd be rated "E" for "Everyone." (laughs)

492
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,147
Knock it off.

493
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,649
What's the difference between

494
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,318
five big black guys and a joke?

495
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,588
Baxley's mom can't take a joke. (choking)

00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,736
(thuds)

557
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,574
(men groaning)

558
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,912
Everything okay back there?

559
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,851
You fucking guys.

560
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,824
(clicking)

561
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,666
(growls)

562
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,744
(sniffs)

563
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,412
(growls)

564
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,748
-(laughing) -(indistinct chatter)

565
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,920
COYLE: We found the one place to hide out

566
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,355
where we don't look crazy.

567
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,792
(snoring)

568
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,130
It's been a long time since I had a gun in my hand.

569
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,431
What's it feel like?

570
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,434
Like a gun.

571
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,837
Hey, you think she's safe in there with them?

572
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,706
The girl?

573
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,008
They're soldiers, man.

574
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,545
Sleeping ladies? Nah, bro.

575
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,615
Sit down.

576
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,853
Here.

577
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,123
It's the end of times, huh?

578
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,594
Worst thing about the end times...

579
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,930
they never fucking are.

580
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,899
(chuckles)

581
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,001
So, um...

582
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,904
did he live?

583
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,439
Say again?

584
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,808
The CO? The asshole you shot, did he live?

585
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,875
Ah.

586
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,078
Yeah. He did.

587
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,946
Yeah, and where is he at now?

588
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,685
You're shitting me.

589
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,820
I missed.

590
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,788
(Williams chuckles)

591
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,190
Why did you do that?

592
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,525
-Miss? -No, shoot yourself.

593
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,728
Doctors asked me the same thing.

594
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,965
Walked to the hospital with a bullet in my skull.

595
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,601
-Good times. -Hey.

596
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,671
Should I be worried?

597
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,080
Probably. (chuckles)

598
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,049
-NETTLES: There we go. -COYLE: Did you get that?

599
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,784
-That's too close to her hand. -NETTLES: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

600
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,052
But then she's gonna drop that there.

601
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,453
Guys!

602
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,156
What the hell are you doing? What is all that shit?

603
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,858
We're trying to make her feel comfortable.

604
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,792
WILLIAMS: Come on.

605
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,627
She's gonna wake up and see

606
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,995
a bunch of motherfuckers. Come on.

607
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,096
What are you doin'?

608
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,665
(whispers) Nettles! Nettles!

609
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,833
BOTH: Move!

610
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,001
WILLIAMS: Move!

611
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,469
QUINN: Get out of there!

612
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,951
Morning, sunshine.

613
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,687
(exhales)

614
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,558
I really wish people would stop calling me that.

615
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,027
COYLE: Chill, hey!

616
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,931
(laughs) I told you she'd grab it. Ten bucks!

617
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,633
Pay up! Whoo!

618
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,635
-Fuck it, fuck it. -(laughing)

619
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,603
-Where's my phone? -You're not gonna need that.

620
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,038
(cocks gun)

621
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,973
COYLE: Oh, that's not cool.

622
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,008
It's okay.

623
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,943
I said it's okay.

624
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,245
Give me the gun.

625
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,080
-Give me the gun. -No. No.

626
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,184
(gun clicks)

627
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,152
(all gasp)

628
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,588
WILLIAMS: Oh, she pulled...

629
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,724
Oh! Shit, I told you she'd pull the trigger!

630
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:01,959
I should have bet you that time!

631
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,127
WILLIAMS: I like her. I like her.

632
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,261
I should have bet you that time!

633
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,729
-I like her. -NETTLES: I like her.

634
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,064
I like her. I like her a lot.

635
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,599
QUINN: Give me that, ding-dong.

636
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,235
COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.

637
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,738
What? You're a scientist, huh? What they got you working on?

638
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,675
You're not gonna last a day out there!

639
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,612
What, you think you're special?

640
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,515
Back at the dam, they were gonna put a bullet in your head.

641
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,183
They were gonna shoot her?

642
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,218
Yes.

643
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,153
Oh, I'm sorry.

644
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,789
Get out of the way. See you around.

645
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,659
(stutters) Eat your pussy.

646
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,294
Wait, what?

647
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,796
How you doing?

648
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,197
No, you just said, "Eat your pussy."

649
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:40,965
Hey...

650
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,000
-How you doing? -No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

651
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,235
What the fuck is wrong with him?

652
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,970
-I said you're pushy. -He said you're pushy.

653
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,037
No, you said, "Eat your pussy."

654
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,806
No. I said, "Sheesh! You're pushy!"

655
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,040
CASEY: No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

656
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,342
No, that's what he said, I heard it.

657
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,177
-He said... pushy. -What the fuck?

658
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,912
Which is also fucking rude.

659
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,347
He doesn't mean your pussy in particular.

660
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,915
You're insane, right?

661
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,250
-Are you fucking insane? -COYLE: Probably.

662
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,084
Well, what's it gonna be?

663
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,052
-BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy. -NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.

664
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,120
BAXLEY: I feel fine.

665
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,955
CASEY: They were gonna shoot me?

666
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,657
Why?

667
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,661
Uh, maybe 'cause of this?

668
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,934
Well, I guess I'm in.

669
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,870
Stay the fuck away from me.

670
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,642
What the fuck is this?

671
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,044
What is this?

672
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,613
-What is that? Like a unicorn? -NETTLES: A unicorn.

673
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,915
-It's a unicorn. -A unicorn.

674
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,816
I made a unicorn...

675
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,618
I'm sorry, it's a piece of shit.

676
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,288
So, what's the upside to me staying here with you guys?

677
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,089
Uh, maybe staying alive?

678
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,391
We are soldiers.

679
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,825
We're the good guys, okay?

680
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,160
CASEY: Well, that's debatable.

681
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,231
I read your file. The guys in Mexico it killed?

682
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,299
They yours?

683
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,301
They're gonna need a patsy for that.

684
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,669
You're looking at him.

685
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:52,836
Yeah, I figured.

686
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,706
Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's actually kind of perfect.

687
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,941
How about you telling us

688
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,976
what you were doing in a secret base.

689
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,879
Surrounded by trained soldiers. Mercs.

690
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:07,051
I'm a biologist, and they have me on call in case there's...

691
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,087
contact.

692
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,923
What did I tell you?

693
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,825
End days. End days.

694
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,260
Nettles, if you don't stop with this Bible shit,

695
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,695
I'm gonna set you on fire.

696
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,096
Guys, if we wanna keep breathing,

697
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,898
we need to find this thing.

698
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,999
Expose it.

699
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,134
It's called the Predator.

700
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,203
It hunts people for sport.

701
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,439
Technically, that's not a predator. That's like...

702
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,740
Thank you.

703
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,175
-It's a hunter. -I said the same thing.

704
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,876
NETTLES: A sportsman, or a hunter, or a fisherman.

705
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,711
COYLE: Well, look at you...

706
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,113
I was there when it escaped. It's looking for something.

707
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,682
Equipment. Weapons.

708
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,419
I took its gear.

709
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,688
What?

710
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:45,889
You took something from the thing?

711
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,758
-What? -So, I'd have evidence.

712
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,861
I think I know where it's going.

713
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,233
(whirring)

714
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,727
(growls)

715
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,462
What?

716
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,308
(indistinct chattering)

717
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,783
(door opens)

718
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,021
Oh, hi, honey, you're home.

719
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,024
-I'm looking for a package. -A package?

720
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,059
Rory!

721
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,994
Hey! This is not your house anymore!

722
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,262
QUINN: Rory!

723
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,964
Hey, buddy. Where are ya?

724
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,866
He's not here.

725
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,401
What do you mean, he's not here?

726
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,104
Oh, shit!

727
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,039
What? So we ordered some video games.

728
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,041
No! No! No!

729
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,277
The whole fucking reason I sent it to a P.O. box,

730
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,978
was so I didn't put you in danger.

731
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,780
Goddamn it, we need to find him.

732
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:17,948
Wait, Quinn, you're scaring me now.

733
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,516
(footsteps)

734
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,886
(indistinct chatter)

735
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,226
I specifically said

736
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,128
no first-person shooter. No combat games.

737
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,896
Did you ever think that maybe he plays them

738
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,997
to connect with his father?

739
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,299
Oh, my God. We're doing this again.

740
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,034
Hey! Can you stop taking all my...

741
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,537
Who are these people in my house?

742
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,873
Emily, loonies. Loonies, Emily.

743
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,241
Good evening.

744
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,843
Uh, the brushstrokes on this

745
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,444
are really dynamic. It's a wonderful piece.

746
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,146
Okay, you need to put that down.

747
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,081
What exactly is she doing with her right hand?

748
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,516
They're my unit. They're soldiers.

749
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,985
Marines. There's his unit. (laughing)

750
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,453
Hi. You seem like a really nice...

751
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,288
Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

752
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,457
Hang on. Back up. Your unit?

753
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,426
What happened to Haines and Dupree?

754
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,728
They're dead.

755
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,064
And the thing that killed them is out there looking for Rory.

756
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,332
What are you talking about?

757
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,433
There's something out there.

758
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,369
It tore my friends apart. What is it?

759
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,137
(Coyle stuttering)

760
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,572
Like, it's a creature. Seriously, it's not a person.

761
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,507
Like from the Bible.

762
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,375
-Revelations. -From the Bible?

763
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,377
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

764
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,311
It's a space alien.

765
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,347
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

766
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,115
It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

767
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,251
Oh, shit!

768
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:28,886
Shit.

769
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,187
I want a grid search.

770
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,288
Three teams.

771
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,023
(men exclaiming)

772
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:33,991
Hey!

773
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,960
-No. -No, no, I'm coming with you.

774
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,195
QUINN: No, nix that.

775
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,429
(gun cocking)

776
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,031
(Quinn clears throat)

777
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,967
Is there a problem?

778
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,137
Thing is, we're kind of moving targets.

779
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,506
Yeah, in case you haven't noticed, we're fugitives.

780
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,441
Yeah. Plus, like where are we gonna get our meds and stuff?

781
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,177
I get it. Fine, stay here and watch TV.

782
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,313
You know what? If you try to split? Or draw the Feds?

783
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,581
Or if you jeopardize my son

784
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,950
by your half-assed yardbird bullshit...

785
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,418
I will come back here, and I will happily

786
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,220
kill every single fucking one of you.

787
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,128
WILLIAMS: Come on, brothers. Let's go.

788
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,030
(door closes)

789
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,032
Seriously?

790
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,967
It's not our fight.

791
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,607
Is your husband the man I think he is?

792
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,909
Excuse me?

793
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,145
Tell me about your husband, please?

794
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,115
He's a security counter-sniper.

795
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,417
-Mmm. -Army Rangers.

796
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,452
He supervised

797
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,522
23 close precision engagements across five continents

798
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,024
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

799
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,294
And he is one of only 14 captains in the armed forces,

800
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,196
to ever receive a Distinguished Service Medal

801
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,331
and the Silver Star.

802
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,200
So, he might be a lousy husband,

803
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,602
but he is a good soldier.

804
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,573
Well, sounds like he can probably take care of himself.

805
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,208
-Yeah. -Jesus Christ.

806
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,343
That's what I thought.

807
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,478
Fucking pussies.

808
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,215
(door opens and closes)

809
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,383
Where you going, Nettles?

810
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,954
I didn't like your speech. It didn't really inspire me.

811
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,391
But... he called me a pussy

812
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,393
and nobody calls me a pussy, so...

813
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,028
-Fuck off, pussy. -Okay...

814
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,263
(clears throat)

815
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,234
Come on, Bax, let's go. Let's get some.

816
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,603
Before these army fuckers screw up the whole thing.

817
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,209
Come on, what are you doing? Let's move.

818
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,210
Hey!

819
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,278
You too, lucky charms.

820
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,379
LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.

821
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,016
I'd like to watch TV

822
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,317
-with you sometime. -Okay.

823
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,451
I liked your speech.

824
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,686
BAXLEY: I liked the couch.

825
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,657
Whoa, what's happening? What?

826
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,426
Well, we're finding my son, that's what.

827
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,995
All right, when all this is over...

828
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,097
Fuck me in the face with an aardvark.

829
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,232
(groaning)

830
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,335
I just want to be famous.

831
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,102
LYNCH: Ostensibly,

832
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,071
if Forrest Gump just read the side of the box,

833
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,572
it would tell him exactly what he would get.

834
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,207
COYLE: You're using "ostensibly" incorrectly.

835
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,309
Is this for me?

836
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,743
This is like the reverse of a clown car.

837
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,345
All right, Nebraska,

838
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,579
let's find some wheels, nothing flashy.

839
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,647
Copy.

840
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,450
All right. Find my son.

841
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,218
Casey, you're with me.

842
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,687
Let's go.

843
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,323
DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.

844
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,294
What are you supposed to be?

845
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,195
RORY: Leave me alone.

846
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,465
EJ: Or what? You'll wash our hands five hundred times?

847
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,599
(snickers)

848
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,601
(doorbell rings)

849
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,337
RORY: Trick or treat?

850
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,776
EJ: What's the matter, dude?

851
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,411
(chuckles)

852
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,146
Here's a treat, you little shit.

853
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:44,681
-Oh! -(laughs)

854
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,483
(helmet whirring)

855
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,455
(grunting)

856
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,793
(tires screeching)

857
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,566
(indistinct shouting)

858
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,135
-(horns honking) -(alarms blaring)

859
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,077
(whimpering)

860
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,619
OFFICER (on radio): I got a male juvenile.

861
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,287
10 to 12 years old.

862
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,522
Metal cast on his arm.

863
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,656
Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?

864
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,191
OFFICER: Ran right in front of my car.

865
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,293
Moving east on Woodruff.

866
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,396
Repeat, moving east on Woodruff.

867
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,768
(sirens wailing in distance)

868
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,470
(panting)

869
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,572
Nebraska, you got wheels?

870
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,541
WILLIAMS: Yeah, I got wheels. Something flashy.

871
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,678
Listen, the kid's spooked, he's rabbiting.

872
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,481
Where's he headed? Where's some place he knows?

873
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,286
(faint growl)

874
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,592
(whimpering)

875
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,470
(whimpers)

876
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,384
(snarling)

877
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,623
(dog barking)

878
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,392
(creature hissing)

879
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:47,704
There he is.

880
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:54,911
Dad!

881
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,650
How you doing, buddy, huh?

882
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,718
I'm good.

883
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,358
(grunts)

884
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,262
(grunts)

885
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,165
-Move! Move! -(gasps)

886
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,734
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

887
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,740
(roars)

888
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,475
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

889
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,577
BAXLEY: Oh, shit!

890
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,680
(snarling)

891
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:32,816
(grunts)

892
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,686
(roars)

893
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:37,988
WILLIAMS: McKenna!

894
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,222
(grunts)

895
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,893
NETTLES: Take cover! Take cover!

896
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,361
(growls)

897
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,599
(snarling)

898
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,813
BAXLEY: Williams! Get the fuck out of there!

899
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,315
(indistinct shouting)

900
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,617
COYLE: What are you doing? Get out of there!

901
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,419
Oh, shit!

902
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,887
(whining)

903
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,325
Oh. Okay.

904
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,870
WILLIAMS: Doc, the dreads. What's that all about?

905
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,539
CASEY: I don't know. Maybe, like, sensor receptors.

906
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:30,707
Kind of like cat whiskers.

907
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,743
Whoa! What the-- I'm getting a sample.

908
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,011
It's a fucking space dog.

909
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,614
You okay? Huh?

910
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,616
(grunts)

911
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,918
What, is your mom cutting your hair now?

912
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:42,819
CASEY: You kidding me? This is

913
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,654
-a once-in-a-lifetime moment. -Shut up. Please shut up.

914
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,655
All I wanted was a little sample.

915
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:46,389
Please shut up.

916
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,757
All I wanted was a goddamn fucking sample.

917
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:48,792
Come here.

918
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,029

I was naked and unarmed, it walked right past me.

Can you tell your kid to tone down the psychosis, please?

He didn't even give a shit about us.

He grew an exoskeleton under his fucking skin.

Nothing.

I'd be careful with that, sir.

You know what I think?

1026
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,597
I think this one went rogue. A runner.

1027
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,232
Hmm. And the big one?

1028
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,400
He's a tracker.

1029
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,868
Sent to take that one out.

1030
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,771
Some kind of interstellar cops and robbers.

1031
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,340
Now he's going after that missing ship.

1032
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,275
And whatever's on board.

1033
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,178
I want that fucking ship.

1034
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,346
We're in the ballpark.

1035
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,281
Captain McKenna's son?

1036

Mother confirms.

1037
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,885
He has the operating system.

1038
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,853
-Get the fuck out of here. -Thought it was a video game.

1039
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,355
So, we find the kid, we find the ship.

1040
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,324
What the fuck we still standing here for?

1041
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,259
You don't want to know what that one is?

1042
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,127
I know what it is. Our big boy's a hunter.

1043
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,395
He brought his dogs with him.

1044
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,668
No, it had to be like

1045
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,270
a government experiment or some shit.

1046
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,372
Like a robot, or whatever.

1047
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,107
Nettles, are you fucking retarded, man?

1048
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,942
Use another word, would ya?

1049
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,978
Yeah, man. Show a little sensitivity.

1050
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,279
His son's retarded.

1051
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,181
BAXLEY: Here you go.

1052
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,282
Here you go.

1053
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,250
He does this from time to time.

1054
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,119
Just give him a minute.

1055
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,154
Hey, Lynch.

1056
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,024
What's the deal with these two?

1057
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,859
Coyle lit up one of his own vehicles?

1058
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,395
Back in '09, yeah. It was bad business. Six dead.

1059
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,030
What, no survivors?

1060
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,765
Yeah, there was one.

1061
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,005
It's fucking romantic.

1062
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,307
Are you kidding me, they're friends?

1063
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,141
Picture it.

1064
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,343
Military inquiries, sitting outside courtroom,

1065
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,145
waiting to go in, side by side,

1066
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,047
-day after fucking day. -After fucking day.

1067
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,382
Unbelievable.

1068
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,816
It's the loonies.

1069
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,127
QUINN: All right, kid.

1070
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,129
I've talked to your mother.

1071
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:07,964
She's doing fine.

1072
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,166
Mom says you're a killer.

1073
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,037
-Well, I'm a soldier. -(Williams clears throat)

1074
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,838
What's the difference?

1075
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,476
Well, when you like it,

1076
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,345
that's when you're a killer.

1077
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,449
-(sniffles) -Are you good?

1078
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,386
Sorry I never grew up.

1079
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,223
You know... the way you wanted.

1080
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,431
Tell you a secret.

1081
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,068
Truth is, kid,

1082
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,071
I never grew up the way I wanted.

1083
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:54,110
(sighs) Are we gonna get killed?

1084
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,244
(grunts softly)

1085
01:01:58,181 --> 01:01:59,182
Nope.

1086
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,452
Come on. (clears throat) Get up.

1087
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,954
I'm single. I don't know if you knew that.

1088
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,023
No, I could tell that you're single.

1089
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,226
We got so much stuff in common, you know...

1090
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:13,296
You like music, I like music. You like music, right?

1091
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,198
-Shit. -What?

1092
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,900
This is more than spinal fluid.

1093
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,901
What does that mean?

1094
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,236
If I'm right,

1095
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,539
they're trying to upgrade themselves.

1096
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,074
McKenna, I got something.

1097
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,110
I think I know what they're up to

1098
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,144
on Predator World these days.

1099
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,547
You see this? They found this in the Predator's plexus.

1100
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,082
So, remember how I told you

1101
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,450
how they take people's spines, right?

1102
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,519
Yeah, for trophies.

1103
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:39,122
Yes! Yes! From the strongest, smartest,

1104
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,125
most dangerous species on every planet they visit.

1105
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:43,326
Collecting survival traits

1106
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,861
from the most high-end specimens.

1107
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,230
I think they're attempting hybridization.

1108
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,366
You're just pulling this out of your ass.

1109
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,335
Did you not see the new Predator?

1110
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,304
It's evolving.

1111
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,039
Or being upgraded.

1112
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,948
QUINN: That little boy

1113
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,084
managed to figure out alien technology.

1114
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,187
You know, a lot of experts say that

1115
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,322
being on the spectrum isn't really a disorder.

1116
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,225
It's actually the next step in the evolutionary chain.

1117
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,161
NETTLES: Hey, yo! What the fuck?

1118
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,362
Get the fuck away from me!

1119
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,564
Yo! Casey! (whistling)

1120
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,000
QUINN: Casey, get inside.

1121
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,434
Casey!

1122
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,371
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

1123
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,906
Casey! Look.

1124
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,108
I think this thing's been following us, all right?

1125
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,877
-Move, Netty! -Hey, hey, hey!

1126
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,445
-Space dog! -Move, Netty!

1127
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,914
(whimpers)

1128
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,617
Fuck that.

1129
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,252
Hey! You had your fucking chance.

1130
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,387
(creature whines)

1131
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,323
Look, I'm just saying, what the fuck is it gonna do?

1132
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:49,258
You know, maybe we can use it, or something?

1133
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,294
Okay, what are we doing? What are we doing with it?

1134
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,529
We're gonna study it. That's what we're gonna do with it.

1135
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,131
What's to learn? Except Williams sucks

1136
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,532
at shooting shit in the head.

1137
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,434
Williams, you lobotomized him. (chuckles)

1138
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,970
Okay, new rule. No one shoots my fucking dog.

1139
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,038
(creature growls)

1140
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,206
BAXLEY: There it is. It's official.

1141
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,874
You were right, we can use this.

1142
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,046
BAXLEY: Shit.

1143
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,881
COYLE: Netty, what is that?

1144
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:15,184
WILLIAMS: Everybody, tighten up.

1145
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,253
-Little man, come here. -NETTLES: That's an EC-130.

1146
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,387
That's not civilian.

1147
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:19,222
Hey, hey, hey!

1148
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,024
You are not starting a firefight with my kid here.

1149
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:22,892
WILLIAMS: There you go.

1150
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,062
Do you wanna help? Go get a helicopter and some pyro.

1151
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,930
All right! On me!

1152
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,065
Now go!

1153
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,534
-Casey! I'll be right back! -No, you won't.

1154
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,402
Hold on. Hey. See this?

1155
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,571
Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1156
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,473
-Fetch! -(creature huffing)

1157
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,912
(coughing)

1158
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,164
Where is it?

1159
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,366
Where's what?

1160
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,635
The device.

1161
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,437
It goes, right in here.

1162
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,274
(grunting)

1163
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,312
Okay, so, the first Predator, Thing One.

1164
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,481
Why'd he come here? To Earth?

1165
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,983
The "Thing One", as you called him,

1166
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,219
arrived in a hijacked spacecraft.

1167
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,321
We think there's something on it.

1168
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,323
Something he didn't want his enemies to have.

1169
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,191
CASEY: Wait, enemies?

1170
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,694
Other Predators. Like that big one.

1171
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,497
So, he brought some what? Gift for the human race?

1172
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,132
I'll help you find it. We can analyze it...

1173
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,400
Shut the fuck up!

1174
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,505
Why are they here?

1175
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,343
You remember a few years back when Hostess went bust?

1176
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,979
There was a run on Twinkies?

1177
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,114
Snapped up from coast-to-coast.

1178
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,649
Get 'em while they still last.

1179
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:55,518
Remember?

1180
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:00,022
How long before climate change renders this planet unlivable?

1181
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,525
Two generations?

1182
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,527
One?

1183
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,629
CASEY: That's why their visits are increasing?

1184
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,797
They're trying to snap up

1185
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,398
all of our best DNA before we're gone.

1186
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:13,035
Adapt themselves with it and then move in.

1187
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,305
We're an endangered species, and they know it.

1188
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,040
They thrive in a hothouse environment.

1189
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,209
Maybe they want to move into ours.

1190
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,345
And that dead Predator

1191
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,146
was bringing us a way to stop them.

1192
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,482
(grunts)

1193
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,185
You've hidden this thing before in the mail.

1194
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,186
(groans)

1195
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,054
So, where is it this time?

1196
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,422
Your mother's ass.

1197
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,491
Wait, did I say that out loud?

1198
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,460
(grunts)

1199
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:42,398
Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no. That is not for you.

1200
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,232
That is my son's,

1201
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,101
and you are violating his privacy reading that.

1202
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,268
You both need to leave right now.

1203
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,371
Ma'am, I don't wanna restrain you.

1204
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,573
Really? Well, why don't you try?

1205
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,609
(objects clattering)

1206
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,080
(footsteps running)

1207
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,821
(snarling)

1208
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,394
(yells)

1209
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,662
(gunshots)

1210
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,598
(snarling)

1211
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,238
(low growling)

1212
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,581
(speaking alien language)

1213
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,593
CRYPTOGRAPHER: You haven't found the spacecraft?

1214
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,429
Why are we trying to crack the entry code?

1215
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,497
SAPIR: Because when we do find it, wouldn't it be great

1216
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:49,665
if we could get into the fucking thing?

1217
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,833
What's that?

1218
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:52,768
A map.

1219
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,003
A map to what?

1220
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,572
CRYPTOGRAPHER: ...give us a clue of where this place is,

1221
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,474
maybe we can try to get into it.

1222
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,443
But if you don't give us anything, we can't get in!

1223
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:09,885
(grunts)

1224
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,489
(whimpering)

1225
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,891
Hey, Rory, I'm Will.

1226
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:17,626
How you doing?

1227
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,162
I understand you know where the spaceship is.

1228
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,177
Golf tomorrow?

1229
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,545
Why not?

1230
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,315
You two never read my file, did ya?

1231
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:40,716
What makes you say that?

1232
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,486
'Cause you two morons are making plans for tomorrow.

1233
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:44,954
(laughing)

1234
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,288
The worst part is,

1235
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,557
you're making me lie to my son.

1236
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,627
What lie did you tell him, hmm?

1237
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,463
That I won't enjoy this.

1238
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,333
(grunting)

1239
01:08:58,868 --> 01:08:59,902
(screams)

1240
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,537
(mouthing)

1241
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,740
-(gun cocking) -Hey, please, don't.

1242
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,676
Look, I don't know what they told you...

1243
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,979
Can you just wait for a second? Just wait!

1244
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,547
No, no, no!

1245
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,182
No.

1246
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,817
(grunting softly)

1247
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,222
-Jeez! -(yipping)

1248
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,323
Oh, my God.

1249
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,530
(retches)

1250
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,470
(both grunting)

1251
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,318
(gasping)

1252
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:55,224
(grunting)

1253
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,628
Nebraska!

1254
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,664
-Yeah? -You just kill somebody?

1255
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,798
Well, he ain't well.

1256
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,033
Untie my friend.

1257
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,568
They got Rory. We gotta move.

1258
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,469
Shit, they rough you up?

1259
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,572
Did worse on myself, back in the day.

1260
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,006
(grunting)

1261
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,675
What do you want to do with this guy?

1262
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,346
Sorry, buddy, that was a dumb question.

1263
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,514
Yeah, that was a dumb question.

1264
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,849
(panting)

1265
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,590
(low growling)

1266
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,728
QUINN: Casey!

1267
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,800
Can I interest you in getting the fuck out of here?

1268
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,436
"Getting the fuck out of here" is my middle name.

1269
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,771
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1270
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:43,839
(Quinn groans)

1271
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,274
(stomach grumbling)

1272
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,476
What? What's wrong?

1273
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,678
(toilet flushing)

1274
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,681
Whew! All right.

1275
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,950
Hey! Just let me unpack this.

1276
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,719
You're saying my son's headed towards a spaceship

1277
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:57,987
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1278
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,488
Uh, 11, actually.

1279
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,789
Used to be a contractor.

1280
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,691
This thing is a hybrid? What does that mean?

1281
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:04,793
Meaning it's the Chinese menu of DNA.

1282
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,829
Comprised of the deadliest species in the entire...

1283
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,063
In the entire universe, yeah?

1284
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,665
-Galaxy. -What?

1285
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,734
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1286
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,435
Why go universe? Just saying.

1287
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,437
(helicopter whirring)

1288
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,485
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1289
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:30,552
That's what you asked for?

1290
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,587
Yeah, that'll do.

1291
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,456
Saddle up!

1292
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,561
COYLE: It's the best we could do, man.

1293
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,732
WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!

1294
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,034
That's it? Another one.

1295
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:46,368
QUINN: The other one!

1296
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,770
Come on. Let's go get my kid.

1297
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,542
Figured something out. I think we're gonna die.

1298
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,612
We're gonna go hunt and fight the what, the army?

1299
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,880
COYLE: We're not gonna fight the army...

1300
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:59,648
BAXLEY: And some fucking people from space!

1301
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,050
You wanna talk survival, huh?

1302
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,751
Fine!

1303
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,887
You, yesterday, you were on a prison bus

1304
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,088
barking to yourself,

1305
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,956
now you got a gun in your hand.

1306
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,358
Who's a survivor now?

1307
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,594
We put bullets in our head

1308
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,996
and walk to the fucking hospital.

1309
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,731
We're soldiers!

1310
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:18,701
Nettles, what's our 20?

1311
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,903
I can follow your boy's chopper.

1312
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,137
I locked into its frequency.

1313
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:37,753
SOLDIER: Fence is hot!

1314
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,538
(indistinct radio chatter)

1315
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,007
What do you say, buddy?

1316
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,443
You think you can get us in there?

1317
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,113
Because I'm not sure that you can.

1318
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,981
Nice reverse psychology.

1319
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,916
I can do that, too.

1320
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,485
Don't go fuck yourself.

1321
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,820
(laughs)

1322
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,189
TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.

1323
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,925
Good. Almost up and running. Five minutes.

1324
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:17,993
TRAEGER: Right on.

1325
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:19,528
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1326
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,929
Been trying to figure out

1327
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,197
what these bird-chirping motherfuckers

1328
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,732
been saying since '87.

1329
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,534
Gave the Harvard School of Linguistics

1330
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,835
a billion-dollar grant.

1331
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,037
Voila. Watch your step, come on.

1332
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,886
Goddamn, kid, I don't know where you get it from.

1333
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,922
(trilling)

1334
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,248
TRAEGER: Put the translator into the mainframe.

1335
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,616
Download everything.

1336
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:22,758
SAPIR: What the hell's inside there?

1337
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,660
It's property of Project Stargazer.

1338
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,728
That's what the fuck it is. (laughs)

1339
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,232
OFFICER (on comms): Code three. Code three.

1340
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,767
We have motion at the south fence line.

1341
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,602
Send a fireteam to check it out.

1342
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,971
That's my dad. He's gonna come save me now.

1343
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:37,639
Oh, is he?

1344
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,175
Is that what he's gonna do?

1345
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,211
I'll tell you what, buddy...

1346
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,746
if it is your daddy,

1347
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,915
and I truly hope that it is...

1348
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,318
he's gotta be just about

1349
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,688
the dumbest motherfucker I've ever met. (laughing)

1350
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:58,060
I mean, a Ranger sniper tripping wire sensors?

1351
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,294
He's gotta be...

1352
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,297
creating a diversion.

1353
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,832
It's a fucking diversion.

1354
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,234
(grunts)

1355
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,702
Oh, shit!

1356
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,003
Wow. Howdy.

1357
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,005
What, are you gonna kill us with a fucking tranq gun?

1358
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,274
You took my boy, so yeah.

1359
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,042
Told you.

1360
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:15,978
Take this, son.

1361
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,014
You outta your mind? We literally have you surrounded.

1362
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,582
That's why you're coming with me.

1363
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,050
I just want the boy. Nobody's got to die.

1364
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:22,985
Dad?

1365
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,022
From here forward.

1366
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,624
Don't look at the dead guy.

1367
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,172
(grunting)

1368
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,345
That was pretty good.

1369
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,713
You all right? Did I get you?

1370
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:52,748
No, I'm good.

1371
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:54,816
Welcome back.

1372
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,951
Fuck you. I never left.

1373
01:15:58,954 --> 01:15:59,922
You open your mouth,

1374
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,957
I'm gonna blow your brains right through it.

1375
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,125
Come on, just get behind me.

1376
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,227
SOLDIER (on radio): All units. They got Traeger.

1377
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,295
They got Traeger.

1378
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,064
(softly) Let's go. Let's go.

1379
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,333
Just tell them to put the guns down.

1380
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,177
Tell them!

1381
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,681
If Captain McKenna doesn't lower his weapon

1382
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,481
in the next 10 seconds...

1383
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,717
shoot the kid's knees out. That work for you?

1384
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,018
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1385
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,721
My guys got this place covered on every angle.

1386
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,289
That's a funny story. See, I don't give a shit.

1387
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,257
10.

1388
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,759
Nine.

1389
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,328
Eight.

1390
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:41,830
Seven.

1391
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:44,299
Come on, you just give the fucking word, man.

1392
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,367
TRAEGER: Six. Five.

1393
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,969
(predator clicking)

1394
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:48,403
(predator grunting)

1395
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,272
(grunts)

1396
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:52,774
(growling)

1397
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,710
(screaming)

1398
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,713
(yelling)

1399
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,150
-(distant yelling) -Oh, shit!

1400
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,952
(grunting)

1401
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,053
Come on, son!

1402
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,723
(indistinct shouting)

1403
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:08,790
Take them down!

1404
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:15,998
Get down, sir.

1405
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,432
Let's go, son. Go!

1406
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,800
SOLDIER: Come on. Come on.

1407
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,274
Okay, take this. (spits)

1408
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:28,644
You wanna vanish,

1409
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,312
you really vanish, son, you understand?

1410
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,048
All right, we're going home. I promise you.

1411
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:39,688
(predator growls)

1412
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:43,959
It's here.

1413
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,134
-(predator growls) -No! No! No!

1414
01:17:58,273 --> 01:17:59,808
SOLDIER 2: Come on, go around the end there!

1415
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,309
Stay on him! Stay on him!

1416
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,045
Move, move, move!

1417
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,379
-You got him? -SOLDIER 3: Yeah!

1418
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,492
-(explosion) -QUINN: Stay back.

1419
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,860
Get down! Get down!

1420
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:25,200
SOLDIER 4: Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire!

1421
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,812
(low growling)

1422
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,081
(both panting quietly)

1423
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,428
-COYLE: Huh? -All right.

1424
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,996
Hey, McKenna.

1425
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,933
Be reasonable. There's six of you, seven of us.

1426
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,835
(grunts)

1427
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,136
Fuck!

1428
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,537
Who taught you math?

1429
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,973
You ain't the only fucking sniper, white boy.

1430
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,044
You can walk away from this, Captain.

1431
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,213
I just want the ship.

1432
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,415
-Dad, he's lying. -Yeah.

1433
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,884
McKenna! I don't like this.

1434
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,452
What's he doing in there?

1435
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,922
(predator warbling)

1436
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,392
-(loud warbling) -(feedback whines)

1437
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:28,230
(all groan)

1438
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,066
It's using the translator.

1439
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,237
PREDATOR (over speaker): Hello. I have enjoyed

1440
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,005
watching you kill each other.

1441
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,841
I came here to destroy this vessel.

1442
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,910
You cannot have it.

1443
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,079
What you can do is run.

1444
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,549
I detect one among you who is a true warrior.

1445
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,018
The one called McKenna.

1446
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,288
He will be your leader.

1447
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,290
He will be my prize.

1448
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,492
I offer time advantage.

1449
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,461
Go.

1450
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,429
What the fuck is time advantage?

1451
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,531
Like a head start?

1452
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,934
(alarm sounding)

1453
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,602
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1454
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,005
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1455
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,975
Hey!

1456
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,343
I'm coming out!

1457
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,087
We're in.

1458
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,456
-Baxley! -Shit!

1459
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,058
Watch where the fuck you're throwing, dickhead.

1460
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,027
-(vehicle engine stalling) -Will do.

1461
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,197
Okay, so we split up. 12 different directions.

1462
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,098
-McKenna's the one he wants. -TRAEGER: No, no, no!

1463
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,367
We stay together, or it'll take us one by one.

1464
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,002
He's right. It's their MO.

1465
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,004
-Grow a dick, will you? -SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!

1466
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,106
Son of a bitch. He must have hacked the vehicles.

1467
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,475
If we can get to the helicopter, go two klicks north.

1468
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,310
-Got you. -Hey?

1469
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,612
When this is over, you and me, we're gonna dance.

1470
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:51,980
I got my shoes all picked out.

1471
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,014
All right.

1472
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,056
(soft growling)

1473
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:02,958
-Fuck. -No, no, no! Don't.

1474
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,594
Here, boy. Fetch.

1475
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,330
-(creature barks) -Here, boy. (whistles)

1476
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,364
Here you go.

1477
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,902
That was a valuable weapon.

1478
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:17,539
Let's go. He'll be coming for us.

1479
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,275
(alarm blaring)

1480
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,934
(warbling)

1481
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,168
(device beeps)

1482
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,612
Give me the goody bag.

1483
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:01,983
Hey. On Halloween, this blew up a whole house.

1484
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,585
-How do you shoot it? -You don't.

1485
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,654
It just fires by itself when it's being attacked.

1486
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,255
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1487
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,458
(man coughing)

1488
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,495
(faint rustling)

1489
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,132
I heard something.

1490
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,267
TRAEGER: Hey, man. That's Predator technology.

1491
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,569
Fuck.

1492
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,271
That-- It's gonna come back.

1493
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,106
You got, uh, a catcher on the wrist.

1494
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,975
That's gonna come back.

1495
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:29,377
No!

1496
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,314
-(screaming) -Quiet. Quiet.

1497
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,083
-Let me see. Let me see. -My fucking hand.

1498
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,418
-Shit. -My fucking hand.

1499
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,988
Gotta be quiet.

1500
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,227
(screaming)

1501
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,100
(predator warbles)

1502
01:22:58,673 --> 01:22:59,774
Moving!

1503
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,159
No, no, no! This way. This way. This way.

1504
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,729
There's a clearing up ahead.

1505
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:23,398
Lynch left some pyro up there. To cover our retreat.

1506
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,200
Let's find it and trap the motherfucker.

1507
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,535
You guys go set it up. We'll lure him in.

1508
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,504
-Who? -You and me.

1509
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:30,538
Yeah? All right.

1510
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,407
-Yeah. -Let's go.

1511
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:34,442
Come on.

1512
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:37,812
Can I talk to you for a second?

1513
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,247
What's this "we" shit?

1514
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,548
What, are you gonna live forever, Coyle?

1515
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:42,217
-Just calm down. -COYLE: Calm down?

1516
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,153
Me, calm down? Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.

1517
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,188
Move, move, move! Up here. Up, up, up.

1518
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,274

1519
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,212
-(indistinct animal croaking) -Shit!

1520
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,116
Okay, fuck this.

1521
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:17,719
Hey! Asshole!

1522
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:19,354
What the fuck was that?

1523
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,122
COYLE: It's a chance for you to survive.

1524
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,091
Go! I got this.

1525
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,226
That's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard.

1526
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:33,301
Come and get us, asshole!

1527
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:36,571
Contact!

1528
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:37,872
-Alien! -Contact!

1529
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,643
-Contact! -Alien!

1530
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:42,677

He said he wanted me!

No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1574
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,388

01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:19,186
(creature whines)

1638
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:23,824
(roars)

1639
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:45,012
(predator whimpers)

1640
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:55,256
What are you?

1641
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,324
(speaks alien language)

1642
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,325
Shut the fuck up.

1643
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:00,928
(gasps)

1644
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,247
My unit.

1645
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:23,884
Nettles.

1646
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,288
Coyle.

1647
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,525
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1648
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,130
Baxley had this the whole time.

1649
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:40,935
Nebraska's bad habit.

1650
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:43,504
Son...

1651
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:46,140
these are the ones that no one's gonna remember.

1652
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:48,509
Just us.

1653
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:51,078
What do you say we put them to rest?

1654
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,253
(indistinct announcement over PA)

1655
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:36,257
Captain McKenna.

1656
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,394
Hiroshi Yamada.

1657
01:36:40,427 --> 01:36:42,296
-Sir. -First things first.

1658
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,598
I want to say thank you for having such a great kid.

1659
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:45,499
He loves it here.

1660
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,968
Yeah, he's something else. What do we got, Doctor?

1661
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:50,070
Well, I assume that you know by now,

1662
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:53,040
but the first Predator, it didn't come here to hunt us.

1663
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,176
-He brought something. -Exactly.

1664
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:56,544
Now, you want to hear the good news?

1665
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,180
The cargo survived.

1666
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,649
With some sort of fail-safe.

1667
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,918
Before the upgrade Predator blew up the ship,

1668
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,352
a pod escaped.

1669
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:06,954
Jettisoned. Saved itself.

1670
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:11,492
It seems that our boy wasn't taking any chances.

1671
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,228
He wanted us to have this.

1672
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,529
(door sliding open)

1673
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,034
(indistinct announcement)

1674
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:29,977
What is it again you do here, exactly?

1675
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:33,314
He's the world's number one authority on cybernetics.

1676
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,884
QUINN: Hey, kiddo.

1677
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:40,287
RORY: Pretty cool, huh?

1678
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:41,622
Pretty cool. You got your own desk.

1679
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:43,157
I'll make sure to tell Mom.

1680
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:48,095
So, this is his gift to humankind?

1681
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:57,471
(static interference)

1682
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:04,111
-(electricity crackling) -(woman screams)

1683
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,113
-MAN 1: Get back! -MAN 2: Look out!

1684
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:07,548
MAN 3: Everyone, stand back!

1685
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:08,582
MAN 4: Stand back! Clear the area!

1686
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:10,451
(pod hissing)

1687
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:12,286
(indistinct shouting)

1688
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:17,091
Dad, the pod sent me a message.

1689
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,595
-Rory, what's in that pod? -Don't know!

1690
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,665
Oh, wow... Oh, shit!

1691
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:26,467
-It's got a name! -Name? What name?

1692
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,702
I guess you'd call it,

1693
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,271
the Predator Killer.

1694
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:32,506
-QUINN: Get him out of here! -Come with me. Let's go.

1695
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,010
SOLDIER 1: Get back. Clear the area.

1696
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,077
SOLDIER 2: Eyes on it.

1697
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,073
(device trilling)

1698
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,312
Whatever it is, it appears to be dormant.

1699
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:14,248
-I assume it needs to be... -(women gasp)

1700
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,650
SOLDIER: Eyes on. Keep your weapons trained.

1701
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:19,486
(gasps) Get it off! Get it off me!

1702
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:21,755
(screaming)

1703
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:54,054
What the hell is that?

1704
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:56,090
That's my new suit, bubba.

1705
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:00,260
I hope they got it in a 42 long.

1706
