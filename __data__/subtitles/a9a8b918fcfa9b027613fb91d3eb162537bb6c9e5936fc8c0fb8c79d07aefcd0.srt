about something.

896

But before I do, I...

897
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,349
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

898
00:53:31,784 --> 00:53:33,052
Okay.

899
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:34,712

done anything to you

that might have scared you

902
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,151
or upset you?

903
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,184
Uh...

904
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,745

I see things.
[breath trembling]

910
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:18,184
And I can't tell
if they're real or not.

911

Listen to me.

912
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:24,976
When I was younger,

913
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:27,514
I... I used to have these

914
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:31,016
horrible visions.

915
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:33,986
They were so terrible that I

916
00:54:34,121 --> 00:54:37,085
convinced myself
that they were real.

917
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:42,613
But I learned
that those thoughts,

918
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:46,043
they were just lies.

919
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:48,916

was playing on me

920
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,415
because I was so unhappy.

921
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:53,348
This isn't a lie.

922
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,382

for certain?

We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

979
00:59:01,418 --> 00:59:03,584
And perhaps
we postpone your vows.

What? No. Why?

981
00:59:05,884 --> 00:59:09,747
We're also concerned about

1010
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:27,043
you will keep your distance

Yes.

1253
01:19:39,851 --> 01:19:41,118
Too many.

1254
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:45,250
I had no idea
they'd gone to such lengths.

1255
01:19:51,612 --> 01:19:53,152
I don't understand.

1256
01:19:53,654 --> 01:19:55,151
They need a male.

1257
01:19:56,779 --> 01:19:58,811
They've only birthed females.

1258
01:19:58,946 --> 01:20:00,911
They've all died
except for Carlita.

1259
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,613
After all these years,
so many failures...

1260
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:07,746
They believe the only way

1261
01:20:07,881 --> 01:20:10,547
is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

1262
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:31,912
What is this?

1263
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:34,176
I told you, it's the photo
from Carlita's birth.

1264
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:35,316
No.

1265
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,118
This.

1266
01:20:42,919 --> 01:20:44,086
[Brennan] It's the mark.

1267
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,415
Carlita doesn't have the mark
on her head.

1268
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:49,910
Hers is here.

1269

What are you talking about?

1270
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,745
I've seen it.

1271
01:20:55,512 --> 01:20:57,384
You see? Carlita.

1272
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,877
No mark.

1273
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:01,415
The baby in this photo
is not Carlita.

1274
01:21:06,645 --> 01:21:08,019
What does that mean?

1275
01:21:09,784 --> 01:21:10,782
Brennan?

1276
01:21:10,918 --> 01:21:12,547
I don't know.

1277
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,015
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for,

1278
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,251
then all we have to do

1279
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:20,183
is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

1280
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:21,748
We must have
missed something.

1281

look like this?

[Brennan] The father.

No.

1612
01:49:38,218 --> 01:49:39,584
Give it to Mama.
Give it to Mama.

1613
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:40,712
Give it to Mama.

1614
01:49:44,217 --> 01:49:46,349
[cattle crying in distance]

1615
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,217
[cattle lowing]

1616
01:50:00,019 --> 01:50:01,679
- [gun cocks]
- [gasps]

1617
01:50:02,515 --> 01:50:04,349
[Brennan] I'm so sorry,
Margaret.

1618
01:50:07,086 --> 01:50:09,019
I tried just to leave you be.

1619
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,217
You need to go.

1620
01:50:14,886 --> 01:50:17,415
Now. [breathing shakily]

1621
01:50:18,216 --> 01:50:19,712
I came to warn you.

1622
01:50:21,018 --> 01:50:22,547
They know you're alive.

1623
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:24,948
You weren't supposed
to survive.

1624
01:50:25,083 --> 01:50:26,552
None of you were.

1625
01:50:26,688 --> 01:50:28,250
Especially the girl.

1626
01:50:30,049 --> 01:50:31,119
[girl laughing]

1627
01:50:31,254 --> 01:50:33,019
[Brennan] She'll be important,
Margaret.

1628
01:50:35,647 --> 01:50:37,316
I just want to be left alone.

1629
01:50:38,949 --> 01:50:40,184
I know.

1630
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,712
- But they will come for you.
- [gun cocks]

1631
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,514
They've even
given it a name.

1632
01:51:05,379 --> 01:51:06,650
Your son.

1633
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:08,448
[wind whistling]

1634
01:51:09,017 --> 01:51:10,119
[Brennan] Damien.

1635
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:12,712
[♪ dramatic sinister
music playing]

1636
01:54:29,316 --> 01:54:31,745
[♪ eerie music playing]
