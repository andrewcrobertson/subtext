1
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,538
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,920
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,538
I have seen one before.

4
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,369
Many, many years ago.

5
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:35,098
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

6
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,438
A man...

7
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:42,065
possessed of some radical notions.

8
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,610
What is the most resilient parasite?

9
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,729
A bacteria?

10
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:52,413
A virus?

11
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,062
An intestinal worm?

12
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:58,133
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...

13
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:58,946
An idea.

14
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,852
Resilient. Highly contagious.

15
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:07,558
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

16
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:11,706
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

17
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,531
Right in there somewhere.

18
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,413
For someone like you to steal?

19
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,564
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered

20
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,036
and that makes your thoughts,
vulnerable to theft.

21
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:22,643
It's called extraction.

22
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:26,511
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself,

23
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,178
from even the most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,393
How can you do that?

25
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,824
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

26
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:36,234
I know how to search your
mind and find your secrets.

27
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,452
I know the tricks.

28
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,025
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you are asleep,

29
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,632
your defense, is never down.

30
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:45,012
Look if you want my help,

31
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,684
you are gonna have to be
completely open with me.

32
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,592
I need to know my way around your
thoughts better than your wife,

33
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,861
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

34
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,526
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets.

35
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,558
I need to know what's in that safe.

36
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,543
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,068
Enjoy your evening gentlemen,

38
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,485
as I consider your proposal.

39
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:13,930
He knows.

40
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,219
What's going on up there?

41
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:13,754
Saito knows.

42
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,332
He is playing with us.

43
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,036
Doesn't matter.
I can get it here, trust me.

44
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:19,844
The information is in the safe.

45
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,837
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

46
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,584
What's she doing here?

47
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,733
Just head back to the room.

48
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,168
Alright? I will take care of this.

49
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,191
Ok, make sure you do.
We are here to work.

50
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:41,897
If I jumped...

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,858
would I survive?

52
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,386
With a clean dive, perhaps.

53
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,035
Mal, what are you doing here?

54
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,941
I thought you might be missing me.

55
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:55,953
You know that I am.

56
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,740
But, I can't trust you anymore.

57
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,670
So what?

58
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,131
Looks like Arthur's taste.

59
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,158
Actually the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

60
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,838
Please, have a seat.

61
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:21,718
Tell me...

62
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,095
Do the children miss me?

63
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:29,834
You can't imagine.

64
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:35,256
What are you doing?

65
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,859
Just getting some fresh air.

66
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,987
Stay where you are Mal.

67
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,221
Goddammit.

68
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:57,951
Turn around.

69
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,676
The gun Dom.

70
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,785
Please.

71
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:24,032
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

72
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,915
Did she tell you?

73
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:28,132
Or have you known all along?

74
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:30,915
That you are here to steal from me or,

75
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:33,655
that we are actually asleep?

76
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,691
I want to know the name of your employer.

77
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:45,437
There is no use threatening him
in a dream, right Mal?

78
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,133
That depends on what you are threatening.

79
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,250
Killing him would just wake him up.

80
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:53,320
But pain...

81
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:58,966
Pain is in the mind.

82
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,553
And judging by the decor.

83
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,572
We are in your mind,
are not we Arthur?

84
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,105
What are you doing it's too soon.

85
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,817
I know, but the dream is collapsing.

86
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,059
I am gonna try to keep Saito
under a little bit longer.

87
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:22,692
We are almost there.

88
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:37,756
He was close.

89
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:39,975
Very close.

90
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:55,786
Stop him!

91
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:23,890
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

92
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:46,464
He won't wake.

93
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:52,966
Give him the kick.
What?

94
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,521
Sunk him.

95
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,013
He is out.

96
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,935
You came prepared?

97
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,656
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment.

98
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,920
How did you find it?

99
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:56,593
It's very difficult for a man of your
position to keep a love nest like this secret

100
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:58,882
particularly where there is
a married woman involved.

101
00:11:58,906 --> 00:11:59,945
She would never...

102
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,154
Yet, here we are.

103
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,117
With a dilemma.

104
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,421
They are getting closer.

105
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,085
You got what you came for.
Well, that's not true.

106
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,169
You left out a key piece
of information, didn't you?

107
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,891
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

108
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,499
Question is why did you let us in at all?

109
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,604
An audition.

110
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:18,618
An audition for what?

111
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,427
Doesn't matter. You failed.

112
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,677
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

113
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,931
But your deception was obvious.

114
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:07,817
So...

115
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:09,567
leave me and go.

116
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:11,716
You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

117
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,695
That corporation that hired us,

118
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:15,763
they won't accept failure.

119
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,880
We won't last two days.

120
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:20,997
Cobb?

121
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,754
Looks like I am gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

122
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,252
Tell us what you know!

123
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,450
Tell us what you know, now!

124
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,345
I have always hated this carpet.

125
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,637
It's stained...

126
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,721
and frayed in such distinctive ways.

127
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:43,350
But very definitely made of wool.

128
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,107
Right now,

129
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,639
I am lying on polyester.

130
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:54,947
Which means,

131
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:58,863
I am not lying on my carpet,
in my apartment.

132
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,435
You have lived up to your reputation.
Mr. Cobb.

133
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,308
I am still dreaming.

134
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,798
How did it go?
Not good.

135
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:20,862
Dream within a dream?

136
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:23,356
I am impressed.

137
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:25,920
But in my dream,

138
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,506
you play by my rules.

139
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,584
Yes, but you see Mr. Saito,

140
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:32,307
We are not in your dream.

141
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:33,326
We are in mine.

142
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:44,872
Asshole.

143
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,011
How do you mess up the carpet?

144
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,261
It was not my fault.

145
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,594
You are the architect.

146
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,558
I didn't know he was gonna
rub his cheek on it!

147
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,526
That's enough.

148
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:53,798
You.

149
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,070
What the hell was all that?

150
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:56,597
I have it under control.

151
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,075
I would hate to see you out of control.

152
00:14:58,504 --> 00:14:59,825
We don't have time for this.

153
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,012
I am getting off at Kyoto.

154
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:04,156
He has not gonna check every compartment.

155
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:05,647
Yeah, well. I don't like trains.

156
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,519
Listen.

157
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,248
Every man for himself.

158
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,995
Yes, hello?

159
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,014
<i>Hi Daddy.</i>

160
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,464
<i>Hi Dad.</i>

161
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:28,484
Hey, guys. Hey.

162
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,720
How are you? How you doing?

163
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:33,063
<i>Good. Ok, I guess.</i>

164
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:34,485
Ok?

165
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:37,528
Who is just ok? Is that you James?

166
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:38,402
<i>Yeah.</i>

167
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,996
<i>When are you coming home, Dad?</i>

168
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:44,496
Well. I can't sweetheart, I can't.

169
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,957
Not for a while, remember?

170
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:47,977
<i>Why?</i>

171
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:49,663
Look.

172
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,916
I told you, I am away,

173
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,657
because I am working, right?

174
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,663
<i>Grandma says you are never coming back.</i>

175
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,460
Phillipa, is that you?

176
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,155
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?

177
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,922
<i>She is shaking her head.</i>

178
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,312
Well, I just hope she is wrong about that.

179
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,686
<i>Daddy?</i>

180
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,686
Yeah. James?

181
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,413
<i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

182
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,925
James, we talked about this.

183
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,636
Mommy is not here anymore.

184
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,058
<i>Where?</i>

185
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,453
<i>That's enough, kids.</i>

186
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:30,999
<i>Say bye-bye.</i>

187
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:34,335
Listen. I am gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, alright?

188
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,400
And you be good, you be...

189
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,362
Our ride is on the roof.
Right.

190
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,273
Hey, are you ok?

191
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,312
Yeah. Yeah. I am fine. Why?

192
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,692
Well, down in the dream.

193
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,074
Mal showing up.

194
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,111
Look. I am...

195
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,404
sorry about your leg.

196
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:04,552
Won't happen again.

197
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:05,671
It's getting worse, isn't it?

198
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,500
One apology is all you are getting, alright?

199
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:09,201
Where is Nash?

200
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:10,805
He has not shown. You wanna wait?

201
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:13,504
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans

202
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,034
to COBOL Engineering two hours ago.

203
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,571
By now, they know we failed.

204
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,485
It's time we disappear.

205
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,422
Where you gonna go?

206
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:21,862
Buenos Aires.

207
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:25,171
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down.

208
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,071
You?
Stateside.

209
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,954
Send my regards.

210
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,663
He sold you out.

211
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:39,233
Thought to come to me
and bargain for his life.

212
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,153
So, I offer you the satisfaction.

213
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,625
It's not the way I deal with things.

214
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:02,794
What will you do with him?

215
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,162
Nothing.

216
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:07,526
But I can't speak for COBOL Engineering.

217
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,406
What do you want from us?

218
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:25,148
Inception.

219
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:27,905
Is it possible?

220
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:28,913
Of course not.

221
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:31,569
If you can steal an idea
from someone is mind,

222
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,710
why can't you plant one there instead?

223
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,073
Ok, here is me planting
an idea in your head.

224
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:38,040
I say you. Don't think about elephants.

225
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,197
What are you thinking about?

226
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,898
Elephants.
Right.

227
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:42,127
But it's not your idea.

228
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,795
Because you know I gave it to you.

229
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:47,197
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

230
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,884
True inspiration is impossible to fake.
That's not true.

231
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:53,806
Can you do it?

232
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,439
Are you offering me a choice?

233
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,908
Because I can find my own way
to square things with COBOL.

234
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,408
Then you do have a choice.

235
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,676
Then I choose to leave, sir.

236
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:09,788
Tell the crew where you want to go.

237
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:15,927
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

238
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:20,613
How would you like to go home?

239
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:22,791
To America.

240
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:24,837
To your children.

241
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,131
You can't fix that.

242
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:28,720
No one can.

243
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,634
Just like inception.

244
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:31,966
Cobb, come on.

245
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:37,606
How complex is the idea?

246
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:38,968
Simple enough.

247
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,639
No idea is simple, when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

248
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:46,197
My main competitor
is an old man in poor health.

249
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:50,088
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

250
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:55,009
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

251
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,835
Cobb, we should walk away from this.
Hold on.

252
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,748
If I were to do this...

253
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,532
If I even could do it,

254
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:05,454
I would need a guarantee.

255
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,638
How do I know you can deliver?

256
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:08,727
You don't.

257
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:10,826
But I can.

258
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:12,638
So...

259
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,935
do you want to take a leap of faith,

260
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,443
or become an old man.

261
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:20,684
Filled with regret,

262
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:22,743
waiting to die alone?

263
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,233
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.

264
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:30,467
And choose your people more wisely.

265
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,945
I know how much you wanna go home.

266
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,882
This can't be done.

267
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,601
Yes, it can.

268
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,814
Just have to go deep enough.
You don't know that.

269
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,228
I have done it before.

270
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,260
Who did you do it to?

271
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:02,618
Why are we going to Paris?

272
00:22:04,997 --> 00:22:06,579
We are gonna need a new architect.

273
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,511
You never did like your office, did you?

274
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:29,852
No space to think in that broom cupboard.

275
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,172
Is it safe for you to be here?

276
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:38,273
Extradition between France
and the United States,

277
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,107
is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

278
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:43,220
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

279
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:44,271
Look, I...

280
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:48,310
brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

281
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,130
It will take more than
the occasional stuffed animal,

282
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,724
to convince those children
they still have a father.

283
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:56,693
I am just doing what I know.
I am doing what you taught me.

284
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,884
I never taught you to be a thief.

285
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,253
No, you taught me
to navigate people's minds.

286
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,551
But after what happened...

287
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:05,986
there were not a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

288
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,921
What are you doing here, Dom?

289
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:16,842
I think I found a way home.

290
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,511
It's a job for some very,

291
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,498
very powerful people.

292
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,561
People who I believe,
can fix my charges permanently.

293
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:28,101
But I need your help.

294
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:31,881
You are here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

295
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,953
You know what I am offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

296
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,589
Money.
Not just money.

297
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:37,788
You remember.

298
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:39,072
It's,

299
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:41,047
the chance to build cathedrals.

300
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,424
Entire cities things that never existed,

301
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,424
things that could not
exist in the real world.

302
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,534
So, you want me to let someone else,

303
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,156
follow you into your fantasy?

304
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,588
They don't actually come into the dream,
they just...

305
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:57,442
they just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

306
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:59,106
Design it yourself.

307
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:02,911
Mal won't let me.

308
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,119
Come back to reality Dom.

309
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:13,760
Please.

310
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,232
Reality.

311
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:16,857
Those kids,

312
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:18,695
your grandchildren,

313
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:22,271
they are waiting for their father
to come back home, that's their reality.

314
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,993
And this job, this last job.

315
00:24:25,193 --> 00:24:26,481
That's how I get there.

316
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:30,139
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

317
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,926
I need an architect
who is as good as I was.

318
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:42,153
I have got somebody better.

319
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,854
Ariadne?

320
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,275
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

321
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:50,254
Pleased to meet you.

322
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:51,728
If you have a few moments,

323
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:55,094
Mr. Cobb has a job offer
he would like to discuss with you.

324
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:56,510
A work placement?

325
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,759
Not exactly.

326
00:24:58,358 --> 00:24:59,689
I have a test for you.

327
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,396
You are not gonna tell me anything first?

328
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:05,387
Before I describe the job.
I have to know you can do it.

329
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:06,239
Why?

330
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,591
It's not, strictly speaking legal.

331
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:12,457
You have,

332
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:13,583
two minutes,

333
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:16,297
to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

334
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:19,000
Stop.

335
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:22,607
Again.

336
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:25,929
Stop.

337
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,337
You are gonna have to do better than that.

338
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:45,946
That's more like it.

339
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,447
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

340
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,022
Now, that's when we are awake.

341
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:12,476
When we are asleep.

342
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,140
Our mind can do almost anything.

343
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:15,238
Such as?

344
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:17,326
So imagine you are designing a building,

345
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:19,443
You consciously create each aspect.

346
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,338
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself,

347
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:23,428
if you know what I mean.
Yeak.

348
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,488
Yeah, like I am...

349
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,822
discovering it.

350
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:27,824
Genuine inspiration, right?

351
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,409
Now in a dream.

352
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,412
Our mind continuously does this.
We...

353
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:36,811
create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

354
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:39,825
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

355
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,518
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

356
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:45,763
How?
By taking over the creating part.

357
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:47,305
Now, this is where I need you.

358
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,475
You create the world of the dream.

359
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,932
We bring the subject into that dream.

360
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,526
And they fill it with their subconscious.

361
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:56,311
How could I ever...

362
00:26:56,674 --> 00:27:00,096
acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

363
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,650
Well, dreams...

364
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,072
they feel real
while we are in them, right?

365
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:07,933
So it's only when we wake up that
we realize something was actually strange.

366
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,564
Let me ask you a question.
You...

367
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:11,743
you never really,

368
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:14,064
remember the
beginning of a dream, do you?

369
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,288
You always wind up,

370
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:17,166
right in the middle of what's going on.

371
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:18,430
I guess, yeah.

372
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,198
So how did we end up here?

373
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:22,121
Well, we just came from the...

374
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:25,847
Think about it. Ariadne.
How did you get here?

375
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,269
Where are you right now?

376
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,185
We are dreaming?

377
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,032
You are in the middle of the workshop,
right now, sleeping.

378
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,538
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming.

379
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:39,655
Stay calm.

380
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,560
If it's just a dream. Then why are you...

381
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,604
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

382
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:24,232
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you are in it,

383
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,797
it feels real.

384
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:28,658
That's why the military developed
dream sharing it was a training program,

385
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:32,566
for soldiers to shoot stab and strangle
each other and then wake up.

386
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,883
How did architects become involved?

387
00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:37,393
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

388
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,829
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

389
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,520
Five minutes?

390
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,172
What...

391
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,305
We were talking for like at least an hour.

392
00:28:46,544 --> 00:28:49,883
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly therefore...

393
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,920
time seems to feel more slow.

394
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:54,568
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

395
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,576
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

396
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:06,358
You have got the basic layout.

397
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:08,206
Bookstore, cafe.

398
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:09,798
Almost everything else is here too.

399
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:12,901
Who are the people?
Projections of my subconscious.

400
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,268
Yours?
Yes.

401
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,785
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

402
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,119
I am the subject.

403
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:19,625
My mind populates it.

404
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,789
You can literally...

405
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,148
talk to my subconscious.

406
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:24,776
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

407
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,063
How else do you do it?

408
00:29:26,406 --> 00:29:28,505
By creating something secure.
Like a...

409
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:30,518
like a bank vault or a jail.

410
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:34,274
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

411
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,540
You understand?

412
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,211
Then you break in and steal it?

413
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:38,259
Well...

414
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:39,683
I guess I thought that...

415
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:42,689
the dream space would be
all about the visual but...

416
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:44,870
it's more about the feel of it.

417
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:49,300
My question is, what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

418
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,527
It's something, isn't it?

419
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,832
Yes, it is.

420
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:00,575
Why are they all looking at me?

421
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:04,333
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

422
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:05,977
The more you change things,

423
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,475
the quicker the projections start
to converge on you.

424
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:09,803
Converge?

425
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:12,102
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

426
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:15,138
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

427
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:16,654
What, they are gonna attack us?

428
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:17,583
No.

429
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:19,505
Just you.

430
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:27,536
This is great, but I am telling you.
If you keep changing things like this...

431
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,803
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

432
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,672
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

433
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,589
Very impressive.

434
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,577
I know this bridge.

435
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:47,988
This place is real, isn't it?

436
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:50,518
Yeah. I cross it every day
to get to the college.

437
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:54,158
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

438
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:56,048
You draw from stuff you know, right?

439
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:57,505
Only use details...

440
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,318
A streetlamp
or a phone booth.

441
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:01,283
Never entire areas.
Why not?

442
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,158
Because building a dream from your memory

443
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:06,436
is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

444
00:33:06,492 --> 00:33:08,350
Is that what happened to you?
Listen to me.

445
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:10,335
This has nothing to do with me, understand?

446
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,583
That why you need me to build your dreams?

447
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,230
Hey, get off of her.

448
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:15,764
Back up. Back up.
Hey!

449
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,512
Cobb! Cobb!
Get off of her!

450
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,471
Let me go! Let me go!
Mal!

451
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:21,956
Cobb! Wake me up!
Mal!

452
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:24,097
Wake me up! Wake me up!
Mal! No!

453
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,124
Let me go! Let me go!
Mal, no! No!

454
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,495
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

455
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,014
You are ok. You are ok.

456
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:32,540
Hey.
Why...

457
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:34,225
Why would not I wake up?

458
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:36,968
There was still time on the clock.

459
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,155
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

460
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:41,084
She will need a totem.
What?

461
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,870
A totem, it's a small personal...

462
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,420
That's some subconscious
you have got on you, Cobb!

463
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,213
She is a real charmer.

464
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,182
I see you met Mrs. Cobb.

465
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,228
She is his wife?

466
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,935
Yeah. So a totem.

467
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,660
You need a small object, potentially heavy.

468
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,112
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

469
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,338
Like a coin?
No.

470
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:00,193
It needs to be more unique than that, like...

471
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:01,527
this is a...

472
00:34:01,855 --> 00:34:02,863
loaded die.

473
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:07,192
I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

474
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:11,136
Dee, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

475
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:13,534
That way.
When you look at your totem...

476
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,044
you know beyond a doubt that
you are not in someone else's dream.

477
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,103
I-I-I-I don't know,

478
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,132
if you can't see what's going on,

479
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:24,559
or if you just don't want to...

480
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:28,249
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he has tried to bury down there.

481
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,639
And I am not about to just,

482
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:31,182
open my mind,

483
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:32,451
to someone like that.

484
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,313
She will be back.

485
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:42,276
I have never seen anyone pick
it up that quickly before.

486
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,797
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.
And when she comes back...

487
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,763
When she comes back.
You are gonna have her building mazes.

488
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:52,130
Where are you gonna be?
I got to go visit Eames.

489
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,318
Eames?

490
00:34:53,672 --> 00:34:54,872
No, he is in Mombasa.

491
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:55,943
It's Cobol's back yard.

492
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:57,536
It's a necessary risk.

493
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,110
Well, there is plenty of good thieves.

494
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:00,779
We don't just need a thief.

495
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,146
We need a forger.

496
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,570
Rub them together all you want.
They are not gonna breed.

497
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,140
You never know.

498
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,386
I am gonna get you a drink.

499
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,126
You are buying.

500
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,258
Your spelling has not improved.
Piss off.

501
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:32,802
How is your handwriting?

502
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:35,224
It's versatile.
Good.

503
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,606
Thank you very much.

504
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:38,408
Inception.

505
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,126
Now, before you...

506
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:42,247
bother telling me it's impossible,

507
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:43,713
No, it's perfectly possible.

508
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:45,141
It's just bloody difficult.

509
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:46,549
Interesting.

510
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,111
Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

511
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:50,803
Arthur.

512
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:52,291
You still working
with that stick in the mud?

513
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,011
He is good at what he does, right?

514
00:35:54,227 --> 00:35:56,286
Oh, he is the best.
But he has no imagination.

515
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:57,486
Not like you.

516
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:00,480
Listen, if you are gonna perform inception.
You need imagination.

517
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,228
Let me ask you something.

518
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,307
Have you done it before?

519
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,635
We tried it.

520
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,190
We got the idea in place.
But it didn't take.

521
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:09,909
You didn't plant it deep enough?

522
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,699
No, it's not just about depth, you know.

523
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,118
You need the simplest version of the idea

524
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:16,460
in order for it to grow
naturally in your subject's mind.

525
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:17,623
It's a subtle art.

526
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,476
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

527
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:21,876
We need the heir of...

528
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,751
a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

529
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,423
Right there you have
various political motivations...

530
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:29,529
and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

531
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,085
But all of that stuff, it's...

532
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,415
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

533
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,271
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

534
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,540
Which is what?

535
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:40,959
The relationship with the father.

536
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,386
Do you have a chemist?
No, not yet.

537
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,306
Right. Ok, well.
There is a man here.

538
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,342
Yusuf. He...

539
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,456
He formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

540
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:53,777
Why don't you take me there?

541
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:55,034
Once you have lost your tail.

542
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,271
The man at the bar.

543
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,523
COBOL Engineering.

544
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,136
That price on my head.
Was that dead or alive?

545
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:02,219
Don't remember.

546
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:03,446
Let's see if he starts shooting.

547
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:06,838
Run interference, I will meet you
downstairs in the bar in, say...

548
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,381
half an hour?
Back here?

549
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,024
This is the last place they would suspect.

550
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:12,935
Alright.

551
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,388
Freddy?

552
00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:16,804
Freddy Simmonds.

553
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,296
My God, it's you, isn't it?

554
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:22,705
No, it isn't you.

555
00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:24,693
Not dreaming now, are you?

556
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,631
Get him!

557
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,506
There!

558
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:05,042
Cafe.

559
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:06,174
One-one cafe.

560
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,054
One cafe.

561
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,468
One cafe.

562
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,469
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

563
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,389
What are you doing in Mombasa?

564
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:23,434
I am here to protect my investment.

565
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,340
So this is your idea of losing a tail?

566
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:30,532
Different tail.

567
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,727
Cobb said you would be back.

568
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,703
I tried not to come, but...

569
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:45,570
But there is nothing quite like it.

570
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:46,790
It's just...

571
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:50,077
pure creation.

572
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,319
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

573
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,170
You are gonna have to master a few tricks,

574
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:57,209
if you are gonna build three
complete dream levels.

575
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:58,334
Excuse me.

576
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,233
What kind of tricks?

577
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:04,285
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

578
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,267
That lets you create closed loops.

579
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,318
Like the Penrose Steps.

580
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,690
The infinite staircase.

581
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:14,588
See.

582
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,449
Paradox.

583
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,418
So a closed loop like that,

584
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:25,324
will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

585
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,432
But how big do these levels have to be?

586
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,823
It could be anything from the floor
of a building to an entire city.

587
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,901
They have to be complicated enough,

588
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,482
that we can hide from the projections.

589
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:35,906
A maze?
Right, a maze.

590
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:37,498
And the better the maze...

591
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,272
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

592
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:41,443
Exactly.

593
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,055
My subconscious seems polite enough.

594
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:46,010
You wait, they will turn ugly.

595
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:48,323
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

596
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:50,972
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

597
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:55,081
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

598
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:57,701
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

599
00:40:57,763 --> 00:40:58,615
Why?

600
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,820
He won't tell me.

601
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:01,533
But I think it's Mal.

602
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:02,865
His ex-wife?

603
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:04,145
No, not his ex.

604
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:05,618
They are still together?

605
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:06,763
No.

606
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:09,677
She is dead.

607
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:14,262
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

608
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:19,856
What was she like in real life?

609
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:21,717
She was lovely.

610
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,098
You are seeking a chemist?

611
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,052
Yes.

612
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,354
To formulate compounds for a job?

613
00:41:31,245 --> 00:41:32,895
And to go into the field with us.

614
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,261
No. I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

615
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:39,198
Well, we would need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

616
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,403
Which are?

617
00:41:40,552 --> 00:41:41,589
Great depth.

618
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:43,114
A dream within a dream?

619
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:44,925
Two levels?

620
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,542
Three.

621
00:41:49,162 --> 00:41:50,068
Not possible.

622
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:52,593
That many dreams within
dreams is too unstable.

623
00:41:52,618 --> 00:41:53,451
It is...

624
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:54,664
possible.

625
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,693
You just have to add a sedative.

626
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:58,254
A powerful...

627
00:41:58,457 --> 00:41:59,596
sedative.

628
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,508
How many team members?

629
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,604
Five.

630
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:04,653
Six.

631
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,222
The only way to know
you have done the job...

632
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:10,396
is if I go in with you.

633
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:13,497
There is no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

634
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,991
This time, it seems there is.

635
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:19,066
This. I think, is a good place to start.

636
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:20,888
I use it every day.

637
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,111
What for?

638
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:23,633
Here. I will show you.

639
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,067
Perhaps you will not want to see.

640
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:33,114
After you.

641
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,632
Ten.

642
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:46,065
Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

643
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:47,970
They come every day to share the dream.

644
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,515
You see?

645
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:53,437
Very stable.

646
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:00,608
How long do they dream for?

647
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:01,817
Three, four hours,

648
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:02,927
each day.

649
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:04,546
In dream time?

650
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:05,849
With this compound?

651
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:07,781
About 40 hours.

652
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:08,644
Each and every day.

653
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,043
Why do they do it?

654
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:11,434
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

655
00:43:13,684 --> 00:43:15,934
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

656
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,985
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

657
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:20,252
They come here every day to sleep?

658
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,461
No.

659
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:25,816
They come to be woken up.

660
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:29,894
The dream, has become their reality.

661
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,016
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

662
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,602
Let's see what you can do.

663
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:50,970
You know how to find me.

664
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,038
You know what you have to do.

665
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,648
Sharp, no?

666
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,227
Are you alright,

667
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:19,318
Mr. Cobb?

668
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,064
Yeah, yeah.

669
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:23,630
Everything is just fine.

670
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,826
Robert Fischer,

671
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:36,457
heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

672
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,468
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

673
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:40,094
That's not your concern.

674
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:42,001
Mr. Saito this...

675
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,921
this isn't your typical corporate espionage.

676
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:46,912
You-you asked me for inception.

677
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,507
I do hope you understand,

678
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:50,226
the gravity of that request.

679
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,260
Now,

680
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:54,669
the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

681
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,398
This idea will define him.

682
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:58,271
It may come to change...

683
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,868
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

684
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:05,029
We are the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

685
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:07,224
And we can no longer compete.

686
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:11,085
Soon, they will control the energy supply
of half the world.

687
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:12,239
In effect,

688
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:13,952
they become a new superpower.

689
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,520
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

690
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:20,248
That's where we come in.

691
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,691
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

692
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:24,793
Rumor is...

693
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:26,801
the relationship is quite complicated.

694
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,379
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

695
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:31,528
Can you get me access to this man here?

696
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:32,685
Browning.

697
00:45:33,138 --> 00:45:34,989
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.

698
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:36,919
Fischer Junior's godfather.

699
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:38,442
It should be possible.

700
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:40,404
If you can get the right references.

701
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:44,404
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

702
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,076
I am not smelling settlement here.

703
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,775
Take them down.
Mr. Browning!

704
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:53,517
Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

705
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,201
Well,

706
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,873
shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

707
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,569
Not sure that's necessary.

708
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:04,636
No, no, no. I-I think we should.

709
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:27,769
How is he?

710
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:31,543
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but...

711
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,749
Robert, I told you...

712
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,515
keep out the damn.

713
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:36,757
Wait.

714
00:46:36,782 --> 00:46:37,991
So do it. Get...

715
00:46:38,113 --> 00:46:40,483
Mr. Fischer.
Put it through.

716
00:46:41,415 --> 00:46:42,621
Never, never.

717
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:45,010
Never do the same as I asked.

718
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:47,279
Leave that.

719
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,388
Here.

720
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:57,662
Must be a cherished memory of his.

721
00:46:58,698 --> 00:47:00,180
I put it beside his bed.

722
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:02,904
He has not even noticed.

723
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,443
Robert...

724
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:09,831
we need to talk about a power of attorney.

725
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:11,253
I know this is hard, but...
Not now.

726
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:13,103
But it's imperative we start...
Uncle Peter.

727
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,091
The vultures are circling.

728
00:47:19,427 --> 00:47:23,130
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

729
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:26,240
I have had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

730
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,667
and adopt his physical presence,

731
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:30,995
study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

732
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:34,753
So now in the first layer of the dream.
I can impersonate Browning.

733
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:38,340
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

734
00:47:38,677 --> 00:47:39,211
Then,

735
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,394
when we take him
a level deeper his own...

736
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:44,347
projection of Browning should
feed that right back to him.

737
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:46,370
So he gives himself the idea.

738
00:47:46,538 --> 00:47:47,449
Precisely.

739
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,794
That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

740
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:51,839
Eames.

741
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:53,605
I am impressed.

742
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:55,736
Your condescension,

743
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,074
as always, is much appreciated.
Arthur thank you.

744
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:21,374
Were you going under on your own?

745
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,930
No, no. I was just...

746
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:24,911
running some experiments.

747
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,345
I didn't realize anyone was here.

748
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,074
Yeah. I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

749
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:31,709
Here, let me take a look.

750
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:34,982
So you are learning?

751
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,055
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

752
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:40,447
Was it your idea?

753
00:48:40,471 --> 00:48:41,591
No, it was...

754
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,695
It was Mal's actually. This...

755
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:45,994
This one was hers.

756
00:48:46,018 --> 00:48:48,064
She would spin it in the dream
and it would never topple.

757
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:49,414
Just...

758
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:51,385
spin and spin.

759
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:54,853
Arthur told me she passed away.

760
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,571
How are the mazes coming along?

761
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:03,614
Each level relates to the part of the subject's
subconscious that we are trying to access.

762
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:04,263
So,

763
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,848
I am making the bottom level a hospital.

764
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:08,678
So Fischer will bring his father...

765
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:12,646
You know, I... I actually.
I have a question about this layout.

766
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:13,528
No, no, no. Don't...

767
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:15,065
Don't show me specifics.

768
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,889
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

769
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:18,911
Why is that so important?

770
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,131
In case one of us brings in our projections.

771
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:23,436
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

772
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:26,912
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

773
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,225
You can't keep her out, can you?

774
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:31,483
Right.

775
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:34,277
You can't build because
if you know the maze.

776
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:35,925
Then she knows it.

777
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:37,886
Well, she would sabotage the whole operation.

778
00:49:38,496 --> 00:49:40,299
Cobb, do the others know?
No.

779
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:41,148
No, they don't.

780
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:43,449
You have got to warn them
if this is getting worse.

781
00:49:43,474 --> 00:49:44,946
No one said it's getting worse.

782
00:49:46,658 --> 00:49:48,015
I need to get home.

783
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:49,641
That's all I care about right now.

784
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:52,399
Why can't you go home?

785
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,790
Because they think I killed her.

786
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:02,446
Thank you.

787
00:50:03,176 --> 00:50:04,040
For what?

788
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,747
For not asking whether I did.

789
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:08,855
I will split up my father's empire.

790
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,711
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

791
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:15,962
which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

792
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,362
The subconscious...

793
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:19,109
is motivated by emotion, right?

794
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,907
Not reason. We need to find
a way to translate this,

795
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,571
into an emotional concept.

796
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:25,929
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

797
00:50:26,098 --> 00:50:27,743
That's what we are here
to figure out right?

798
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:31,737
Robert's relationship with his father
is stressed, to say the least.

799
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:33,022
Can we run with that?

800
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,622
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a screw you to the old man.

801
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,565
No, because I think positive emotion...

802
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:40,583
trumps negative emotion every time.

803
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,569
We all yearn for reconciliation.

804
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,801
For catharsis.

805
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:48,048
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

806
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,368
Alright, well try this.

807
00:50:50,602 --> 00:50:54,939
My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps.

808
00:50:55,512 --> 00:50:56,493
That might work.

809
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,360
Might?

810
00:50:58,511 --> 00:51:00,231
We need to do a little better than might.

811
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,059
Thank you for your contribution Arthur.

812
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:04,693
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity Eames.

813
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,446
Specificity?

814
00:51:06,558 --> 00:51:08,674
Inception's not about being specific.

815
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,931
When we get inside his mind, we are
gonna have to work with what we find.

816
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,935
On the top level,

817
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,860
we open up his relationship
with his father...

818
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:17,979
and say,

819
00:51:18,003 --> 00:51:20,304
I will not follow in my father's footsteps.

820
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:22,401
Then the next level down, we feed him,

821
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:25,259
I will create something for myself.

822
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:25,935
Then,

823
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:28,407
by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

824
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:30,893
My father doesn't want me to be him.
Exactly.

825
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,245
Three layers down,

826
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:34,830
the dreams are gonna collapse,

827
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:36,410
with the slightest disturbance.

828
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:37,491
Sedation.

829
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:39,000
For sleep,

830
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:41,171
stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming

831
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:44,061
we will have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

832
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,387
Good night.

833
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,938
The compound we will be
using to share the dream

834
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:02,454
creates a very clear connection
between dreamers whilst,

835
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:04,594
actually accelerating brain function.

836
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,847
In other words, more time on each level.

837
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,722
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

838
00:52:10,191 --> 00:52:11,950
And when you enter a dream within
that dream,

839
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:13,647
the effect is compounded.

840
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:15,338
It's three dreams.
That's 10 hours times 20...

841
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:18,651
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

842
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:21,182
It's a week, the first level down.

843
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,879
Six months the second level down.

844
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:25,778
And the third level...

845
00:52:25,803 --> 00:52:26,778
That's 10 years.

846
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:31,857
Who would want be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

847
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,479
Depends on the dream.

848
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:36,070
So once we have made the plant.
How do we get out?

849
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:39,306
I am hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

850
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:40,353
A kick.

851
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:42,109
What's a kick?

852
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:43,027
This.

853
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:44,507
Ariadne, would be a kick.

854
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:49,865
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

855
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,576
Snaps you out of the dream.

856
00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:53,567
How we gonna feel a kick
with this sedation?

857
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:54,748
That's the clever part.

858
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:57,904
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

859
00:52:58,149 --> 00:52:58,997
That way,

860
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:00,530
however deep the sleep.

861
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,559
The sleeper still feels falling.

862
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,629
Or tipping.

863
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:08,381
The trick is to synchronize a kick,

864
00:53:08,514 --> 00:53:10,172
that can penetrate all three levels.

865
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:14,094
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

866
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:24,648
He has not got any surgery scheduled,

867
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,140
no dental, nothing.

868
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,100
Was not he supposed to have
a knee operation?

869
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,031
Nothing.

870
00:53:29,146 --> 00:53:31,304
Nothing that they will put him
under for, anyway we need...

871
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,510
We need at least a good 10 hours.

872
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:34,949
Sydney to Los Angeles.

873
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:38,161
One of the longest flights in the world.

874
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:40,119
He makes it every two weeks.

875
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:42,643
He must be flying private, then.

876
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:46,457
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

877
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:49,066
It would have to be a 747.
Why's that?

878
00:53:49,134 --> 00:53:50,892
On a 747, the pilot's up top,

879
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:52,676
the first-class cabin's in the nose.

880
00:53:52,785 --> 00:53:54,192
So no one would walk through.

881
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:56,012
Wait you would have
to buy out the entire cabin

882
00:53:56,036 --> 00:53:57,748
and the first-class flight attendant.

883
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:59,154
I bought the airline.

884
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,544
It seemed neater.

885
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:06,478
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

886
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,119
Ariadne?

887
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:11,251
Terrific work, by the way.

888
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,762
You know how to find me.

889
00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:04,242
You know what you have to do.

890
00:55:08,033 --> 00:55:10,869
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

891
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:13,681
Of course I do.

892
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,344
You said you had a dream.

893
00:55:21,338 --> 00:55:23,022
That we would grow old together.

894
00:55:24,996 --> 00:55:26,291
And we can.

895
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:34,932
You should not be here.

896
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:42,678
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you are doing on your own every night.

897
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:44,483
This has nothing to do with you.

898
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:46,035
This has everything to do with me.

899
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:47,879
You have asked me
to share dreams with you.

900
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:49,061
Not these.

901
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,391
These are my dreams.

902
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,504
Why do you do this to yourself?

903
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:07,546
It's the only way I can still dream.

904
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,859
Why is it so important to dream?

905
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,067
In my dreams, we are still together.

906
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,126
These are not just dreams.

907
00:56:33,438 --> 00:56:34,629
These are memories.

908
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:36,234
And you said never to use memories.

909
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:37,664
I know I did.

910
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:39,937
You are trying to keep her alive.

911
00:56:40,736 --> 00:56:41,984
You can't let her go.

912
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:44,281
You don't understand.

913
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:46,229
These are moments I regret.

914
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:48,407
They are memories that I have to change.

915
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:51,876
Well, what's down there that you regret?

916
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:55,879
Listen, there is only one thing
you need to understand about me.

917
00:57:04,362 --> 00:57:05,629
This is your house?

918
00:57:06,774 --> 00:57:08,207
Mine and Mal's, yes.

919
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,395
Where is she?

920
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,090
She is already gone.

921
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,176
That's my son, James.

922
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:22,559
He is digging for something.
Maybe a worm.

923
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,766
That's Phillipa.

924
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:28,082
See I thought about calling out,

925
00:57:28,253 --> 00:57:30,627
so they would turn and smile
and I could see this...

926
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:33,908
those beautiful faces of theirs but...

927
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:36,578
it's all too late.

928
00:57:37,228 --> 00:57:39,328
Right now, or never Cobb.

929
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:45,859
Then I start to panic.

930
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:49,187
I realize I am gonna regret
this moment that...

931
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:52,280
I need to see their faces one last time.
James!

932
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,333
Phillipa!

933
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:54,755
Come on in!

934
00:57:55,192 --> 00:57:56,663
But the moment has past.

935
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:02,088
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

936
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:05,923
As I am about to call out to them...

937
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:07,948
they run away.

938
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:12,268
I am ever gonna see their faces,

939
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:14,092
again I have got to get back home.

940
00:58:14,983 --> 00:58:16,022
The real world.

941
00:58:57,942 --> 00:58:59,409
What are you doing here?

942
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,337
My name is...

943
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:02,674
I know who you are.

944
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:04,330
What are you doing here?

945
00:59:12,991 --> 00:59:15,425
I am just trying to understand.

946
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,118
How could you understand?

947
00:59:19,062 --> 00:59:21,189
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

948
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:24,934
To be half of a whole?

949
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,317
No.

950
00:59:29,474 --> 00:59:31,020
I will tell you a riddle.

951
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,826
You are waiting for a train.

952
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:38,889
A train that will take you far away.

953
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:43,399
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

954
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,844
but you don't know for sure.

955
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,914
But it doesn't matter.

956
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:52,160
How can it not matter to you

957
00:59:52,184 --> 00:59:53,673
where that train will take you?

958
00:59:53,698 --> 00:59:55,061
Because you will be together.

959
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:58,414
How could you bring her here Dom?

960
00:59:58,439 --> 00:59:59,719
What is this place?

961
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:03,228
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

962
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:04,584
What happened here?

963
01:00:06,577 --> 01:00:07,592
You promised!

964
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:10,177
You promised, we would be together!

965
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:12,147
Please. I need you to stay here
just for now!

966
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:15,539
You said we would be together!
You said we would grow old together!

967
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:16,967
I will come back for you.

968
01:00:17,485 --> 01:00:18,545
I promise.

969
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:37,455
Do you think,

970
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,844
you can just build a prison
of memories to lock her in?

971
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:44,970
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

972
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:46,837
It's time.

973
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,143
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

974
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:51,718
When is the funeral?

975
01:00:51,743 --> 01:00:53,194
Thursday. In Los Angeles.

976
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,668
Robert should accompany
the body no later than Tuesday.

977
01:00:55,764 --> 01:00:57,007
We should move.
Alright.

978
01:00:58,296 --> 01:00:59,553
Cobb. I am coming with you.

979
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:01,446
I promised Miles. No.

980
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:03,106
The team needs someone,

981
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,889
who understands what
you are struggling with.

982
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,014
And it doesn't have to be me...

983
01:01:09,704 --> 01:01:11,572
but then you have to show Arthur,

984
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,063
what I just saw.

985
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:20,474
Get us another seat on the plane.

986
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,586
If I get on this plane and
you don't honor our agreement,

987
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:30,927
when we land I go to jail
for the rest of my life.

988
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:34,029
Complete the job en route,

989
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:36,766
I make one phone call from the plane,

990
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:39,749
you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

991
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:56,075
I am sorry.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

992
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,021
Thank you.

993
01:02:31,717 --> 01:02:33,404
Excuse me. I think this is yours?

994
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,067
You must have dropped it.

995
01:02:35,329 --> 01:02:36,936
Would you care for a drink?

996
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,258
Oh. Water, please.

997
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:40,067
Oh... same, please.

998
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:44,826
Thank you.

999
01:02:45,183 --> 01:02:46,918
You know I could not help but notice but...

1000
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:49,087
you would not happen to be related to...

1001
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:50,633
the Maurice Fischer, would you?

1002
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,090
Yes, he...

1003
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:54,895
He was my father.

1004
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:59,372
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I am sorry for your loss.

1005
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:04,270
Here you go.
Thank you.

1006
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:05,291
Hey.

1007
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:07,557
To your father.

1008
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,023
May he rest in peace?

1009
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:21,376
You could not have peed before you went under?
Sorry.

1010
01:04:21,493 --> 01:04:23,938
A bit too much free champagne
before take off, hey Yusuf?

1011
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:25,032
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

1012
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,548
We know he is going to be looking
for a taxi in this weather.

1013
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:41,124
Asshole!

1014
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,337
Hey man, why don't you try...
Walk away.

1015
01:04:59,749 --> 01:05:01,280
Just have him ca...
I got to go.

1016
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:02,178
Alright. Taxi!

1017
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,452
Thank you.

1018
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:07,141
Alright.

1019
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,032
Third and Market. Snappy.

1020
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:11,157
What are you doing?

1021
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:13,098
Oh sorry, I thought it was free.
It's not.

1022
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:14,607
Maybe we could share.
Maybe not.

1023
01:05:14,631 --> 01:05:16,118
Can you pull over and get this...

1024
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:20,951
Great.

1025
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:27,182
Come on.

1026
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,216
There is $500 in there.

1027
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,447
The wallet is worth more than that.

1028
01:05:41,507 --> 01:05:43,366
So you might at least drop me at my stop.

1029
01:05:43,454 --> 01:05:44,710
I am afraid that it doesn't...

1030
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:45,577
Book!

1031
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:55,922
Cover him!
Down! Down! Down!

1032
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:57,569
What the hell is going on?
What the fuck!

1033
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:03,054
This was not in the design.

1034
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:05,522
Cobb?

1035
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:07,506
Cobb?

1036
01:06:58,072 --> 01:06:58,861
Get him!

1037
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,025
Are you alright?

1038
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:09,578
Yeah. I am ok. I am ok.

1039
01:07:10,096 --> 01:07:12,109
Fischer is ok, unless he gets carsick.

1040
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:13,141
Saito?

1041
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,992
Get Fischer in the back room now.

1042
01:07:34,692 --> 01:07:35,915
Get him in the back room.

1043
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:37,168
Move.
What the hell happened?

1044
01:07:38,027 --> 01:07:39,662
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

1045
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:40,637
I don't know.
Jesus Christ.

1046
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:42,824
Where were you? What happened to you?

1047
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:44,073
Blocked by a freight train.

1048
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,278
Why did you put a train cross
in the middle of a downtown intersection?

1049
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,691
I didn't.
Where did it come from?

1050
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:49,977
Let me ask you a question,
why the hell were we ambushed?

1051
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,847
Those were not normal projections.

1052
01:07:51,872 --> 01:07:53,189
They have been trained for God's sakes!
You are right.

1053
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,394
How could he be trained?

1054
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:55,352
Fischer has

1055
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:56,551
had an extractor,

1056
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:58,700
teach his subconscious to defend itself, so...

1057
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,896
his subconscious is militarized,
it should have shown in the research.

1058
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:03,255
I am sorry.
Why the hell didn't it?

1059
01:08:03,614 --> 01:08:05,661
Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!

1060
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:07,363
This was your job, goddamn it!

1061
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:08,908
This was your responsibility!

1062
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:11,107
You were meant to check
Fischer's background thoroughly!

1063
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:13,155
We are not prepared
for this type of parody!

1064
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,005
We have dealt with sub-security before!

1065
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,748
We will be more careful
and we are gonna be fine!

1066
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:18,743
This was not a part of the plan!
He is dying.

1067
01:08:18,814 --> 01:08:20,070
God!
So we put him out of his misery.

1068
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,252
Cobb!
Don't do that!

1069
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:22,948
Don't do that.
Cobb, hey, hey.

1070
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:25,066
He is in agony.
I am waking him up.

1071
01:08:25,242 --> 01:08:25,965
No.

1072
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:27,408
It won't wake him up.

1073
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:29,488
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
We won't wake him up?

1074
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:31,113
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

1075
01:08:31,138 --> 01:08:32,169
Not from this.

1076
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:34,625
We are too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

1077
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:37,448
Right. So, what happens when we die?

1078
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:39,430
We drop into limbo. Are you serious?

1079
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:40,312
Limbo?

1080
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:42,201
Unconstructed dream space.

1081
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:44,085
Well, what the hell is down there?
Just...

1082
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:45,873
raw, infinite subconscious.

1083
01:08:45,898 --> 01:08:47,192
Nothing is down there,

1084
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:48,972
except for what might have been left behind

1085
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:51,584
by anyone sharing the dream
who is been trapped there before.

1086
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:53,075
Which in our case,

1087
01:08:53,099 --> 01:08:54,082
is just you.

1088
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,957
How long could we be stuck there?

1089
01:08:55,982 --> 01:08:58,532
Don't even think about trying
to escape until the sedation...

1090
01:08:58,557 --> 01:08:59,526
How long?
Jesus.

1091
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:01,347
Decades. It could be infinite, I don't know.

1092
01:09:01,372 --> 01:09:02,760
Ask him, he is the one who is been there.

1093
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,207
Let's get him upstairs.

1094
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:06,910
Great.

1095
01:09:08,285 --> 01:09:09,339
Thank you.

1096
01:09:10,454 --> 01:09:13,792
So, now we are trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army,

1097
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:14,972
and if we get killed,

1098
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:18,242
we will be lost in limbo
till our brains turn to scrambled egg?

1099
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:26,984
Someone got first aid?

1100
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,530
So you knew these risks,

1101
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,699
and didn't tell us?
There were not meant to be risks

1102
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:35,744
I didn't know we would be dealing
with a load of gunfire.

1103
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:36,638
You had no right.

1104
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:38,495
It's the only way
you can go three layers deep.

1105
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:39,872
And you?

1106
01:09:40,077 --> 01:09:41,403
You knew about this
and went along with it?

1107
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,267
I trusted him.

1108
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:44,366
You trusted him? And what did
he promised you half his share?

1109
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:45,044
No.

1110
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:46,462
His whole share.

1111
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:47,834
Besides he said he had done it before.

1112
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,548
You done it before. What with Mal?

1113
01:09:49,766 --> 01:09:51,731
Because that worked so good?
That has nothing to do with it.

1114
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:53,562
I did what I had to to get to my children.

1115
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,672
So you led us into a war
zone with no way out?

1116
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:56,790
There is a way out.

1117
01:09:56,815 --> 01:09:58,620
We continue on with the job,

1118
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:01,593
and we do it as fast as possible
and we get out using the kick.

1119
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:02,681
Just like before.

1120
01:10:02,706 --> 01:10:05,134
Forget it. We go any deeper.
We just raise the stakes.

1121
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:07,152
I am sitting this one out on this level.

1122
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:09,835
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak.

1123
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:12,415
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

1124
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,615
That means each and every one of us
will be killed.

1125
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:16,367
That I can guarantee you.

1126
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:19,788
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

1127
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,498
Downwards is the only way forwards.

1128
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,866
Get ready.

1129
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:29,426
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

1130
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,145
I am insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

1131
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:38,762
This should be very simple.

1132
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:40,505
Shut up! It won't be.

1133
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:44,153
In your father's office below the
bookshelves is his personal safe.

1134
01:10:44,254 --> 01:10:45,638
We need the combination.

1135
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,849
I don't know any safe.

1136
01:10:48,052 --> 01:10:50,231
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

1137
01:10:52,454 --> 01:10:53,801
Tell us what it is.

1138
01:10:54,539 --> 01:10:56,059
I don't know.

1139
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:03,660
We have it on good authority you do know.

1140
01:11:03,734 --> 01:11:04,540
Yeah?

1141
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,230
Whose authority?

1142
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:09,253
Five hundred dollars this cost.

1143
01:11:09,688 --> 01:11:10,797
What's inside it?

1144
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:13,422
Cash, cards, ID...

1145
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:14,586
and this.

1146
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,196
Useful?

1147
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:23,362
Maybe.

1148
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:24,852
You are on.

1149
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:25,884
You have got an hour.

1150
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,114
An hour?

1151
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:30,590
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

1152
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,442
And Saito was not supposed
to be shot in the chest.

1153
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:36,176
You have got one hour.
Now get us something useful, please.

1154
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:40,336
What's that?

1155
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:42,171
Good authority.

1156
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,187
Uncle Peter.

1157
01:11:48,412 --> 01:11:50,247
Just make, just make them stop.

1158
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,180
The combination.
I don't know it.

1159
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,257
Why does Browning say you do?

1160
01:11:55,281 --> 01:11:56,146
I don't know.

1161
01:11:56,334 --> 01:11:58,802
Just let me. Let me talk to him
and I will find out.

1162
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:02,306
You have one hour.

1163
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:03,951
Start talking.

1164
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:06,580
You alright?

1165
01:12:08,754 --> 01:12:09,682
You ok?

1166
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:16,610
Those bastards have had at me for two days.

1167
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,643
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

1168
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:22,533
They are trying to open his safe.
Yeah.

1169
01:12:22,846 --> 01:12:25,576
They thought I would know the combination.
But I don't know it.

1170
01:12:25,749 --> 01:12:27,373
Yeah well, neither do I, so...

1171
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:28,870
What?

1172
01:12:29,347 --> 01:12:31,335
Maurice told me that when he passed.

1173
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:32,950
You were the only one able to open it.

1174
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:35,298
No, he never gave me any combination.

1175
01:12:35,926 --> 01:12:37,007
Maybe he did.

1176
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:39,688
I mean, maybe you just didn't know
it was a combination.

1177
01:12:40,307 --> 01:12:41,438
Well, what then?

1178
01:12:41,463 --> 01:12:44,219
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

1179
01:12:44,244 --> 01:12:46,016
based on your-your...

1180
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,808
your experiences with Maurice.

1181
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,522
We didn't have very many...

1182
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:54,054
Meaningful experiences together.

1183
01:12:54,735 --> 01:12:56,202
Perhaps after your mother died.

1184
01:12:58,811 --> 01:13:00,280
After my mother died.

1185
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,585
You know what he told me?

1186
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:03,992
Robert.

1187
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:05,536
There is really...

1188
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:06,704
nothing...

1189
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:07,810
to be said.

1190
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,755
Well, he was bad with emotion.

1191
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,834
I was 11.

1192
01:13:12,576 --> 01:13:13,529
Uncle Peter.

1193
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:15,462
How is he doing?

1194
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,622
He is in a lot of pain.

1195
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:20,676
When we get down to the lower levels.
The pain will be less intense.

1196
01:13:21,645 --> 01:13:22,817
And if he dies?

1197
01:13:24,047 --> 01:13:25,214
Worst case scenario?

1198
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:28,070
When he wakes up.
His mind is completely gone.

1199
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,059
Cobb.

1200
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,245
I will still honor the arrangement.

1201
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:34,582
I appreciate that Saito but...

1202
01:13:35,066 --> 01:13:38,097
when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

1203
01:13:38,809 --> 01:13:40,834
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

1204
01:13:40,903 --> 01:13:42,948
You are gonna be lost down there so long
that...

1205
01:13:43,612 --> 01:13:44,938
you are gonna become an old man.

1206
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:46,797
Filled with regret?

1207
01:13:48,105 --> 01:13:49,321
Waiting to die alone.

1208
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:50,414
No.

1209
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,446
I will come back.

1210
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:55,960
And we will be young men together again.

1211
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:03,450
Breathe.

1212
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:06,663
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

1213
01:14:06,688 --> 01:14:08,757
They just wanna ransom us.
I heard them.

1214
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:12,824
They are gonna lock us in that van.
And then drive it into the river.

1215
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:14,663
Alright. What is in the safe?

1216
01:14:15,695 --> 01:14:16,855
Something for you.

1217
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:21,201
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

1218
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,022
A will.

1219
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:25,467
Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1220
01:14:25,598 --> 01:14:26,826
That's an alternate.

1221
01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:29,217
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

1222
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,233
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

1223
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:35,444
It would be the end
of the entire empire as we know it.

1224
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:38,073
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1225
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:42,090
Why would he suggest such a thing?

1226
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:43,422
I just don't know.

1227
01:14:46,205 --> 01:14:47,584
He loved you Robert.

1228
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,050
In his own way.

1229
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:51,870
In his own way.

1230
01:14:53,716 --> 01:14:54,831
At the end...

1231
01:14:56,322 --> 01:14:58,339
he called me in to his deathbed.

1232
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:00,711
He could barely speak.

1233
01:15:02,116 --> 01:15:03,403
But he took the trouble...

1234
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:05,656
to tell me one last thing.

1235
01:15:08,848 --> 01:15:10,175
He pulled me close.

1236
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:14,756
And I could only make out...

1237
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,256
one word.

1238
01:15:21,339 --> 01:15:22,402
Disappointed.

1239
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:30,101
When were you in limbo?

1240
01:15:31,842 --> 01:15:35,274
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

1241
01:15:35,299 --> 01:15:36,395
But they don't know the truth.

1242
01:15:36,419 --> 01:15:37,665
Truth? What truth?

1243
01:15:37,956 --> 01:15:39,565
The truth that, at any minute,

1244
01:15:39,737 --> 01:15:42,233
you might bring a freight train
through the wall.

1245
01:15:42,386 --> 01:15:43,361
The truth that,

1246
01:15:43,525 --> 01:15:46,215
Mal is bursting through your subconscious.

1247
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:48,942
And the truth that.
As we go deeper into Fischer...

1248
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:50,801
we are also going deeper into you.

1249
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,327
And...

1250
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,776
I am not sure
we are gonna like what we find.

1251
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:00,389
We were working together.

1252
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:03,297
We were exploring the concept
of a dream,

1253
01:16:03,586 --> 01:16:04,583
within a dream.

1254
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:05,870
I kept pushing things.

1255
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,926
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go...

1256
01:16:08,401 --> 01:16:09,237
further.

1257
01:16:10,135 --> 01:16:14,557
I just didn't understand the concept
that hours could turn into years down,

1258
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:17,219
that we could get trapped so deep only...

1259
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:21,368
when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1260
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:24,744
we lost sight of what was real.

1261
01:16:31,334 --> 01:16:33,682
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

1262
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:36,992
We did that for years.

1263
01:16:38,464 --> 01:16:39,843
We built our own world.

1264
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:43,257
How long were you stuck there?

1265
01:16:44,693 --> 01:16:46,224
Something like 50 years.

1266
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:51,107
Jesus.

1267
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:55,188
How could you stand it?

1268
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:57,599
It was not so bad at first.
Feeling like gods.

1269
01:16:58,261 --> 01:17:01,029
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1270
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:02,439
Eventually,

1271
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:05,497
it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1272
01:17:06,036 --> 01:17:07,224
And what about for her?

1273
01:17:10,907 --> 01:17:14,297
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1274
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:17,981
A truth that she had once known but...

1275
01:17:19,356 --> 01:17:20,783
chose to forget.

1276
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,379
Limbo became her...

1277
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:26,620
reality.

1278
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:29,683
What happened when you woke up?

1279
01:17:30,318 --> 01:17:33,229
Well, to wake up from that after,
after years,

1280
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:34,333
after decades...

1281
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:39,067
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that?

1282
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,286
I knew something was wrong with her.

1283
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:43,970
She just would not admit it.

1284
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:47,556
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1285
01:17:48,341 --> 01:17:50,070
She was possessed...

1286
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:51,474
by an idea.

1287
01:17:51,988 --> 01:17:54,866
This one very simple idea,

1288
01:17:55,398 --> 01:17:57,096
that changed everything.

1289
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:00,798
That our world was not real.

1290
01:18:02,255 --> 01:18:05,910
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality that...

1291
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,715
in order to get back home...

1292
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:11,997
we had to kill ourselves.

1293
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,505
What about your children?

1294
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,830
She thought they were projections,

1295
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:25,682
that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

1296
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:27,603
I am their mother!
Calm down.

1297
01:18:27,655 --> 01:18:29,323
I can tell the difference.

1298
01:18:29,348 --> 01:18:31,465
If this is my dream.
Why can't I control this?

1299
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,185
Because you don't know you are dreaming!

1300
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:35,957
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1301
01:18:36,088 --> 01:18:39,286
no matter how much I begged.
No matter how much I pleaded.

1302
01:18:42,683 --> 01:18:45,709
She wanted to do it.
But she could not do it alone.

1303
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:47,591
She loved me too much so...

1304
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:50,088
she came up with a plan...

1305
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:51,771
on our anniversary.

1306
01:19:18,602 --> 01:19:19,788
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

1307
01:19:20,226 --> 01:19:21,226
Join me.

1308
01:19:21,282 --> 01:19:21,828
Just,

1309
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,497
just step back inside.

1310
01:19:23,763 --> 01:19:25,781
Alright?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1311
01:19:25,806 --> 01:19:26,710
No.

1312
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:30,075
I am going to jump and
you are coming with me.

1313
01:19:30,403 --> 01:19:31,434
No. I am not.

1314
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,965
Now, you listen to me.

1315
01:19:35,052 --> 01:19:36,051
If you jump,

1316
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,147
you are not gonna wake up, remember?

1317
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,816
You are gonna die. I am just...

1318
01:19:40,129 --> 01:19:42,307
just step back inside.
Come on.

1319
01:19:42,331 --> 01:19:44,340
Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1320
01:19:44,461 --> 01:19:45,695
We have talked enough.

1321
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,130
Mal.

1322
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:51,617
Come out onto the ledge
or I will jump right now.

1323
01:19:51,835 --> 01:19:52,614
Ok.

1324
01:19:57,407 --> 01:19:58,704
We are gonna talk about this.

1325
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:00,718
Alright?

1326
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:03,913
I am asking you to take a leap of faith.

1327
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:05,890
No, honey.

1328
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:08,375
No. I can't.

1329
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:10,115
You know I can't do that.

1330
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,544
Take a second, think about our children.

1331
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,584
Think about James.

1332
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:17,427
Think about Phillipa now.

1333
01:20:17,827 --> 01:20:20,268
If I go without you.
They will take them away anyway.

1334
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:22,104
What does that mean?

1335
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:24,381
I filed a letter with our attorney,

1336
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:27,167
explaining how I am fearful
for my safety.

1337
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,977
How you have threatened to kill me.

1338
01:20:35,092 --> 01:20:37,398
Why did you do this?
I love you Dom.

1339
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,886
Why did you?
Why-why would you do this to me?

1340
01:20:39,911 --> 01:20:42,707
I have freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1341
01:20:42,952 --> 01:20:44,327
We are going home,

1342
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,978
to our real children.

1343
01:20:46,003 --> 01:20:48,322
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me.
Alright?

1344
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,934
Mal, look at me, please?

1345
01:20:49,959 --> 01:20:51,373
You are waiting for a train.

1346
01:20:51,628 --> 01:20:53,295
Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!

1347
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,473
A train that will take you far away.

1348
01:20:55,498 --> 01:20:57,090
James and Phillipa,

1349
01:20:57,114 --> 01:20:58,508
are waiting for you!
You know where you hope,

1350
01:20:58,532 --> 01:20:59,696
this train will take you,

1351
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,502
They are waiting for us!
But you can't know for sure.

1352
01:21:01,527 --> 01:21:02,804
Mal, look at me!

1353
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:04,062
But it doesn't matter.

1354
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:05,599
Mal, goddamn it!

1355
01:21:05,623 --> 01:21:07,110
Because you will be together.
Mal, listen to me!

1356
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,226
Sweetheart!

1357
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:09,540
Look at me!

1358
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,141
Mal, no!

1359
01:21:11,414 --> 01:21:12,847
Jesus Christ!

1360
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:19,907
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1361
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:21,909
It made it impossible for me,

1362
01:21:21,934 --> 01:21:24,262
to try to explain the nature of her madness.

1363
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:25,855
So I ran.

1364
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:29,762
Right now, or never Cobb.

1365
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:38,215
James! Phillipa!

1366
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,589
Come on in! Come on!

1367
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:42,269
Alright, let's go.

1368
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:46,399
I left my children behind and I have been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1369
01:21:47,183 --> 01:21:48,808
Your guilt, defines her.

1370
01:21:49,235 --> 01:21:50,790
It's what powers her.

1371
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:54,520
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1372
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:58,178
And if we are gonna succeed in this,

1373
01:21:58,495 --> 01:22:00,108
you have to forgive yourself.

1374
01:22:01,257 --> 01:22:02,779
And you are gonna have to confront her.

1375
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:05,231
But you don't have to do that alone.

1376
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,804
No, you are not...
I am doing it for the others.

1377
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:10,288
Because they have no idea,

1378
01:22:10,312 --> 01:22:12,535
the risk they have taken
coming down here with you.

1379
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:19,705
We have to move.

1380
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,449
Time is up.

1381
01:22:21,705 --> 01:22:22,384
Alright.

1382
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,747
I don't know any combination.

1383
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:27,322
Not consciously, anyway.
How about instinctively?

1384
01:22:28,191 --> 01:22:32,127
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1385
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:35,099
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1386
01:22:35,365 --> 01:22:37,216
I have no idea.
Right now!

1387
01:22:37,767 --> 01:22:40,145
I said, right now! Right now!

1388
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:44,072
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1389
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:49,358
You will have to do better than that.

1390
01:22:49,713 --> 01:22:51,233
Alright. Bag them.

1391
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:53,542
You are going for a ride.

1392
01:22:57,711 --> 01:22:58,988
We are worth more to you alive.

1393
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:01,425
You hear me?

1394
01:23:07,097 --> 01:23:08,205
What did you get?

1395
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,775
That boy's relationship with his father
is even worse than we imagined.

1396
01:23:11,835 --> 01:23:12,859
This helps us how?

1397
01:23:13,036 --> 01:23:15,278
The stronger the issues.
The more powerful the catharsis.

1398
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,590
How are you going to reconcile
them if they are so estranged?

1399
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:21,296
I am working on that, are not I?
Work faster.

1400
01:23:21,934 --> 01:23:23,488
The projections are closing in quick.

1401
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:27,074
We got to break out of here
before we are totally boxed in.

1402
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:03,759
Damn it.

1403
01:24:04,054 --> 01:24:06,314
You must not be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1404
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,855
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1405
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,727
Destroy his one positive relationship?

1406
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:30,885
No, we repair his relationship
with his father,

1407
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:33,324
whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1408
01:24:33,783 --> 01:24:36,189
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1409
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:39,486
What about his security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1410
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:41,379
No I think we run with Mr. Charles.

1411
01:24:41,404 --> 01:24:42,189
No.

1412
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:43,992
Who is Mr. Charles? Bad idea.

1413
01:24:43,993 --> 01:24:46,356
The second we get into
that hotel and approach Fischer

1414
01:24:46,357 --> 01:24:48,044
his security is gonna be all over us.

1415
01:24:48,057 --> 01:24:50,086
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1416
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,298
You have done it before?
Yeah and it didn't work.

1417
01:24:52,468 --> 01:24:55,787
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1418
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:57,584
Excellent but you learned a lot, right?

1419
01:24:57,895 --> 01:25:00,124
I need some kind of distraction.
No problem.

1420
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,585
How about a lovely lady
that I have used before?

1421
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:04,710
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, alright?

1422
01:25:04,735 --> 01:25:06,768
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1423
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:13,246
Don't jump too soon.

1424
01:25:13,356 --> 01:25:15,612
We only got one shot at that kick.
We got to make it.

1425
01:25:15,637 --> 01:25:17,063
I will play the music to let you know
it's coming.

1426
01:25:17,087 --> 01:25:18,269
The rest is on you.

1427
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:20,371
You ready?
Ready!

1428
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:23,191
Sweet dreams.

1429
01:25:23,533 --> 01:25:24,845
Am I boring you?

1430
01:25:26,603 --> 01:25:28,111
I was telling you my story.

1431
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:30,064
I guess it was not to your liking.

1432
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:33,952
I have a lot on my mind.

1433
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:37,446
There goes Mr. Charles.

1434
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:43,585
Mr. Fischer,

1435
01:25:44,023 --> 01:25:44,777
right?

1436
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,988
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing, I...

1437
01:25:49,957 --> 01:25:51,819
And you must be?
Leaving.

1438
01:25:55,722 --> 01:25:57,111
In case you get bored.

1439
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:03,703
Must have blown you off.

1440
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:06,658
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1441
01:26:08,598 --> 01:26:10,111
Funny way to make friends.

1442
01:26:10,135 --> 01:26:12,641
Someone stealing your wallet like that.

1443
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:19,176
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least...

1444
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:20,481
500 dollars right?

1445
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:23,442
Listen don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1446
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,606
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1447
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:29,268
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1448
01:26:29,974 --> 01:26:31,305
And why don't you approve?

1449
01:26:31,343 --> 01:26:33,334
Because it involves telling the mark
that he is dreaming,

1450
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:35,568
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1451
01:26:36,072 --> 01:26:37,807
Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

1452
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:40,655
So now you have noticed how much time Cobb

1453
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,832
spends doing things he says never to do.

1454
01:26:45,481 --> 01:26:47,003
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1455
01:26:47,565 --> 01:26:49,339
I am sorry, but...
Hold on! Wait!

1456
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:52,242
You look a bit perkier.

1457
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:54,308
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1458
01:27:01,073 --> 01:27:02,563
Turbulence on the plane?

1459
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:04,594
No, it's much closer.

1460
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:06,164
That's Yusuf's driving.

1461
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,927
I am sorry.

1462
01:27:16,122 --> 01:27:17,359
Who did you say you were?

1463
01:27:17,413 --> 01:27:18,880
Rod Green from marketing.

1464
01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:21,574
But that's not true at all, is it?

1465
01:27:23,386 --> 01:27:24,811
My name is Mr. Charles.

1466
01:27:24,835 --> 01:27:26,331
You remember me, don't you?

1467
01:27:27,056 --> 01:27:29,124
I am the head of your security down here.

1468
01:27:30,066 --> 01:27:32,000
Get out on a different floor.
Keep moving.

1469
01:27:32,395 --> 01:27:34,727
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1470
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:35,880
Ok.

1471
01:27:35,904 --> 01:27:37,814
We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1472
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:42,991
Security?

1473
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:47,788
You work for the hotel?
No, no.

1474
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:51,987
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1475
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:55,043
Subconscious security.

1476
01:27:55,178 --> 01:27:56,415
You are talking about dreams?

1477
01:27:57,487 --> 01:27:58,720
Are you talking about...

1478
01:27:59,337 --> 01:28:00,330
extraction?

1479
01:28:01,343 --> 01:28:02,942
I am here to protect you.

1480
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,072
Mr. Fischer I am here to protect you,

1481
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:20,692
in the event that someone
tries to access your mind

1482
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:22,184
through your dreams.

1483
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:24,699
You are not safe here.

1484
01:28:25,948 --> 01:28:27,258
They are coming for you.

1485
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:47,206
Strange weather, isn't it?

1486
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:53,777
You feel that?

1487
01:28:55,878 --> 01:28:56,945
What's happening?

1488
01:28:57,246 --> 01:29:00,030
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream,

1489
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,882
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1490
01:29:03,686 --> 01:29:04,452
For me.

1491
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:05,959
Quick, give me a kiss.

1492
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,006
They are still looking at us.

1493
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,875
Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1494
01:29:16,299 --> 01:29:17,515
We should probably get out of here.

1495
01:29:33,616 --> 01:29:34,567
You feel that?

1496
01:29:35,066 --> 01:29:37,352
You have actually been trained
for this, Mr. Fischer.

1497
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:41,191
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1498
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:42,949
None of this is real.

1499
01:29:43,683 --> 01:29:44,878
You are in a dream.

1500
01:29:49,498 --> 01:29:51,620
Now, the easiest way for you
to test yourself

1501
01:29:51,644 --> 01:29:54,480
is to try and remember how
you arrived at this hotel.

1502
01:29:54,504 --> 01:29:55,628
Can you do that?

1503
01:29:56,839 --> 01:29:57,917
Yeah, I...

1504
01:29:58,307 --> 01:30:00,534
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1505
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,760
Accept the fact that you are in a dream.

1506
01:30:02,784 --> 01:30:04,384
And I am here to protect you.

1507
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:05,697
Go on.

1508
01:30:12,355 --> 01:30:13,688
You are not real?
No.

1509
01:30:14,141 --> 01:30:15,015
No.

1510
01:30:15,657 --> 01:30:17,671
I am a projection of your subconscious.

1511
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:22,410
I was sent here to protect you in the event
that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.

1512
01:30:23,232 --> 01:30:26,192
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1513
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:28,324
Yeah.

1514
01:30:28,692 --> 01:30:29,387
Ok.

1515
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:31,401
Ok.

1516
01:30:34,844 --> 01:30:36,134
Can you get me out of here?

1517
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:38,572
Right away.

1518
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:40,064
Follow me.

1519
01:30:54,563 --> 01:30:55,894
Hold on a second.

1520
01:31:00,836 --> 01:31:02,254
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1521
01:31:02,838 --> 01:31:04,674
These men were sent here
to abduct you, alright?

1522
01:31:05,023 --> 01:31:06,032
If you want my help.

1523
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:07,518
You have to remain calm.

1524
01:31:09,578 --> 01:31:11,557
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1525
01:31:23,592 --> 01:31:24,739
If this is a dream.

1526
01:31:25,268 --> 01:31:27,169
I should just kill myself
to wake up, right?

1527
01:31:27,463 --> 01:31:29,466
I would not do that if I were you.
Mr. Fischer.

1528
01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:32,419
I believe they have you sedated.
And if you pull that trigger...

1529
01:31:33,302 --> 01:31:34,462
you may not wake up.

1530
01:31:35,604 --> 01:31:37,619
You may go into a further
dream state, now...

1531
01:31:38,386 --> 01:31:40,072
you know what I am talking about.

1532
01:31:42,244 --> 01:31:43,502
You remember the training.

1533
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:46,274
Remember what I said to you.

1534
01:31:47,316 --> 01:31:48,227
Give me the gun.

1535
01:32:00,218 --> 01:32:02,591
This room should be directly below 528?
Yeah.

1536
01:32:12,274 --> 01:32:13,764
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1537
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:15,142
What do you remember,

1538
01:32:15,298 --> 01:32:17,107
from before this dream?

1539
01:32:17,982 --> 01:32:18,980
There was...

1540
01:32:19,004 --> 01:32:21,190
there was a lot of gunfire.
There was...

1541
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:22,834
rain.

1542
01:32:24,086 --> 01:32:25,217
Uncle Peter.

1543
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:27,556
Oh, my God, we have been kidnapped.

1544
01:32:27,734 --> 01:32:29,061
Where were they holding you?

1545
01:32:32,628 --> 01:32:34,124
They had us in the back of a van.

1546
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,829
That explains the gravity shifts.

1547
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:38,157
You are in the back of a van right now,
keep going.

1548
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:39,971
It had something to do with...

1549
01:32:41,237 --> 01:32:43,206
Something to do with a safe.

1550
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,456
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1551
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:49,047
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you have woken up.

1552
01:32:49,072 --> 01:32:51,070
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1553
01:32:51,656 --> 01:32:54,108
You and Browning,
have been pulled into this dream

1554
01:32:54,133 --> 01:32:56,495
because they are trying to steal
something from your mind.

1555
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:59,680
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1556
01:33:00,556 --> 01:33:02,099
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1557
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:03,491
A combination.

1558
01:33:03,816 --> 01:33:06,513
They demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head.

1559
01:33:06,562 --> 01:33:09,092
They are trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1560
01:33:09,135 --> 01:33:10,573
It can represent anything.

1561
01:33:10,597 --> 01:33:12,205
We are in a hotel right now.

1562
01:33:13,657 --> 01:33:15,080
We should try hotel rooms.

1563
01:33:15,594 --> 01:33:17,096
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1564
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:19,654
Try and remember for me,
this is very important.

1565
01:33:20,042 --> 01:33:20,812
Five.

1566
01:33:22,281 --> 01:33:23,169
Five, two.

1567
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,945
It was something.
It was a long number.

1568
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,063
That's good enough we can start there.
Fifth floor.

1569
01:33:27,088 --> 01:33:27,773
Yep.

1570
01:33:28,299 --> 01:33:29,526
So do you use a timer?

1571
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:31,982
No. I have to judge it for myself.

1572
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:34,705
Or while you are all asleep in 528.

1573
01:33:34,729 --> 01:33:36,004
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1574
01:33:36,091 --> 01:33:38,218
Well, how will you know?
His music warns me.

1575
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:40,504
And then when the van hits
the barrier of the bridge,

1576
01:33:40,624 --> 01:33:42,081
that should be unmistakable.

1577
01:33:42,136 --> 01:33:43,689
So we get a nice,

1578
01:33:43,713 --> 01:33:45,444
synchronized kick.

1579
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:48,011
If it's too soon.
We won't get pulled out.

1580
01:33:48,437 --> 01:33:49,659
But if it's too late.

1581
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:51,539
I won't be able to drop us.

1582
01:33:51,623 --> 01:33:52,646
Well, why not?

1583
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:54,847
Because the van will be in free fall.

1584
01:33:56,157 --> 01:33:57,882
Can't drop you without gravity.

1585
01:33:58,162 --> 01:33:59,169
Right.

1586
01:34:04,244 --> 01:34:05,919
They are with me.
Go on.

1587
01:34:31,247 --> 01:34:32,271
Mr. Charles.

1588
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,031
Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?

1589
01:34:34,055 --> 01:34:35,417
Yeah. I think so. Yeah.

1590
01:34:35,443 --> 01:34:37,297
They were trying to put you under.

1591
01:34:37,946 --> 01:34:39,914
I am already under.
Under again.

1592
01:34:40,212 --> 01:34:42,453
What do you mean.
A dream within a dream?

1593
01:34:43,397 --> 01:34:44,083
Hey.

1594
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:45,865
I see you have changed.

1595
01:34:46,057 --> 01:34:47,202
I am sorry?

1596
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,338
Oh. I am sorry.

1597
01:34:49,362 --> 01:34:51,179
I mistook you for a friend.

1598
01:34:53,603 --> 01:34:55,309
Good-looking fellow. I am sure.

1599
01:34:56,382 --> 01:34:57,440
No, no, no.

1600
01:34:57,997 --> 01:34:59,715
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.

1601
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:01,497
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1602
01:35:01,677 --> 01:35:02,348
Why?

1603
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,145
Because how he acts will tell us,

1604
01:35:04,169 --> 01:35:06,914
if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1605
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:13,602
Uncle Peter.

1606
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,414
You said you were kidnapped together?

1607
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,184
Well, well, not exactly.

1608
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:19,169
They al-They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1609
01:35:19,194 --> 01:35:20,661
And you saw them torture him?

1610
01:35:28,203 --> 01:35:29,768
The kidnappers are working for you?

1611
01:35:31,006 --> 01:35:32,034
Robert.

1612
01:35:32,641 --> 01:35:34,385
You are trying to get that safe open?

1613
01:35:35,057 --> 01:35:36,565
To get the alternate will?

1614
01:35:36,894 --> 01:35:39,355
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.

1615
01:35:39,539 --> 01:35:41,078
I can't let you destroy it.

1616
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:43,469
I am not gonna throw away
my inheritance, what would I?

1617
01:35:43,623 --> 01:35:47,787
I could not let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1618
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:50,524
What taunt?
The will Robert.

1619
01:35:50,676 --> 01:35:51,747
That will?

1620
01:35:51,814 --> 01:35:53,513
That's his last insult.

1621
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,237
A challenge for...

1622
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,529
you to build something for yourself,

1623
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,286
by telling you, you are not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1624
01:36:07,376 --> 01:36:09,168
What, but that he was...

1625
01:36:09,192 --> 01:36:10,404
disappointed?

1626
01:36:11,296 --> 01:36:12,366
I am sorry.

1627
01:36:13,967 --> 01:36:14,673
But...

1628
01:36:15,727 --> 01:36:16,759
he is wrong.

1629
01:36:17,953 --> 01:36:20,345
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1630
01:36:20,465 --> 01:36:21,548
Mr. Fischer?

1631
01:36:22,298 --> 01:36:23,314
He is lying.

1632
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:25,430
How do you know?
Trust me, it's what I do.

1633
01:36:25,502 --> 01:36:28,156
He is hiding something.
And we need to find out what that is.

1634
01:36:29,692 --> 01:36:33,093
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1635
01:36:35,696 --> 01:36:38,685
We will enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1636
01:36:40,909 --> 01:36:41,700
Alright.

1637
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:49,612
He is out.
Wait.

1638
01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:51,844
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1639
01:36:52,245 --> 01:36:53,455
We are going into Fischer's.

1640
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:56,256
I told him it was Browning
so he would be a part of our team.

1641
01:36:56,392 --> 01:36:58,724
He is gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1642
01:36:58,753 --> 01:36:59,709
That's right.

1643
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:02,248
Security is gonna run you down hard.

1644
01:37:02,865 --> 01:37:05,325
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1645
01:37:05,768 --> 01:37:07,226
Just be back before the kick.

1646
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,606
Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1647
01:37:13,515 --> 01:37:14,351
You good?

1648
01:37:17,839 --> 01:37:19,170
Hey. You ready?

1649
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:20,509
Yes, yes. Some...

1650
01:37:21,114 --> 01:37:22,413
I am fine. I am ready.

1651
01:37:35,552 --> 01:37:36,345
Cobb?

1652
01:37:37,633 --> 01:37:38,340
Cobb?

1653
01:37:38,903 --> 01:37:40,033
What's down there?

1654
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:45,436
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.

1655
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:47,749
I mean, what's down there for you?

1656
01:40:24,512 --> 01:40:25,754
Did you see that?

1657
01:40:44,953 --> 01:40:46,784
Eames, this is your dream.

1658
01:40:46,809 --> 01:40:49,903
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, you understand?

1659
01:40:50,076 --> 01:40:51,873
Who guides Fischer in?
Not me.

1660
01:40:52,194 --> 01:40:54,184
If I know the route.
Everything could be compromised.

1661
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:57,271
I designed the place.
No, you are with me.

1662
01:40:57,461 --> 01:40:58,498
I could do it.

1663
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:01,990
Alright. You brief him on the route
into the complex.

1664
01:41:02,017 --> 01:41:02,795
Fischer,

1665
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:04,505
you will be going with him.
Alright.

1666
01:41:04,865 --> 01:41:05,939
What about you?

1667
01:41:06,475 --> 01:41:07,633
You keep this live.

1668
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:09,308
I will be listening in the whole time.

1669
01:41:09,627 --> 01:41:10,969
The windows on that upper floor,

1670
01:41:10,993 --> 01:41:13,478
are big enough for me to cover
you from that tower, you see?

1671
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:15,188
You are not coming in?

1672
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:17,154
In order to find out the truth
about your father,

1673
01:41:17,178 --> 01:41:19,586
you are gonna need to break
into Browning's mind on your own.

1674
01:41:21,344 --> 01:41:22,320
Come on Fischer!

1675
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:19,375
Sound the alarm!

1676
01:42:19,512 --> 01:42:20,664
Sound the alarm!

1677
01:42:20,813 --> 01:42:21,961
Go, go, go!

1678
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:22,935
Move!

1679
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,178
Go!

1680
01:42:41,403 --> 01:42:42,342
Sod it.

1681
01:42:53,513 --> 01:42:54,669
I hope you are ready.

1682
01:43:04,026 --> 01:43:05,698
No, it's too soon.

1683
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,494
Cobb, do you hear that?

1684
01:43:13,816 --> 01:43:15,682
<i>I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago.</i>

1685
01:43:15,707 --> 01:43:17,253
I thought it was the wind up here.

1686
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:18,639
Yeah, I hear it.

1687
01:43:18,972 --> 01:43:20,019
It's music.

1688
01:43:20,379 --> 01:43:21,386
So, what do we do?

1689
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:23,307
We move fast.

1690
01:43:28,737 --> 01:43:30,455
Yusuf is 10 seconds from the jump.

1691
01:43:32,872 --> 01:43:34,643
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1692
01:43:36,324 --> 01:43:37,617
Hey!
That's him!

1693
01:43:38,813 --> 01:43:40,589
Which gives us what?
Sixty minutes.

1694
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,327
Can they make that route in an hour?

1695
01:43:42,352 --> 01:43:44,120
They have to climb to the terrace.

1696
01:43:44,145 --> 01:43:46,527
Then they need a new route.
A more direct route.

1697
01:43:58,513 --> 01:43:59,977
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1698
01:44:00,034 --> 01:44:02,502
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze, right?

1699
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:03,915
Eames?

1700
01:44:27,642 --> 01:44:28,853
Did Eames add any features?

1701
01:44:28,878 --> 01:44:30,096
I don't think I should tell you.

1702
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:31,878
If Mal was after...
We don't have time for this.

1703
01:44:31,902 --> 01:44:32,963
Did he add anything?

1704
01:44:33,448 --> 01:44:36,024
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1705
01:44:36,157 --> 01:44:37,500
Good. Explain it to them.

1706
01:44:37,525 --> 01:44:38,843
<i>Saito?</i>
Go ahead.

1707
01:45:12,187 --> 01:45:13,237
Paradox.

1708
01:46:23,558 --> 01:46:24,611
What was that?

1709
01:46:24,936 --> 01:46:25,887
The kick.

1710
01:46:26,326 --> 01:46:27,119
<i>Cobb!</i>

1711
01:46:27,143 --> 01:46:28,250
Cobb, did we miss it?

1712
01:46:28,496 --> 01:46:29,684
Yeah, we missed it.

1713
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:31,075
Man.

1714
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,441
Could not someone...

1715
01:46:32,653 --> 01:46:33,625
have dreamt up...

1716
01:46:33,758 --> 01:46:35,220
a goddamn beach?

1717
01:46:38,206 --> 01:46:39,401
<i>What the hell do we do now?</i>

1718
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:42,373
We finish the job before the next kick.

1719
01:46:42,448 --> 01:46:43,385
What next kick?

1720
01:46:43,409 --> 01:46:44,737
When the van hits the water.

1721
01:47:07,502 --> 01:47:08,994
<i>If you would like to make a call,</i>

1722
01:47:09,018 --> 01:47:10,938
<i>please hang up and try again.</i>

1723
01:47:11,004 --> 01:47:12,835
<i>If you need help, hang up...</i>

1724
01:47:13,174 --> 01:47:15,377
How do I drop you without gravity?

1725
01:47:18,831 --> 01:47:20,255
Arthur has a couple minutes.

1726
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:21,493
And we have about 20.

1727
01:47:45,073 --> 01:47:46,110
You ok?

1728
01:47:51,212 --> 01:47:52,496
Run! Turn around!

1729
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,720
Move to base!

1730
01:47:58,953 --> 01:47:59,953
There is something wrong.

1731
01:47:59,978 --> 01:48:01,649
They are heading your way.
Like they know something.

1732
01:48:03,858 --> 01:48:05,796
Just buy us more time, alright?

1733
01:48:06,089 --> 01:48:06,842
Come on!

1734
01:48:07,318 --> 01:48:08,186
On my way.

1735
01:48:08,408 --> 01:48:09,537
Come on! Move!

1736
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:35,079
Alright.

1737
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,456
Ok. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1738
01:49:50,894 --> 01:49:52,407
Does the strong room have windows?

1739
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:54,346
It would not be very strong if it did.

1740
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:56,377
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1741
01:49:58,373 --> 01:50:01,033
Are those projections his subconscious?
Yes.

1742
01:50:02,063 --> 01:50:03,668
Are you destroying parts of his mind?

1743
01:50:03,692 --> 01:50:05,133
No. They are just projections.

1744
01:50:31,477 --> 01:50:32,477
We are here.

1745
01:50:32,478 --> 01:50:35,272
You are clear, but hurry there is
an entire army headed your way.

1746
01:51:01,993 --> 01:51:02,884
I am in.

1747
01:51:08,776 --> 01:51:09,626
There he is.

1748
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,653
There is someone in there.

1749
01:51:53,677 --> 01:51:55,232
Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1750
01:51:56,424 --> 01:51:58,686
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1751
01:52:04,622 --> 01:52:05,423
Cobb.

1752
01:52:06,534 --> 01:52:07,250
No she...

1753
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,986
She is not real.

1754
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:10,744
How do you know that?

1755
01:52:10,798 --> 01:52:12,243
She is just a projection.

1756
01:52:12,615 --> 01:52:14,498
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1757
01:52:18,525 --> 01:52:19,381
Hello.

1758
01:52:25,419 --> 01:52:27,876
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1759
01:53:11,884 --> 01:53:12,899
What happened?

1760
01:53:13,055 --> 01:53:14,338
Mal killed Fischer.

1761
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:18,229
I could not shoot her.

1762
01:53:19,874 --> 01:53:21,616
There is no use in reviving him.

1763
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,241
His mind is already trapped down there.

1764
01:53:23,411 --> 01:53:24,469
It's all over.

1765
01:53:26,214 --> 01:53:27,601
So that's it then, we failed?

1766
01:53:28,365 --> 01:53:29,165
We are done.

1767
01:53:29,665 --> 01:53:30,640
I am sorry.

1768
01:53:34,459 --> 01:53:36,716
Well, it's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1769
01:53:37,937 --> 01:53:39,926
It's a shame, I really wanted to know
what was going to happen in there.

1770
01:53:40,015 --> 01:53:41,241
I swear we had this one.

1771
01:53:41,929 --> 01:53:43,233
Let's set the charges.

1772
01:53:45,803 --> 01:53:47,147
Wait, there is still another way!

1773
01:53:48,369 --> 01:53:50,203
We just have to follow Fischer down there.

1774
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,516
Not enough time.

1775
01:53:51,885 --> 01:53:54,180
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1776
01:53:55,786 --> 01:53:57,008
And we will find him.

1777
01:53:57,218 --> 01:53:59,529
Ok, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in.

1778
01:53:59,779 --> 01:54:01,449
Just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1779
01:54:01,474 --> 01:54:04,375
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1780
01:54:05,423 --> 01:54:06,849
Look, you get him in there.

1781
01:54:07,135 --> 01:54:08,569
As soon as the music ends.

1782
01:54:08,593 --> 01:54:10,096
You blow up the hospital...

1783
01:54:10,121 --> 01:54:12,244
and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1784
01:54:14,231 --> 01:54:15,519
Hope it's worth a shot,

1785
01:54:16,519 --> 01:54:18,643
if Saito can hold the guards
off while I set the charges.

1786
01:54:19,207 --> 01:54:21,104
Saito will never make it, will he?

1787
01:54:22,471 --> 01:54:24,369
Cobb, come on.
We have got to try this.

1788
01:54:24,997 --> 01:54:25,997
Go for it.

1789
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,856
If you are not back before the kick.
I am gone with or without you.

1790
01:54:28,881 --> 01:54:29,767
She is right.

1791
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:31,215
She is right.
Come on. Let's go.

1792
01:54:36,613 --> 01:54:38,488
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1793
01:54:38,513 --> 01:54:39,824
I mean, Mal is gonna be down there.

1794
01:54:40,343 --> 01:54:42,622
I know where to find her.
She will have Fischer.

1795
01:54:42,647 --> 01:54:44,032
How do you know?
Because...

1796
01:54:44,527 --> 01:54:46,261
she wants me to come after him.

1797
01:54:46,977 --> 01:54:48,668
She wants me back down there with her.

1798
01:55:16,023 --> 01:55:16,843
Alright?

1799
01:55:24,298 --> 01:55:25,367
This is your world?

1800
01:55:25,656 --> 01:55:26,594
It was.

1801
01:55:27,535 --> 01:55:28,969
And this is where she will be.

1802
01:55:30,395 --> 01:55:31,226
Come on.

1803
01:56:18,157 --> 01:56:18,996
Saito.

1804
01:56:19,431 --> 01:56:20,355
Saito.

1805
01:56:21,389 --> 01:56:22,213
I need you...

1806
01:56:22,464 --> 01:56:25,183
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, ok?

1807
01:56:25,338 --> 01:56:27,931
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1808
01:56:31,216 --> 01:56:32,135
Don't be silly.

1809
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:07,447
You built all this?
This is incredible.

1810
01:57:07,802 --> 01:57:09,158
We built for years.

1811
01:57:10,872 --> 01:57:12,471
Then we started in on the memories.

1812
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,671
This way.

1813
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,232
This was our neighborhood.

1814
01:58:05,259 --> 01:58:06,732
Places from our past.

1815
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:08,850
That was our first apartment.

1816
01:58:09,697 --> 01:58:11,427
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1817
01:58:11,958 --> 01:58:14,370
After Mal became pregnant.
That became our home.

1818
01:58:14,684 --> 01:58:17,066
You reconstructed all of this from memory?

1819
01:58:17,772 --> 01:58:19,581
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1820
01:58:20,035 --> 01:58:21,097
What is that?

1821
01:58:23,133 --> 01:58:24,541
That's the house Mal grew up.

1822
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:26,212
Well, will she be in there?

1823
01:58:26,603 --> 01:58:27,400
No.

1824
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:28,728
Come on.

1825
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,298
We both wanted to live in a house.
But we loved this type of building.

1826
01:58:32,619 --> 01:58:34,893
In the real world.
We would have to choose but not here.

1827
01:59:16,263 --> 01:59:17,665
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1828
01:59:18,699 --> 01:59:20,805
We are gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1829
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:21,915
What?

1830
01:59:23,704 --> 01:59:24,829
I am gonna improvise.

1831
01:59:24,916 --> 01:59:26,969
Listen, there is something
you should know about me.

1832
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:28,868
About inception.

1833
01:59:42,523 --> 01:59:44,361
An idea is like a virus.

1834
01:59:44,906 --> 01:59:45,923
Resilient.

1835
01:59:47,139 --> 01:59:48,580
Highly contagious.

1836
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:51,900
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1837
01:59:53,567 --> 01:59:54,884
It can grow to define...

1838
01:59:56,475 --> 01:59:57,541
or destroy you.

1839
02:00:00,952 --> 02:00:03,552
A smallest idea such as,

1840
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:06,506
Your world is not real.

1841
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:08,564
Simple little thought,

1842
02:00:08,588 --> 02:00:10,207
that changes everything.

1843
02:00:12,114 --> 02:00:13,778
So certain of your world...

1844
02:00:14,817 --> 02:00:16,074
of what's real.

1845
02:00:16,597 --> 02:00:17,863
Do you think he is?

1846
02:00:20,381 --> 02:00:22,620
Or do you think he is as lost as I was?

1847
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,823
I know what's real, Mal.

1848
02:00:27,825 --> 02:00:30,091
No creeping doubts?

1849
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:33,162
Not feeling persecuted Dom?

1850
02:00:33,991 --> 02:00:38,154
Chased around the globe by anonymous
corporations and police forces,

1851
02:00:38,282 --> 02:00:40,678
the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1852
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:43,568
Admit it.

1853
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:47,597
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1854
02:00:48,278 --> 02:00:49,612
So choose.

1855
02:00:50,191 --> 02:00:51,808
Choose to be here.

1856
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:53,901
Choose me.

1857
02:01:20,321 --> 02:01:21,583
You know what I have to do.

1858
02:01:21,646 --> 02:01:24,308
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1859
02:01:25,532 --> 02:01:26,956
Because you left us.

1860
02:01:27,067 --> 02:01:28,067
You are wrong.

1861
02:01:28,292 --> 02:01:29,292
I am not wrong.

1862
02:01:29,317 --> 02:01:30,797
You are confused.

1863
02:01:32,347 --> 02:01:33,867
Our children are here.

1864
02:01:34,894 --> 02:01:37,759
And you would like to see their faces again.
Would not you?

1865
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:41,443
Yes, but I am gonna see them up above Mal.

1866
02:01:55,446 --> 02:01:56,627
Up above?

1867
02:01:58,302 --> 02:01:59,717
Listen to yourself.

1868
02:02:00,084 --> 02:02:01,897
These are our children.

1869
02:02:02,434 --> 02:02:03,326
Watch.

1870
02:02:04,294 --> 02:02:05,989
James? Phillipa?

1871
02:02:06,367 --> 02:02:07,808
Don't do this Mal. Please.

1872
02:02:08,118 --> 02:02:10,478
Those are not my children.
You keep telling yourself that.

1873
02:02:10,502 --> 02:02:12,146
But you don't believe it.
No. I know it.

1874
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,405
What if you are wrong?

1875
02:02:13,705 --> 02:02:15,447
What if I am what's real?

1876
02:02:17,254 --> 02:02:19,244
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1877
02:02:20,831 --> 02:02:22,822
But what do you believe?

1878
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:25,387
What do you feel?

1879
02:02:27,513 --> 02:02:28,307
Guilt.

1880
02:02:30,197 --> 02:02:31,759
I feel guilt, Mal.

1881
02:02:32,975 --> 02:02:34,668
And no matter what I do. No...

1882
02:02:35,508 --> 02:02:37,311
No matter how hopeless I am.

1883
02:02:37,336 --> 02:02:39,507
No matter how confused.
That guilt...

1884
02:02:40,023 --> 02:02:41,602
is always there,

1885
02:02:41,633 --> 02:02:43,648
reminding me of the truth.

1886
02:02:44,389 --> 02:02:45,686
What truth?

1887
02:02:48,422 --> 02:02:49,531
The idea,

1888
02:02:50,208 --> 02:02:53,125
that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1889
02:02:57,117 --> 02:02:59,458
You planted the idea in my mind?

1890
02:03:01,622 --> 02:03:03,112
What is she talking about?

1891
02:03:04,017 --> 02:03:06,242
The reason I knew inception was possible,

1892
02:03:06,266 --> 02:03:07,159
was because I...

1893
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:09,148
did it to her first.

1894
02:03:10,441 --> 02:03:11,851
I did it to my own wife.

1895
02:03:12,226 --> 02:03:13,125
Why?

1896
02:03:13,926 --> 02:03:15,508
We were lost in here.

1897
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:18,431
I knew we needed to escape but...

1898
02:03:18,853 --> 02:03:20,635
she would not accept it.

1899
02:03:23,999 --> 02:03:26,387
She had locked something away,
something...

1900
02:03:27,543 --> 02:03:29,295
something deep inside.

1901
02:03:30,837 --> 02:03:32,768
A truth that she had once known but...

1902
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:34,322
chose to forget.

1903
02:03:35,755 --> 02:03:37,500
And she could not break free.

1904
02:03:40,507 --> 02:03:42,781
So I decided to search for it.

1905
02:03:44,131 --> 02:03:46,657
I went deep into the recess of her mind,

1906
02:03:46,681 --> 02:03:48,552
and found that secret place.

1907
02:03:49,169 --> 02:03:50,545
And I broke in...

1908
02:03:51,568 --> 02:03:53,429
and I planted an idea.

1909
02:03:54,322 --> 02:03:57,650
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1910
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:05,343
That her world was not real.

1911
02:04:18,732 --> 02:04:20,988
That death was the only escape.

1912
02:04:29,138 --> 02:04:30,580
You are waiting for a train.

1913
02:04:33,414 --> 02:04:35,244
A train that will take you far away.

1914
02:04:37,318 --> 02:04:39,539
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1915
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:42,898
but you can't know for sure.

1916
02:04:44,539 --> 02:04:45,796
Yet it doesn't matter.

1917
02:04:47,594 --> 02:04:48,594
Now, tell me why!

1918
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,387
Because you will be together!

1919
02:04:55,062 --> 02:04:56,341
But I never knew that,

1920
02:04:56,911 --> 02:05:00,880
that idea would grow in her mind like
a cancer that even after she woke.

1921
02:05:04,496 --> 02:05:06,964
That even after
you came back to reality...

1922
02:05:09,909 --> 02:05:12,595
that you would continue to believe
your world was not real.

1923
02:05:15,578 --> 02:05:17,619
That death was the only escape.

1924
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:20,965
Mal, no! Jesus!

1925
02:05:21,195 --> 02:05:23,337
You infected my mind.

1926
02:05:23,361 --> 02:05:24,892
I was trying to save you.

1927
02:05:24,917 --> 02:05:26,316
You betrayed me.

1928
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:28,759
But you can make amends.

1929
02:05:28,876 --> 02:05:30,832
You can still keep your promise.

1930
02:05:30,944 --> 02:05:32,513
We can still be together,

1931
02:05:32,802 --> 02:05:33,949
right here...

1932
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:36,191
in the world we built together.

1933
02:06:57,549 --> 02:06:58,182
Cobb.

1934
02:06:58,206 --> 02:06:59,470
We need to get Fischer.

1935
02:07:00,759 --> 02:07:02,056
You can't have him.

1936
02:07:03,197 --> 02:07:04,915
If I stay here, will you let him go?

1937
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:06,634
What are you talking about?

1938
02:07:10,877 --> 02:07:12,388
Fischer is on the porch.

1939
02:07:13,507 --> 02:07:14,823
Go check he is alive Ariadne.

1940
02:07:14,848 --> 02:07:16,004
Cobb, you can't do this.

1941
02:07:16,029 --> 02:07:18,301
Go check he is alive right now.
Do it.

1942
02:07:34,561 --> 02:07:37,196
He is here! And it's time.
But you have to come now!

1943
02:07:37,831 --> 02:07:39,306
You take Fischer with you, alright?

1944
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:41,352
You can't stay here to be with her.

1945
02:07:43,914 --> 02:07:44,770
I am not.

1946
02:07:45,195 --> 02:07:46,610
Saito is dead by now.

1947
02:07:46,635 --> 02:07:48,315
That means he is down here somewhere.

1948
02:07:48,495 --> 02:07:50,085
That means I have to find him.

1949
02:07:52,274 --> 02:07:53,862
I can't stay with her anymore.

1950
02:07:53,886 --> 02:07:55,368
Because she doesn't exist.

1951
02:07:55,473 --> 02:07:58,468
I am the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1952
02:07:59,286 --> 02:08:00,047
No.

1953
02:08:01,507 --> 02:08:02,514
I wish.

1954
02:08:04,551 --> 02:08:06,592
I wish more than anything but...

1955
02:08:08,428 --> 02:08:11,102
I can't imagine you with
all your complexity,

1956
02:08:11,227 --> 02:08:13,711
all your perfection, all your imperfection.

1957
02:08:14,968 --> 02:08:16,125
You alright?
Yeah.

1958
02:08:16,207 --> 02:08:17,305
Look at you.

1959
02:08:19,239 --> 02:08:20,514
You are just a shade.

1960
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,527
You are just a shade of my real wife.

1961
02:08:24,611 --> 02:08:26,413
And you were the best that I could do but...

1962
02:08:27,878 --> 02:08:30,165
I am sorry, you are just not good enough.

1963
02:08:30,496 --> 02:08:32,238
Does this feel real?

1964
02:08:34,509 --> 02:08:35,629
What are you doing?

1965
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:37,339
Improvising.

1966
02:08:45,660 --> 02:08:46,900
No, no, no!

1967
02:08:48,485 --> 02:08:50,285
In there, now. Go, go, go, go.

1968
02:09:35,683 --> 02:09:36,700
I was...

1969
02:09:36,902 --> 02:09:37,644
dis...

1970
02:09:39,382 --> 02:09:40,177
I was dis...

1971
02:09:40,942 --> 02:09:41,909
disap...

1972
02:09:42,366 --> 02:09:43,180
I know Dad.

1973
02:09:43,492 --> 02:09:44,605
Dis...

1974
02:09:51,018 --> 02:09:52,621
I know you were disappointed...

1975
02:09:53,921 --> 02:09:55,286
I could not be you.

1976
02:09:55,743 --> 02:09:56,527
No.

1977
02:09:57,621 --> 02:09:58,582
No, no, no, no.

1978
02:09:59,913 --> 02:10:01,454
I was disappointed...

1979
02:10:03,594 --> 02:10:04,892
that you tried.

1980
02:10:29,006 --> 02:10:29,887
What?

1981
02:10:39,953 --> 02:10:40,940
Come on, come on.

1982
02:11:11,349 --> 02:11:12,208
Dad?

1983
02:11:51,298 --> 02:11:52,684
That's the kick Ariadne!

1984
02:11:52,878 --> 02:11:54,292
You have to go now!

1985
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:08,408
Don't lose yourself!

1986
02:12:08,865 --> 02:12:10,763
Find Saito and bring him back!

1987
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:11,966
I will!

1988
02:12:52,023 --> 02:12:54,667
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1989
02:12:55,649 --> 02:12:56,741
Yes.

1990
02:12:56,862 --> 02:12:59,922
You said you dreamt
that we would grow old together.

1991
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:03,633
But we did.

1992
02:13:06,016 --> 02:13:07,665
We did. You don't remember?

1993
02:13:13,166 --> 02:13:14,993
I miss you more than I can bear...

1994
02:13:18,112 --> 02:13:19,821
but we had our time together.

1995
02:13:21,708 --> 02:13:22,958
And I have to let you go.

1996
02:13:25,879 --> 02:13:27,286
I have to let you go.

1997
02:14:18,932 --> 02:14:20,076
I am sorry Robert.

1998
02:14:47,894 --> 02:14:50,720
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1999
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:53,962
not just to live for him.

2000
02:14:56,222 --> 02:14:57,842
That's what I am gonna do Uncle Peter.

2001
02:15:08,324 --> 02:15:09,222
What happened?

2002
02:15:10,118 --> 02:15:11,007
Cobb stayed.

2003
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:11,891
With Mal?

2004
02:15:11,972 --> 02:15:13,234
No, to find Saito.

2005
02:15:15,689 --> 02:15:16,813
He will be lost.

2006
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:21,173
No, he will be alright.

2007
02:15:37,554 --> 02:15:39,522
Have you come to kill me?

2008
02:15:43,802 --> 02:15:45,746
I am waiting for someone.

2009
02:15:50,867 --> 02:15:53,228
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

2010
02:15:56,232 --> 02:15:57,416
Cobb?

2011
02:15:59,866 --> 02:16:00,944
Impossible.

2012
02:16:01,839 --> 02:16:03,874
We were young men together.

2013
02:16:06,123 --> 02:16:07,843
I am an old man.

2014
02:16:09,943 --> 02:16:11,277
Filled with regret.

2015
02:16:14,882 --> 02:16:16,848
Waiting to die alone.

2016
02:16:21,021 --> 02:16:22,354
I have come back for you.

2017
02:16:26,459 --> 02:16:27,626
To remind you...

2018
02:16:28,565 --> 02:16:29,627
of something.

2019
02:16:33,498 --> 02:16:35,148
Something you once knew.

2020
02:16:38,736 --> 02:16:40,366
That this world is not real.

2021
02:16:45,862 --> 02:16:49,614
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

2022
02:16:51,317 --> 02:16:53,518
To take a leap of faith, yes.

2023
02:17:00,091 --> 02:17:00,838
Come back...

2024
02:17:03,946 --> 02:17:06,429
so we can be young men together again.

2025
02:17:10,984 --> 02:17:12,152
Come back with me.

2026
02:17:16,159 --> 02:17:17,248
Come back.

2027
02:17:27,227 --> 02:17:28,547
Hot towel sir?

2028
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:32,507
We will be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

2029
02:17:32,669 --> 02:17:34,289
Do you need immigration forms?

2030
02:17:37,097 --> 02:17:38,036
Thank you.

2031
02:17:38,898 --> 02:17:40,091
Hot towel sir?

2032
02:17:41,409 --> 02:17:42,075
No.

2033
02:17:42,176 --> 02:17:43,699
Do you need immigration forms?

2034
02:18:56,042 --> 02:18:57,404
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

2035
02:18:58,244 --> 02:18:59,201
Thank you, sir.

2036
02:19:43,923 --> 02:19:44,689
Welcome.

2037
02:19:45,641 --> 02:19:46,579
This way.

2038
02:20:08,347 --> 02:20:09,388
James?

2039
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,941
Phillipa?

2040
02:20:15,305 --> 02:20:16,355
Look who is here.

2041
02:20:22,428 --> 02:20:23,266
Hey.

2042
02:20:24,597 --> 02:20:25,488
Hey, guys!

2043
02:20:25,512 --> 02:20:27,293
Hey! How are you?
Daddy! Daddy!

2044
02:20:27,467 --> 02:20:29,050
Daddy!
How are you?

2045
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:32,429
Look what I have been building!

2046
02:20:32,605 --> 02:20:33,705
What are you building?

2047
02:20:33,729 --> 02:20:36,302
We are building a house on the cliff!

2048
02:20:36,476 --> 02:20:38,084
On the cliff? Come on.

2049
02:20:38,108 --> 02:20:39,550
I want you to show me.
Can you show me?

2050
02:20:39,636 --> 02:20:42,196
Let's go. Come on.
Daddy!
