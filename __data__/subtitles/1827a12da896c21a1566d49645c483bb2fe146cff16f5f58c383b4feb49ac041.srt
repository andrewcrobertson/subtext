00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,083
- It is.
- It's a good question.

506
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:24,000
Um, it feels very, very sweet.

507

[laughter]

508
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,333
I don't know.
I think I just feel really grateful.

509
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,250
I'm glad to be here.
I'm grateful to be here.

510
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,666
Maybe confusing.

511
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,500
You know?

512
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,934
Um, I had Izzy when I was so young,

513
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,625
so I feel like I, like, disconnected
from my age, uh, in my 20s.

514
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,059
- I mean, I was just out of college, you know?
- [Tracy] Sure.

515
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,500
- Do you get it?
- [Nancy] I think

516
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,208
you're not even a person until you hit 30.

517
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,375
I mean, just think about it, right?

518
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,291
And then you spend
the next ten years after that

519
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,041
trying to figure out
the type of person you want to be.

520
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,791
- That is profound.
- That is drunk.

- Yeah, let's put that spin on it.
- Hear, hear.

525
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,833
Hey, hey!

526
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,583
- Birthday girl. Hi.
- [laughs]

527
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,583
- Whew, you startled me there.
- Yeah, I know.

528
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,291
[laughs] Hi, Todd.

529
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,916
Hi. Um...

530
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Listen, I just wanted to come over and say
that I-I really admire you.

531
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,041
- Oh.
- Uh, you've built a community

532
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,416
around art and inclusiveness.

533
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,291
It's just... that's so cool.

534
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,583
That's very sweet. Thank you.

Oh, sophomores.

538
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,916
- My daughter's gonna be a senior.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

539
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,583
And divorce, I mean,
it's such an identify shift, right?

[both chuckle]

541
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,291
- Yeah.
- I totally get it.

542
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,333
I mean, who am I
if I'm not Jessica's husband?

How long ago did you guys split up?

554
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,166
"Split" is such a specific word.
[chuckles]

555
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,375
I'm just gonna say it.

556
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,250
Uh, I would like you
to accompany me next week

It's her.

- This is a surprise.
- [chuckles]

588
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,916
I did some online sleuthing
for a Solène of Silver Lake,

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,583
and, uh, well, I have
this very large, empty flat in London

590
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:00,041
that, uh, desperately needs some artwork.

591
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,458

Um... [clears throat]

597
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:18,458

potter we work with called Susan Hable.

N-No. She...

That's what they call it when they do
the work on the, on the wheel.

601
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,666
It's called throwing.

- Right.

Being in my 30s, obviously.

Hmm.

637
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,375
These are shot on

No digital manipulation.

639
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,625
So cool. I'll take them all.

640
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,250
- What?
- If you could Bubble Wrap them or whatever,

641
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,291
and then I'll send someone over later
just to pick them up.

642
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,583
These bowls, by the way, these are lovely.

- And the spaghetti tiles?

00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,041
I mean, the detail i-is beautiful.

645
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,333
And whatever this is,
I want it in my home.

Honestly, uh...

647
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,458
I think I'll take all of it.

This is real art,
and these are real artists.

They take their work very seriously,
as do I.

650
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:37,500
They made it with a great deal of care,
and you're coming in here like...

651

I don't know...
like you're buying apples or something.

for art like this for so long,

and so...

So?

662
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,642
Are you gonna show me something else?

663
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,666
Don't you have a football stadium
to get to or a photo shoot to attend?

664

Well, um, what's-what's the day today?

665

- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah, no, don't have any of those until Wednesday.

666
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:24,125
I actually would love to show you
some more art,

667
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,083
but you just bought
everything in the gallery.

668
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,916
Oh.

669
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,375

Yeah.

673
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,375
Well, if you have nothing left to show me,

674
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,142
then I'm gonna have to go find
another art gallery

675
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,934
- owned by a different art dealer...
- Okay. Okay.

676
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,208

for the longest time.

680
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,642
- You have no idea.
- Middle of nowhere Glendale?

681
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,125
The middle of nowhere is
my favorite place in the world.

682
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,934
Why don't you have your driver meet us
out back, and we'll go to Glendale.

683
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,458
I mean, we could just go in your car.

684
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,041
- Sorry about the clutter.
- Oh. Uh, yeah.

685
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,291
I'll get that out of your way. Okay, um...

686
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,250
- Okay, I'm in.
- Whoops.

687
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,916
- I can take that.
- Oh, thank you.

688
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
Yeah, sure. Where do you want me to...

689
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,208
- Just on the floor or...
- Floor?

690
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,875
- Oh, yeah, the back. Sure, okay.
- [stammers] Okay.

Okay.

692

- Yeah.

- I'm coming up to the, uh, light.

look them in the eye.

[Solène] Okay, great.
Just staring straight ahead.

00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:42,541
They are really not noticing anything.

701
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,125
I think we're good.

702
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,333

[Hayes] Is this a painting?

711

[Solène] Yes, it is.

712
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,916
- What does it mean?
- It's a calendar.

713
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,500
- No, don't do that.
- Don't what?

714
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,903
Do you really want the lecture
about how art is subjective?

What do you see?

716
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,166
It's a grid. It's grid-like.

717
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,708
It's-it's-it's numerical.

718
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,166
Which means that...

719
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,375
Please. I-I've got nothing.

[both laugh]

721
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:49,458
So the artist calls this piece
a self-portrait.

722
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,000
Now, what's she's showing is that

723
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:56,791
she's not some, uh, untouchable genius
in a rarefied space.

724
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,666
This is her life as an artist.

725
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,541
I find its honesty incredibly moving.

726
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,708
This piece is from my friend Sarah.

727
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,934
Um, she's sending all of these
to a gallery show in New York,

728
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,208

Campbell Hall two years ago.

Okay, she's brilliant.

1370
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,708

and Simon are doing.

1372

Simon, how many models
are with you right now? [chuckles]

1373
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,226
We're gonna have to do
something a little naughty

1374
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,601
to prove that we're having more fun.

1375
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,041
- Orgies are still a thing, right?
- [Charlotte laughs]

1376
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,726
- Ollie, can you not, please?
- I know, I know.

1377
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,916
Now that you're with Solène,
you're like a middle-aged man.

1378
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,916
You know, before you showed up,
he behaved like an actual pop star.

1379
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,916
Do you just say every fucking thing
that pops in your head?

1380
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,750

- [Priya] Popsicles.

1381
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,666
Come on, guys.

1382
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:40,541
Solène, how did you guys meet?
We need to know the story.

1383
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:43,250
Uh, we met at Coachella.

1384
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:45,653
- Actually, it was at an August Moon meet and greet.
- Yeah.

1385
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, my God. You're a Moonhead.

1386
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,791
- [Hayes] No, no.
- That's so cute.

1387
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,625
It's actually kind of a crazy story.

1388
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,083
- Uh, she wasn't supposed to be there.
- [chuckles]

1389
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,291
And then she was,
and she was with her daughter.

1390
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,583
Yeah, yeah.
No, we-we, uh, we met by accident.

1391
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,750
[Hayes] By accident, yeah.

1392
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:01,916
In my trailer.

1393
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,416
And then Hayes, you know, really upped
the ante when he dedicated a song to me.

1394
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,041
"Closer"?

1395
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,583
- Yes.
- Of course that was the one.

1396
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:12,958
- [chuckles]
- [Oliver] We do that when one of us finds a girl,

1397
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,375
- or in Hayes's case, a woman, cute.

at the last minute.

for that Swedish actress

who was, like, in love with him?

1403

- Mm-hmm.

1404

- Hanna. Wasn't it Hanna, Hayes?
- Oh, my God.

1405

Poor Hanna. She was obsessed.

1406

can you imagine if he did it?

1407

1409

We couldn't ditch her 'cause she was,
like, famous in Sweden or something.

1410

[Amber] She was like 33 and clueless.

1411
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,583
It was, like, so awkward.

1412
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,916

- Just let me...

1413

Sorry. Just got to grab it.

- It's fine.

He's a guy in his 20s.

What's that supposed to mean?

1423
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:17,934
It means I think it's time I went home.

1424

that I've slept with other women?

1433
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,125
Other older women? No.

1434

and it's been fun, it really has,

- Does it have to end?

1439

W-We have a few more weeks of the tour,
then I'm gonna be in L.A.

1440

It would just be me,
and we could hang out like normal people.

1441
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,333
Um, yeah, it's not gonna work for me.

1442

This was fun, but now it's, uh, not.

1443

Wh-What are you so afraid of, Solène?

1444
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:09,083
The father of my child
lied to me for a year,

1445
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:10,833
and all of his friends knew.

1446

have to be dramatic, okay?

1455

would I want this to end?
