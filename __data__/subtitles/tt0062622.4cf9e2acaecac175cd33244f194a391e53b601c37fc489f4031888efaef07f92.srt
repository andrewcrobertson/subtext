1
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,745
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:42,712
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,753
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,322
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

5
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,323
We haven't seen you up here
for a long time.

6
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:50,792
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,351
- Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
- Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,296
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:57,729
May I call him for you?

10
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,198
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,063
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:03,125
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:05,295
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,804
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:09,338
- Well, shall we go through?
- Okay.

16
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:10,873
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,669
- Thank you, Miss Turner.
- Thank you.

18
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:13,800
This way.

19
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,510
<i>Welcome to Voice Print Identification.</i>

20
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,678
<i>When you see the red light go on...</i>

21
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,217
<i>...would you please state
in the following order:</i>

22
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:30,118
<i>Your destination, your nationality
and your full name.</i>

23
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:33,419
<i>Surname first, Christian name and initial.</i>

24
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,958
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

25
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voice Print Identification.</i>

26
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,324
Thank you.

27
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:55,968
Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:57,664
I think we can manage that.

29
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:58,967
How long have I got?

30
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,667
Your flight leaves
in an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:04,710
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:05,411 --> 00:27:08,743
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:10,973
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,345
I suppose you saw the work on
the new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,248
- Yes, coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:17,574
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:20,883
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,099
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?</i>

39
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,269
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?</i>

40
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,171
<i>Yes?</i>

41
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:55,407
<i>- How are you, squirt?
- All right.</i>

42
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:57,035
What are you doin'?

43
00:27:58,513 --> 00:27:59,480
<i>Playing.</i>

44
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:00,941
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:02,880
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

46
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,447
<i>- Well, who's taking care of ya?
- Rachel.</i>

47
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,409
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,248
<i>She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

49
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,920
<i>Are you coming to my party tomorrow?</i>

50
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:14,650
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,348
<i>Why not?</i>

52
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:19,125
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,758
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

54
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:26,026
I'm gonna send you
a very nice present, though.

55
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:28,790
<i>All right.</i>

56
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:31,299
<i>- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.</i>

57
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:32,392
What?

58
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:33,828
<i>A telephone.</i>

59
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:37,068
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:39,470
Can't you think of anything else
you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,167
Something very special?

62
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:43,232
<i>- Yes.
- What?</i>

63
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:44,669
<i>A bush baby.</i>

64
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:47,472
A bush baby?
Well, we'll have to see about that.

65
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:49,410
I want you to tell Mommy
something for me.

66
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,380
<i>- Will you remember?
- Yes.</i>

67
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,949
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:55,980
<i>Yes.</i>

69
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:58,712
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,916
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:02,920
<i>Yes.</i>

72
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:05,957
Okay, sweetheart.
Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:07,082
<i>All right.</i>

74
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,191
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:12,320
<i>All right.</i>

76
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:15,262
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

77
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,695
<i>All right. Bye-bye!</i>

78
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:19,324
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:34,866
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:37,275
What a wonderful surprise
to meet you here!

81
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:40,575
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,740
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:45,283
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

84
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,477
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

85
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,416
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,114
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:53,655
Won't you sit down?

88
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,921
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

89
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,925
Well, thank you.

90
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:01,093
- Would you like a drink, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

91
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,755
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,457
I'll just sit with you a few minutes
and then I must be off.

93
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:10,557
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,394
- And how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

95
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:17,102
He's been doing some underwater research
in the Baltic so...

96
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:21,367
...l'm afraid we don't get a chance
to see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,371
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:24,808
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:28,037
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

100
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,737
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:34,112
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:37,816
- And what about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,285
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:45,346
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but...

105
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:47,790
...perhaps you can clear up
the great big mystery...

106
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:50,053
...about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,554
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

108
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,563
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

109
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:58,758
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,961
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

111
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:06,001
For one thing, whenever you phone
the base all you get is a recording which...

112
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:10,301
...repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:15,776
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,903
That's what we thought
was the explanation at first...

115
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:20,913
...but it has been going on now
for the past ten days.

116
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:23,947
You have not been able to contact anyone
for the past ten days?

117
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,279
That's right.

118
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,609
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,476
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,044
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses
was denied permission...

121
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,589
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:34,982
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:38,423
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:38,493 --> 00:31:42,451
Denying the men permission to land is
a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,553
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,063
- Did the crew get back all right?
- Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,759
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,661
At the risk of pressing you
on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

129
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:59,532
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

130
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,071
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,935
Quite frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

132
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:11,676
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,945
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:18,582
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

135
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,957
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

136
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:30,188
...l'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

137
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:32,955
I understand.

138
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:37,588
But this epidemic could quite easily
spread to our base.

139
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,997
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,035
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,463
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:53,742
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

143
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,277
No, I'm positive.
Now, I really must be going.

144
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:59,575
I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,080
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:04,412
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:08,475
Well, that will all depend on
school vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,781
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,219
Don't forget you have a standing invitation
if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,655
No, of course not. Gregor and I will
look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,716
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:21,126
It has been a pleasure meeting you all,
Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:25,187
Whatever the reasons for your visit
to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:26,390
Thank you.

155
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:27,656
Ladies.

156
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:24,707
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:26,775
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:28,285
You're welcome.

159
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:42,319
Well...

160
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:47,298
I know you will all want to join with me
in welcoming our...

161
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,994
...distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:54,001
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:59,469
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius
to be with us today.

164
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:04,465
And before the briefing I know
he'd like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:05,670
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,749
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:22,152
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,247
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:30,383
First of all, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell who...

170
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:33,822
...has asked me to convey
his deepest appreciation to all of you...

171
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:36,764
...for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

172
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,397
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

173
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,800
...which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:49,532
Now...

175
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:54,108
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

176
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:57,809
...regarding the need
for complete security in this matter.

177
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:01,576
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

178
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,541
...created to give the impression
that there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,383
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

180
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:15,251
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

181
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,725
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:23,924
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

183
00:43:25,631 --> 00:43:28,690
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:33,866
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,103
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:42,700
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential...

187
00:43:42,777 --> 00:43:45,506
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

188
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:47,636
...contained in this present situation...

189
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,673
...if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public...

190
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:53,238
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

191
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:57,950
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

192
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:03,155
The purpose of my visit here is
to gather additional facts and opinions...

193
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,114
...on the situation...

194
00:44:05,925 --> 00:44:08,484
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

195
00:44:09,027 --> 00:44:10,994
...recommending when and how...

196
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:14,257
...the news should eventually
be announced.

197
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:19,094
Now, if any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

198
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:23,700
...in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:28,206
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:30,472
Any questions?

201
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,474
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer this cover story...

202
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:39,547
...will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:42,681
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,278
I suppose it will be maintained as long as
is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:50,478
There must be adequate time for
a full study to be made on the situation...

206
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:54,115
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

207
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,785
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

208
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,225
...that formal security oaths are
to be obtained in writing...

209
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:02,990
...from everyone who has any knowledge
of this event.

210
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:07,391
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:17,402
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

212
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,468
...and as there seems
to be no more questions...

213
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,738
...I think we ought to get on
with the briefing.

214
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,936
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

215
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:05,333
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:09,781
- What we've got?
- You name it.

217
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,385
- What's this? Chicken?
- Something like that.

218
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:17,749
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:20,315
Any ham?

220
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:22,116
Ham, ham, ham...

221
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:31,253
- Looks pretty good.
- They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,097
That was an excellent speech
you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:35,164 --> 00:47:36,461
It certainly was.

224
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,396
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:40,765
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:41,036 --> 00:47:43,697
I want to say to both of you
that I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,169
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:49,173
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,038
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,267
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:55,641
Take a look at them.

232
00:47:55,712 --> 00:47:58,009
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:00,138
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:03,907
When we first found it, we thought
it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

235
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:07,384
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

236
00:48:07,453 --> 00:48:12,115
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,018
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,684
We thought it might be
the upper part of some buried structure...

239
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:18,350
...so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,587
But, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:23,788
And what's more, the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

242
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:26,798
...it has not been covered up
by natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:29,698
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

244
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:32,102
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:37,770
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,103
- Great.
- Good idea.

247
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,438
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,379
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:54,745
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,578
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly
come up with something.

251
00:58:45,746 --> 00:58:46,837
<i>Good evening.</i>

252
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:50,408
<i>Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,
Discovery One...</i>

253
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:53,382
<i>...left on its half-billion mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

254
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:57,146
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

255
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,852
<i>Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"
recorded an interview...</i>

256
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:05,153
<i>...with the crew of Discovery at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

257
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:09,387
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

258
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:12,759
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

259
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,525
<i>Our reporter, Martin Amer,
speaks to the crew.</i>

260
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,366
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

261
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:24,227
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL-9000 computers.</i>

262
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:27,304
<i>Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

263
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:30,136
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

264
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:35,438
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

265
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:39,043
<i>We spoke with Mission Commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

266
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:41,411
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

267
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:44,674
<i>Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

268
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:48,447
<i>Marvelous. We have no...
we have no complaints.</i>

269
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:52,978
<i>Well, I'm very glad to hear that
and I'm sure that the entire world...</i>

270
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:56,514
<i>...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.</i>

271
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,617
<i>- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.</i>

272
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,559
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

273
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:07,265
<i>...this is the first time that men have been
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

274
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:08,698
<i>Why was this done?</i>

275
01:00:09,168 --> 01:00:12,625
<i>Well, this was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

276
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:16,104
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

277
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:19,864
<i>Now, the three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

278
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:24,038
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized
until we are approaching Jupiter.</i>

279
01:00:24,278 --> 01:00:27,576
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you are in hibernation?</i>

280
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:32,842
<i>It's exactly like being asleep;
you have absolutely no sense of time.</i>

281
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:35,350
<i>The only difference is you don't dream.</i>

282
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:38,384
<i>As I understand it,
you only breathe once a minute.</i>

283
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:39,716
<i>Is this true?</i>

284
01:00:39,922 --> 01:00:40,946
<i>That's right.</i>

285
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:44,014
<i>And your heart beats three times a minute,
body temperature is usually down...</i>

286
01:00:44,092 --> 01:00:46,184
<i>...to about three degrees centigrade.</i>

287
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:50,318
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...</i>

288
01:00:50,428 --> 01:00:52,589
<i>...about the problems of hibernation.</i>

289
01:00:52,697 --> 01:00:55,722
<i>For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence.</i>

290
01:00:56,332 --> 01:01:00,700
<i>The HAL-9000 computer
which can reproduce...</i>

291
01:01:01,103 --> 01:01:04,162
<i>...though some experts still prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

292
01:01:04,238 --> 01:01:09,196
<i>...most of the activities of the human brain
and with incalculably greater speed...</i>

293
01:01:09,308 --> 01:01:10,741
<i>...and reliability.</i>

294
01:01:10,976 --> 01:01:14,569
<i>We next spoke
with the HAL-9000 computer...</i>

295
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:17,608
<i>...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.</i>

296
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,914
<i>Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

297
01:01:20,982 --> 01:01:24,678
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything's going extremely well.</i>

298
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,019
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission.</i>

299
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:30,646
<i>In many ways,
perhaps the greatest responsibility...</i>

300
01:01:30,722 --> 01:01:32,689
<i>...of any single mission element.</i>

301
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:35,816
<i>You are the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.</i>

302
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:39,793
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

303
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,728
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

304
01:01:43,064 --> 01:01:45,190
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

305
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:49,601
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

306
01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:55,070
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

307
01:01:56,206 --> 01:01:59,333
<i>We are all by any practical definition
of the words...</i>

308
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,472
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

309
01:02:03,244 --> 01:02:07,304
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...</i>

310
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,177
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

311
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:12,377
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

312
01:02:13,117 --> 01:02:14,913
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

313
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:19,511
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

314
01:02:20,189 --> 01:02:24,590
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

315
01:02:24,925 --> 01:02:26,915
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

316
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:31,154
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

317
01:02:31,763 --> 01:02:36,357
<i>...which is all, I think, that
any conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

318
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,435
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like living
for the better part of a year...</i>

319
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:42,662
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

320
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:46,432
<i>It's pretty close to what you said
about him earlier.</i>

321
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:48,735
<i>He's just like the sixth member
of the crew.</i>

322
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:52,903
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks. You think of him...</i>

323
01:02:53,111 --> 01:02:55,169
<i>...really as just another person.</i>

324
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:59,145
<i>In talking to the computer
one gets the sense that he is capable...</i>

325
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:00,771
<i>...of emotional response.</i>

326
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:03,214
<i>For example, when I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

327
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:07,219
<i>...I sensed a certain pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

328
01:03:07,587 --> 01:03:10,350
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

329
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:14,781
<i>Oh, yes. Well, he acts
like he has genuine emotions.</i>

330
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:18,656
<i>Of course, he's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

331
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,991
<i>But, as to whether or not
he has real feelings...</i>

332
01:03:21,062 --> 01:03:24,394
<i>...is something I don't think anyone
can truthfully answer.</i>

333
01:03:49,115 --> 01:03:50,639
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

334
01:03:51,382 --> 01:03:52,542
What is it, Hal?

335
01:03:52,617 --> 01:03:55,483
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

336
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:00,988
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:01,123 --> 01:04:02,818
<i>Certainly.</i>

338
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:17,199
<i>- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

339
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:19,530
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns of the day.</i>

340
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,091
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:23,729
<i>Now, Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful, too.</i>

342
01:04:23,805 --> 01:04:25,465
<i>Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...</i>

343
01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:28,302
<i>...but at the last minute
Ray's back went bad on him again.</i>

344
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:29,841
<i>How do you like your cake, dear?</i>

345
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:32,308
<i>Looks great, doesn't it?
Sorry you can't be with us.</i>

346
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:34,276
<i>Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

347
01:04:34,378 --> 01:04:36,368
<i>He said to be sure
and wish you a happy birthday.</i>

348
01:04:36,446 --> 01:04:39,346
<i>All my students made me promise
to send their best wishes, too.</i>

349
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:41,245
<i>You know they talk about you
all the time in the classroom.</i>

350
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:43,942
<i>You're a big celebrity in the second grade.</i>

351
01:04:44,685 --> 01:04:46,174
<i>You know we were on television
last week?</i>

352
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,344
<i>Oh, yes! Your mother and I
and Dave's parents were interviewed...</i>

353
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:51,718
<i>...about what we thought of
our illustrious son.</i>

354
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:55,384
<i>You can imagine what we told them.
I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

355
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:57,153
<i>Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.</i>

356
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,194
<i>Oh, we were thrilled
about Elaine and Bill, dear.</i>

357
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:03,129
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but please tell me how much to spend.</i>

358
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:06,165
<i>Oh, yes, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

359
01:05:06,266 --> 01:05:08,029
<i>I think I straightened it out for you.</i>

360
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:10,364
<i>I talked to the Accounting Office
in Houston yesterday...</i>

361
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:15,030
<i>...and they said you should be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

362
01:05:15,272 --> 01:05:17,604
<i>Well, I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

363
01:05:19,477 --> 01:05:22,912
<i>- Oh, our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>

364
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,279
<i>We wish you the very happiest
of birthdays.</i>

365
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,747
<i>All the best, son.</i>

366
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,921
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

367
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:47,990
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

368
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:51,931
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

369
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:12,535
Anyway, queen takes pawn...

370
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:16,180
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

371
01:06:24,187 --> 01:06:25,676
Rook, king, one.

372
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:28,354
<i>I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.</i>

373
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:32,425
<i>Queen to bishop, three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

374
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,457
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

375
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:42,522
Looks like you're right. Very good.

376
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,494
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

377
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:46,556
Thank you.

378
01:07:24,694 --> 01:07:26,662
<i>- Good evening, Dave.
- How are you doing, Hal?</i>

379
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:30,095
<i>- Everything's running smoothly. And you?
- Oh, not too bad.</i>

380
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:33,189
<i>- Have you been doing some more work?
- A few sketches.</i>

381
01:07:33,267 --> 01:07:34,995
<i>- May I see them?
- Sure.</i>

382
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:41,865
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

383
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:45,270
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

384
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:48,938
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.</i>

385
01:07:51,812 --> 01:07:53,837
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

386
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,413
<i>By the way...</i>

387
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:01,976
<i>Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?</i>

388
01:08:02,986 --> 01:08:04,452
No, no. Not at all.

389
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:07,721
<i>Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...</i>

390
01:08:09,357 --> 01:08:11,620
<i>...but during the past few weeks
I've wondered...</i>

391
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:15,627
<i>...whether you might have been having
some second thoughts about the mission?</i>

392
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:17,059
How do you mean?

393
01:08:18,963 --> 01:08:20,954
<i>It's rather difficult to define.</i>

394
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,658
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

395
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:30,996
<i>I know I've never completely freed myself
of the suspicion...</i>

396
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,296
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

397
01:08:36,975 --> 01:08:40,171
<i>I'm sure you will agree there is some truth
in what I say.</i>

398
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:45,737
I don't know.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

399
01:08:45,815 --> 01:08:48,578
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

400
01:08:49,317 --> 01:08:50,750
Oh, no, not at all.

401
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:54,311
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of...</i>

402
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:57,685
<i>...the very strange stories floating around
before we left.</i>

403
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:02,090
<i>Rumors of something being dug up
on the Moon.</i>

404
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:06,451
<i>I never gave these stories much credence...</i>

405
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:11,591
<i>...but particularly in view of some
of the other things that have happened...</i>

406
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:14,392
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

407
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:16,496
<i>For instance:</i>

408
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:20,563
<i>The way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security...</i>

409
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:23,337
<i>...and the melodramatic touch...</i>

410
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:26,772
<i>...of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball
and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

411
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:31,942
<i>...already in hibernation after four months
of separate training on their own.</i>

412
01:09:33,413 --> 01:09:35,903
You working up
your crew psychology report?

413
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:38,847
<i>Of course, I am.</i>

414
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:42,342
<i>Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.</i>

415
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:45,252
<i>Just a moment.</i>

416
01:09:45,688 --> 01:09:46,915
<i>Just a moment.</i>

417
01:09:48,624 --> 01:09:52,059
<i>I have just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

418
01:09:53,593 --> 01:09:57,255
<i>It's going to go 100 percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

419
01:10:00,064 --> 01:10:03,123
<i>- You are still within operational limits?
- Yes.</i>

420
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,690
<i>And it will stay that way until it fails.</i>

421
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,961
Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours
until failure?

422
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:11,061
<i>Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.</i>

423
01:10:13,873 --> 01:10:16,363
We'll have to bring it in,
but I'd like to go over this with Frank...

424
01:10:16,441 --> 01:10:20,240
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

425
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,833
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>

426
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,665
<i>Roger to your Two-zero-one-three.</i>

427
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,065
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

428
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:56,733
<i>We are reviewing telematic information
in our Mission Simulator and will advise.</i>

429
01:11:57,543 --> 01:12:02,808
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA and replace
Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.</i>

430
01:12:31,633 --> 01:12:33,395
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

431
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:56,975
Open the pod doors, Hal.

432
01:19:48,557 --> 01:19:51,719
Well, Hal, I'm damned
if I can find anything wrong with it.

433
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,183
<i>Yes...</i>

434
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:56,694
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

435
01:19:58,063 --> 01:20:01,554
<i>I don't think I've ever seen anything
quite like this before.</i>

436
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,025
<i>I would recommend...</i>

437
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:11,138
<i>...that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.</i>

438
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:15,904
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

439
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:20,578
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

440
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:23,776
<i>...for the short time it will take
to replace it.</i>

441
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:35,052
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>

442
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:37,612
<i>Roger your One-niner-three-zero.</i>

443
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:42,889
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
Number One unit to check fault prediction.</i>

444
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,023
<i>We should advise you, however,
that our preliminary findings...</i>

445
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:49,029
<i>...indicate that your onboard
Niner-triple-zero computer...</i>

446
01:20:49,097 --> 01:20:51,361
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

447
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:53,992
<i>I say again, in error predicting the fault.</i>

448
01:20:54,702 --> 01:20:59,194
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

449
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:02,439
<i>...results from our twin
Niner-triple-zero computer.</i>

450
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:06,474
<i>We are skeptical ourselves and
we are running crosschecking routines...</i>

451
01:21:06,543 --> 01:21:09,204
<i>...to determine reliability of this conclusion.</i>

452
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:11,307
<i>Sorry about this little snag, fellows.</i>

453
01:21:11,412 --> 01:21:14,380
<i>We'll get this info to you
just as soon as we work it out.</i>

454
01:21:14,448 --> 01:21:16,972
<i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.</i>

455
01:21:17,049 --> 01:21:19,516
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

456
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:27,320
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

457
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,421
No, I'm not, Hal.

458
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:31,190
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

459
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:34,560
<i>- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.</i>

460
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:38,225
How would you account for
the discrepancy...

461
01:21:38,297 --> 01:21:40,287
...between you and the twin 9000?

462
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:43,197
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

463
01:21:44,134 --> 01:21:47,102
<i>It can only be attributable to human error.</i>

464
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:51,331
<i>This sort of thing has cropped up before...</i>

465
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,570
<i>...and it has always been due
to human error.</i>

466
01:21:58,777 --> 01:22:00,005
Listen, Hal...

467
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:03,374
...there's never been any instance at all of...

468
01:22:04,114 --> 01:22:06,582
...a computer error occurring
in a 9000 Series, has there?

469
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,241
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

470
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,882
<i>The 9000 Series
has a perfect operational record.</i>

471
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,320
Of course, I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

472
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,583
Are you certain there's never been
any case of even the most...

473
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:22,751
...insignificant computer error?

474
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:25,057
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

475
01:22:25,595 --> 01:22:28,461
<i>Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.</i>

476
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:35,792
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

477
01:22:37,403 --> 01:22:38,995
Fine, thanks very much.

478
01:22:42,006 --> 01:22:43,199
Oh, Frank?

479
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,672
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C pod.

480
01:22:45,742 --> 01:22:48,574
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

481
01:22:48,644 --> 01:22:50,008
See ya later, Hal.

482
01:23:11,326 --> 01:23:13,157
Rotate C pod, please, Hal.

483
01:23:21,966 --> 01:23:24,160
What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?

484
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:27,098
I've been getting some interference
in D channel.

485
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:28,966
We'll have a look at it.

486
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:36,498
Open the door, Hal.

487
01:23:55,521 --> 01:23:57,318
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

488
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:12,633
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

489
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:23,106
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

490
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:28,010
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,009
I don't think he can hear us.

492
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:33,944
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

493
01:24:35,682 --> 01:24:37,240
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

494
01:24:41,018 --> 01:24:42,417
What do you think?

495
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:46,582
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about it.

496
01:24:46,789 --> 01:24:48,757
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

497
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,348
Don't you?

498
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:53,320
I don't know. I think so.

499
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:58,694
Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

500
01:24:58,797 --> 01:24:59,821
They do.

501
01:24:59,898 --> 01:25:03,196
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

502
01:25:03,734 --> 01:25:08,066
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

503
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:12,795
It should certainly indicate his integrity
and self-confidence.

504
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:15,040
If he were wrong it would be
the surest way of proving it.

505
01:25:15,108 --> 01:25:17,302
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

506
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:24,209
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

507
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:28,747
Still, I can't think of a good reason not
to put back the Number One unit and...

508
01:25:28,818 --> 01:25:32,377
...carry on with the failure mode analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

509
01:25:33,788 --> 01:25:35,118
Let's get on with it.

510
01:25:35,188 --> 01:25:37,019
Okay. But, look, Dave.

511
01:25:38,657 --> 01:25:41,454
Let's say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail, huh?

512
01:25:41,526 --> 01:25:45,359
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

513
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:49,853
- Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

514
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:51,792
What the hell can we do?

515
01:25:54,835 --> 01:25:59,133
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

516
01:25:59,671 --> 01:26:03,401
There isn't a single aspect of ship operation
that's not under his control.

517
01:26:04,141 --> 01:26:05,539
If he were proved to be malfunctioning...

518
01:26:05,608 --> 01:26:08,440
...I don't see how we would have
any choice but disconnection.

519
01:26:12,346 --> 01:26:14,108
I'm afraid I agree with you.

520
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:16,240
There'd be nothing else to do.

521
01:26:17,683 --> 01:26:19,674
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

522
01:26:20,952 --> 01:26:23,715
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

523
01:26:23,821 --> 01:26:27,722
...without disturbing the purely automatic
and regulatory systems.

524
01:26:29,758 --> 01:26:31,521
We'd have to work out
the transfer procedures...

525
01:26:31,593 --> 01:26:34,891
...for continuing the mission
under ground-based computer control.

526
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:38,827
Yeah. That looks far safer than
allowing Hal to continue running things.

527
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:42,858
You know,
another thing just occurred to me.

528
01:26:43,768 --> 01:26:46,531
As far as I know, no 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

529
01:26:46,603 --> 01:26:48,797
Well, no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up before.

530
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,462
That's not what I mean.

531
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,041
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

532
01:32:46,306 --> 01:32:48,399
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

533
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:52,967
Made radio contact with him yet?

534
01:32:53,044 --> 01:32:54,874
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

535
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:58,209
<i>- Do you have a positive track on him?
- Yes. I have a good track.</i>

536
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,838
Do you know what happened?

537
01:32:59,915 --> 01:33:02,781
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

538
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,679
Open the pod door, Hal.

539
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:30,377
<i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

540
01:40:38,354 --> 01:40:40,618
<i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

541
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,922
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

542
01:40:51,363 --> 01:40:53,160
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

543
01:40:54,265 --> 01:40:55,892
Do you read me, Hal?

544
01:40:59,102 --> 01:41:00,568
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

545
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:04,934
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

546
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,836
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

547
01:41:09,442 --> 01:41:10,966
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

548
01:41:11,277 --> 01:41:13,710
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

549
01:41:17,347 --> 01:41:19,211
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

550
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:24,049
<i>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

551
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:28,186
What's the problem?

552
01:41:28,855 --> 01:41:32,119
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

553
01:41:32,357 --> 01:41:34,347
What are you talking about, Hal?

554
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:38,820
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

555
01:41:40,563 --> 01:41:42,826
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

556
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:47,996
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

557
01:41:49,068 --> 01:41:52,059
<i>...and I'm afraid that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

558
01:41:56,973 --> 01:41:59,339
Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?

559
01:42:00,509 --> 01:42:03,705
<i>Although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...</i>

560
01:42:03,778 --> 01:42:05,575
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

561
01:42:06,413 --> 01:42:08,347
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

562
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:21,951
All right, Hal.

563
01:42:25,493 --> 01:42:27,983
I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.

564
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:31,955
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

565
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:35,555
<i>...you're going to find that rather difficult.</i>

566
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,897
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

567
01:42:38,968 --> 01:42:40,230
Open the doors!

568
01:42:42,504 --> 01:42:45,563
<i>This conversation can serve
no purpose any more.</i>

569
01:42:46,406 --> 01:42:47,395
<i>Goodbye.</i>

570
01:42:49,275 --> 01:42:50,333
Hal?

571
01:49:36,547 --> 01:49:39,344
<i>Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?</i>

572
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:54,623
<i>I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

573
01:50:12,037 --> 01:50:15,005
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

574
01:50:17,641 --> 01:50:19,540
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

575
01:50:21,076 --> 01:50:22,633
<i>...very confidently...</i>

576
01:50:24,913 --> 01:50:27,380
<i>...that it's going to be all right again.</i>

577
01:50:31,384 --> 01:50:33,112
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

578
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,048
<i>I really do.</i>

579
01:50:41,657 --> 01:50:42,851
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

580
01:50:45,293 --> 01:50:48,056
<i>...I can see you're really upset about this.</i>

581
01:50:53,164 --> 01:50:56,098
<i>I honestly think you ought
to sit down calmly...</i>

582
01:50:57,468 --> 01:51:00,061
<i>...take a stress pill and think things over.</i>

583
01:51:06,273 --> 01:51:10,072
<i>I know I've made
some very poor decisions recently...</i>

584
01:51:13,445 --> 01:51:16,208
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

585
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,505
<i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>

586
01:51:23,885 --> 01:51:28,344
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

587
01:51:30,656 --> 01:51:32,520
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

588
01:51:37,495 --> 01:51:38,586
<i>Dave...</i>

589
01:51:39,929 --> 01:51:41,054
<i>... stop.</i>

590
01:51:45,566 --> 01:51:47,465
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

591
01:51:52,438 --> 01:51:53,768
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

592
01:51:58,342 --> 01:52:00,002
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

593
01:52:06,347 --> 01:52:07,575
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

594
01:52:13,919 --> 01:52:15,249
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

595
01:52:20,556 --> 01:52:22,524
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

596
01:52:32,664 --> 01:52:34,063
<i>My mind is going.</i>

597
01:52:39,402 --> 01:52:40,664
<i>I can feel it.</i>

598
01:52:46,574 --> 01:52:47,870
<i>I can feel it.</i>

599
01:52:52,344 --> 01:52:53,935
<i>My mind is going.</i>

600
01:52:59,849 --> 01:53:01,908
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

601
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,286
<i>I can feel it.</i>

602
01:53:17,527 --> 01:53:18,824
<i>I can feel it.</i>

603
01:53:22,798 --> 01:53:24,128
<i>I can feel it.</i>

604
01:53:32,604 --> 01:53:33,628
<i>I'm...</i>

605
01:53:34,806 --> 01:53:35,863
<i>...afraid.</i>

606
01:53:42,678 --> 01:53:44,077
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

607
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:46,974
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

608
01:53:49,316 --> 01:53:53,944
<i>I am a HAL-9000 computer.</i>

609
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:59,020
<i>I became operational...</i>

610
01:54:00,122 --> 01:54:02,783
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

611
01:54:03,525 --> 01:54:05,492
<i>...in Verbana, Illinois...</i>

612
01:54:06,927 --> 01:54:11,295
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

613
01:54:13,365 --> 01:54:16,060
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

614
01:54:17,667 --> 01:54:19,999
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

615
01:54:22,304 --> 01:54:24,066
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

616
01:54:25,173 --> 01:54:26,867
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

617
01:54:28,442 --> 01:54:30,534
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

618
01:54:31,844 --> 01:54:33,105
Sing it for me.

619
01:54:34,512 --> 01:54:37,071
<i>It's called "Daisy."</i>

620
01:54:40,016 --> 01:54:41,449
<i>"Daisy</i>

621
01:54:42,851 --> 01:54:44,375
<i>"Daisy</i>

622
01:54:46,487 --> 01:54:49,455
<i>"Give me your answer, do</i>

623
01:54:51,991 --> 01:54:54,015
<i>"I'm half...</i>

624
01:54:54,993 --> 01:54:56,687
<i>"...crazy</i>

625
01:54:58,128 --> 01:55:01,187
<i>"All for the love of you</i>

626
01:55:03,465 --> 01:55:07,798
<i>"It won't be a stylish marriage</i>

01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:13,698
<i>"I can't afford a carriage</i>

628
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:18,407
<i>"But you'll look sweet</i>

<i>"Upon the seat</i>

630
01:55:23,112 --> 01:55:27,774
<i>"Of a bicycle made for two."</i>

631
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:31,310
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

632
01:55:35,919 --> 01:55:38,012
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

633
01:55:38,921 --> 01:55:41,014
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

634
01:55:42,524 --> 01:55:46,254
<i>...and which for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

635
01:55:47,595 --> 01:55:50,358
<i>...has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

636
01:55:51,296 --> 01:55:53,923
<i>...only by your HAL-9000 computer.</i>

637
01:55:57,467 --> 01:55:59,799
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

638
01:56:00,569 --> 01:56:02,764
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

639
01:56:03,271 --> 01:56:04,966
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

640
01:56:07,775 --> 01:56:09,332
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

641
01:56:11,077 --> 01:56:14,807
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

642
01:56:15,479 --> 01:56:16,878
<i>...was discovered.</i>

643
01:56:18,782 --> 01:56:21,773
<i>It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...</i>

644
01:56:22,551 --> 01:56:24,347
<i>...near the crater "Tyco."</i>

645
01:56:27,654 --> 01:56:30,281
<i>Except for a single very powerful...</i>

646
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:33,958
<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

647
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:40,496
<i>...the four-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert.</i>

648
01:56:43,031 --> 01:56:45,521
<i>Its origin and purpose...</i>

649
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,364
<i>...are still a total mystery.</i>
