1
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,041
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer...

2
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:54,001
in... um...

3
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,921
In Sumeria.

4
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:00,041
What happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

5
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:03,041
Jesus' disciples
performed miracles.

6
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,981
When Simon Magus
saw the miracles...

7
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,881
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

8
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,761
How did Peter respond...

9
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,241
John Rossi?

10
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:16,721
Stand up!

11
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,162
Answer, John Rossi.

12
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:27,522
That's not my name.

13
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:31,042
You and all
the other bastards...

14
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,642
lucky enough to be here...

15
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:36,082
children of sin,
spawn of the damned...

16
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:39,682
are all named for saints...

17
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:44,082
saints who are disciplined,
saints who are chaste.

18
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:48,322
You are named
for John Baptist Rossi...

19
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:51,362
a Capuchin priest who
gave away all his possessions.

20
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:57,082
A man who had nothing,
like you.

21
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:58,602
Now what is your name...

22
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:01,762
you ungrateful cur?

23
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,682
Your name, boy!

24
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:20,402
Have you lost your tongue?

25
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,242
What is your name?

26
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,363
All the girls...

27
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,963
will remain locked
in their dormitory...

28
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:38,203
and no food
will be served to any boy...

29
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:42,763
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

30
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,963
Food! Food! Food!
Food! Food! Food! Food!

31
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,044
Yes. Yes.

32
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:57,484
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

33
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:58,889
No.

34
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:01,284
Simon... Templar.

35
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,444
Agnes!

36
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,524
Agnes!

37
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,884
Agnes!

38
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:34,884
Agnes!

39
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:44,764
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

40
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,084
Won't happen,
'cause we're leaving tonight...

41
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,685
this hearty brotherhood,
on a crusade.

42
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,005
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love...

43
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,685
to bid you farewell.

44
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:56,125
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss.

45
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,245
Hey, watch this.

46
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:15,925
We've lost some girls!

47
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,365
The girls are missing!

48
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,405
There are girls missing!

49
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,605
Come on, boys!

50
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,525
Wait, John Rossi.
My kiss.

51
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,325
There he is! Get him!

52
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,405
Aah!

53
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,286
October 3.

54
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,526
Entering foyer
of Tretiak industries.

55
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:07,006
Heavy security on elevators.
Guards in uniform.

56
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:10,446
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate passkey.

57
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,806
Maybe use stairs.

58
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,926
No traffic there.

59
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:17,806
October 4.

60
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,331
Personal tidbits.

61
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:23,846
Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.

62
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:26,846
It left Tretiak as sole owner
of a gas and oil empire.

63
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:32,086
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

64
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,926
Who are you?

65
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,326
Vehicle was
driven by younger son Ilya...

66
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:38,566
now 27.

67
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,246
Wife now lives in Geneva...

68
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,086
following assassination
attempt in 1996.

69
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:44,146
I am... Ivanovanovitch.

70
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,166
October 5.

71
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,246
Ilya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado...

72
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,366
with bandito buddies.

73
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:53,446
Gangster rap, coffee,
flirting with teenage girls.

74
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,806
Small firearms in coats.
Machine pistols in cars.

75
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,488
There were
three great empires...

76
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:20,248
that dominated the world both
culturally and militarily...

77
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,568
Rome, Constantinople,
and Russia.

78
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:27,448
All three have fallen.

79
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,848
Only one can be restored...

80
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:34,688
and only one man
can restore it...

81
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,488
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

82
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,208
Friends...
countrymen...

83
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:04,968
Russians!

84
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:15,568
You people
here in this room...

85
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,768
are the cream of Russia...

86
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:24,169
and the whole nation
is listening with us.

87
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,609
But why do you all
listen to me rave?

88
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,609
Set aside my oil company...

89
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,209
forget about
my best-selling book...

90
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:36,689
and all I am is a lunatic...

91
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:40,369
haunted by the fantasy
of an empire...

92
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,609
that reclaims her former might,
her former size.

93
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:54,569
All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of a Russia...

94
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:59,449
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth.

95
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:05,329
Not ridiculed, but revered.

96
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,129
No! More than revered!

97
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,569
Feared!

98
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:25,009
But who am I
to dazzle you with this dream?

99
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,249
All I've done is...

100
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,169
How does it look
for the leader's son...

101
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,690
to walk out
when the leader speaks?

102
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,130
You'd prefer
the leader's son...

103
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,490
to piss his pants on live TV?
Hmm?

104
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,330
And still the people
freeze to death!

105
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,490
I love this country.

106
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,732
I don't speak Russian.

107
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:14,332
In that case, stand up...

108
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,212
put your hands
behind your head...

109
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:18,932
and turn around slowly.

110
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:26,732
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

111
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,412
Listen,
if I give this to you...

112
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,892
you'll give it to your daddy.

113
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:41,412
What's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

114
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,892
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me $1 million.

115
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,852
If we go in partners,
we'll split 50-50.

116
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,252
Half a million hard currency.

117
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,852
Think of the drugs you could buy
with that much cake.

118
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:55,172
You'll be discoing
for a decade in Moscow, mate.

119
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,413
I don't need your small change.

120
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,973
That's your first problem.

121
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,413
Here is your second.

122
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,653
Microchip... please.

123
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:08,133
Freeze!

124
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,213
Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

125
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:13,573
Suck me... sideways.

126
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,413
Aah! Uhh!

127
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,253
Uh! My eyes! Ohh!

128
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,374
Give it up!

129
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:18,454
You got no place to go!

130
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:33,614
A goddamn button!

131
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,654
Back of the building!
Come on!

132
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:58,134
Where's the body?

133
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,414
No body.
Just some guy in rags.

134
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:05,135
As the bitter chill of winter...

135
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:06,855
descends on Moscow...

136
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,175
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric...

137
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:11,655
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

138
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,215
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

139
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:16,175
and leader
of his own political party...

140
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:19,055
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

141
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:23,216
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

142
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,976
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

143
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:38,736
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

144
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,176
What beautiful work.

145
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,396
Ah. Cloisonne.

146
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,496
It is old.

147
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:54,616
Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

148
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,576
Please.

149
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:08,096
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

150
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,936
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

151
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:14,861
until things change.

152
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:18,576
You are married
not even a year...

153
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,936
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

154
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,181
I am sorry.

155
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,656
It's not my business.

156
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:30,296
How come you know
so much about me?

157
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,537
It is a gift.

158
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:38,457
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

159
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:40,337
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

160
00:18:40,377 --> 00:18:43,377
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

161
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,937
by the laying of hands.

162
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,862
Hmm.
He's the same build...

163
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,217
as the description
the Russians gave us...

164
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:02,817
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

165
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:03,977
No.

166
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:09,177
Could be faking it.

167
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:17,617
X- rays are clear.

168
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,137
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

169
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:22,857
You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

170
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,257
On the airplane, I had chicken.

171
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,377
Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

172
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,417
Last year. Same eyes.

173
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:30,137
Different chin.

174
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,418
Halcyon Hotel, guv.

175
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,663
Stand up!

176
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,858
What is your name?!

177
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,338
Answer the question!

178
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:31,818
What is your name?! Hey!

179
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:39,418
Lou, the microchip arrived.

180
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,578
I put the dough in your account.

181
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,818
Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

182
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:44,418
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

183
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,978
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

184
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:49,259
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

185
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,499
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

186
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,699
- I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
- I heard that before.

187
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,099
Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

188
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,539
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

189
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:58,939
- Fuck you, Lou.
- See yourself.

190
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,579
Can't seem to break 50.

191
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,820
"One million U.S. dollars...

192
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,340
"nonrefundable...

193
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,145
"reserves you a quiet table...

194
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,380
"at a romantic little spot
in Berlin called Templehopf...

195
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,260
"which has
a cozy transit lounge.

196
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,740
"To get inside, you walk
through the metal detectors...

197
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,020
"and I walk through
the metal detectors.

198
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,980
"Since you know I'm not armed,
and I know you're not armed...

199
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,820
"we can both fall in love,
and nobody gets hurt. "

200
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,260
I can't see him.

201
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,700
Then look for him.

202
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,740
You have
a long and beautiful cane...

203
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,980
along with your beautiful eyes.

204
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,020
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

205
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,465
Who are you?

206
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,180
My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

207
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,380
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

208
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,460
Had the wine, women, songs...

209
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,100
then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

210
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,060
went to live in the forest...
in the nude.

211
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,500
Please leave.

212
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,861
I represent
the professional you hired.

213
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,781
I'm his business manager.

214
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,661
I speak for him.

215
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,741
We don't deal
with underlings.

216
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,501
Come on, Father. Let's go.

217
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,821
Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

218
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,301
Ah. Youth.

219
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,661
Who runs this thief?

220
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,701
CIA? Ml-6? Libya?

221
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,501
He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

222
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:34,821
He's an independent contractor.

223
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:38,461
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

224
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,181
Oh, yes.

225
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:44,701
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that...

226
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,261
even with metal detectors...

227
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,581
even in this transit lounge.

228
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:53,141
Oh, it's so early.

229
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,101
You guys wanna get coffee
or something?

230
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,781
Sure.

231
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,546
Be quiet.

232
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,861
What is it
you request of my employer?

233
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,261
Do you know
what cold fusion is?

234
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,701
Of course.

235
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,861
It's the theory...

236
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,421
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

237
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:15,542
free energy forever.

238
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:16,822
Yes.

239
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:17,942
Kaffee?

240
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,062
Klein, Bitte.

241
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:23,662
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

242
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:26,462
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

243
00:24:26,502 --> 00:24:28,582
have never been able
to duplicate it.

244
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:29,862
Until now.

245
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:35,542
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

246
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,862
We believe
that this good lady...

247
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:40,702
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

248
00:24:40,742 --> 00:24:44,662
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

249
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:48,342
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

250
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:50,107
Your offer must inspire him.

251
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:52,662
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

252
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:56,382
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

253
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,422
She's cagey, difficult.

254
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,982
Maybe your agents are stupid.

255
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:09,822
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

256
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,027
Ridiculous.

257
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:16,662
Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

258
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:19,062
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

259
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,342
His deposit should go-

260
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:23,422
Hey. It is not for me.

261
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:24,903
It is for mother Russia.

262
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:28,668
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

263
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:32,343
Three million in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

264
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:36,063
Yes.

265
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:41,183
How long to get
your employer's agreement?

266
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:42,383
I'll ask.

267
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,743
Your offer has inspired her.

268
00:25:58,783 --> 00:25:59,863
I'll do it.

269
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,663
Bank account number in Zurich.

270
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,423
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

271
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:08,183
Bye-bye.

272
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:13,743
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

273
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,783
Too bad we have to kill him.

274
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:20,183
Yeah, too bad.

275
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,424
When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

276
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,864
announced in 1989...

277
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:42,984
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

278
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:47,144
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

279
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:50,544
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

280
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:53,304
and then condemned
as charlatans.

281
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,344
The protocols of cold fusion...

282
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,744
What are those? Drugs?

283
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,784
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

284
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,864
She's boring the life
out of me.

285
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,624
- They're for my heart.
- Oh.

286
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:11,904
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

287
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:14,269
- Who are you?
- Me?

288
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,744
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

289
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:19,384
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

290
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,264
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

291
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:24,344
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

292
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,464
Dr. Emma Russell.

293
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,504
Oops.

294
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:45,265
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

295
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:47,185
I'm actually more interested...

296
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:50,585
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

297
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,665
so I thought we would
start with those.

298
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,705
Any questions?

299
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:57,985
Please?

300
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:59,465
I have, Dr. Russell.

301
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:03,545
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

302
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:05,145
you know, the theory?

303
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,905
Yes. Oh, there it is.

304
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:11,785
This is the-the apparatus.

305
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,145
And very simply...

306
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:16,305
when positively charged
deuterons...

307
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:19,185
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

308
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:20,625
they cram together...

309
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:24,065
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

310
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:27,345
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

311
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,465
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

312
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,025
But I read somewhere...

313
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,745
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

314
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:36,425
so how do we know it works?

315
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,545
We don't.

316
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:39,705
Not yet.

317
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,585
But if you remember Einstein...

318
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,625
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

319
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:46,825
long before he could prove it.

320
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,950
I mean, he felt the truth.

321
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:52,626
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

322
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:53,826
about cold fusion...

323
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,226
because it's there.
It's in nature...

324
00:28:56,266 --> 00:29:00,826
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

325
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:05,106
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

326
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:07,346
I mean, just imagine.

327
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:12,306
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

328
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:15,066
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

329
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:19,026
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

330
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:21,426
on a gallon of heavy water.

331
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:24,226
It would be the end
of pollution...

332
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,706
warmth for the whole world.

333
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:31,906
So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

334
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:35,546
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

335
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,786
They used very complex...

336
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,786
November 17, 11:30 a. m.

337
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:45,346
Entering flat
of Dr. Emma Russell.

338
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,586
High Street, Oxford.

339
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,506
No alarms on outer doors.
Strange.

340
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,106
No messages.

341
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:58,546
Shelley Monument.

342
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:02,627
Entering bathroom.

343
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:04,787
Books.

344
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:08,347
More books.

345
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,667
Walls covered
with reminder notes.

346
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:17,787
Poetry.

347
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,827
Ah. Dad.

348
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,587
"Stop and talk to Shelley
every day.

349
00:31:06,627 --> 00:31:09,108
"How can I love
a man named Percy?"

350
00:31:12,828 --> 00:31:14,748
"Isn't there
someone in the world...

351
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,748
"who can consume me like that. "

352
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:19,908
Magic. Romantic.

353
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:28,788
No recent applications.

354
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:30,788
"Cold fusion notes. "

355
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,868
"Although I pass the
Shelley Monument every day...

356
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,148
"its sadness strikes me
every time. "

357
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:50,508
"I feel a very personal loss
when I look at it.

358
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,508
"So much pain
and so much passion. "

359
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:00,228
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness...

360
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:01,708
"and in the shadow of death. "

361
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,108
"Luke 1; verse 79."

362
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:09,028
Tretiak's wrong.
She's not cagey.

363
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:12,988
She's not difficult.
She's just...

364
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,268
eccentric.

365
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:16,909
She's innocent.

366
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:24,349
Maybe it's in her head.

367
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:29,509
She needs a poet...
an artist...

368
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:32,869
someone who...

369
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,589
understands truth.

370
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,589
She needs Thomas More.

371
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,910
Do you like it?

372
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
What?

373
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,190
The sculpture. Do you like it?

374
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,990
Oh... yes.

375
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,870
What do you love about it?

376
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,310
The way it... glows.

377
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,110
And how the light...

378
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,670
holds him in silence...

379
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,710
taking care of him.

380
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,830
That's what I like about it.

381
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,710
Are you an artist?

382
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,070
No. I'm just a traveler
searching for purity.

383
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,670
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

384
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,550
Yes.

385
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,950
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

386
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,711
No, not really.

387
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:39,991
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home...

388
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:42,151
in Africa.

389
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:44,671
You should
experience the energy...

390
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:46,431
of where all life began.

391
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:55,031
Sorry.
I'm not very good with people.

392
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:00,711
Me, neither.

393
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,791
"I see my angel
for the first time...

394
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:33,831
"know my purpose,
feel my birth... "

395
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:38,511
"hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly...

396
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,911
"the sweet strains
of our union... "

397
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:45,512
"Our love heats up
the cold universe...

398
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:48,272
"and gives my tired,
desperate hope... "

399
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,072
"purified
by our kisses...

400
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:53,792
"are eternally healed. "

401
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:56,637
Do you like it?

402
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,912
Who did you write it for?

403
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:01,352
You.

404
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,792
You're following me,
or it's destiny.

405
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,272
Either way, it's weird.

406
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,792
Very weird.

407
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:12,752
Destiny then.

408
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:24,952
This must look strange.

409
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:27,832
It's, uh...

410
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:30,832
something that I'm working on...

411
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:32,512
a formula for...

412
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:35,632
creating energy.

413
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,272
That you carry around
in your underwear?

414
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:43,112
Yeah, I do.

415
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,313
How did you do that?

416
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,313
Magic.

417
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,033
Give it back.

418
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:04,553
It looks like Sanskrit.

419
00:37:04,593 --> 00:37:06,473
Give it back.

420
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,673
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

421
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,953
What else do you keep in there?

422
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:17,833
Nothing.

423
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,233
That's not true.

424
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:23,553
Can I get you
anything else?

425
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:30,033
Drink your wine.
Latour '57.

426
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:35,033
The Latour, sir,
is $400 a bottle.

427
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:41,233
Then we'll have two bottles.

428
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:46,113
There. You count it.

429
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:55,473
All these little tubes
and microbes and things.

430
00:37:55,513 --> 00:37:56,833
Molecules?

431
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,913
Those, too.

432
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:01,514
Can I tell you something?

433
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:03,514
What? You must. Everything.

434
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:05,994
It's a secret.

435
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,154
What?

436
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,514
I'm done.

437
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:16,194
My energy research-
I'm finished.

438
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:19,514
I still have some sequencing
that I have to work out...

439
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:22,634
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

440
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,274
It's just been you against
the whole world, hasn't it?

441
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:29,874
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

442
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:31,554
The gift of faith.

443
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:35,514
To see...

444
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,194
Well...

445
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,714
to believe in something
that's all around us...

446
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:45,714
but hidden from our sight.

447
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,194
That's a beautiful thought.

448
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:50,234
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

449
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,314
I don't even know your name.

450
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:55,834
Well, my name is...

451
00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:58,914
I don't want to tell you.

452
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:00,994
I don't want to do that.

453
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,434
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

454
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:08,835
What's your name?

455
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:12,275
- Emma.
- Emma.

456
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:14,955
Now I know
everything about you.

457
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:18,755
Your... genius.

458
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:22,435
You have a weak heart.

459
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:29,875
You have beautiful dreams,
great courage.

460
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:33,435
You're not afraid in this world.

461
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,355
You get that from your father.

462
00:39:37,595 --> 00:39:40,035
You can't cook
to save your life...

463
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,475
and you love fish.

464
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,435
I do love fish.

465
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:49,635
That's weird.

466
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,235
I want to try that.

467
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,795
- No.
- Yes.

468
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:54,755
I don't want you to.
Drink your wine.

469
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:58,315
Yes, I do.

470
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:00,875
What's your name?

471
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,795
My name is Thomas More.

472
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,315
I was named after the saint...

473
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:13,035
who died for his faith.

474
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:15,955
OK.

475
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:19,556
Your work...

476
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:24,036
is very dangerous...
and alive...

477
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,356
and I love your poems.

478
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,476
They move me.

479
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,996
But that's not
who you really are.

480
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,316
You're running away from...

481
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:39,956
your past and your pain...

482
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:44,116
and yet you keep it
so close to you.

483
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:50,316
So you don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

484
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,236
because you're beautiful.

485
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:51,957
What are you doing?

486
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:13,757
Oh, my God,
you're bleeding. What happened?

487
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,957
Don't know. I was...

488
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:19,077
weeping, and I slipped.

489
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:21,437
I was thinking of you.
I don't know.

490
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:23,637
I live right down the street.

491
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,357
I could clean you up.

492
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:28,517
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

493
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:29,797
- I don't know.
- Wait.

494
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:35,678
I'm glad it stopped bleeding.

495
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:38,998
Don't need stitches.

496
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:48,398
We're gonna have
to disinfect it, though.

497
00:42:48,438 --> 00:42:50,918
You really are an angel.

498
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,118
You are.

499
00:42:55,278 --> 00:42:57,158
It's gonna hurt.

500
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:58,478
- Aah!
- Aah!

501
00:42:58,518 --> 00:43:00,478
Oh, sorry.

502
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:05,438
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

503
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,318
Yeah.

504
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:09,198
I'm sorry. I was just joking.

505
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:12,198
I...

506
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:14,278
- I should go.
- Oh, no.

507
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,678
Yes. You-you... I...

508
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,678
Take off your pants.

509
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:20,838
Pardon?

510
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:22,398
I mean, your sweater.

511
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:28,718
There's blood on it.
I'll wash it.

512
00:43:33,518 --> 00:43:34,838
Very domestic.

513
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,918
There's blood
on your blouse as well.

514
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:43,719
I'll wash it.

515
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,039
Do you have any wine?

516
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,879
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

517
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,359
How could I not?

518
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:21,559
You make me feel so good.

519
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,719
I wish you...

520
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:26,239
I wish you could understand.

521
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,799
I want you to know who I am.

522
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,359
Oh, my heart.

523
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:51,760
Don't disappear.
I'll be right back.

524
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,520
Calm it down.

525
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,080
Bring it round.

526
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,960
Too way high up, your street.

527
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,560
I can see...

528
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,080
like nothin' else...

529
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,520
in me, you're better
than I wanna be.

530
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,280
Don't think,
'cause I understand...

531
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,040
I care...

532
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,480
Don't think,
'cause I'm talking...

533
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,120
Oh, I can't do this.

534
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,360
She's so great.

535
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,760
I can't believe this.

536
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,240
I can't believe
this is happening.

537
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,845
I'm open...

538
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,760
to falling from grace.

539
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,080
Hi.

540
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:15,241
"To spider:

541
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:17,921
"Must fly. Have better offer. "

542
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:21,081
Greedy westerner.
Wants more money.

543
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:22,321
Who cares?

544
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:25,241
Can't spend hard currency
in hell.

545
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:28,961
Send this message-

546
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:32,201
"Fly, don't buzz off.

547
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,641
"I'll double your fee...

548
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,201
"or send my own boys
to take care of the woman. "

549
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:50,481
You OK?

550
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:57,001
Let's...
let's just lie here.

551
00:46:59,081 --> 00:47:01,681
Can't we just
be like this tonight?

552
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,561
Is that what you want?

553
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,001
It's so magic.

554
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:15,562
It just feels so perfect.

555
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:47,802
It's 7:00 a. m.,
and here are the news headlines.

556
00:47:56,522 --> 00:47:57,922
Thomas?

557
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:14,003
Lev Naumovitch,
it's here! Good man!

558
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:15,448
It's revolutionary, sir!

559
00:49:15,483 --> 00:49:18,443
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas...

560
00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:20,923
but I think the formula
is incomplete.

561
00:49:20,963 --> 00:49:22,043
It will take months...

562
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,283
That won't do...

563
00:49:23,323 --> 00:49:26,203
because now that the people are
nicely beginning to freeze...

564
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:29,804
Tretiak must sweep in
with a miracle to save them.

565
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:32,084
How high do you want it,
Mr. Tretiak?

566
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:34,484
To the top.
Good morning, Yuri.

567
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:35,764
Good morning.

568
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:38,724
Perhaps I
can confirm the validity...

569
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:41,364
of this formula more quickly
if I dispense...

570
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:44,244
with certain protocols.
But, Mr. Tretiak-

571
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:46,364
How long, Dr. Botvin,
since you received...

572
00:49:46,404 --> 00:49:50,084
your last salary check
from Moscow University?

573
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:52,964
Ukrainian Independence Day.

574
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:55,684
Last August.

575
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,364
Ivan, he's on-line.

576
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:03,444
Do it.

577
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:07,844
To spider...

578
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:11,684
You've got the recipe.

579
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:12,924
"Where's my dough?"

580
00:50:12,964 --> 00:50:14,964
To human fly...

581
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:19,404
Recipe incomplete.

582
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:21,364
The cake won't rise.

583
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:24,284
Hence, no dough.

584
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,684
I am not the baker...

585
00:50:32,724 --> 00:50:35,245
"... but don't make me
the butcher. "

586
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,165
I like this guy.

587
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,085
No play, no pay.

588
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:49,605
I'm certain you kept
the cookbook.

589
00:50:57,885 --> 00:50:58,965
Holland Park.

590
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:15,605
I'll check that for you.

591
00:51:15,645 --> 00:51:18,645
Yes, that seems to be fine.
One moment. Aah!

592
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:29,205
He's keeping me on-line.

593
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:39,885
You wait here.

594
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:24,086
You, beside the car.

595
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,846
Now, turn around.
Step away from the vehicle.

596
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:30,006
He's armed!

597
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:53,647
Drive!

598
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:05,247
Go the other way. Go!

599
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,167
You're all I've got tonight.

600
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:16,047
You're all I've got tonight.

601
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
What about him?

602
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:29,327
What about this one?

603
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Yeah. That-

604
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:39,327
We believe
they're all the same villain.

605
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:45,327
Oh, my God.

606
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,407
They're all him?

607
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:51,087
We believe so.

608
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,967
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

609
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,567
Then he fled the U.K.
out of Heathrow.

610
00:53:58,607 --> 00:54:00,327
We've got a handful
of false identities...

611
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:03,728
used on visas,
passports, leases...

612
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:06,608
Nicholas Owen...

613
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,288
Louie Guanella...

614
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,488
Peter Damian...

615
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:13,048
Charles Borroneo.

616
00:54:13,088 --> 00:54:15,528
Of course.

617
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:18,248
Thomas More.

618
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,288
All names of Catholic saints.

619
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:26,048
Can you access
Heathrow's passenger lists...

620
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:29,048
for the last eight hours?

621
00:54:29,648 --> 00:54:31,248
I think it might be possible.

622
00:54:31,288 --> 00:54:32,408
Good.

623
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:41,368
Go!

624
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:00,248
Yeah!

625
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:12,649
Yes!

626
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:25,409
See, my friends...

627
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:29,089
you back the biggest rats.

628
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:50,529
Hello.

629
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:55,889
Out, out.

630
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:58,294
Freeloaders, out.

631
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,929
I want to drink alone.

632
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,209
Close the curtain.

633
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,530
- What?
- What?

634
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,890
Don't look down.

635
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,770
You know who I am?

636
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,050
No.

637
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,690
I'm the thief
you tried to cheat.

638
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,570
This is your accountant.

639
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,250
Talk to him.

640
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,330
The phone goes
the other way, you moron.

641
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,410
Hello.

642
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,050
Tretiak speaking.

643
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:00,290
That money to Zurich,
send it now.

644
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,810
I said now.

645
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,490
Yeah.

646
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,130
Thank you.

647
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,850
You know what the hardest part
about being you is?

648
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,410
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

649
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,490
You son of the bitch.

650
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,570
There is an impostor.
Get him out.

651
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,090
Hey, hey, hey!

652
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:28,691
Take your hands off me,
you idiots!

653
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:31,011
Are you crazy? It's me.

654
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:32,171
Go, go!

655
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:33,496
Catch him, go!

656
00:57:33,531 --> 00:57:35,411
Ilya, get the bastard!

657
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:59,611
Fifty million. I'm out.

658
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:04,011
Mr. Ferrer checking out.

659
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:06,571
OK.

660
00:58:16,051 --> 00:58:18,451
I'll have one, too.

661
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,131
Emma.

662
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:22,011
Hi.

663
00:58:22,971 --> 00:58:25,571
I'm... I'm overwhelmed.

664
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:28,411
You found me.

665
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,051
Wasn't very hard.

666
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,891
Two men with saint's names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

667
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:38,852
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African...

668
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,292
whereas Vincent Ferrer-

669
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:43,372
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

670
00:58:43,412 --> 00:58:45,292
How could you do it?

671
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,652
Emma...

672
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:50,292
I- I had to.

673
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:52,812
I'm a thief.

674
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:54,772
I want my cards back.

675
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:56,732
You flew all this way
for your cards?

676
00:58:56,772 --> 00:58:57,852
Yes, I did.

677
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:00,452
No.
It's because you're in love.

678
00:59:04,092 --> 00:59:05,332
I rest my case.

679
00:59:05,372 --> 00:59:07,132
Who are you?

680
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:10,212
No one has a clue,
least of all me.

681
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:13,892
And why would you
steal cold fusion?

682
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:17,132
It's free.
Why would you do that?

683
00:59:19,212 --> 00:59:20,852
Eight million reasons.

684
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:23,492
Eight million.
Wow. That's all?

685
00:59:25,172 --> 00:59:28,532
I would have
given them to you...

686
00:59:28,572 --> 00:59:30,372
if you'd only asked.

687
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:37,852
You've got
to get away from me.

688
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:41,212
I'm not going until you tell me
why you lied to me.

689
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:43,732
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

690
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:46,213
You almost got me killed.
The guy says it doesn't work.

691
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,973
Well, screw him.

692
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:50,213
I don't think you'd enjoy that.

693
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,133
You're right.
I don't think I would.

694
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:02,493
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

695
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:05,493
What?

696
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:15,533
- They took my pills.
- No, they didn't.

697
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:17,573
I palmed them from your purse.

698
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,733
I need one or two.

699
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:22,813
I need...
I have a bad heart.

700
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,933
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

701
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:26,550
It's OK. I've got your pills.

702
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:29,319
OK, I've got two in my hand.

703
01:00:29,354 --> 01:00:32,053
I'm gonna pass out.

704
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:33,893
Sit down on the floor.

705
01:00:35,453 --> 01:00:38,533
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

706
01:00:38,573 --> 01:00:40,333
That's right.
Eat two out of my hand.

707
01:00:40,373 --> 01:00:43,773
That's right. OK?

708
01:00:43,813 --> 01:00:46,173
While you're down there...

709
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:50,693
Get the pocketknife
out of my boot.

710
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:56,934
This formula makes
certain assumptions...

711
01:00:56,974 --> 01:01:01,174
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes...

712
01:01:01,214 --> 01:01:03,374
so testing at any level
becomes futile...

713
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:06,974
without further information,
Mr. Tretiak.

714
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:09,694
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.

715
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:11,134
Help is here.

716
01:01:22,294 --> 01:01:24,014
The two came very quietly.

717
01:01:26,294 --> 01:01:27,454
Oh.

718
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:35,174
And they left even more quietly.

719
01:01:36,854 --> 01:01:38,214
Close the city.

720
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:43,254
Kill him, and bring her... alive.

721
01:01:56,894 --> 01:01:59,654
Why are they after me?

722
01:01:59,694 --> 01:02:03,815
Tretiak, the guy I work for...
he owns this city, cops and all.

723
01:02:03,855 --> 01:02:07,975
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

724
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,015
What do you want from me?

725
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:19,295
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

726
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,775
So the formula works?

727
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:23,295
Oh, kiss me again.

728
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,980
- No.
- Make up your mind.

729
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:32,055
Oh, it's-I have to
figure out the order...

730
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:34,775
before the formula works,
and I'm not giving it to him.

731
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:36,815
- Tretiak will find you.
- No.

732
01:02:36,855 --> 01:02:39,255
He found me,
and that's hard to do.

733
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:43,255
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

734
01:02:43,295 --> 01:02:44,575
What do you need?

735
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:50,855
I need some time...

736
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:52,135
and I need...

737
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,215
I need a place to work...

738
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:58,815
and...

739
01:02:59,815 --> 01:03:01,975
Where's everyone going?

740
01:03:02,015 --> 01:03:05,255
To their country
relatives to cut firewood.

741
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:06,935
There's no heat in the city.

742
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,776
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

743
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:20,376
I don't know.

744
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:23,496
Two hours, maybe.
I don't know.

745
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:26,096
Should be enough time to get
our passports together...

746
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,976
and for us to get married.

747
01:03:29,016 --> 01:03:31,616
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

748
01:03:32,736 --> 01:03:35,896
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

749
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:41,976
- You're not Martin.
- No.

750
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:44,576
Who are you?

751
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:49,336
I don't have a name.

752
01:03:50,896 --> 01:03:52,096
That's sad.

753
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:54,416
Will you have a name
when we get home?

754
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,296
I don't have a home.

755
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:58,016
When we get back...

756
01:03:58,056 --> 01:04:00,256
you do the science,
I'll do the math.

757
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:01,976
We'll market your formula
around the world.

758
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:05,136
We'll make a fortune,
and then...

759
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,936
we'll see.

760
01:04:09,296 --> 01:04:10,936
OK?

761
01:04:19,176 --> 01:04:20,457
Emma!

762
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:39,297
No trouble, OK?

763
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:45,897
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

764
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,218
Ohh!

765
01:06:41,779 --> 01:06:43,099
Spice room, sun room...

766
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,179
Shadow room, night...

767
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:48,299
I've got you.

768
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,059
Come on.

769
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:02,059
Here we go. Up.

770
01:07:05,419 --> 01:07:07,979
We've gotta get you warm.

771
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:17,419
We're almost there.

772
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:41,699
Come on.

773
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:44,899
Come on.

774
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:53,100
You'll wait till Christ
comes to Moscow.

775
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,740
Elevator was made of mahogany.

776
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,860
Tenants used it
for firewood last winter.

777
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,420
We need your help.

778
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,140
He fell in the river,
and he's freezing.

779
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,820
- Need clothes.
- We're just people-

780
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,140
You're not people.
You're Americans.

781
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:11,300
Yes, but we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

782
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:46,540
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys her.

783
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,580
No heat for sale...

784
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,460
but these clothes
will make him warm.

785
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,221
I tell her, Mashenka,
go back to bed.

786
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,261
She's always puttering around.

787
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:09,741
It's here.
Built to escape Secret Police.

788
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:11,221
In you go.

789
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:27,621
You've got hypothermia.

790
01:09:27,661 --> 01:09:30,061
We have to get
these wet clothes off...

791
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,501
keep you warm.

792
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,501
They must be in
one of these buildings.

793
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:37,141
Check every apartment.

794
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:42,061
How you doing? Talk to me.

795
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:44,821
Snug as a bug in a rug.

796
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:55,861
OK. We're gonna...

797
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:59,781
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature...

798
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,661
falls below 95 degrees.

799
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:17,782
Two kids
talking about foreigners.

800
01:10:26,342 --> 01:10:27,982
Listen to me, tenants!

801
01:10:28,822 --> 01:10:30,982
Show me where
the Americans are...

802
01:10:31,022 --> 01:10:34,862
and you'll be paid
in American dollars.

803
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:37,182
Five hundred bucks reward.

804
01:10:37,217 --> 01:10:38,382
Daddy...

805
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,982
have you seen, by chance,
two Americans?

806
01:10:43,022 --> 01:10:45,702
Just one American
and one polar bear.

807
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:49,342
Do we get 250?

808
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:09,422
We check upstairs.

809
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,783
What's your name?

810
01:11:26,063 --> 01:11:27,463
Who are you really?

811
01:11:29,423 --> 01:11:30,543
Simon.

812
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:31,783
Simon?

813
01:11:32,703 --> 01:11:35,663
So you are named for a saint.

814
01:11:35,703 --> 01:11:37,463
No, Simon the magician.

815
01:11:38,343 --> 01:11:40,383
I did tricks...

816
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:43,863
tricks for Agnes...
and that's how I got things.

817
01:11:43,903 --> 01:11:47,743
Priests took everything,
took Agnes.

818
01:11:47,783 --> 01:11:49,783
Dogs too big.

819
01:11:49,823 --> 01:11:52,783
Teeth. Teeth.

820
01:11:52,823 --> 01:11:54,543
She fell.

821
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:55,903
I escaped.

822
01:11:57,303 --> 01:11:58,423
I always escape.

823
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,143
I don't believe in magic
anymore.

824
01:12:03,743 --> 01:12:05,023
I do.

825
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:10,183
I've never felt
like this before.

826
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:12,463
How?

827
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,303
I'm freezing.

828
01:12:19,743 --> 01:12:21,424
These are here!

829
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:31,064
We gotta get out of here.
Are you OK?

830
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:33,184
They're coming.

831
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:36,744
Americans are here!

832
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:39,104
Hurry. Here, put this on.

833
01:12:44,704 --> 01:12:45,824
Ilya!

834
01:12:58,904 --> 01:13:00,144
Upstairs. Go!

835
01:13:17,464 --> 01:13:18,984
Maybe we can jump.

836
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,544
Let's jump.

837
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:27,264
Come on.

838
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:53,065
Wait.

839
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:11,145
We need her alive, idiot.

840
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,265
Embassy's east of here.

841
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:35,625
You're late.
Where have you been?

842
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:38,026
I've been waiting two hours.

843
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:41,586
I've got some beautiful
paintings for you to buy.

844
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:43,106
In here. Come on.

845
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:51,066
Don't fret.
It's just my curator, Toli.

846
01:14:51,106 --> 01:14:53,706
I am Alexa Frankievitch,
but being you're Americans...

847
01:14:53,746 --> 01:14:55,546
you can call me Frankie.

848
01:14:55,586 --> 01:14:57,586
OK, Frankie.
I've got money. We want-

849
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:01,466
I know. The icon
of the Virgin of the Damned.

850
01:15:01,506 --> 01:15:03,866
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

851
01:15:03,906 --> 01:15:06,586
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American Embassy.

852
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:09,586
Right.
I need $10,000 up-front.

853
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:11,871
No.

854
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:15,306
OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.

855
01:15:15,346 --> 01:15:16,746
Shh.

856
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:25,466
Police.

857
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:27,466
No. Tretiak's goons.

858
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:37,386
Wait.

859
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:40,306
Sasha,
go east to the embassy.

860
01:15:40,346 --> 01:15:42,266
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

861
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:45,506
You're in Russia, sir.
Everything is complicated.

862
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,586
But you know the way?

863
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:50,147
Like the face
of a Bulgari chronograph.

864
01:16:00,027 --> 01:16:01,867
I remember. This way.

865
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:08,707
At last. Water main.

866
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:11,667
They shut it down
each afternoon in winter.

867
01:16:11,707 --> 01:16:13,267
What time do they
turn it back on?

868
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:16,587
You have five minutes,
plus or minus.

869
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:17,707
Plus or minus?

870
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:20,072
That means several
minutes earlier or later.

871
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:23,147
Don't worry.
Third opening is your embassy.

872
01:16:40,587 --> 01:16:42,427
Quick. Someone's coming.

873
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:50,467
Come on. Come on.

874
01:16:57,948 --> 01:16:59,908
Here's the second one.

875
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,668
Embassy's next.

876
01:17:05,228 --> 01:17:08,748
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah. Unless it's minus.

877
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:15,028
Damn.
It's sealed.

878
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,228
We'll have to go back.

879
01:17:18,268 --> 01:17:19,428
Come on.

880
01:17:42,428 --> 01:17:43,628
Hurry.

881
01:17:53,308 --> 01:17:55,268
Up you go.

882
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:16,949
Yankee, go home!
Down with Yankee!

883
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:27,629
Embassy's only
about 100 yards away.

884
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:31,109
There's a car right above us.
Watch your head.

885
01:19:03,109 --> 01:19:05,029
I'll create a diversion.

886
01:19:05,069 --> 01:19:07,749
It should take you 10 seconds
to run to those gates.

887
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,669
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

888
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:12,229
OK. I can do that.

889
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:14,310
You can do it.

890
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:18,190
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

891
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,150
I'll find you. You found me.

892
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,790
Yeah, I did.

893
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:51,990
Aah!

894
01:20:22,071 --> 01:20:25,431
I'm an American!
Open the gate!

895
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,911
Open the gate!
I'm an American!

896
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,711
Back off from the gate.

897
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:33,591
Back off. I said back off.

898
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:37,951
Stand back from the gate.

899
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:41,031
I said back off!

900
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:54,951
She outran you?

901
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:56,951
How humiliating.

902
01:21:00,671 --> 01:21:03,791
One... shot left.

903
01:21:05,391 --> 01:21:07,351
Can't come
all the way to Russia...

904
01:21:07,391 --> 01:21:10,071
and not play Russian roulette.

905
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:12,271
Before you shoot me,
want to know where the money is?

906
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:15,511
Whose money?

907
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,111
Tretiak's, yours.

908
01:21:17,151 --> 01:21:19,511
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

909
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:21,031
What are you saying?

910
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:23,191
I'm saying your father
stashed billions...

911
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:26,111
and I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

912
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:29,671
So... where are all those
hidden billions?

913
01:21:30,392 --> 01:21:34,152
I know... but I don't think
I'm gonna tell you.

914
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:05,512
Joseph, what's the holdup?
I said get 'em inside!

915
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:07,432
You're worse
than all the others.

916
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:10,072
However, burns will heal.

917
01:22:10,112 --> 01:22:12,672
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

918
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:15,952
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

919
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:18,232
Lucky? Look at me.

920
01:22:19,112 --> 01:22:21,672
I am a damn devil.

921
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:23,192
Christ.

922
01:22:26,352 --> 01:22:27,432
Yes?

923
01:22:27,472 --> 01:22:30,472
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

924
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:34,872
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

925
01:22:34,912 --> 01:22:37,112
but rather... impossible.

926
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,793
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion.

927
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:44,433
I invest millions...

928
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,433
and you can't make it work!

929
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:54,513
What are you doing
with my money?

930
01:22:57,073 --> 01:23:00,753
Do you think it comes so easy?

931
01:23:00,793 --> 01:23:01,913
No!

932
01:23:01,953 --> 01:23:03,913
But, sir...

933
01:23:03,953 --> 01:23:08,433
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

934
01:23:08,473 --> 01:23:12,873
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite convincing.

935
01:23:12,913 --> 01:23:14,393
It does?

936
01:23:18,673 --> 01:23:22,793
Yes. It does.

937
01:23:23,513 --> 01:23:24,793
Good man.

938
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,393
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

939
01:23:29,113 --> 01:23:32,473
Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

940
01:23:32,513 --> 01:23:35,193
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

941
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:38,913
From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

942
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:40,753
all of them loyal to us.

943
01:23:40,793 --> 01:23:42,793
Make certain
they get the message-

944
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:45,593
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

945
01:23:48,034 --> 01:23:49,234
Mr. President.

946
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:52,274
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

947
01:23:52,314 --> 01:23:57,394
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

948
01:23:57,434 --> 01:24:00,874
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

949
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:04,234
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

950
01:24:04,274 --> 01:24:07,114
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

951
01:24:07,154 --> 01:24:09,794
from a scientific viewpoint.

952
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:12,954
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

953
01:24:12,994 --> 01:24:16,114
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

954
01:24:16,154 --> 01:24:18,634
Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

955
01:24:18,674 --> 01:24:21,234
let's dispense with the bad.

956
01:24:21,274 --> 01:24:23,394
What is the price
of this marvel?

957
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:26,154
The cost of research
and development are there...

958
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:29,754
which is all
you are asked to defray.

959
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:37,274
Ten billion in hard currency?

960
01:24:37,314 --> 01:24:42,234
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

961
01:24:49,434 --> 01:24:51,354
Where are you heading?

962
01:24:51,394 --> 01:24:54,674
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

963
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:01,675
Like the miracle of socialism...

964
01:25:01,715 --> 01:25:04,915
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

965
01:25:04,955 --> 01:25:06,075
But no matter.

966
01:25:06,115 --> 01:25:10,235
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

967
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:13,675
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

968
01:25:13,715 --> 01:25:16,475
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

969
01:25:16,515 --> 01:25:19,995
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

970
01:25:20,035 --> 01:25:23,315
Not now, old witch.
We're working.

971
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:24,755
Yes. Think of it.

972
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:30,395
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

973
01:25:30,435 --> 01:25:34,395
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

974
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:37,435
You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

975
01:25:37,475 --> 01:25:39,035
Any medical problems?

976
01:25:39,075 --> 01:25:40,515
I have a heart condition.

977
01:25:40,555 --> 01:25:42,995
Do you need me to arrange
any medication for you?

978
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,315
Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

979
01:25:46,835 --> 01:25:47,995
That's strange.

980
01:25:48,035 --> 01:25:50,075
Get a form from
table three down the corridor.

981
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:51,555
I'll be back in 10 minutes...

982
01:25:51,595 --> 01:25:53,715
by your side,
all the way to the airport.

983
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:54,875
Thank you.

984
01:25:54,915 --> 01:25:57,075
...Across the street
in central Moscow...

985
01:25:57,115 --> 01:26:01,555
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

986
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:05,396
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

987
01:26:05,476 --> 01:26:07,236
I'm told
that all American citizens...

988
01:26:07,276 --> 01:26:09,796
have been asked to report
to the American embassy...

989
01:26:09,836 --> 01:26:11,676
for immediate evacuation.

990
01:26:11,716 --> 01:26:14,876
Excuse me. You look lost.

991
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:17,281
- No, I'm fine.
- May I help you?

992
01:26:17,316 --> 01:26:21,876
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is August Christopher.

993
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,356
Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase-

994
01:26:25,396 --> 01:26:27,836
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

995
01:26:27,876 --> 01:26:30,396
"but do not give it yet. "

996
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:37,756
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

997
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:38,956
Are you coming with me?

998
01:26:38,996 --> 01:26:42,356
No. But they are.

999
01:26:48,276 --> 01:26:51,756
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1000
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:53,596
Find a quiet room.

1001
01:26:54,436 --> 01:26:56,676
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1002
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:58,396
My number's on the back.

1003
01:26:58,436 --> 01:27:02,076
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1004
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,876
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1005
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:05,916
or you'll never be safe.

1006
01:27:05,956 --> 01:27:07,636
Be good at school.

1007
01:27:07,676 --> 01:27:08,796
Wait.

1008
01:27:11,156 --> 01:27:14,077
- Don't you trust me, darlin'?
- Trust who?

1009
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,597
That hurts, Emma.

1010
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,197
I'm serious.
What's your name?

1011
01:27:19,237 --> 01:27:21,917
My name is August Christopher.

1012
01:27:21,957 --> 01:27:24,837
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1013
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:26,797
I mean, Vincent Ferrer...

1014
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:28,957
I mean, Martin de Porres...

1015
01:27:30,157 --> 01:27:31,917
Thomas More.

1016
01:27:33,037 --> 01:27:35,877
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1017
01:27:36,797 --> 01:27:38,637
You have to be a very good...

1018
01:27:38,677 --> 01:27:42,077
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1019
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:45,597
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1020
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:47,837
Now, get to work.

1021
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,197
Who's that man?

1022
01:27:50,237 --> 01:27:52,517
You're leaving
on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?

1023
01:27:52,557 --> 01:27:55,437
Probably be your
last chance out of here.

1024
01:27:55,477 --> 01:27:56,917
Better hurry. It's leaving.

1025
01:27:59,197 --> 01:28:01,717
Your troops
will depose the president...

1026
01:28:01,757 --> 01:28:04,597
and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.

1027
01:28:04,637 --> 01:28:09,197
Moscow must be
ringed with tanks by evening.

1028
01:28:09,237 --> 01:28:12,437
Don't worry.
The people will follow me.

1029
01:28:12,477 --> 01:28:14,637
They will be crying
for revolution.

1030
01:28:14,677 --> 01:28:17,157
Still, no one's
guessed the simple truth...

1031
01:28:17,197 --> 01:28:19,197
of where the heating oil went.

1032
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:25,918
Who would believe
that a sea of oil...

1033
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,518
was hidden under
this very building?

1034
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:32,998
Yuri, I understand
your Nataly is to...

1035
01:28:33,038 --> 01:28:35,518
Francis, you devil...

1036
01:28:35,558 --> 01:28:37,798
I heard you came here,
and you didn't call me.

1037
01:28:37,838 --> 01:28:41,078
- Hello, Dominic-
- Give me a ring, Charles.

1038
01:28:41,118 --> 01:28:43,718
Lou,
I've heard on the grapevine...

1039
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:46,958
you're brokering a revolutionary
new energy source.

1040
01:28:47,798 --> 01:28:49,998
If it's as good
as it's cracked up to be...

1041
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:53,158
I have friends who can double
your best offer...

1042
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:55,278
on deposit in Zurich...

1043
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:58,078
within one hour
of delivery and confirmation.

1044
01:28:58,878 --> 01:28:59,998
I'll be waiting.

1045
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,158
The work could be here.

1046
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,038
This machine could work,
couldn't it?

1047
01:29:26,718 --> 01:29:28,318
Who are you?

1048
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:30,398
A friend of Dr. Russell's.

1049
01:29:30,438 --> 01:29:31,599
Dr. Russell?

1050
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,679
What's this equation?

1051
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:37,039
It's so simple.

1052
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,519
This is the key
to Dr. Russell's formula.

1053
01:29:40,559 --> 01:29:41,839
Yes.

1054
01:29:43,599 --> 01:29:45,759
The alarm. You had better go.

1055
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:49,679
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

1056
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:53,239
But Mr. Tretiak's rally
is tonight.

1057
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:54,879
Can you make it work?

1058
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:57,599
Make it work.

1059
01:30:01,959 --> 01:30:03,359
What is wrong here?

1060
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:04,759
Uh, the alarm...

1061
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:09,199
Uh... uh...

1062
01:30:09,919 --> 01:30:11,319
I tripped.

1063
01:30:19,799 --> 01:30:23,199
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

1064
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:24,879
You are Nikolai Provovich-

1065
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:26,079
Petrovich.

1066
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,679
Tunnel built by KGB...

1067
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,120
Leads to machine room
in Kremlin.

1068
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:47,200
Do you know where
the president's quarters are?

1069
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:51,040
President Karpov is there.

1070
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,080
But there are many guards,
so I suggest-

1071
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,040
An alternate route?

1072
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,880
Money. Now.

1073
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,280
Oh, ye of little faith.

1074
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,480
Russia stands tonight...

1075
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,240
on the brink
of a second revolution.

1076
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,720
As the number of deaths
from freezing mounts...

1077
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,640
hundreds of thousands
of protesters...

1078
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,760
have taken to the streets.

1079
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,360
Even as
Russian President Karpov...

1080
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,560
is promising
a mysterious solution...

1081
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,440
to the crippling
heating-oil shortage...

1082
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,600
troops opposed
to the elected government...

1083
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,845
and led
by General Leo Sklarov...

1084
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,560
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

1085
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,480
Angry, frightened citizens...

1086
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,200
are gathering outside
the Kremlin in Red Square...

1087
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,000
but they're not braving
the bitter cold...

1088
01:31:37,035 --> 01:31:39,040
for yet another political rally.

1089
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,400
They've been drawn here by
the promise of a revelation...

1090
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,800
whatever that may be...

1091
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,240
in what's become
a life-and-death struggle...

1092
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,161
for the future
of democracy in Russia.

1093
01:33:01,482 --> 01:33:04,202
Mr. President?
I'm your friend.

1094
01:33:04,237 --> 01:33:05,962
What do you want?

1095
01:33:07,762 --> 01:33:10,922
I want to help you
to destroy Tretiak.

1096
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:12,682
I need you to listen
for about 30 seconds.

1097
01:33:14,442 --> 01:33:17,122
I'm all right. Stay outside.

1098
01:33:17,162 --> 01:33:19,082
Please, continue.

1099
01:33:19,122 --> 01:33:22,402
Tonight you'll stand trial
in Red Square before the world.

1100
01:33:22,437 --> 01:33:25,682
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

1101
01:33:25,722 --> 01:33:27,202
Agree with this criminal?

1102
01:33:27,242 --> 01:33:30,002
If you want
to destroy Tretiak... yes.

1103
01:33:46,482 --> 01:33:48,602
Gruschev,
take Mr. Karpov downstairs.

1104
01:33:48,642 --> 01:33:49,802
The wife stays here.

1105
01:33:51,922 --> 01:33:55,202
Get your hands off!
What you are doing is illegal!

1106
01:33:55,242 --> 01:33:57,122
The people won't stand for it!

1107
01:33:57,162 --> 01:34:00,482
The people are too cold
to stop it. Who are you?

1108
01:34:14,163 --> 01:34:16,843
Tretiak!
Tretiak! Tretiak!

1109
01:34:31,603 --> 01:34:33,643
Friends...

1110
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:35,523
countrymen...

1111
01:34:35,563 --> 01:34:37,643
Russians!

1112
01:34:46,923 --> 01:34:51,083
You heard about this morning's
sensational events.

1113
01:34:51,123 --> 01:34:54,123
Many shocking documents
were recovered...

1114
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:56,323
from the president's
secret files...

1115
01:34:56,363 --> 01:34:58,888
locked within his private safe.

1116
01:34:58,923 --> 01:35:03,683
The documents which will be
published in today's papers...

1117
01:35:03,723 --> 01:35:07,848
prove that the traitor Karpov...

1118
01:35:07,883 --> 01:35:11,603
was about to steal
over 40 trillion...

1119
01:35:11,643 --> 01:35:14,403
of our precious
Russian rubles...

1120
01:35:14,443 --> 01:35:18,924
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

1121
01:35:18,959 --> 01:35:20,844
To add insult...

1122
01:35:20,884 --> 01:35:23,724
millions of dollars
were to be paid...

1123
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:26,724
to this international criminal!

1124
01:35:33,404 --> 01:35:35,364
And for what
was your president...

1125
01:35:35,404 --> 01:35:39,369
hoping to bankrupt
our national treasury?

1126
01:35:39,404 --> 01:35:44,344
What you see is a fairy tale
called cold fusion.

1127
01:35:44,379 --> 01:35:49,284
You pass electric current
into the machine...

1128
01:35:49,324 --> 01:35:53,404
and there is supposed
to be a chemical reaction.

1129
01:35:53,444 --> 01:35:54,964
Watch.

1130
01:35:55,004 --> 01:35:58,484
It can't even light up
a tiny light bulb!

1131
01:35:58,524 --> 01:36:00,884
Do you dare deny this,
Mr. Karpov?

1132
01:36:00,924 --> 01:36:03,044
Absolutely not!

1133
01:36:03,084 --> 01:36:05,289
I proudly admit it!

1134
01:36:05,324 --> 01:36:08,324
But enough puny failure.

1135
01:36:08,364 --> 01:36:10,404
Failure's in the past!

1136
01:36:10,444 --> 01:36:13,564
Begging is behind us!

1137
01:36:13,604 --> 01:36:17,204
The balance of power
is about to shift!

1138
01:36:49,765 --> 01:36:51,725
Miracle one.

1139
01:36:55,925 --> 01:37:15,765
Karpov! Karpov!

1140
01:37:22,765 --> 01:37:23,845
Ilya! Ilya!

1141
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:25,205
Go! Go!

1142
01:37:25,245 --> 01:37:26,725
Go, go, go!

1143
01:37:28,205 --> 01:37:32,486
I order all troops
loyal to mother Russia...

1144
01:37:32,526 --> 01:37:35,846
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

1145
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:42,726
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

1146
01:37:42,766 --> 01:37:46,006
There was a miscommunication
in the chain of command.

1147
01:37:52,206 --> 01:37:53,566
Miracle two.

1148
01:37:53,646 --> 01:37:56,726
The billionaire
industrialist and his son...

1149
01:37:56,766 --> 01:37:59,206
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison...

1150
01:37:59,246 --> 01:38:03,146
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1151
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:07,046
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth...

1152
01:38:07,086 --> 01:38:09,246
as millions of gallons
of heating oil...

1153
01:38:09,286 --> 01:38:12,346
flowed from a storage depot
beneath Tretiak's mansion.

1154
01:38:12,381 --> 01:38:15,406
He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1155
01:38:15,446 --> 01:38:17,206
He never had the chance.

1156
01:38:17,246 --> 01:38:18,486
You'll tell us
if he makes contact?

1157
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:19,646
Yes.

1158
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:24,246
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1159
01:38:24,286 --> 01:38:27,726
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1160
01:38:27,766 --> 01:38:30,566
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1161
01:38:30,606 --> 01:38:34,286
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint...

1162
01:38:34,326 --> 01:38:36,406
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1163
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:37,651
Count yourself lucky.

1164
01:38:37,686 --> 01:38:41,967
I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1165
01:38:42,007 --> 01:38:44,247
We understand.
You have a life.

1166
01:38:44,287 --> 01:38:45,927
We appreciate
your taking the time.

1167
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:47,407
No problem.

1168
01:38:53,647 --> 01:38:55,567
She's in love with him.

1169
01:40:03,128 --> 01:40:05,848
I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1170
01:40:05,888 --> 01:40:07,048
It hasn't been safe.

1171
01:40:07,088 --> 01:40:09,608
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1172
01:40:11,768 --> 01:40:16,608
So... have you been busy?

1173
01:40:16,648 --> 01:40:19,088
Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1174
01:40:19,123 --> 01:40:21,493
Thank God I have my cards back.

1175
01:40:21,528 --> 01:40:25,008
You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1176
01:40:25,048 --> 01:40:27,608
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1177
01:40:27,648 --> 01:40:29,848
Oh, my God.

1178
01:40:29,888 --> 01:40:31,288
That was you?

1179
01:40:32,248 --> 01:40:34,608
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1180
01:40:35,648 --> 01:40:38,128
I thought you were
some old biddy...

1181
01:40:38,168 --> 01:40:41,408
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1182
01:40:41,448 --> 01:40:44,248
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1183
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,368
I am?

1184
01:40:45,408 --> 01:40:48,208
Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1185
01:40:54,408 --> 01:40:55,488
- Emma.
- Yeah?

1186
01:40:55,528 --> 01:40:57,208
My life is very strange.

1187
01:40:58,128 --> 01:40:59,409
I just...

1188
01:41:03,209 --> 01:41:05,289
I don't do anything normal.

1189
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:06,809
I'm-I can't even-

1190
01:41:06,849 --> 01:41:10,169
I know. I know you.

1191
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:13,649
I know your life.

1192
01:41:13,689 --> 01:41:16,209
- What do you want?
- I want you.

1193
01:41:16,249 --> 01:41:18,209
For how long?

1194
01:41:18,249 --> 01:41:20,169
It doesn't matter.

1195
01:41:26,809 --> 01:41:28,449
Tell me you love me.

1196
01:41:30,289 --> 01:41:31,889
I- I love you.

1197
01:41:32,929 --> 01:41:34,049
Simon.

1198
01:41:35,449 --> 01:41:37,569
I love you, Simon.

1199
01:41:38,769 --> 01:41:40,729
Miracle three.

1200
01:42:03,289 --> 01:42:05,209
Dear Simon...

1201
01:42:05,249 --> 01:42:08,490
the pin is something
I've kept for years.

1202
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:11,810
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1203
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:14,290
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1204
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:16,690
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1205
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:18,770
something I loved.

1206
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:21,570
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1207
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:24,250
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1208
01:42:24,290 --> 01:42:26,370
and so I hope you'll understand.

1209
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:29,850
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1210
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:33,090
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1211
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,890
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1212
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:39,610
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1213
01:42:39,645 --> 01:42:44,570
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1214
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:47,730
If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1215
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:50,010
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1216
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:53,690
will accomplish anything...
you're absolutely right.

1217
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:58,290
Simon, what are you doing here?

1218
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,690
There are police.

1219
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:02,130
They're everywhere.

1220
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,410
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1221
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:07,370
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

1222
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:12,290
You better go.

1223
01:43:25,651 --> 01:43:26,931
How will I find you?

1224
01:43:28,891 --> 01:43:31,611
I'll find you. You found me.

1225
01:43:57,651 --> 01:44:00,611
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1226
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:05,011
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1227
01:44:05,051 --> 01:44:09,291
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1228
01:44:09,331 --> 01:44:13,051
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1229
01:44:13,091 --> 01:44:15,971
No.

1230
01:44:16,011 --> 01:44:17,731
Dr. Russell?

1231
01:44:26,412 --> 01:44:29,212
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1232
01:44:29,247 --> 01:44:30,812
Thank you. Good morning.

1233
01:44:30,852 --> 01:44:32,292
No.

1234
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:36,372
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1235
01:44:36,412 --> 01:44:39,252
a difficult childhood.

1236
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:41,812
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1237
01:44:41,852 --> 01:44:43,732
bastards, at best.

1238
01:44:43,772 --> 01:44:48,692
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1239
01:44:50,132 --> 01:44:52,372
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1240
01:44:52,412 --> 01:44:54,972
I'm her biggest fan.

1241
01:44:55,012 --> 01:44:57,697
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1242
01:44:57,732 --> 01:45:00,652
Even though
some of you may feel...

1243
01:45:00,692 --> 01:45:04,292
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1244
01:45:04,332 --> 01:45:08,412
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1245
01:45:08,452 --> 01:45:09,532
becoming a reality.

1246
01:45:09,572 --> 01:45:12,932
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1247
01:45:12,972 --> 01:45:14,852
Look at the time.
Got to go.

1248
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:18,372
...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1249
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:21,292
we can all work towards
making the-the...

1250
01:45:22,412 --> 01:45:26,692
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1251
01:45:49,893 --> 01:45:50,973
