1
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:35,735
Navid!

2
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,195
Get away from the window!

3
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,364
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

4
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,200
Come here! Come here right now!

5
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:43,368
Arash!

6
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,412
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

7
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,288
But he's just a kid.

8
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:47,705
Seven!

9
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,707
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

10
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,918
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

11
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,545
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

12
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,800
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

13
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,010
Navid!

14
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,553
Shut the door!

15
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,556
We're not here to kill any of them.

16
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,058
Got it?

17
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,269
The goal is to die on television.

18
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:11,270
Let's go!

19
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,601
Don't make a move before I say...

20
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,812
I wanna make sure they're recording.

21
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:53,771
Yes!

22
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:54,647
Yes! Yes!

23
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:55,857
We're ready.

24
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,559
Navid! It's dangerous here!

25
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,393
Come away! Come...

26
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,895
Navid, where are you going?

27
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,856
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

28
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,316
What are you looking for? Navid!

29
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,902
Navid! Navid! What are you...

30
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,361
Navid! Don't go! Navid!
