01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:54,287
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

957
01:05:54,412 --> 01:05:58,792
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

958

to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

959
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:06,132
This time they called it
World War II.

Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

961

Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

962
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,268
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

963
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:21,356
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

964

Your granddad was facing death.

He knew it.

966

None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

967
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:33,660
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

968
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:38,957
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

969
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,960
a man he'd never met before
in his life--

970
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:45,005
to deliver to his infant son,

971
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,676
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

972
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:54,055
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

973
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:58,393
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

his dad's gold watch.

976
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:16,036
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

979
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:27,255
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

980
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:31,051
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

981
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:35,055
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

982
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,059
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-- his ass.

he wore this watch up his ass.

which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1762
02:03:08,596 --> 02:03:12,851
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

[ Sighs ]

1764
02:03:20,692 --> 02:03:22,527
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1765
02:03:22,694 --> 02:03:26,031
Do me a favour, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1766
02:03:26,197 --> 02:03:29,534
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1767
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:33,955
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1768
02:03:34,122 --> 02:03:36,583
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1769
02:03:38,752 --> 02:03:42,088
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall ?

1770
02:03:42,255 --> 02:03:45,592
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1771
02:03:45,759 --> 02:03:49,095
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1772
02:03:49,262 --> 02:03:52,599
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1773
02:03:52,766 --> 02:03:56,728
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1774
02:03:56,895 --> 02:03:58,855
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

[ Exhales ]

1776
02:04:04,569 --> 02:04:07,405
- Here you go, Mr Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1777
02:04:12,327 --> 02:04:14,204
Mmm.

1778
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:17,415
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1779
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:20,418
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1780
02:04:20,543 --> 02:04:23,213
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1781
02:04:23,338 --> 02:04:27,217
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1782
02:04:27,342 --> 02:04:30,720
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1783
02:04:30,845 --> 02:04:34,808
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1784
02:04:34,974 --> 02:04:38,812
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1785
02:04:38,978 --> 02:04:41,815
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1786
02:04:41,981 --> 02:04:44,818
It don’t need to be spick-and-span.
You don’t need to eat off it.

1787
02:04:44,984 --> 02:04:49,280
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1788
02:04:49,406 --> 02:04:53,451
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1789
02:04:53,576 --> 02:04:55,954
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1790
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:58,957
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1791
02:04:59,082 --> 02:05:02,627
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1792
02:05:02,794 --> 02:05:08,008
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1793
02:05:08,174 --> 02:05:10,010
with quilts and blankets,

1794
02:05:10,176 --> 02:05:14,014
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won’t last,

1795
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:16,975
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1796
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:19,102
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1797
02:05:19,227 --> 02:05:20,937
"Please" would be nice.

1798
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:25,316
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1799
02:05:27,318 --> 02:05:31,072
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1800
02:05:32,949 --> 02:05:35,827
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1801
02:05:35,952 --> 02:05:38,329
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1802
02:05:38,455 --> 02:05:42,292
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1803
02:05:42,417 --> 02:05:45,670
No, Mr Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1804
02:05:45,837 --> 02:05:48,673
Mr Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1805
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,551
I just don’t like people
barkin' orders at me.

1806
02:05:51,718 --> 02:05:54,679
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1807
02:05:54,846 --> 02:05:59,392
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1808
02:05:59,559 --> 02:06:02,896
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1809

Don’t be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

- No, no, please. Go ahead.

that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

with that shit!

'til I do something.
- Right.

- Don't do shit unless.

- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1901

Spoken like a true prodigy.

1902
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:45,697
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1903

I'm cool. I promise you.

any different than I gave it,

disposing of two bodies.

- [ Vincent ] All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

Mm-hmm.

- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2086
02:22:42,771 --> 02:22:46,149
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

- Don't you hurt him !
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

We're all gonna be like three little

And that's what we're gonna be.

2092

We're gonna be cool.

02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:08,338
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2094
02:23:08,463 --> 02:23:10,507
And when I count three,

2095
02:23:10,632 --> 02:23:13,510
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2096
02:23:13,635 --> 02:23:17,013
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2097

you do it cool.

- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go !
- Yolanda !

2104
02:23:41,413 --> 02:23:44,916
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

2105
02:23:45,083 --> 02:23:47,085
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2106
02:23:47,252 --> 02:23:51,006
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2107
02:23:52,716 --> 02:23:56,261
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2108
02:23:56,428 --> 02:23:59,723
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2109
02:23:59,889 --> 02:24:01,725
But I don't want that.

2110
02:24:01,891 --> 02:24:03,727
And you don't want that.

2111
02:24:03,893 --> 02:24:06,563
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2112
02:24:06,688 --> 02:24:08,732
So let's see what we can do.

2113
02:24:11,192 --> 02:24:14,362
Now... here's the situation.

2114
02:24:14,487 --> 02:24:18,283
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2115

while I'm in a transitional period,

and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

02:24:24,956 --> 02:24:28,793
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don’t belong to me.

2118
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:31,796
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

And Ringo's proud of you.

2131
02:25:05,789 --> 02:25:08,625

Tell her you're proud of her.

2132
02:25:08,792 --> 02:25:12,087
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2133
02:25:12,212 --> 02:25:15,298
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2134
02:25:15,465 --> 02:25:19,302
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2137
02:25:42,784 --> 02:25:45,829
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2138
02:25:50,917 --> 02:25:53,003

Count it.

2139
02:25:59,426 --> 02:26:01,845
How much is there?

2140
02:26:03,847 --> 02:26:05,682
About 1,500 dollars.

2141
02:26:05,849 --> 02:26:08,977
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2142
02:26:09,102 --> 02:26:12,230
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2143
02:26:12,397 --> 02:26:14,399
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2144
02:26:14,566 --> 02:26:18,361
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

- Shut up !
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2148
02:26:28,121 --> 02:26:30,999
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2149

Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don’t have to kill your ass.

2152

You read the Bible, Ringo?

02:26:46,139 --> 02:26:48,016
Not regularly, no.

2154
02:26:48,141 --> 02:26:50,518
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2155
02:26:50,643 --> 02:26:54,105
Ezekiel 25:17.

2156
02:26:54,272 --> 02:26:57,025
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2157
02:26:57,150 --> 02:26:59,027
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2158
02:26:59,152 --> 02:27:01,029
and the tyranny of evil men.

2159
02:27:01,154 --> 02:27:04,449
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2160
02:27:04,616 --> 02:27:06,951
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2161
02:27:07,118 --> 02:27:11,122
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2162
02:27:11,289 --> 02:27:15,502
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2163
02:27:15,669 --> 02:27:18,630
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2164
02:27:18,797 --> 02:27:21,758
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2165
02:27:21,883 --> 02:27:25,387
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2166
02:27:26,513 --> 02:27:28,890
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2167
02:27:29,015 --> 02:27:32,102
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2168
02:27:32,268 --> 02:27:35,105
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2169
02:27:35,271 --> 02:27:38,108
I just thought it was some cold blooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2170
02:27:38,274 --> 02:27:40,610
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2171
02:27:40,777 --> 02:27:44,114
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2172
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:47,117
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2173
02:27:47,283 --> 02:27:52,080
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2174
02:27:52,205 --> 02:27:55,083
and Mr 9-millimetre here,
he's the shepherd...

2175
02:27:55,208 --> 02:27:58,712
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2176
02:27:58,878 --> 02:28:00,714
Or it could mean...

2177
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:04,217
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2178
02:28:04,384 --> 02:28:08,221
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2179
02:28:08,388 --> 02:28:10,557
Now, I'd like that.

2180
02:28:10,724 --> 02:28:13,518
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2181
02:28:13,685 --> 02:28:15,478
The truth is,

2182
02:28:16,604 --> 02:28:18,481
you're the weak...

2183
02:28:19,941 --> 02:28:23,278
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

02:28:24,738 --> 02:28:26,614
But I’m tryin', Ringo.

2185
