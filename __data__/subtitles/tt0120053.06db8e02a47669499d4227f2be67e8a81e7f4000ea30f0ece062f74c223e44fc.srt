00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,433
This is the… the apparatus.

336
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,851
And very simply…

337
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:28,146
when positively charged
deuterons…

338
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,149
are attracted
to the palladium cathode…

339
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:32,651
they cram together…

340
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:36,238
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode…

341
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,658
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse…

342
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:41,868
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

343
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,495

couldn't be replicated…

347
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,546
Not yet.

348
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,549
But if you remember Einstein…

349
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,718
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true…

350
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,594
long before he could prove it.

351
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:01,179
I mean, he felt the truth.

352
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,346
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way…

353
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:06,017
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way…

355
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,771
because it's there.

to seize the criminal Tretiak!

1239
01:41:50,822 --> 01:41:52,449
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

1240
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:55,869
There was a miscommunication
in the chain of command.

1241
01:42:02,334 --> 01:42:03,752
[THINKING]
Miracle two.

1242
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:07,047
NEWSWOMAN: The billionaire
industrialist and his son…

1243
01:42:07,088 --> 01:42:09,633
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison…

1244
01:42:09,674 --> 01:42:14,011
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1245
01:42:14,012 --> 01:42:17,807
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth…

1246
01:42:17,849 --> 01:42:20,101
as millions of gallons
of heating oil…

1247
01:42:20,143 --> 01:42:23,854
flowed from a storage depot
beneath Tretiak's mansion.

1248
01:42:23,855 --> 01:42:26,525
INSPECTOR: He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1249
01:42:26,566 --> 01:42:28,401
EMMA: He never had the chance.

1250
01:42:28,443 --> 01:42:29,736
You'll tell us
if he makes contact?

1251
01:42:29,778 --> 01:42:30,946
EMMA: Yes.

1252
01:42:30,987 --> 01:42:32,488
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1253
01:42:32,489 --> 01:42:35,742
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1254
01:42:35,784 --> 01:42:39,371
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1255
01:42:39,412 --> 01:42:42,332
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1256
01:42:42,374 --> 01:42:46,211
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint…

1257
01:42:46,253 --> 01:42:48,421
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1258
01:42:48,463 --> 01:42:49,755
Count yourself lucky.

1259
01:42:49,756 --> 01:42:54,219
I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1260
01:42:54,261 --> 01:42:56,596
INSPECTOR: We understand.
You have a life.

1261
01:42:56,638 --> 01:42:58,348
WOMAN: We appreciate
your taking the time.

1262
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:59,891
EMMA: No problem.

1263
01:43:06,398 --> 01:43:08,400
INSPECTOR:
She's in love with him.

1264
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:08,835
[GIGGLING]

1265
01:44:18,845 --> 01:44:21,681
SIMON: I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1266
01:44:21,723 --> 01:44:22,933
It hasn't been safe.

1267
01:44:22,974 --> 01:44:25,602
EMMA: I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1268
01:44:27,854 --> 01:44:32,901
SIMON:
So… have you been busy?

1269
01:44:32,943 --> 01:44:35,194
EMMA: Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1270
01:44:35,195 --> 01:44:38,030
Thank God I have my cards back.

1271
01:44:38,031 --> 01:44:41,660
SIMON: You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1272
01:44:41,701 --> 01:44:44,371
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1273
01:44:44,412 --> 01:44:46,706
EMMA: Oh, my God.

1274
01:44:46,748 --> 01:44:48,208
That was you?

1275
01:44:49,209 --> 01:44:51,670
SIMON: That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1276
01:44:52,754 --> 01:44:55,340
I thought you were
some old biddy…

1277
01:44:55,382 --> 01:44:58,760
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1278
01:44:58,802 --> 01:45:01,721
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1279
01:45:01,763 --> 01:45:02,889
EMMA: I am?

1280
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:05,851
SIMON: Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1281
01:45:12,315 --> 01:45:13,441
- Emma.
- Yeah?

1282
01:45:13,483 --> 01:45:15,235
My life is very strange.

1283
01:45:16,194 --> 01:45:17,529
I just…

1284
01:45:21,491 --> 01:45:23,660
I don't do anything normal.

1285
01:45:23,702 --> 01:45:25,245
I'm… I can't even…

1286
01:45:25,287 --> 01:45:28,748
I know. I know you.

1287
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:32,377
I know your life.

1288
01:45:32,419 --> 01:45:35,046
- What do you want?
- I want you.

1289
01:45:35,088 --> 01:45:37,132
For how long?

1290
01:45:37,174 --> 01:45:39,176
It doesn't matter.

1291
01:45:46,099 --> 01:45:47,809
Tell me you love me.

1292
01:45:49,728 --> 01:45:51,396
I… I love you.

1293
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,648
Simon.

1294
01:45:55,108 --> 01:45:57,319
I love you, Simon.

1295
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,614
Miracle three.

1296
01:46:24,137 --> 01:46:26,139
EMMA: Dear Simon…

1297
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:29,559
the pin is something
I've kept for years.

1298
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:33,021
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1299
01:46:33,063 --> 01:46:35,607
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1300
01:46:35,649 --> 01:46:38,109
I just wanted you
to have something of mine…

1301
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:40,278
something I loved.

1302
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,198
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles…

1303
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,992
then I'd say you've made it,
my love…

1304
01:46:46,034 --> 01:46:48,203
and so I hope you'll understand.

1305
01:46:48,245 --> 01:46:51,831
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1306
01:46:51,873 --> 01:46:55,210
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1307
01:46:55,252 --> 01:46:58,129
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again…

1308
01:46:58,171 --> 01:47:02,007
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1309
01:47:02,008 --> 01:47:07,180
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1310
01:47:07,222 --> 01:47:10,475
If you think giving away
everything before the world…

1311
01:47:10,517 --> 01:47:12,853
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune…

1312
01:47:12,894 --> 01:47:16,690
will accomplish anything…
you're absolutely right.

1313
01:47:19,526 --> 01:47:21,486
Simon, what are you doing here?

1314
01:47:21,528 --> 01:47:23,989
There are police.

1315
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:25,490
They're everywhere.

1316
01:47:25,532 --> 01:47:27,868
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1317
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:30,954
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

1318
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:36,084
You better go.

1319
01:47:50,015 --> 01:47:51,349
How will I find you?

1320
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,351
[GIGGLES]

1321
01:47:53,393 --> 01:47:56,229
I'll find you. You found me.

[APPLAUSE]

1323
01:48:23,381 --> 01:48:26,468
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction…

1324
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:31,056
after last week's
Moscow fireworks…

1325
01:48:31,097 --> 01:48:35,519
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1326
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,439
SIMON: Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1327
01:48:39,481 --> 01:48:42,484
No.

1328
01:48:42,526 --> 01:48:44,319
CHAIRMAN: Dr. Russell?

1329
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:56,288
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1330
01:48:56,289 --> 01:48:57,958
EMMA:
Thank you. Good morning.

1331
01:48:57,999 --> 01:48:59,501
INSPECTOR: No.

1332
01:48:59,543 --> 01:49:03,755
We all know cold fusion
has had a…

1333
01:49:03,797 --> 01:49:06,758
a difficult childhood.

1334
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,427
Those of us in the field
are orphans…

1335
01:49:09,469 --> 01:49:11,429
bastards, at best.

1336
01:49:11,471 --> 01:49:16,601
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1337
01:49:18,103 --> 01:49:20,438
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion…

1338
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,149
SIMON: I'm her biggest fan.

1339
01:49:23,191 --> 01:49:26,026
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1340
01:49:26,027 --> 01:49:27,194
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel…

1341
01:49:27,195 --> 01:49:29,072
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel…

1342
01:49:29,114 --> 01:49:32,868
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative…

1343
01:49:32,909 --> 01:49:37,163
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly…

1344
01:49:37,205 --> 01:49:38,331
becoming a reality.

1345
01:49:38,373 --> 01:49:41,877
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn…

1346
01:49:41,918 --> 01:49:43,879
SIMON: Look at the time.
Got to go.

1347
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,549
EMMA: …stabilize its power,
but with your help…

1348
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:50,594
we can all work towards
making the… the…

and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

Light a candle.

1371
01:51:20,809 --> 01:51:23,310
Lay flowers at the door…

1372
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:26,106
for those who're left behind…

1373
01:51:26,147 --> 01:51:29,109
and the ones who've gone before.

1374
01:51:29,192 --> 01:51:31,361
Here it comes now…

1375
01:51:31,403 --> 01:51:34,656
sure as silence follows rain…

1376
01:51:34,698 --> 01:51:37,659
the taste of you upon my lips…

1377
01:51:37,701 --> 01:51:40,078
the fingers in my brain.

1378
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,455
Ever gentle…

1379
01:51:42,497 --> 01:51:46,334
as it kills me where I lay…

1380
01:51:46,376 --> 01:51:48,962
who am I to resist?

1381
01:51:49,045 --> 01:51:51,464
Who are you to fail?

1382
01:51:51,506 --> 01:51:55,594
Got to get you out of my mind…

1383
01:51:56,845 --> 01:52:01,433
but I can't escape
from the feeling…

1384
01:52:01,474 --> 01:52:06,438
as I try to leave
the memory behind.

1385
01:52:07,981 --> 01:52:12,694
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1386
01:52:24,831 --> 01:52:27,334
I'm so sorry…

1387
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:30,377
for the way it had to go.

1388
01:52:30,378 --> 01:52:32,881
Now I feel your presence…

1389
01:52:32,923 --> 01:52:35,759
in a way I could not know…

1390
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,928
and I wonder…

1391
01:52:37,969 --> 01:52:41,556
do you ever feel the same?

1392
01:52:41,598 --> 01:52:43,850
In the spilling darkness…

1393
01:52:43,892 --> 01:52:47,270
do you ever hear my name?

1394
01:52:47,312 --> 01:52:51,358
Got to get you out of my mind…

1395
01:52:52,567 --> 01:52:57,030
but I can't escape
from the feeling…

1396
01:52:57,072 --> 01:52:58,405
as I…

1397
01:52:58,406 --> 01:53:02,244
try to leave the memory behind.

1398
01:53:03,578 --> 01:53:08,124
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1399
01:53:15,173 --> 01:53:19,928
Deep in the back of your mind…

1400
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:31,231
Deep in the back of your mind…

1401
01:53:35,569 --> 01:53:38,071
And how could you dare…

1402
01:53:38,113 --> 01:53:41,408
to come so close…

1403
01:53:41,449 --> 01:53:44,786
when you're just a ghost to me?

1404
01:53:47,122 --> 01:53:52,460
And I've got to get you
out of my mind…

1405
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:58,258
but I can't escape
from the feeling…

1406
01:53:58,341 --> 01:53:59,593
as I…

1407
01:53:59,634 --> 01:54:03,305
try to leave the memory behind.

1408
01:54:04,764 --> 01:54:09,269
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1409
01:54:16,234 --> 01:54:20,822
Here in the back of your mind…

1410
01:54:26,828 --> 01:54:28,830
[BALLAD BEGINS]

1411
01:54:36,546 --> 01:54:39,341
CRYSTAL: [SINGING]
It's just black-and-white…

1412
01:54:39,382 --> 01:54:40,884
or color.

1413
01:54:45,013 --> 01:54:47,599
Those postcards…

1414
01:54:47,641 --> 01:54:49,392
sent from heaven…

1415
01:54:53,104 --> 01:54:55,565
says, "Make the most…

1416
01:54:55,607 --> 01:54:58,360
"of never-never."

1417
01:54:58,401 --> 01:55:01,655
Horizon starts right here.

1418
01:55:03,073 --> 01:55:07,077
The future's always near…

1419
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:08,286
and I…

1420
01:55:11,414 --> 01:55:13,542
I know this time…

1421
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:15,836
is borrowed.

1422
01:55:15,877 --> 01:55:20,090
I try to remember
and forget my sorrow…

1423
01:55:23,426 --> 01:55:25,428
celluloid…

1424
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:27,180
monochrome…

1425
01:55:27,222 --> 01:55:28,765
or color.

1426
01:55:32,561 --> 01:55:36,147
Don't want to end in tears.

1427
01:55:41,069 --> 01:55:45,740
I'll leave before
my fears are found.

1428
01:55:45,782 --> 01:55:48,535
Scared to love…

1429
01:55:48,577 --> 01:55:51,121
wasted knowledge…

1430
01:55:51,162 --> 01:55:52,831
into the brink…

1431
01:55:56,459 --> 01:55:58,419
these four walls…

1432
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,589
are lost forever.

1433
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:02,757
I will never…

1434
01:56:02,799 --> 01:56:05,051
be that clever.
