about this?

356
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,517

his partner got hit,

Well, check

He's far too unstable.

395

that he has a temper.

any idea what we'd be
putting him through?

emotionally balanced.

Now watch Alex.

The software
assesses the threat,
just like the robot.

to the brain.

the information and
decides what to do with it

based on his emotional
cognitive abilities

720

to the AI module and...

depends on it

742
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,376
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

743
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,628
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

744

out of my mouth.

We have

I said go!

1716
01:49:30,983 --> 01:49:34,987
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1717
01:49:35,154 --> 01:49:39,283
Some of you even believe
that the use of these
drones overseas

1718
01:49:39,366 --> 01:49:44,037
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists

1719
01:49:44,121 --> 01:49:46,874

were trying to escape.

America is now

1723
01:49:56,884 --> 01:49:59,178
and always will be

1724
01:49:59,261 --> 01:50:03,682
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1726

Good night.
