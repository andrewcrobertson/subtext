00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,846
I'm fighting, I don't wanna like it but you know I like it

But you know I like it, like it, like it, like it

7
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,422
Used to always think I was bullet proof

8
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:28,230
But you got an AK and you're blowing through

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,022
Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it

I want you to know it, know it, know it, know it

11
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,541
All of them other boys can walk away

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:43,370
They ain't even in the game

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,501

14
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,814

Everybody wants what I got with you

26
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,608
'Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view

27
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:28,556
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million

28
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm one in a million, million, million

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,152
I ain't even here, I'm in outer space

30
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,974
Like I'm Venus, you're Mars in the Milky Way
