73
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:35,756
Navid.

74
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,174
Get away from the window.

75
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,343
Mom, they're here. 
They're coming.

76
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,179
Come here. Come here right now.

77
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,347
Arash.

78
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,391
Navid, you stay with your mom 
and sisters.

79
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,784
- But he's just a kid.
- Sayeh!

80
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,686
Stay here with your mom 
and the kids.

81
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,897
- What do you think you're doing?
- You heard me.

82
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:54,524
Arash, please don't go. 
Don't do this.

83
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,779
Navid, my dear. 
Come back here.

84
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:00,989
Navid.

85
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,532
Shut the door.

86
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,535
We're not here to kill any of them.

87
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,037
Got it?

88
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:10,248
The goal is to die on television.

89
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,349
Let's go.

97
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,580
Don't make a move before I say.

98
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,791
I wanna make sure they're recording.

99
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:53,950
Yes.

100
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:54,626
Yes. Yes.

101
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:55,836
We're ready.

108
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:31,538
Navid, it's dangerous here.

109
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:32,372
Come away. Come...

110
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:33,874
Navid, where are you going?

111
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,835
Look at me, Navid. Navid!

112
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,295
What are you looking for? Navid!

113
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,881
Navid! Navid! 
What are you...

114
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,340
Navid, don't go! Navid!
