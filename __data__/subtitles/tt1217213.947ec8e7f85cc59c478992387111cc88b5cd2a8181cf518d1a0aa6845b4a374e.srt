1
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:55,122
If you had wings to lift you
and the Second Star your guide,

2
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,928
you'd find a place where
all the seasons flourish side by side.

3
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,532
Yet past the Summer Meadow
and beyond the Autumn Wood,

4
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:11,471
lies an icy land of secrets,
a world misunderstood.

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,911
But if your mind is open
and your heart just has to know,

6
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,517
your wings can take you farther
than you ever thought you'd go.

7
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,728
We'll be there
at the first breath of spring

8
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,832
When the birds start to sing
and the grass starts growing

9
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,535
We'll be there
in the still summer heat

10
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,172
With the meadow's gleaming gold

11
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,542
We'll be there
on the crisp autumn days

12
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,746
With the leaves all ablaze
in the cool breeze blowing

13
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,549
We'll be there for it all every year

14
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,319
As we've been since days of old

15
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:05,859
For what if the world is wider
than we ever knew?

16
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:13,166
And through all the seasons
didn't we dream of something more?

17
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,971
What if we brave the great unknown?

18
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,441
What if we're not so all alone?

19
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:27,581
What if it's you I'm searching for?

20
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,518
Look sharp, everyone!

21
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,554
The snowy owls will soon be arriving

22
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,790
to take the snowflake baskets
to the Winter Woods.

23
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,527
Lucinda, stop noodling
and start tinkering.

24
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,034
Is that the last load?

25
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,369
Thanks, Cheese.

26
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,006
Basket weaving
is my favorite thing, Bobble.

27
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:54,942
Really? I'm partial to macramÃ©.

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,777
Morning, Clank. Morning, Bobble.

29
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,878
Morning!

30
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,480
That should be enough
to finish the snowflake baskets.

31
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,882
Aye, that will do her.

32
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,950
Thanks!

33
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,018
Clanky.

34
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,320
Sorry.

35
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,188
I can't believe we make the baskets,

36
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,691
but don't get to take them
to the Winter Fairies.

37
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,527
I mean, wouldn't you want to
go into the Winter Woods?

38
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,931
We wouldn't last a day in that cold.

39
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,767
Besides, I'm afraid of glaciers.

40
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,002
Glaciers?

41
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,438
They're known for their stealth.

42
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,473
He's never actually seen one.

43
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,975
You never do!

44
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,411
The snowy owls!

45
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,082
Places, everyone!

46
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,984
Clank, Bobble, get that basket up.

47
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,785
Right! Got it, Fairy Mary!

48
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,987
Start the pulley!

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,048
Newcomer.

50
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,864
Wow.

51
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,933
The final shipment order.

52
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,804
Goodness! They need 20 more baskets
for tomorrow's pickup.

53
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,223
There's a whole other world over there.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,560
Well done, everyone!
The first shipment is headed for Winter.

55
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,896
But there's much more to do
for tomorrow's pickup,

56
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,799
so this is no time to rest on your laurels.

57
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,935
Lucinda, get off your laurel
and get to work.

58
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,674
Look out!

59
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,045
Runaway bunny!

60
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,851
No!

61
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,188
-Got you!
-Thanks, Tink.

62
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,689
No problem, Fawn.

63
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:26,260
Come on, little guy.
It's still a long way to the Winter Woods.

64
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,462
You're taking the animals today?

65
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,596
Trying to.

66
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,565
It's time for them to cross the border,

67
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,867
but this little guy is a handful.

68
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,470
Hey, how about if I help?

69
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,440
Slow down! Slow down!

70
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,210
-Need some help?
-Nope. Doing fine.

71
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,012
That lost thing really is handy.

72
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,079
Yeah.

73
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,348
Heel, Hoppy, heel! Slow down!

74
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,358
Wow.

75
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,162
Don't be scared, little fellow.

76
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,464
We'll let the weasels go first.

77
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,969
Come on. Come on. Come on!

78
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,106
So, how far do we take the animals in?

79
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,742
Tink, we don't cross the border.

80
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,277
We just help the animals cross.

81
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:21,415
But I thought Animal Fairies
got to cross with the animals.

82
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,417
Tink, it's freezing over there.

83
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,386
Besides, no Warm Fairies
are allowed in the Winter Woods.

84
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,922
Just like Winter Fairies
aren't allowed over here.

85
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,892
Who made up that rule?

86
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,795
I think it was the Lord of Winter.

87
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,063
Winter has a lord?

88
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,065
All right, guys. You ready?

89
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,043
-Wow.
-Pretty great, huh?

90
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,881
It's incredible.

91
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,617
They get their winter coats
to protect them from the cold.

92
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,654
Your turn. Go on.

93
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,230
Go on, now. Follow your brothers.

94
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,517
Bye-bye!

95
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,419
All right, big guy.

96
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,221
Oh, no.

97
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,692
No hibernating yet.
You do that in Winter!

98
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,728
Come on. Come on!

99
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,299
Wake up. Wake up.

100
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,368
Come on.

101
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,237
Wake up.

102
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,139
Rise and shine.

103
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,054
Tink!

104
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,224
Tink!

105
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,692
-Tinker Bell!
-What?

106
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,635
Tink! I told you,
we're not allowed to cross.

107
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,838
Your wings.

108
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,239
I know!

109
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,807
They were sparkling.

110
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,409
They're freezing!

111
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,244
We'd better get you
to a Healing Talent Fairy.

112
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,512
-But...
-Come on.

113
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:12,853
May I help you?

114
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,087
How much longer?

115
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,891
I told you,
a rainbow collision is not an emergency.

116
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,327
But the purple's starting to itch.

117
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,795
Take a seat.

118
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,570
Snapdragon, right?

119
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,439
Not an emergency. Plant it over there.

120
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,507
Thank you.

121
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,876
Hurry, girls. What if we're too late?

122
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:39,446
-Sorry. Do you know...
-Window.

123
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,188
Patient's name?

124
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,623
Tinker Bell.

125
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,092
Yes. The border crosser. She's...

126
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,627
Frozen solid?

127
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,896
-Room two.
-Oh, my.

128
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,197
Thank you.

129
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,999
-This way!
-Come on, girls. Hurry.

130
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,534
She's right over here. Room two.

131
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,935
-There she is.
-Tink!

132
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,338
We got here as quick as we could.

133
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,006
We did have to stop at reception.

134
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,207
Did you really cross?

135
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,177
Well, did you?

136
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,122
Okay. You're all warmed up.
Let's test your wings.

137
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,323
Sure.

138
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,391
Open.

139
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,326
Close.

140
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,462
And try a little flap.

141
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,497
A flutter.

142
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,833
Can you give me a flitter?

143
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,671
Okay. Well, I don't see anything
unusual. Your wings appear to be fine.

144
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,409
But what about the sparkling?

145
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,444
It must have been the light
reflecting off the snow.

146
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,512
-But...
-You should have never

147
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,580
crossed the border.

148
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,283
Winter is too cold
for our Warm Fairy wings.

149
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,352
Now, to be safe,
I want you to take two sunflower seeds

150
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,955
and come back if there is any problem.

151
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,491
Thank you.

152
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,359
We were worried, Tink.

153
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,728
You are so lucky
nothing happened to your wings.

154
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,197
Can you imagine?

155
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,200
But something did happen.
They sparkled!

156
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,469
But you heard her. It was just the light
reflecting off the snow.

157
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,840
No, it wasn't. They actually lit up.

158
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,443
It was brighter than a thousand fireflies.

159
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,146
You saw it. Didn't you, Fawn?

160
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,480
No.

161
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,884
You don't believe me?

162
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,452
Who...

163
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,020
No?

164
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:31,291
Look, you guys, it happened.
It felt like...

165
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,293
-Like...
-Like what?

166
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:38,332
Like the Winter Woods was calling me.

167
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,400
You know?

168
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,440
Not really. Get the doctor.

169
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,545
Animal Fairy Books,
101 Uses for Pixie Dust,

170
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,247
Beauty and the Bees...

171
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,382
There's got to be a wing book
here somewhere.

172
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,852
Rules for Rainbow Riding.  No, not that.

173
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,156
Hey. Someone's been eating the books!

174
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,926
Bookworms.

175
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,629
What's this?

176
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,331
Light reading.

177
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,268
Dustology, windology...

178
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,871
Wingology. That's got to have it.

179
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,682
Got you!

180
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,852
Sorry.

181
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,290
Okay, let's see.

182
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,458
Wing care. Wing washing. Wing tips.

183
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,861
"Don't get them wet."
Everybody knows that.

184
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,531
Sizes, shapes, flapping, fluttering.

185
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,867
Sparkling! I knew it!

186
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,339
Sorry. Found it!

187
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,176
Oh, no.

188
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,580
Thanks a lot.

189
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,085
Okay.

190
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:09,756
"Sparkling wings.
When a most incredible...

191
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,226
"...that the sparkle... There were two."

192
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,863
"That the sparkle... There were two."

193
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:20,334
Two wings? Two feet? Two what?

194
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,807
-Yes?
-Hey.

195
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,977
Do you know anything
about sparkling wings?

196
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,080
No. The bookworm ate that page.

197
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,748
Yeah, I know.

198
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,750
But the Keeper does.

199
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,852
The Keeper? Who's the Keeper?

200
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,655
He writes the books.

201
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:44,458
He is the keeper of all fairy knowledge.

202
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,661
That's perfect. Is he here?
I have to talk to him.

203
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:52,633
I would give anything to talk to him.
But you can't.

204
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,401
Why not?

205
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,802
Because he's a Winter Fairy.

206
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,973
In order to talk to him, you would have
to go to the Winter Woods.

207
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,343
And that's impossible.
Your wings will freeze and...

208
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,013
Chapter 16.

209
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,417
The Winter Woods.

210
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,599
Can't fly.

211
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:03,937
Hurry, now, hurry! Let's finish up.
Stand by with the pulley.

212
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:09,309
All right! It's this season's final pickup,
so let's make it our best.

213
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,281
Lucinda, let's leave the loafing
for the Baking Fairies.

214
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,750
-Okay, Clanky.
-Right!

215
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,387
Snowflake release system working!

216
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,957
Maybe you should
be the test snowflake for a while.

217
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,292
Tink?

218
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,261
We already checked that basket.

219
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,363
Right.

220
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,569
Why are you dressed all cozy?

221
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,038
I'm going to the Winter Woods.

222
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,140
The Winter Woods?

223
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:42,843
The Winter Woods?

224
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,011
Places, everyone!

225
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,445
The snowy owls. They're here!

226
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,881
Start the pulley!

227
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,049
Bye!

228
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,150
But, Miss...

229
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,387
Tink! Wait!

230
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,490
You can't cross the border, Miss Bell.
Your wings!

231
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:58,425
Don't worry. They're in my coat.

232
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,327
Does this have to do with the...

233
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,730
-The sparkling?
-Yes.

234
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,999
There's somebody in Winter
who can tell me what it means.

235
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,203
Clank! Bobble!
Is something wrong with that basket?

236
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,537
What?

237
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,108
Tink?

238
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,910
I just have to do this.

239
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,148
No, no. Everything is fine.

240
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:25,085
We're just sad to see it go.
Pretty basket.

241
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:28,088
Honestly. Let it go!

242
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,766
That's the new one.

243
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,835
New one?

244
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,833
Excellent work, everyone.
They're off to the cold of winter.

245
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,002
Well, that's that until next year.

246
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,590
Wow. I made it.

247
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,893
Welcome back.

248
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,828
A Winter Fairy.

249
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,264
You ready for the drop-off?

250
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,300
Come on. You did it yesterday.
You'll be fine.

251
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,270
All right then. Here we go.

252
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,039
Look out!

253
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,514
Sorry about that.

254
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:12,786
Oh, no.

255
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:32,639
Lord Milori.

256
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,110
And what happened here?

257
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,648
A bit of a bumpy landing.
It's only his second drop-off.

258
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,385
As long as the basket made it,
I'd say he did just fine.

259
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,354
How was the crossing?

260
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,790
Four bunnies,
two weasels, and a marmot.

261
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,924
And they all crossed safely.

262
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:53,794
Yes. I met up with them
on the north side.

263
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,464
The snowflakes
are looking quite beautiful.

264
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,433
No two alike.

265
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,905
No, no, no.

266
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,074
Ambitious.

267
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,279
Now that is odd.

268
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,517
It must have been left
in the basket by accident.

269
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:18,719
Return this to the Keeper.

270
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,853
The Keeper.

271
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,323
He can send it back to the Warm Side
with his next delivery.

272
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:43,310
It must have come from the Warm Side.
In one of the baskets.

273
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:44,945
Thanks.

274
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,216
That's the end of that chapter.

275
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:24,718
Boy, that's a beauty.

276
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,688
Flora and Fauna of the Fairies.

277
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:33,193
Put a period there,
then we are pretty much done.

278
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:37,197
Wait. I forgot to number the pages.

279
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,701
I'm going to have to start all over
on this large book.

280
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,202
-Keeper. Keeper!
-Yes, what...

281
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,705
The most amazing thing happened.
You'll never believe it.

282
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,373
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

283
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,641
I've never felt anything like it!

284
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,711
My friends didn't believe me,
but how could they because it's so...

285
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:53,313
Slow down. I can only listen so fast.

286
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,649
Yesterday, at the border, my wings.

287
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,752
They actually... They lit up.

288
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,154
It's happening again!

289
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,895
Well, I'll be a yeti's uncle.

290
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,781
In all my years.

291
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:36,957
Your wings. They're sparkling.

292
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,359
Like yours.

293
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,596
I've written about the sparkling,

294
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,999
but I've never seen the sparkling
with my own peepers!

295
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,571
Follow me.

296
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,144
Now, step the footsies on the snowflake.

297
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,367
Just put your wings into the light.

298
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:39,453
The mainland.

299
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:07,848
Oh, no.

300
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,260
Hello?

301
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:54,761
Hello.

302
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:57,264
Hello?

303
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,807
Two fairies born of the same laugh.

304
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:10,077
So that means...

305
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:11,545
You're my...

306
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:13,413
So we're

307
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,550
sisters.

308
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,888
Yes! And your wings are identical.

309
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,823
That is why they sparkle.

310
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,767
Jingles!

311
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,006
Oh, boy. Maybe you shouldn't do that.

312
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:43,477
I'm Tinker Bell.

313
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,245
I'm Periwinkle.

314
00:25:45,512 --> 00:25:47,281
So you must have been at the border.

315
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,583
Yeah. I was hoping to see
the animals cross.

316
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,151
I guess I didn't see you.

317
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,387
Me either.

318
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:55,923
What?

319
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,061
I usually just wear them at home.

320
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,598
-Wow.
-Hello.

321
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,800
Keeper, are you in?

322
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,936
Yumping yetis, Lord Milori!

323
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,437
If he sees you, he'll send you back.

324
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,773
Keeper? Are you here?

325
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,175
Don't worry.
I'm going to take care of this.

326
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,010
Where are you?

327
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:20,614
Come back later!

328
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,049
Keeper?

329
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,384
Whoa, boy. Can't get that one back.

330
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:26,019
I need to speak with you.

331
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,621
It's important.

332
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,657
I'll be right back.

333
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,928
I'm right here, Lord Milori.

334
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:36,563
Did you receive that wing book?

335
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,465
You know, once upon a time,

336
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:41,802
you'd stop by just to say hello
and howdy-do.

337
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,505
I'm sorry. Hello.

338
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,173
Howdy-do?

339
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,575
Howdy-do.

340
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:53,113
This book has me worried.
What if a Warm Fairy brought it here?

341
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:57,951
Well, that might be nice,
then, meeting a Warm Fairy.

342
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,754
Especially one
with such good taste in books.

343
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,356
It's too cold.

344
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,591
Maybe if they were wearing a coat,

345
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:06,660
or one of them little sweater vests.

346
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,028
-They're nice.
-I'll remind you.

347
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,963
Crossing the border is forbidden.

348
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,732
There was a time when it wasn't.

349
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:15,536
The rule is there to keep
the fairies safe. That will never change.

350
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,603
But I...

351
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,141
If a Warm Fairy comes here,
you will send them back.

352
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,710
Of course.

353
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,347
Thank you.

354
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:37,324
Well, you heard the Lord Milori.

355
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,460
He said you must go back home.

356
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,497
Of course, he didn't say when.

357
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:47,734
Now, listen, you two,
it gets colder after the dark,

358
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:51,004
so it's best to get Tinker Bell
home before the first moonlight.

359
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,639
Thank you, Dewey.

360
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:53,774
Dewey?

361
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:56,043
That's his real name.

362
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,512
It's what my friends call me.

363
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,515
Thank you.

364
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:02,950
Dewey.

365
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,219
Dewey.

366
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:09,289
So, I'm a Frost Fairy. I frost things.

367
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,159
-I'm a Tinker. I...
-Tinker things?

368
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,294
Yep. I even made this coat.

369
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,863
-I like it.
-Thanks.

370
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:16,997
You're welcome.

371
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:18,131
Sisters.

372
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:22,569
It's amazing. The dust travels
all the way from the Pixie Dust Tree.

373
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,037
Kind of like you did.

374
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,240
...Terence and I
barely escaped the pirate ship!

375
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,308
Is he your boyfriend?

376
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,711
So Lizzy loves fairies?

377
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,146
Yeah. She even built a fairy house.

378
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,516
That's how I met her.
You see, me and Vidia...

379
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:43,223
You collect lost things, too?

380
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,158
I call them found things.

381
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:49,530
I never knew I lost you
till I found you

382
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:56,937
And you'd never guess
how close you are to me

383
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,808
Now I want to
throw my arms around you

384
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:05,345
Tell a thousand tales
that will astound you

385
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:10,751
Everything about you
tells me this was meant to be

386
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:15,222
Don't you see?
I'm on your side

387
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,159
Let's take this ride

388
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:22,829
And together we're facing the world

389
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:26,266
Doing things nobody's done before

390
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,736
And the great divide

391
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:33,207
Doesn't seem so wide

392
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,508
Anymore

393
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:35,909
This is the Frost Forest.

394
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,711
Wow.

395
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,912
That's Gliss.

396
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,851
Come on, Spike. Practice.

397
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,354
Okay, okay. Practicing.

398
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:50,591
And that's Spike. She's a bit...

399
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:59,266
-Hi.
-Sisters?

400
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,435
Well, I think it's fantastic!

401
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:05,072
Wow, you two look exactly alike!

402
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,976
I mean, except for your clothes
and your hair and Peri's a bit more pale.

403
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:11,044
But your noses are very similar.

404
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,948
Forget their noses.
She's a Warm Fairy. In Winter!

405
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:18,385
You're right.
We got to show her around!

406
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,289
Let's take her ice sliding!
Come on, Spike!

407
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:23,824
You are going to love this!

408
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,158
It sounds fun.

409
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:28,195
Yeah. Great idea.
Push the Warm Fairy down a hill of ice.

410
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:31,198
Okay, well, wait for me, you guys.

411
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:37,771
And if you'll be there
beside me when I falter

412
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,642
Then whatever comes I know
we'll take it all in stride

413
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:45,012
Ready, set, slide!

414
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,615
I'm on your side

415
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,285
I'm on your side

416
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,755
Let's take this ride

417
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:58,825
And together
we're facing the world

418
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:02,296
Doing things
nobody's done before

419
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,766
And the great divide

420
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:09,436
Doesn't seem so wide

421
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,637
Anymore

422
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,643
I know. Favorite star?

423
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,811
Second star

424
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:18,946
-to the right.
-To the right.

425
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,583
Okay. Favorite drink?

426
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:24,084
Hot chamomile tea.

427
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,686
Iced chamomile tea!

428
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,290
Okay, my turn. How about favorite bug?

429
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:33,060
Bug? It's too cold for bugs over here,

430
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:35,996
but in one of Dewey's books,
I read about butterflies.

431
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:39,199
In Butterfly Cove,
there's hundreds of them.

432
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:41,368
It's in Summer. It's right over...

433
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,073
I guess you can't see it from here.

434
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,276
No. You can't.

435
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,612
What's it like over there?

436
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:52,713
Warm.

437
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,082
And the colors? The sounds?

438
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:57,217
All the animals. And the fish.

439
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,719
They swim in melted ice, right?

440
00:31:58,785 --> 00:31:59,920
Water.

441
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,856
I wish...

442
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,726
I wish I could go there.

443
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,999
-Peri?
-Yeah?

444
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:20,040
I made it warmer over here.
Maybe I could make it colder over there.

445
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:21,642
Are you...

446
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,644
Are you saying I could cross?

447
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,547
-Yeah!
-Oh, Tink.

448
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:28,582
You could show me your world.

449
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,717
I could meet your friends.

450
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,319
Do you think I could see a butterfly?

451
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,254
There's a pretty good chance.

452
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,061
Tink?

453
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,266
-I can't fly!
-Tink!

454
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,269
Hold on. Hold on!

455
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,239
I'm slipping!

456
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,479
That's it, Fiona. That's it.

457
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:02,549
Are you girls all right?

458
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,685
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

459
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,255
Are you sure? Nothing broken?
Nothing bruised?

460
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:10,891
No. We're okay.

461
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:13,160
This time.

462
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:15,562
Lord Milori was right.

463
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:19,233
Crossing the border
is just too dangerous.

464
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,435
What are you saying?

465
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,070
I'm sorry, girls,

466
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:27,741
but I'm afraid this isn't going to work out
like you hoped.

467
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:30,277
We have to take Tinker Bell home.

468
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:36,717
Let's go, Fiona.

469
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:53,901
It's...

470
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,802
It's for your own good.

471
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,967
I can't watch, Fiona.

472
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:31,638
I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

473
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:34,608
Okay. Here's the plan.
Meet me here tomorrow.

474
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,777
Thank goodness. I thought
you were really saying goodbye.

475
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,947
No! I just met my sister
I never knew I had

476
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:42,916
and I'm going to say goodbye forever?
Are you kidding?

477
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:44,184
So...

478
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:49,523
Clank? Bobble?

479
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,060
Guys?

480
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,038
Oopsie.

481
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:07,541
Tink! You're back!

482
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,744
-Yes.
-Sorry!

483
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,180
We thought you were a troll.

484
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:14,248
A troll?

485
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,149
I knew we shouldn't have used
the troll stopper.

486
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:17,784
What if it was a troll?

487
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,620
You'd be saying something different,
wouldn't you?

488
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:21,154
Guys. It doesn't matter.

489
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,589
Oh, right.

490
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,091
I need your help.

491
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:25,926
Is it about a glacier?

492
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,930
No. But it's kind of a secret.

493
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:31,865
I don't want everybody to know.

494
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:38,405
I'm pretty sure these buttons will work,
but we're going to need more of them.

495
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:41,308
Aye, unless we use
a couple of acorn caps.

496
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,943
Right! Good idea.

497
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,279
Now where is that Clanky?

498
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,648
Yes, I'm right here.

499
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:52,119
I didn't tell everybody.

500
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:56,723
Just Fawn, Ro, Sil, Dess, and Vidia.

501
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:00,160
So, there's another you.

502
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,095
-Vidia!
-Yeah.

503
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,530
I've got a sister.

504
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,499
I told you!

505
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:06,733
Bust my bonnet.

506
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,669
-Amazing!
-It's fantastic!

507
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:09,937
I can't believe this is happening.

508
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,038
But how?

509
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,807
They were born of the same laugh!

510
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,777
Tell them, Tink,
what you told me and Bobble.

511
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:19,479
Her name's Periwinkle.

512
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:23,517
She's a Frost Fairy,
and she's just amazing.

513
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:26,119
I'm making this machine
so she can come here and meet you all,

514
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,522
and after that
we'll go straight to Queen Clarion!

515
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,626
Have you thought this through?

516
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:36,296
"Hi, Queen Clarion. Meet the Winter
Fairy I smuggled over the border."

517
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,731
Vidia!

518
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,833
When Queen Clarion
hears how we found each other,

519
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,068
and that we're sisters,

520
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:43,003
she will change Lord Milori's rule.

521
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,838
Of course she will.

522
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,573
She'd never want you to be apart.

523
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,409
It's like you found the perfect lost thing.

524
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,546
And I'm never going to lose her.

525
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,414
Well, then, let's get to work!

526
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,916
Just tell us what to do.

527
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:56,984
Great!

528
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,785
Okay. We need to place
that wheel right here.

529
00:36:58,886 --> 00:36:59,887
Got you, Tink.

530
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:01,855
And let's get that
propped up over there.

531
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,257
I feel so tinkery.

532
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,858
-Clank, Bobble...
-Wait, wait.

533
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:05,993
Finish up the chassis?

534
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,261
Exactly.

535
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,029
-Come on, Clanky!
-Bobble!

536
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:13,267
Perhaps you and I are brothers!
It's possible.

537
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,369
We look almost exactly alike.

538
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:25,746
Anyone see you?

539
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:27,047
No.

540
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,715
I can't believe we're doing this!

541
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,818
So, did you bring it?

542
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:33,820
Yes.

543
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,190
Watch the branch.

544
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:40,093
Careful. More to the right.

545
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,431
For the record, we shouldn't be doing
this, whatever it is we're doing.

546
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,735
As ordered. One big block of ice.

547
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,438
Courtesy of our resident glacier fairy.

548
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:53,073
Hey.

549
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,608
So, what do you think?

550
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:55,909
It's perfect!

551
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:01,448
Are you sure
she's not luring you into a trap?

552
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:15,128
It's one of those...

553
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,997
Things we shouldn't be doing?

554
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:18,899
It's a snowmaker!

555
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,902
It makes snow!

556
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:25,806
Yep, this is your ticket
to the warm side of Pixie Hollow.

557
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,374
Wait a second.

558
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:30,277
This is crazy!
You don't even know if this thing works!

559
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:32,145
It works, all right.

560
00:38:32,212 --> 00:38:34,281
Aye, we made it ourselves.

561
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,784
Of course you did. Just walk away.

562
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,354
How does it work?

563
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,522
Guys?

564
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:43,490
Pull.

565
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,425
Move this around here.

566
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,532
You might want to
step aside for this part.

567
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,103
They're serious.

568
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,222
Snow!

569
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:16,557
Wow.

570
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,793
You did it! You actually did it!

571
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,200
It's cold.

572
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,135
So?

573
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,073
Go, go on.

574
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,808
Live it, man.

575
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:47,221
Welcome, Miss Winkle.

576
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:48,455
Thank you.

577
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:52,259
All righty! Your tour begins
with the Autumn Forest.

578
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:55,562
Next it's a quick stop
in Springtime Square.

579
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:57,998
And finally, the Pixie Dust Tree,

580
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,968
which, as you know,
makes all fairy life possible.

581
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:05,105
Aye, that's where you'll be meeting
her majestiness, the queen.

582
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,573
The queen?

583
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:08,876
They're going to see the queen!

584
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,377
She's very wise.

585
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,312
And if we tell her we're sisters,

586
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:14,281
she'll change Lord Milori's rule.

587
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:15,883
That is so exciting!

588
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,986
Say hi for me, or curtsy,
or whatever it is you do.

589
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:20,187
Sure.

590
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,688
And bring me back an acorn. A big one!

591
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,290
-After you.
-Thank you.

592
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:25,926
Bye!

593
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:31,932
I can't believe I'm going to get an acorn!
Finally! That is so exciting!

594
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,072
Wow.

595
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:48,348
Just when we thought
life couldn't get much better

596
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:55,856
A wish we never knew
we made came true

597
00:40:57,057 --> 00:41:00,260
Worlds that were apart
have come together

598
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,329
-There she is!
-She's so wintery.

599
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,831
We'll be friends
no matter what the weather

600
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:06,233
This is so exciting!

601
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,568
Wait for the signal.

602
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:13,640
Wait until you see the wondrous
things that we can do here with you

603
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:16,176
That's it. Operation Periwinkle in effect.

604
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,714
We're on your side

605
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:24,084
We're on your side

606
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,321
Let's take this ride

607
00:41:27,387 --> 00:41:29,423
Let's take this ride

608
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,929
And together we're facing the world

609
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:39,333
Doing things nobody's done before

610
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:43,237
And the great divide

611
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:45,439
Doesn't seem so wide

612
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,408
Butterflies!

613
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,080
Surprise!

614
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,483
Your friends did all this?

615
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,252
They wanted to surprise you.

616
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:02,422
Everyone, this is Periwinkle, my sister.

617
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:03,657
This is so exciting.

618
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,892
-Oh, wow!
-Can you believe it?

619
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:08,896
Hello. It is nice to meet you.

620
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:12,533
I am Rosetta. This is...

621
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,569
She's a Winter Fairy.
She's not from the moon.

622
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,939
Oh, right. I know, I know.
I'm just so excited!

623
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,807
It's great to meet all of you.

624
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:23,677
This is so remarkable!
You two are sisters!

625
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,913
Yeah. A little fairy-to-fairy advice.

626
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:29,316
Tink can be tricky
to get along with at times.

627
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:31,218
Yeah. Look who's talking.

628
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,387
We can't believe you're over here!

629
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:35,222
So... Are you cold enough?

630
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,324
Yeah. It's perfect.

631
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,163
I nearly forgot.

632
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:48,101
This is for you.
It's called a periwinkle. Also.

633
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,670
Thank you.

634
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,173
I'll keep it forever.

635
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,579
Look at that!

636
00:42:58,645 --> 00:42:59,746
It's frost.

637
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:02,850
She and her friends practice
in the Frost Forest. You should see it!

638
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,185
You should see Tink on ice skates.

639
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,954
She's a natural.

640
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,089
It's only because
you had that lost thing.

641
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,959
-She collects lost things, too?
-Yeah!

642
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:13,493
You guys are so alike.

643
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,561
I know.

644
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:17,564
Even our wings are identical.
That's why they sparkled.

645
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:19,032
-Let's show them.
-I don't feel so...

646
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,267
Periwinkle!

647
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,368
Is she all right?

648
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,170
I think she's getting a little too hot.

649
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,939
My wings, I can't feel them.

650
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,243
I think they're too warm.

651
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,911
Oh, the snowmaker!

652
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:33,080
It's running out of ice!

653
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:34,848
We have to get her back to the border!

654
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,884
Tink, what about the queen?

655
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,252
There's no time.

656
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,954
Clank, grab some ice.
We'll wrap her wings.

657
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,992
Be careful. Gentle. Easy.

658
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,427
Okay. Let's go. Hurry!

659
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:50,063
All together. All together.

660
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,465
All together.

661
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:52,833
Hurry!

662
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:54,902
We can do this!

663
00:43:57,504 --> 00:43:58,672
Hurry!

664
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,374
Go, go, go!

665
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:02,843
Hold on. We're almost there.

666
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,745
Hurry! It's nearly out of ice!

667
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,146
Not much further.

668
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:11,885
Don't worry. We're almost there.

669
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:14,288
We're going to make it.
We're going to make it!

670
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,158
Let me help you.

671
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:23,564
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

672
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:29,837
Please, can you help her?

673
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,208
Tink.

674
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:47,754
Gently. Lift your wings.
Let the cold surround them.

675
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,907
You're okay. Your wings are okay.

676
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:08,709
Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:11,678
This is why we do not cross the border.

678
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:17,251
No, it could've worked!
We just needed a bigger piece of ice!

679
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:20,754
And when that was gone?
Your wings could have broken.

680
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:27,261
But they didn't. I'm fine.
Thanks to them.

681
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:33,534
The rule is there to protect you.
I'm sorry.

682
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,270
You two may never see
each other again.

683
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:38,705
Please don't do this.
We belong together.

684
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:40,174
We're sisters.

685
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:44,378
We were born of the same laugh.

686
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:52,586
All the more reason you should want
to keep each other safe.

687
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,988
Return home.

688
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:01,895
Come on, Tink. Let's go home.

689
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,163
No!

690
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:08,769
Lord Milori,
your rule will not keep us apart.

691
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:09,937
Tinker Bell.

692
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:14,975
This is not Lord Milori's rule. It's mine.

693
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:16,977
Queen Clarion?

694
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:18,946
I'm sorry.

695
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,223
You should get deeper into the cold.

696
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,491
Back to the north side of the mountain.

697
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:12,693
Speaking of sparkling,
we can conclude

698
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:18,332
that it spreads in a spiral
and circles the center.

699
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,647
Hello?

700
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:35,949
Hello?

701
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:43,690
Peri?

702
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,971
Queen Clarion. Why?

703
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:00,674
Tinker Bell.

704
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:04,878
Long ago,
when Pixie Hollow was very young,

705
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,248
two fairies met and fell in love.

706
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,685
One of them was a Winter Fairy...

707
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,055
...and the other
was from the warm seasons.

708
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,725
The two fairies were enchanted
with each other.

709
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:21,595
And every sunset,
they met at the border...

710
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,797
...where Spring touches Winter.

711
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:28,802
But as their love grew stronger,
they wished to be together...

712
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,405
...and share each other's worlds.

713
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,843
So they disregarded the danger
and crossed.

714
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:39,546
One of them broke a wing.

715
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,717
For which there is no cure.

716
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,120
From that day forward,
Queen Clarion decreed

717
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:49,690
that fairies must never again
cross the border.

718
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,327
And I agreed that our two worlds

719
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:56,263
should forever remain apart.

720
00:49:57,764 --> 00:49:59,967
And the two fairies?

721
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,269
What happened to them?

722
00:50:05,572 --> 00:50:07,708
They had to say goodbye.

723
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,132
We saw the snow.

724
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,901
Queen Clarion, something's wrong!

725
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:35,836
The temperature,
it seems to be plummeting!

726
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,671
The hibiscus are halfway to hibernation!

727
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:40,040
Now, now, ministers, let's not panic.

728
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:41,308
Absolutely right.

729
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,776
Snow!

730
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:45,078
Heave!

731
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:46,180
Ho!

732
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:48,215
-Heave!
-Ho!

733
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,883
Put your muscle into it, Clanky!

734
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,418
I'm trying, Bobble!

735
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:54,588
What happened?
How did this get here?

736
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:57,824
We don't know, Miss Bell,
but it's stuck real good!

737
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,794
Aye, and it's making that thing bigger
by the minute!

738
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,698
Guys, down here!

739
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:05,799
-Come on!
-Got it!

740
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,034
Okay, push!

741
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,004
All together. All together!

742
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:14,575
Upsy-daisy.

743
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,111
We did it!

744
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,013
We did it!

745
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,215
It's over.

746
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,517
I don't think it is.

747
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:27,154
Oh, my goodness.

748
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,890
The seasons have
been thrown out of balance.

749
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:31,592
But if the temperatures
continue to drop,

750
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:33,894
it will freeze all of Pixie Hollow.

751
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,867
-Oh, no.
-Queen Clarion, the Pixie Dust Tree.

752
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,971
We must hope
the tree survives the freeze.

753
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:46,874
Otherwise there will
be no more pixie dust.

754
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,878
Life in Pixie Hollow will change forever.

755
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,480
And no fairy will ever fly again.

756
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:57,150
Hurry. We must do everything we can.

757
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,289
Grab as many as you can
and head for the Pixie Dust Tree!

758
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:06,126
Hurry, guys! This way!
Hop to it! That's it!

759
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:13,534
Snug as a bug.

760
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:15,769
Oh, no!

761
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,312
Come on, that's it.

762
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,648
Just a little faster.

763
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:28,982
That's it, fairies.

764
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:32,753
Lay the blankets along the branches,
as many as you can!

765
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:35,589
We must protect the Pixie Dust Tree!

766
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:38,058
-Miss Bell!
-Tink! Do you need any help?

767
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,194
No! This is my last run!

768
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,062
I'll meet you in the tree!

769
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,738
Everybody okay?

770
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:56,376
Great. There you go. Nice and toasty.

771
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,679
You guys just stay here and keep warm.

772
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:02,616
Everything's going to be fine.

773
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,324
It's still alive.

774
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:17,030
Peri.

775
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:19,733
Dewey, you've got to see this.

776
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,902
There must be something wrong
with the Pixie Dust Tree.

777
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,470
Now don't worry...

778
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:25,672
Careful.

779
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:28,275
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

780
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:32,746
Oh, dear.

781
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:47,294
Okay, you might want to worry
just a little bit.

782
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,431
Tink?

783
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,768
Periwinkle!

784
00:54:13,954 --> 00:54:17,090
Tinker Bell! Are you okay?

785
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,326
Why would you fly here?

786
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:20,494
I had to.

787
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:22,462
Your jacket. Put on your jacket.

788
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,097
Pixie Hollow's in trouble.

789
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:26,967
There's a freeze moving in,
and the Pixie Dust Tree is in danger.

790
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,902
That explains it.

791
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:32,306
The pixie dust here,
it already stopped flowing.

792
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,641
I think there's something you can do.

793
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,945
Your frost, it kept the flower alive.

794
00:54:38,812 --> 00:54:41,148
Frost does that. It's like a little blanket.

795
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:43,750
It tucks the warm air inside
and keeps out the cold.

796
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,023
We could frost the Pixie Dust Tree
before the freeze hits it.

797
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:53,493
One question. What about our wings?

798
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,563
If it's a freeze,
it will be cold enough to cross.

799
00:54:57,998 --> 00:54:59,533
Then what are we waiting for?

800
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:07,574
We're almost to the border!

801
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:15,649
The Autumn Woods.

802
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,355
The freeze. It's moving so fast.

803
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:23,457
Come on! We have to get to the tree!

804
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,375
That's it, Clanky.

805
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:45,979
Queen Clarion, it's not working.

806
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:47,681
The wind, it's too strong!

807
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:55,122
Tinker Bell.

808
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:57,424
Queen Clarion! They can help.

809
00:55:57,491 --> 00:56:01,461
Our frost, it covers like a blanket.
It can protect the tree.

810
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,135
Do it.

811
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:31,692
Oh, no.

812
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:33,093
It's getting colder.

813
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,696
Let's hand out the blankets.
They'll keep us warm!

814
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:37,764
Hurry, Peri. Hurry!

815
00:56:48,342 --> 00:56:51,111
That's it. There you go!
Make sure to cover your wings!

816
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:54,948
The tree! It's too big.
We're never going to make it.

817
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:59,620
I'm sorry.

818
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:22,843
Whoopsie! Ha!

819
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,117
Lord Milori.

820
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:31,518
We've come to help.

821
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:33,120
Now, you didn't think
I was going to let you

822
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:35,355
do this all by yourself, now did you?

823
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,992
The tree should be our top priority.

824
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:42,396
But any fairy we can spare
should try to frost the other seasons.

825
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:46,733
Start at the freeze line
and spread out to Spring and Summer.

826
00:57:46,834 --> 00:57:48,669
The rest of you, cover the tree!

827
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,178
Oh, my goodness.

828
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:00,647
Look, Bobble! The snowy owls!

829
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:07,588
Thank you.

830
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,022
Stay warm.

831
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:17,064
Now!

832
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:49,062
We've done all we can. Join the others.

833
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,677
The freeze is upon us.
You must take cover.

834
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:04,745
Follow me.

835
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,649
I hope it works.

836
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:10,450
Tink!

837
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,496
Will everything be all right?

838
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:25,666
I don't know.
I've never seen anything like this.

839
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:33,540
Thank you, Milori.

840
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:35,242
Please, take cover.

841
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:46,019
Winter Fairies, stand guard.

842
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,268
What a beautiful sight.

843
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:52,246
It worked! It worked, Tinker Bell.

844
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,147
Thank goodness!

845
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:00,387
We did it.

846
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:10,564
Whoa!

847
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:26,280
Come on, everyone!

848
01:02:29,483 --> 01:02:30,884
Tink! Come on!

849
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:34,688
Tink?

850
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:37,658
What's wrong?

851
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:47,901
Oh!

852
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:54,875
When you flew to Winter,
that's why you fell.

853
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:59,012
Oh, no.

854
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,514
Oh, Tinker Bell.

855
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:01,648
Tink.

856
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:04,885
Why didn't you tell me?

857
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:07,821
We had to save the tree.

858
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:12,359
Besides, there's no cure
for a broken wing.

859
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:15,929
I'm so sorry.

860
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:30,777
This happened
because we tried to keep you apart.

861
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,447
But never again.

862
01:03:34,281 --> 01:03:35,616
You belong together.

863
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:47,594
It's getting warmer.

864
01:03:48,195 --> 01:03:49,796
You should get back to Winter.

865
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:53,233
Yeah.

866
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:02,543
I'll be okay.
I'll meet you tomorrow at the border.

867
01:04:07,447 --> 01:04:08,582
Sisters?

868
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,617
Sisters.

869
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:21,929
Jingles!

870
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:05,939
That's a new chapter.

871
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,513
Okay, that was amazing.

872
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,615
Miss Bell, you are fantastic!

873
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,922
Queen Clarion!

874
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:25,058
I didn't know they were going to do
the smoochy, smoochity.

875
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,627
Guess they're telling people now.

876
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:44,912
Next!

877
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:51,585
Maybe you should go first.

878
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:53,720
Next.

879
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:55,189
All right.

880
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,726
Would you look at that.

881
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,565
That feels good.

882
01:06:14,408 --> 01:06:16,243
Look out! Runaway bunny!

883
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,685
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

884
01:06:24,985 --> 01:06:26,320
Hey, little buddy.

885
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,556
From Dewey?

886
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:31,892
It's what my friends call me.

887
01:06:32,359 --> 01:06:34,561
Wow!

888
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,599
I love your work.
I have so many questions for you.

889
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,767
Okay, you can let go of my hand now.

890
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:46,773
Hi.

891
01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:48,375
Hello there.

892
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:49,476
I'm Sled.

893
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:51,245
Oh, my. That's perfect!

894
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,015
I'm Rosetta.

895
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:57,718
Rosetta. That's beautiful.

896
01:06:58,986 --> 01:07:00,921
Oh, my.

897
01:07:01,788 --> 01:07:03,991
Oh, Miss Gliss!

898
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,559
An acorn!

899
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:07,728
Biggest one we could find.

900
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:08,829
I love it!

901
01:07:08,896 --> 01:07:09,997
She likes acorns.

902
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:11,164
Must be a Winter thing.

903
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,266
Not really.

904
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:14,468
