00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.</font>

2
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that monkey on the train.</font>

3
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Medici Brothers' circus
is taking off!</font>

4
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathing normal...</font>

5
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">heart rate normal.</font>

6
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're cleared to perform.</font>

7
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milly!
Another train!</font>

8
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Niños, wait!
We are coming, too!</font>

9
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joplin!</font>

10
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joplin, Missouri!</font>

11
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, sweetheart!
- Daddy!</font>

12
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I meant to tell ya.</font>

13
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
in the letter I sent?</font>

14
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry
that I wasn't here.</font>

15
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, come here now.</font>

16
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still me.</font>

17
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you...</font>

18
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're just as pretty
as your momma.</font>

19
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We missed you, Dad.</font>

20
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you, too.</font>

21
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ivan and Catherine,
thank you both...</font>

22
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for looking out for them.</font>

23
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Farrier, of course.</font>

24
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's Holt, come on now.</font>

25
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just Holt.</font>

26
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you worry.</font>

27
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.</font>

28
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on!</font>

29
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home sweet home.</font>

30
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey! Holt!
- Hey, Puck.</font>

31
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Thomas.
- Milly, come on!</font>

32
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Holt.</font>

33
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Hey, Miss Atlantis.</font>

34
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pramesh!</font>

35
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very best journey,
dear friend.</font>

36
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The road that leads home.</font>

37
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome home.</font>

38
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No hugs!</font>

39
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pramesh, I missed you, too.</font>

40
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? The camp's
half the size it used to be.</font>

41
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.</font>

42
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attention, everybody!</font>

43
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?</font>

44
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because
"keep the cages locked"</font>

45
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the most important
rule of all!</font>

46
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I catch
that fugitive scalawag</font>

47
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who interrupted my dream...</font>

48
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rongo!</font>

49
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Rongo?</font>

50
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's heading camp management?</font>

51
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the strongman.</font>

52
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but we're all wearing
multiple hats!</font>

53
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.</font>

54
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means
animal whereabouts!</font>

55
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, go find that monkey!</font>

56
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have a look around.</font>

57
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, everybody.
Back to work.</font>

58
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holt!</font>

59
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.</font>

60
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalya, Vincenzo...</font>

61
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Vanderjees, and then...</font>

62
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your wife.</font>

63
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poor Annie.</font>

64
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How she fought.</font>

65
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was the best of us.</font>

66
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it.</font>

67
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, you know, for her,</font>

68
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's have
our best season yet!</font>

69
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now where's my horses?</font>

70
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah...</font>

71
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny story about that.</font>

72
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny how?</font>

73
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sold them.</font>

74
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But our act is the soul
of this show!</font>

75
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!</font>

76
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only Milly would have
learned the trade.</font>

77
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna be a show-off
in your circus.</font>

78
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Show-off"?
- You see?</font>

79
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna make
scientific discoveries.</font>

80
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna be noticed
for my mind.</font>

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

82
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then learn clairvoyance.
Telepathy! Something!</font>

83
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do a handstand
for almost 10 seconds.</font>

84
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

85
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.</font>

86
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on now. Without horses,
what the hell's my act?</font>

87
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crowds come to see me!</font>

88
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, please.</font>

89
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to work.</font>

90
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good news.</font>

91
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One job, I have.</font>

92
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.
Give me a showstopper.</font>

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that old rascal
Itchy McPhee?</font>

94
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He finally ran off
with the bearded lady.</font>

95
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.</font>

96
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need somebody good
to tend the elephants.</font>

97
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not serious.</font>

98
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am on occasion.</font>

99
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a big job
and you know it.</font>

100
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's a big shovel
for a big pile of...</font>

101
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.</font>

102
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.</font>

103
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your scrawny, mangy,
cut-rate elephants.</font>

104
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're important.
Especially this season.</font>

105
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why's that?</font>

106
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it goes
against my nature...</font>

107
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but for once,
I made an investment.</font>

108
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bellissima! There she is!</font>

109
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our brand-new Asian female.</font>

110
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought her off
a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.</font>

111
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to get him
way down on the price.</font>

112
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I swear to you, Holt,</font>

113
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw something special
in her eyes.</font>

114
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.</font>

115
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. She's not sick.</font>

116
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any day now...</font>

117
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's having a baby.</font>

118
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, watch! Dad!
I'm getting better!</font>

119
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on now, this is our tent?</font>

120
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to our things?</font>

121
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had nice furniture,
we had rooms.</font>

122
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, what didn't you sell?</font>

123
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a gun.</font>

124
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, look!</font>

125
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toys?</font>

126
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not toys.</font>

127
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're for
my science experiments.</font>

128
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we're a circus, darlin',
a circus.</font>

129
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to be practical
if we want to survive.</font>

130
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't
just take up one act?</font>

131
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tumblin' or tightrope?</font>

132
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I don't need
the world staring at me.</font>

133
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'm just not
you and Mom.</font>

134
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, who makes the rules
in this family?</font>

135
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom did.</font>

136
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
I make them now.</font>

137
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So just, uh...
Go to your room!</font>

138
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my room.</font>

139
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all our rooms.</font>

140
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See this?</font>

141
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what this is?</font>

142
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your inheritance.</font>

143
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

144
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.</font>

145
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's stuck here.</font>

146
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you and me.</font>

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on,
you're missing it!</font>

148
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!</font>

149
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new season!</font>

150
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me in,
you little hairball!</font>

151
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

152
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would somebody please
let me in my own train?</font>

153
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, wake up! Let's go!</font>

154
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The elephants need us!</font>

155
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good God, son,</font>

156
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're gonna make me
miss the war.</font>

157
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gimme that.</font>

158
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, lead the way.</font>

159
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it!</font>

160
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!</font>

161
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make me
have to incentivize.</font>

162
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her out of there, boys.</font>

163
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy, Rufus.</font>

164
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a lady in there.</font>

165
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.</font>

166
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he just ain't
on the marquee no more.</font>

167
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to see
what he's been missing.</font>

168
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you ever get that feeling?</font>

169
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like there's something
you're missing?</font>

170
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine my surprise,
you didn't enlist.</font>

171
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
- Uh-huh.</font>

172
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad? Something's wrong.</font>

173
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She doesn't wanna leave.</font>

174
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

175
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get her outta there!</font>

176
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- Come on!</font>

177
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave her alone!</font>

178
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop hurting her, please!
- Leave her alone!</font>

179
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, look.</font>

180
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>

181
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move her!</font>

182
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, we got a baby in here.</font>

183
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She had a baby!</font>

184
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Baby!
- Huh?</font>

185
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,932

You tend the elephants.</font>

228

232
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the circus.</font>

233
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all family here.
No matter how small.</font>

234
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't elephants
afraid of mice?</font>

235
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says who?
That's why we experiment.</font>

236
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone needs to
keep him company.</font>

237
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he's not with his momma.</font>

238
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Give him one.</font>

239
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he can lift his ears
out of the way.</font>

240
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You have to blow your ears
out of the way.</font>

241
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like this.</font>

242
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck with that.</font>

243
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you can teach him
to juggle, too.</font>

244
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby Jumbo, look at me.</font>

245
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what I do.</font>

246
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blow.</font>

247
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!</font>

248
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He thinks it's a game.</font>

249
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, Max, come here.
- What?</font>

250
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch this.</font>

251
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...</font>

252
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stampede!</font>

253
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send 'em!</font>

254
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way, Max!</font>

255
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm, uh, still working out
the timing.</font>

256
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me have a turn.</font>

257
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, for when you</font>

258
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lead out the elephants...
- Uh-huh.</font>

259
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had the costume departments</font>

260
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make you up
a little something.</font>

261
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

262
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in gosh...</font>

263
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really broke the bank
with this, Max.</font>

264
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of kids
come to the show.</font>

265
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want me to
scare anyone, I get it.</font>

266
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, Dad!</font>

267
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.</font>

268
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He jumped in the air.
With his ears.</font>

269
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I said leave him be.</font>

270
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he was this far
off the ground!</font>

271
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I bet he was.</font>

272
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.</font>

273
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, really.
We tried an experiment.</font>

274
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave the poor guy alone.</font>

275
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First rule of science,
you have to have interest.</font>

276
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise,
you don't deserve to know.</font>

277
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a rough year
for both of them.</font>

00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Annie knew how to talk to 'em.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, I give to you...</font>

298
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Medici Brothers' circus.</font>

299
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

300
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay,
no one's gonna hurt him.</font>

301
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, little guy,
let's put on a show.</font>

302
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?</font>

303
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Ain't you Holt Farrier?</font>

304
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah, he died in the war.
So sad.</font>

305
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw!</font>

306
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw!</font>

307
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing?</font>

308
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's reaching
for the feathers.</font>

309
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coat, coat, coat, coat!</font>

310
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh...</font>

311
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.</font>

312
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those ears are fake!</font>

313
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look! Look at the sign!</font>

314
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dumbo!"</font>

315
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

316
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, calm down, now.</font>

317
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a fake!</font>

318
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he's a fake!</font>

319
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

320
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're scaring the elephants!</font>

321
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy now. Calm down.</font>

322
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo,
Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!</font>

323
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:17,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, sit down.</font>

324
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo, Dumbo,
fake, fake, fake!</font>

325
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said sit down!</font>

326
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, little fella.</font>

327
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fake!</font>

328
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rongo! Music!</font>

329
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happiness, joy!</font>

330
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear 'em making
fun of your ugly baby?</font>

331
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's gonna help him now?</font>

332
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holt, get those ears
off the stage!</font>

333
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

334
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, all right.</font>

335
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.</font>

336
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just calm down.</font>

337
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Attagirl.</font>

338
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here to protect him.
Same as you.</font>

339
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attagirl.</font>

340
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice and easy.</font>

341
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh. Okay, nobody's gonna
hurt your baby.</font>

342
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rufus, no!</font>

343
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rufus, stop!
- Mad elephant!</font>

344
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>

345
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, get the kids out of here!</font>

346
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody, out!
Get to safety.</font>

347
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, careful.</font>

348
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids?</font>

349
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

350
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.</font>

351
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. This way, come on.</font>

352
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you like your job now,
cowboy?</font>

353
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

354
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milly, Joe!
Come on!</font>

355
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!
Come on!</font>

356
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wanna
just emphasize,</font>

357
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we did everything right.</font>

358
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What it is, the tent
just absolutely fell down.</font>

359
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just collapsed.</font>

360
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.</font>

361
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brugelbecker,
I have a man dead,</font>

362
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you understand?</font>

363
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what they're reading</font>

364
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the Great Lakes
to the Gulf!</font>

365
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have
a moral responsibility</font>

366
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to buy
your killer elephant back.</font>

367
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the baby?</font>

368
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least
he got a few laughs.</font>

369
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll put him in the clown act,</font>

370
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">see if I can
salvage something.</font>

371
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll buy her back half price.</font>

372
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will buy her back
full price.</font>

373
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quarter price.</font>

374
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half price it is!</font>

375
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up!</font>

376
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?
Where are they taking her?</font>

377
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Away. Back to your tent now.</font>

378
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's his mom!</font>

379
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, please. Stop them.</font>

380
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please!</font>

381
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do something.</font>

382
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom would have done something.</font>

383
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Momma's not here.</font>

384
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, little fella.
Okay. Come on.</font>

385
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I do.</font>

386
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:09,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.</font>

387
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darlin', it's late.</font>

388
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on now.</font>

389
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I can't sleep, either.</font>

390
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My momma told me
there'd be times</font>

391
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when my life seemed
locked behind a door.</font>

392
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:44,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.</font>

393
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And said
whenever I have that feeling,</font>

394
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">imagine that door...</font>

395
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just turn the key.</font>

396
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I keep trying.</font>

397
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not supposed to
be in here alone.</font>

398
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not. You're here.</font>

399
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

400
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought
he might be hungry.</font>

401
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's sad.</font>

402
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't eat when you're sad.</font>

403
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mermaid does.</font>

404
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

405
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have one, Dumbo.</font>

406
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're calling him Dumbo now?</font>

407
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we call him Jumbo Junior...</font>

408
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it might make him
miss his mom.</font>

409
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go... Dumbo.</font>

410
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on,
and flap those ears again.</font>

411
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To show us
we didn't imagine it.</font>

412
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your momma, she didn't
mean to hurt anyone.</font>

413
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was just protecting you.</font>

414
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we think
your ears are great.</font>

415
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.</font>

416
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody wants to be alone.</font>

417
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

418
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you change your mind...</font>

419
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night-night, Dumbo.</font>

420
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

421
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the peanuts
that made him do it.</font>

422
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the feathers!</font>

423
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo!</font>

424
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo, you gotta do this
in the show.</font>

425
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:39,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

426
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if the circus
sells more tickets</font>

427
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Medici makes more money...</font>

428
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then we can get him
to use some</font>

429
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.</font>

430
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

431
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.</font>

432
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just show them all
what you can do.</font>

433
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. We gotta tell Dad.</font>

434
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He'll just tell us
to be practical.</font>

435
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shows got canceled
for a week, right?</font>

436
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can research
and study and test.</font>

437
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a miracle elephant,
Dumbo.</font>

438
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're gonna
bring your momma home.</font>

439
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

440
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So low.</font>

441
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An all-time low.</font>

442
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said he didn't want
to be recognized?</font>

443
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.</font>

444
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except for lights, music,
fire and crowds.</font>

to offer you a drink.</font>

523
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm all out of bourbon.</font>

526
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,295

529
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I probably should tell you...</font>

530
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the elephant is not for sale.</font>

531
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo will only fly
for the Medici circus.</font>

532
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's assuming he is real.</font>

533
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See for yourself.</font>

534
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,104

<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this, uh,
creature of yours...</font>

00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is supposed to fly?</font>

539
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trade secrets.</font>

540
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

541
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Max,
if you don't mind my asking...</font>

542
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:13,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where did you
come upon the animal?</font>

543
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hails from the far east.</font>

544
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How far?</font>

545
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Far.</font>

546
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't look
like "magic" to me.</font>

547
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what the heck can you
tell by appearances, right?</font>

548
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you train
flying elephants, too?</font>

549
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's a little hobby
on the side.</font>

550
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the kids taught Dumbo.</font>

551
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, yes.</font>

552
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

553
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how on earth
did you do that?</font>

554
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the scientific method.</font>

555
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One picture, one picture!</font>

556
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:52,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max.</font>

557
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You possess something
that's very rare in life.</font>

558
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the tragedy of it is,</font>

559
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is you don't even know
that you have it.</font>

560
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what it is
that you have, Max?</font>

561
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

562
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's mystique.</font>

563
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, I know your type.</font>

564
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charlatan, con man,
opportunist...</font>

565
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New York is that way,
in case you need directions.</font>

566
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know it comes
from a deep desire</font>

567
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to build something
authentic and true.</font>

568
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know your game.</font>

569
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a game.</font>

570
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.</font>

571
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's up your sleeve.</font>

572
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in your pocket.</font>

573
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret to show business</font>

574
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is always keep a rabbit
in your hat.</font>

575
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or a monkey in your desk,
I guess.</font>

576
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ownership shares?</font>

577
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, look around you.</font>

578
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your entire way of life
is dying.</font>

579
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The future
of the entertainment business</font>

580
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to bring
the audience to you.</font>

581
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I've built
that destination.</font>

582
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm lacking...</font>

583
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a protégé.</font>

584
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know
there's no Medici Brothers.</font>

585
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You probably always
wanted one.</font>

586
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're offering me
a partnership?</font>

587
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

588
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a home.</font>

589
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you and the entire troupe.</font>

590
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A home?
For all of us?</font>

591
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Join me.</font>

592
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Join me and my family.</font>

593
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me take us all
into the future.</font>

594
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me take us all...</font>

595
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to Dreamland!</font>

596
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish Momma
could've seen this.</font>

597
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.</font>

598
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way to work your magic, Max.</font>

599
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We hear you, Dumbo!</font>

600
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why won't you
let him see outside?</font>

601
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, young lady...</font>

602
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mystique.</font>

603
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now this is why
I joined the circus.</font>

604
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad.
Wonders of Science!</font>

605
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, sugar plum.</font>

606
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, we got
a job to do here.</font>

607
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My daughter, she fancies
herself the next Marie Curie.</font>

608
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ever let anybody
tell you what you can't do.</font>

609
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on,
I wasn't saying she can't.</font>

610
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:19,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it exactly that
we do here, ma chérie?</font>

611
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We make
the impossible possible.</font>

612
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's where
you'll perform.</font>

613
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Colosseum!</font>

614
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo will stay
in the training tent behind.</font>

615
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo!</font>

616
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't we going with him?</font>

617
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that is your new home.</font>

618
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

619
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this place!</font>

620
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A library...</font>

621
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"And the children
shall lead them."</font>

622
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're grateful for the
opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.</font>

623
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, your family's mine.</font>

624
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've been brushing
up on your story, Mr. Farrier.</font>

625
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kentucky's top trick rider.</font>

626
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...</font>

627
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:17,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only here,
you'd be Captain Farrier...</font>

628
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">war hero.</font>

629
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One-armed wonder.</font>

630
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">National treasure.</font>

631
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

632
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I still can ride.</font>

633
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I know you can.</font>

634
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're going to.</font>

635
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right after you get
that little elephant</font>

636
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">off the ground for me.</font>

637
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean
once his act's working?</font>

638
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're back in the saddle.</font>

639
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still working
on the schedule</font>

640
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the rest of your troupe...</font>

641
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but on Friday...</font>

642
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we premiere our little Dumbo.</font>

643
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get goose bumps.</font>

644
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you looking at me?</font>

645
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, because the only thing</font>

646
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more amazing
than a flying elephant...</font>

647
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the goddess who can fly it.</font>

648
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you lost your mind?</font>

649
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.</font>

650
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we fly Friday!</font>

651
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Dumbo's never flown
with anyone.</font>

652
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why it's become
abundantly clear</font>

653
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:21,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why we need you.</font>

654
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo!</font>

655
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, buddy.
- We missed you. You all right?</font>

656
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Captain Farrier
is in charge.</font>

657
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one sees the animal
without his approval.</font>

658
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holt.</font>

659
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just call me Holt.</font>

660
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were
a military man.</font>

661
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?</font>

662
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

663
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you better keep
your elephant friend</font>

664
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on my good side.</font>

665
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiya, Dumbo.</font>

666
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo, you mind?</font>

667
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get my arm?</font>

668
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?</font>

669
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

670
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record,
this was not my idea.</font>

671
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo works alone.</font>

672
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I.</font>

673
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bonjour, Milly, Joe...</font>

674
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you...</font>

675
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm, charming.</font>

676
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe he doesn't
recognize you</font>

677
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without your makeup.</font>

678
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I gotta teach you to fly?</font>

679
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how to fly,
ever since I was a child.</font>

680
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They taught Dumbo to fly, no?</font>

681
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I don't need
your expertise.</font>

682
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

683
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just so you know,
I've been to France.</font>

684
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a good experience.</font>

685
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me your secret!</font>

686
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How on earth
does your elephant fly?</font>

687
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, first,
he needs a feather.</font>

688
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't fly
without a feather.</font>

689
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well then, neither will I.</font>

690
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, slow down, princess.
Safety first.</font>

691
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, nets.</font>

692
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, hurry.</font>

693
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, guys, good.</font>

694
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, Dumbo?</font>

695
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fly!</font>

696
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See if you can catch me!</font>

697
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, Dumbo!</font>

698
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:14,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we got some work to do.</font>

699
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends and colleagues...</font>

700
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let's give a warm
Dreamland welcome</font>

701
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to our new executive
vice president...</font>

702
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Max Medici.</font>

703
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything he needs,
anything at all...</font>

704
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">make it happen
as you always do.</font>

705
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Miss Verna.</font>

706
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will handle your schedule,</font>

707
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">correspondence,
and all your calls.</font>

708
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're needed
in meetings,</font>

709
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she'll let you know.</font>

710
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are there meetings today?</font>

711
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you know!</font>

712
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Mr. Vandevere,
one question.</font>

713
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly what do I do?</font>

714
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where'd
Vandevere find you?</font>

715
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a street performer
in Paris.</font>

716
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He discovered me.</font>

717
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here I am.</font>

718
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A millionaire's girlfriend.</font>

719
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a tough break.</font>

720
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all for show.</font>

721
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you and he,
you're not, uh...</font>

722
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm one of many gems he wears</font>

723
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to reflect the light
back onto him.</font>

724
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>

725
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:33,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy, Dumbo.</font>

726
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good job.
- Yeah! They're gonna love him.</font>

727
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you are the lucky one.</font>

728
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well done, Dumbo.
- Good boy.</font>

729
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's been dreaming</font>

730
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like I've been dreaming?</font>

731
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how's everything?</font>

732
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good?
- Oh, we're making progress.</font>

733
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he ain't quite ready yet.</font>

734
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?</font>

735
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not that simple.
<i>- Ma chérie...</i></font>

736
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've already sold
all the tickets.</font>

737
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe our little
scientist here</font>

738
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can show us
that it's going to work.</font>

739
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare for takeoff.</font>

740
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right wing?
- Check!</font>

741
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left wing?</font>

742
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check!</font>

743
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take her up, Dumbo.</font>

744
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

745
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Come on, Dumbo.</font>

746
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. Come on.</font>

747
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try it again.</font>

748
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got this.
Here you go.</font>

749
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You beautiful
one-armed cowboy.</font>

750
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've made me a child again.</font>

751
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i></font>

752
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>where the impossible
is possible.</i></font>

753
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buonasera. Max Medici.</font>

754
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I discovered the elephant,
my elephant.</font>

755
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And basically I said no.</font>

756
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I walked out
and that was the end of that.</font>

757
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The flying
elephant's mine.</font>

758
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:22,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

759
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the guy!</font>

760
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the guy that's
made out of magic dust!</font>

761
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max.</font>

762
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">J. Griffin Remington.
Atlas Forge Bank.</font>

763
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the money man.</font>

764
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:35,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The J?</font>

765
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! It's a pleasure
to meet you.</font>

766
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you?</font>

767
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they say the moon
is made out of magic dust.</font>

768
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why
they're going to send</font>

769
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a man up there
one of these days.</font>

770
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my bank is
going to be the bank</font>

771
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that finances the expedition.</font>

772
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think of that?</font>

773
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

774
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Needless to say, Max...</font>

775
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we all have high hopes
for tonight.</font>

776
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.</font>

777
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know,
hopes, and dreams,</font>

778
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's one thing.
That's words.</font>

779
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what we're talking
about here is facts!</font>

780
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plans!</font>

781
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plans! That takes
a lot of money.</font>

782
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which he hasn't got!</font>

783
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we are hoping
that your pachyderm</font>

784
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">comes through with the goods.</font>

785
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now let's get this show
on the road!</font>

786
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are looking good!</font>

787
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:26,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, Big D.</font>

788
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just more room to fly
out there, that's all.</font>

789
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Round and round,
just like we practiced.</font>

790
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Dad can talk
to Vandevere about the deal!</font>

791
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About the what?</font>

792
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made a deal with Dumbo.</font>

793
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We promised we'd buy
his mom back</font>

794
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with all the money
he makes for the circus.</font>

795
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:40,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he flies.</font>

796
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:44,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Joe, not now!
- Are we ready?</font>

797
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

798
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go.</font>

799
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.</font>

800
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pink elephants?</font>

801
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

802
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i></font>

803
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i></font>

804
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>V.A. Vandevere,</i></font>

805
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in association

806
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:15,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i></font>

807
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i></font>

808
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i></font>

809
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You've even seen a housefly.</i></font>

810
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But you haven't
seen anything...</i></font>

811
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:30,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>until you see an elephant fly.</i></font>

812
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i></font>

813
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming through.</font>

814
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

815
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can do it.</font>

816
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know he can.</font>

817
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And here to welcome him...</i></font>

818
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:29,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i></font>

819
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo.</font>

820
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:27,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.</font>

821
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice and easy,
like we practiced.</font>

822
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm.</font>

823
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't they
putting up the nets?</font>

824
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys?</font>

825
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:44,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, what's going on?</font>

826
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your men are supposed
to be out there!</font>

827
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change of plan. From the top.</font>

828
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see the nets.</font>

829
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're invisible.
- Hmm.</font>

830
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you?
They need nets!</font>

831
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colette!</font>

832
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, don't take off!</font>

833
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo...</font>

834
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy!</font>

835
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Prince of the Elephants.</font>

836
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I command you to fly with me.</font>

837
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colette!</font>

838
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lower the platform!</font>

839
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly, little one!</font>

840
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic dust!</font>

841
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my show?</font>

842
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The elephant's headed
to Nightmare Island.</font>

843
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.</font>

844
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:47,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo, it's okay.</font>

845
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here.</font>

846
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening.</font>

847
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Mr. Vandevere.</font>

848
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello, hi.
- Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!</font>

849
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone having fun?</font>

850
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

851
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Having a good time?
- Yes, sir.</font>

852
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fantastic.</font>

853
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him outta here.</font>

854
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Over here!</font>

855
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Folks, please.
- Hello.</font>

856
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Folks, I need you
to leave the exhibit.</font>

857
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

858
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.</font>

859
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soldier,
I give the orders here.</font>

860
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's his bedtime.</font>

861
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:29,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This attraction is now closed.</i></font>

862
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

863
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

864
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Mrs. Jumbo.</font>

865
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on,
I want to see Dumbo!</font>

866
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see Dumbo!</font>

867
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want my money back!</font>

868
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:53,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.</font>

869
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The elephant flies.
You saw it.</font>

870
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw a vanishing act.</font>

871
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.</font>

872
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't control your animal.</font>

873
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You give me a little time,
I can fix this.</font>

874
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:09,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever! Till then,
the bank is closed.</font>

875
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened up there?</font>

876
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost control
of the animal.</font>

877
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the animal.</font>

878
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was my net?</font>

879
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.</font>

880
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Training?
You call that training?</font>

881
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.</font>

882
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He recognized
that other elephant's call.</font>

883
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!</font>

884
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's true. It's her.</font>

885
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was sold from our circus
2 months ago.</font>

886
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every child
knows its mother.</font>

887
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they say
elephants never forget.</font>

888
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can be together now.</font>

889
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are there children
in my office?</font>

890
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.</font>

891
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just reunite them,</font>

892
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:50,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he'll do
whatever you want.</font>

893
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he'll do
whatever she wants.</font>

894
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'd have bought her</font>

895
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I thought she was
related to him? Hmm?</font>

896
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't help me at all.</font>

897
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna know
the most important thing</font>

898
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:07,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about growing up?</font>

899
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:13,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to learn
to go it alone.</font>

900
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.</font>

901
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And treat yourself
to some new boots.</font>

902
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, sir,
you can't just kill her.</font>

903
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

904
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Vandevere.</font>

905
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.</font>

906
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do that to my kids.</font>

907
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Holt,
when my father left us,</font>

908
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was a blessing really.</font>

909
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.</font>

910
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe that's what
your children need.</font>

911
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell me
what my children need.</font>

912
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best take a step back,
Elephant Man.</font>

913
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darling...</font>

914
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:51,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dumbo and his mom
need a little alone time.</font>

915
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Mommy's going to
take a little trip...</font>

916
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that Dumbo
won't be distracted.</font>

917
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milly! Milly!</font>

918
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colette?</font>

919
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have rehearsal.</font>

920
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,791

01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Home of the most dangerous
beasts in the world.</i></font>

924
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, park's closing.</font>

925
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milly!</font>

926
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Milly!</font>

927
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you find her?</font>

928
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

929
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, her momma always knew
what to say. No matter what.</font>

930
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always knew.</font>

931
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your children don't need you
to be perfect.</font>

932
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just need you
to believe in them.</font>

933
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That simple, huh?</font>

934
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.</font>

935
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my daughter all right.</font>

936
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:49,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only girl I know
who runs away to go to school.</font>

937
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's our fault.</font>

938
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bet Dumbo wishes
he never met us.</font>

939
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, you showed him
he could fly.</font>

940
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think
he'd ever trade that?</font>

941
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He would to have his mom back.</font>

942
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss Momma.</font>

943
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so do I.</font>

944
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something
I want to show you.</font>

great things.</font>

952
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:38,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it.</font>

953
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa. What's this?</font>

954
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, give me a break.</font>

955
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta teach you
how to read English, too?</font>

956
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Max, hello!</font>

957
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, you brought
the paperwork.</font>

958
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:06,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max...</font>

959
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was reviewing your troupe...</font>

960
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to be honest with you...</font>

961
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.</font>

962
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I was thinking,
I don't know,</font>

963
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a month's severance?
Seems fair.</font>

964
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Capisce?</i></font>

965
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you promised to...</font>

966
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:26,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Max, the contract says
that I'd hire them.</font>

967
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It never stipulated
for how long.</font>

968
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, get your little band of
low-rent freaks out of here.</font>

969
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.</font>

970
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's have a heart.</font>

971
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you tell them?</font>

972
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:54,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?</font>

973
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on, guys?</font>

974
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vandevere's fired them all.</font>

975
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're to leave by tomorrow.</font>

976
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, little friend.</font>

977
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye.</font>

978
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We wanted to see him
one last time.</font>

979
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One last time to see him fly.</font>

980
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
he wants to anymore.</font>

981
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. But he must.</font>

982
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He cannot lose
Mrs. Jumbo again!</font>

983
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I'm afraid
it's rather worse than that.</font>

984
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Sotheby?</font>

985
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come
to clear my conscience.</font>

986
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.</font>

987
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What order?</font>

988
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Jumbo will be gone
by tomorrow night.</font>

989
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she's not
meant to survive.</font>

990
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This "Dreamland"
doesn't deserve him.</font>

991
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No circus does.</font>

992
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:38,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, who's gonna be
willing to help me?</font>

993
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set Dumbo and his momma free.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for positions.</font>

1009
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could have used
a little rehearsal.</font>

1010
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rehearsal?</font>

1011
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,180

01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fly elephants all the time.</font>

1014

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you can do this?</font>

1015
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,524

tied behind my back.</font>

1080
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,049

just standing there?</font>

1084
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:12,763

There's no elevators!</font>

01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What power, mon chéri?</font>

1091
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ungrateful...</font>

01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Vandevere, wait!</font>

1096
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:00,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!</font>

1097
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:01,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now it's impossible!</font>

1098
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:04,180

You gotta go, Dumbo.</font>

1140
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lost the feather.</font>

1141
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:19,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feather doesn't do nothin'.</font>

1142
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:21,695

1145
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:26,738

1147
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:33,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From my momma?</font>

1148
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:36,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.</font>

1149
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:39,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't need
this key to do it.</font>

1150
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you don't need
the feather.</font>

1155
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There ain't room
for the 3 of us.</font>

1156
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.</font>

1157
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:08,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on, Big D.</font>

1158
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,079

1164
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Get back here!</font>

1165
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You freak!
What have you done?</font>

1166
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What they pay me for,
mister.</font>

1167
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put on a hell of a show.</font>

1168
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Him!</font>

1169
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:05,633

you got bigger problems here.</font>

1172
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. This is a disaster.</font>

1173
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on,
I'll buy you a hot dog.</font>

1174
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,781

He'll be here.</font>
