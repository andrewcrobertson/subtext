1
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,413
Mum!

2
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,347
Mum!

3
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,810
Mummy!

4
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,523
Mum!

5
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,026
Mum!

6
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,280
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,083
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

8
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,503
"straight into
the huge black pot.

9
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,757
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,889
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

11
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,475
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,977
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,146
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,567
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,110
It's very late.

16
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,030
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,786
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact -

18
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:46,833
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,115
What have you done?

20
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,950
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,327
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,497
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,707
Please don't!

24
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,753
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,381
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,966
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,217
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,553
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,472
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,056
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

31
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,058
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

32
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,270
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

33
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,530
Mmm.

34
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,036
Don't do that!

35
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,207
Ready?

36
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,085
Come on.

37
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,217
Quick. You're late already.

38
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,010
What have you got in there?

39
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,512
See you later, alligator.

40
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,690
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

41
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,858
What?

42
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,819
One with your milk in it.

43
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,695
I don't want milk.

44
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,573
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

45
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,205
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

46
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,624
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

47
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,668
Do you want a cuppa?

48
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,712
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

49
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,797
Aw.

50
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,882
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

51
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,468
Right?

52
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,182
Amelia?

53
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,934
Your son's school
is on the phone.

54
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,566
Oh, my God.

55
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,984
Did he hurt anyone?

56
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,403
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

57
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,531
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

58
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,867
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

59
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,577
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

60
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:12,747
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

61
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,040
Monitor?

62
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,001
He'll be separated
from the other children.

63
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,837
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

64
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,213
Samuel won't cope with this.

65
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,673
He already feels so different.

66
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:24,551
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

67
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,677
Mrs Fanning,

68
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,138
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

69
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,017
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

70
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,269
What he needs
is some understanding.

71
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,980
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

72
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,483
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

73
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,109
I think I'll just find
another school.

74
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,612
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

75
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,655
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

76
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,449
that sees my son
as a human being

77
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,451
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

78
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:52,454
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

79
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,915
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

80
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,125
His name is Samuel.

81
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,260
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

82
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,429
You can play
on that swing you like

83
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,348
for as long as you like, OK?

84
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,392
Mrs Bruen hates me.

85
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,019
No, she doesn't.

86
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,481
Just need a break, that's all.

87
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,777
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

88
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,031
I'll tell her later.

89
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,161
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

90
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,665
Sam, don't bother the lady.

91
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,291
No, no, no. That's alright.

92
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,168
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

93
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,795
My dad's in the cemetery.

94
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,004
Oh. That's...

95
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,007
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

96
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,718
Samuel.

97
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,137
I'm sorry. He just...

98
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,014
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

99
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,143
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

100
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,936
We have to go.

101
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:00,147
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

102
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,233
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

103
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,901
Right in front of
his own installation.

104
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,903
Lost all these sales.

105
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,947
You're not listening.

106
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,699
I am. I am.

107
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,827
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

108
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,829
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

109
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,415
Mum! Mum!

110
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,251
I'm gonna smash its head!

111
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,590
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

112
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,928
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

113
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,098
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

114
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,394
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

115
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,523
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

116
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,818
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

117
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,403
She wants to have
a princess party.

118
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,655
Mum! Mum!

119
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,157
That's OK.

120
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,409
We don't have to come.

121
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,369
You can still come.

122
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,496
Mum!

123
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,706
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

124
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,791
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

125
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:05,128
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

126
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,217
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

127
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,510
this year, anyway.

128
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,845
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

129
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,599
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,601
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

131
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,811
and I end up feeling awful.

132
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:22,062
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

133
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,315
We'll be fine.

134
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,483
We'll be absolutely fine.

135
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,235
Mum! Look at me!

136
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,534
Mama!

137
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,917
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

138
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,919
You look tired, little one.

139
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,255
Have you been in the wars today?

140
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,673
A few wars.

141
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:52,342
He's had a big day, that's all.

142
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,969
He's just exhausted.

143
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,804
Poor little sweetheart.

144
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,222
Bugsy.

145
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,974
Come here, little girl. Hello.

146
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,601
You look tired too, love.

147
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,019
You OK?

148
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,230
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

149
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,150
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

150
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,902
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

151
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,487
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

152
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,488
You can choose one tonight.

153
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,996
Where did you get this?

154
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,498
On the shelf.

155
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,882
"If it's in a word
or it's in a look,

156
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,676
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

157
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,141
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

158
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,144
"then you can make friends
with a special one -

159
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,687
"a friend of you and me."

160
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:37,572
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

161
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:42,285
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -

162
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,831
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

163
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,875
"That's when you'll know
he's around.

164
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,211
"You'll see him if you look.

165
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,843
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

166
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,803
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

167
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,680
But you said I could choose.

168
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,979
"This is what he wears on top.

169
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,148
"He's funny, don't you think?

170
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,486
"See him
in your room at night..."

171
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,699
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

172
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,119
Mum?

173
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,913
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

174
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,000
Mummy?

175
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,712
Mummy?!

176
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,047
"How sweetly they sung,

177
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,799
"telling of the happiness
and loveliness

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,968
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

179
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,512
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

180
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,876
It's that time of
night again.

181
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,544
Time...

182
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:58,004
If that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

183
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,382
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

184
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,897
Do you...

185
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:42,359
Mum!

186
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,194
- It's in my room!
- What is?

187
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,987
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

188
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:50,700
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

189
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,453
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

190
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,455
It's just a book.

191
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,833
It can't hurt you.

192
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,585
You've had a big day.

193
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,213
You're just exhausted.

194
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,968
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

195
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,682
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

196
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:16,226
I'm gonna protect you.

197
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,049
Mum, it's 9:00.

198
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,270
He's not running a fever
anymore.

199
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:46,650
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

200
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:48,485
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

201
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,738
Sorry. What was that?

202
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:55,283
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

203
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,161
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

204
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:01,540
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

205
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,795
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

206
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,180
88. Number 88.

207
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,099
Two fat ladies.

208
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,725
Good, Elaine!

209
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,353
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

210
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,191
Number 11.

211
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,943
Who has number 11?

212
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,028
Legs 11.

213
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,865
Hey? See what else we've got.

214
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,202
5 billion.

215
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,621
Anyone got 5 billion?

216
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:55,469
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

217
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:01,183
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

218
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,935
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

219
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:07,147
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

220
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:12,652
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

221
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:16,072
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

222
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,908
Why don't you go home?

223
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:22,496
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

224
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:23,413
I can cover for you.

225
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:26,041
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

226
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,753
I'll give you my pay.

227
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:31,671
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

228
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,965
You've got a sick boy.

229
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,842
Life's too short.

230
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,720
You're so sweet, Robbie.

231
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,265
- You should go.
- Yeah.

232
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:45,477
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

233
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,656
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

234
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:40,907
Rung you a million times.

235
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:41,950
What happened?

236
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:44,035
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

237
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,205
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

238
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,457
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

239
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm so sorry.

240
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,960
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

241
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,879
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

242
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,338
It's not rubbish. It's real!

243
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,466
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

244
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:01,887
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

245
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,805
You got them for me
on the internet.

246
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,223
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

247
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,437
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

248
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:14,065
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

249
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,901
Well, I'm not scared.

250
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:19,029
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

251
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,697
That's enough.

252
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,283
You will be
when it eats your insides.

253
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,117
I've decided

254
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:25,994
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

255
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:27,704
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

256
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,919
Samuel.

257
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:47,432
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

258
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,101
life is not always as it seems.

259
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:53,355
It can be a wondrous thing.

260
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:57,776
But it can also be
very treacherous.

261
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:09,162
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

262
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,165
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

263
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:18,296
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

264
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,382
Samuel.

265
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,601
I was just
putting something back.

266
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,019
All your father's things
are down there.

267
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,062
He's my father.

268
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,189
You don't own him!

269
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,152
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

270
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:44,948
Can I come in?

271
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:49,411
Hey, matey. This is for you.

272
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:52,205
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

273
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,707
I'm not sick.

274
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,669
Oh. I-I thought...

275
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,337
No, he's not, actually.

276
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,424
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

277
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,467
You said that's not true.

278
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:05,010
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

279
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:06,178
who still believe in monsters?

280
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,345
I hate you!

281
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,889
She won't let me have
a birthday party

282
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,933
and she won't let me have a dad!

283
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,752
Ohh.

284
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,800
Don't eat it.

285
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,731
The Babadook did it, Mum.

286
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,985
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

287
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,528
The Babadook did it!

288
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,321
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

289
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,991
Ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,076
girls and boys,

291
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:58,540
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

292
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,626
Life is not always as it seems.

293
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:05,755
It can be a wondrous thing.

294
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:09,801
But it can also be
very treacherous.

295
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,137
In this DVD,

296
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:16,766
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

297
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:22,397
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

298
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:47,547
Do you think this is funny?

299
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:51,843
Oh, no. No. No!

300
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:55,555
Give it to me!

301
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,768
Do you wanna die?

302
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:14,843
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

303
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:18,555
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

304
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:20,348
Don't let it in!

305
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:34,631
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

306
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,561
I've already got this doll, Mum.

307
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:48,895
Now she's got a twin.

308
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,105
They can go shopping together.

309
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:57,362
Off you go.

310
00:28:57,363 --> 00:28:59,739
He's just really tired.

311
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:07,080
Go and play right now.

312
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,256
Claire tells me you're a writer.

313
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,967
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

314
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:21,470
What kind of writing did you do?

315
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:25,432
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

316
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,851
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

317
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:29,311
It must be difficult.

318
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:32,772
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

319
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:35,525
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

320
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,195
and they find it very hard.

321
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:41,740
How's Richard's merger going?

322
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,994
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

323
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:48,788
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

324
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,956
Tell me about it!

325
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,292
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

326
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,919
That's a real tragedy.

327
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,255
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

328
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:59,341
You must have so much
to talk about

329
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:01,009
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

330
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:16,149
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

331
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,609
I'm not hurting anybody.

332
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,988
Bye.

333
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,992
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

334
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,917
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

335
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,961
She never comes to our house.

336
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:38,463
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

337
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,340
'cause it's too depressing.

338
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,343
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

339
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,887
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

340
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:49,099
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

341
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,518
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

342
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,104
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

343
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,564
Isn't it time you moved on?

344
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,107
I have moved on.

345
00:30:57,108 --> 00:31:00,569
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

346
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,696
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

347
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,490
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

348
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,534
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

349
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:09,202
I do have a dad!

350
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:12,080
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

351
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,167
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

352
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:16,418
I do!

353
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,128
I want to know how you are.

354
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:19,838
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

355
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,048
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

356
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,676
I can't believe
you just said that.

357
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:27,220
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

358
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,723
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

359
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,224
That's not true!

360
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:32,434
And your mum doesn't want you.

361
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:34,769
No-one wants you.

362
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,073
What did you do?!

363
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,743
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

364
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,996
Is she alright?

365
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:55,624
Stay here
and look after the children

366
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,709
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

367
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,798
Mummy!
She wouldn't believe me!

368
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,300
Mummy! Mummy!

369
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:07,219
Mummy!

370
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,223
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

371
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:15,101
There is no Babadook!

372
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,105
Get out!

373
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:24,444
- Get out!
- Samuel?

374
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,696
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

375
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,574
Get out! Get out! Get out!

376
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,011
Please help me!

377
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:52,180
There's something wrong
with my son.

378
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:07,279
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

379
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,156
That's when the brain overheats.

380
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:10,490
It always looks worse
than it is.

381
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,367
I've never seen
anything like this.

382
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,452
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

383
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:16,246
All his other results
are normal.

384
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:20,417
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

385
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:22,169
Very committed to
the monster theory.

386
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,545
That's an understatement.

387
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:27,299
All children see monsters.

388
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,050
Not like this.

389
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:32,471
And it's getting worse.

390
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,182
He's becoming aggressive.

391
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:36,766
He could see a psychiatrist.

392
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,393
I can refer you.

393
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:39,978
Takes a few weeks to get in.

394
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,188
That'd be great.

395
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:46,443
But can you just give me
something for now,

396
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:48,904
just to make him sleep?

397
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,656
Um, just until...

398
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,118
...just until
we get an appointment.

399
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:58,497
Please?

400
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:03,293
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

401
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:04,711
and when we go home tonight,

402
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,713
this whole nightmare
will start up again

403
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:07,964
and I am really...

404
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,842
...I'm really not coping.

405
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:17,724
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

406
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,143
Just until the tests come back.

407
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:25,023
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

408
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:27,025
It's really bad.

409
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:38,829
These can make children
feel foggy.

410
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,081
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

411
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:44,292
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

412
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:47,879
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

413
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,384
Why don't people
like me?

414
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:54,469
Why do you say that?

415
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,390
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

416
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:03,603
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

417
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:11,278
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

418
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,654
and not worry.

419
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:15,949
I don't want you to die.

420
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,077
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

421
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:23,331
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

422
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:31,089
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

423
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,425
I've got the day off tomorrow.

424
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:35,469
Maybe we could do something,
hmm?

425
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,847
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

426
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:40,557
I think so

427
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:42,434
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

428
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:46,480
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

429
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:48,315
Then I won't mention it.

430
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:52,652
I promise to protect you.

431
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,362
Come on.

432
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,791
Come on.

433
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:15,801
Can you stay here with me?

434
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:17,719
Yes.

435
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,055
I love you, Mum.

436
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:21,848
Me too.

437
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,575
Her nose
is broken in two places.

438
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:27,409
She may need surgery.

439
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,785
I'll pay for everything.

440
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:30,537
You can't even pay
your own bills.

441
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:31,913
Look, I really have to go.

442
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,709
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

443
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,085
What?

444
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:39,129
A book turned up
at our place.

445
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,757
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

446
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:44,551
and put it on our doorstep.

447
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:47,971
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

448
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:50,932
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

449
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,185
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

450
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:56,021
I have to go.

451
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,458
Claire!

452
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,711
Hello?

453
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,884
Mmm, Babadook...

454
00:40:25,885 --> 00:40:29,971
...dook... dook.

455
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:39,314
Hi.

456
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:43,276
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

457
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:44,611
Can you tell us what happened?

458
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:47,572
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

459
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,660
And?

460
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:54,830
And it contained violent
and graphic images

461
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,873
of my child and me
being murdered.

462
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,875
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

463
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,127
I burnt it.

464
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:03,839
You burnt it?

465
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,965
Yes.

466
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,467
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

467
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:13,140
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

468
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,432
What's he been saying?

469
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:18,103
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

470
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:19,938
How do you know
it's the same person?

471
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,399
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

472
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,151
The book you burnt?

473
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:26,319
Yes.

474
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,795
OK.

475
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,382
Don't worry about it.

476
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,186
Did you get your things done?

477
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:01,354
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

478
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,148
That's why she shakes like this.

479
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:04,900
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

480
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:06,151
that goes through your head.

481
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:08,737
Oh, it's alright, love.

482
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:13,742
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

483
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:16,411
He sees things as they are,
that one.

484
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:18,121
Oskar was the same.

485
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:19,831
He always spoke his mind.

486
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,709
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

487
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:30,217
Hey, Bugsy.

488
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:33,261
Hey.

489
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:35,639
Hey!

490
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:52,489
Eugh!

491
00:43:41,456 --> 00:43:43,707
Don't come in here.

492
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,555
I don't want to buy anything.

493
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:00,640
Are you Amelia Vanick?

494
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:01,683
Yes.

495
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:04,269
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

496
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,062
from the Department of
Community Services.

497
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,106
My son's only been
away for two days.

498
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:11,651
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

499
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,862
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

500
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:15,864
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

501
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:20,535
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

502
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,120
at the moment.

503
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:26,082
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

504
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:31,087
Hello, Samuel.

505
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:35,091
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

506
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:38,136
How are you?

507
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:41,848
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

508
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,936
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

509
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:47,813
He had a fit yesterday.

510
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:51,233
I'm really tired, actually.

511
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:52,943
That's no good.

512
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:57,989
May I have a glass of water,
please?

513
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,327
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

514
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,211
It's a real mess.

515
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:13,630
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

516
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:15,173
I normally have
the house sprayed.

517
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:17,050
I did actually already
have it sprayed

518
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:19,886
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

519
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,555
and that's why I...

520
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:29,062
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

521
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,565
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

522
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:33,859
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

523
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,027
We've caught you
at a bad time.

524
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,030
I'll leave you with this.

525
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,658
We're required
to come back in a week

526
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:43,451
to talk through your options.

527
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:45,662
Here's my card.

528
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:51,626
Mum,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

529
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:13,690
What was
that noise I heard?

530
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:16,568
I didn't hear any noise.

531
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:18,862
Wind howling,
doors slamming.

532
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,823
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

533
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:26,119
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

534
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,121
Are you sick?

535
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,414
Oh, no, Granny.

536
00:46:31,042 --> 00:46:33,126
It's only 6:00.

537
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:35,879
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

538
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,339
No.

539
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,383
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

540
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,557
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

541
00:47:02,448 --> 00:47:04,533
Where's its mother,
Skip?

542
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:06,117
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

543
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,161
Are you off now, Dad?

544
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:09,871
Yep.
Soon as I fuel up.

545
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:11,832
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

546
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,000
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

547
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,879
"And the Prince
and the Princess

548
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,841
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

549
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:23,343
"for the rest of their days."

550
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:09,825
Babadook...

551
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:13,787
...dook... dook.

552
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:50,740
What are we doing?

553
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,576
We're going downstairs.

554
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:54,953
- Why?
- Because we are.

555
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:16,725
Iris, Iris, Iris.

556
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,560
No.

557
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,986
Glass and mirror attachment.

558
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,988
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

559
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:13,532
for a streak-free shine.

560
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,908
As part of
your steaming special,

561
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,743
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

562
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:20,247
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

563
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,043
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

564
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:26,378
That's just what I need.

565
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,673
I can't help it if I'm sick.

566
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:31,091
What do you expect me to do?

567
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,885
You do that!

568
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:53,113
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

569
00:51:54,824 --> 00:51:57,576
I need to eat something.

570
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:05,417
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

571
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:10,505
You said to have them with food.

572
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:14,468
I'm really hungry, Mum.

573
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:18,597
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

574
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,557
Don't you ever stop?

575
00:52:20,558 --> 00:52:24,186
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

576
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:27,689
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

577
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:31,943
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

578
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:07,145
I'm so sorry.

579
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:10,315
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

580
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:15,195
I've had absolutely no sleep.

581
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:17,572
I didn't know what I was saying.

582
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:21,326
I'll cook you something. Hey?

583
00:53:22,662 --> 00:53:23,995
What would you like?

584
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,956
I'm not hungry anymore.

585
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,923
We really need to get
out of this house.

586
00:53:34,924 --> 00:53:37,384
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

587
00:53:42,223 --> 00:53:44,099
Do you want to go to Wally's?

588
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:47,769
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

589
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:51,481
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

590
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,028
Give it back!

591
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:01,116
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

592
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:03,076
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

593
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:04,494
Sit down, please.

594
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,960
Where are we going?

595
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:15,046
I just want to drive
for a little while.

596
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:29,102
Aarggh!

597
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:31,104
Mummy! Mummy!

598
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:35,692
Babadook.

599
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:48,038
You ran straight into me!

600
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,417
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

601
00:54:53,711 --> 00:54:56,296
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

602
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:58,256
You could've killed someone!

603
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:01,009
Hey!

604
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,052
Hey, what are you doing?

605
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:04,012
Hey! Crazy bitch!

606
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,188
Hi, sweetheart.

607
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,906
Mum?

608
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,827
I can call Aunty Claire.

609
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:32,791
I can call
and she can come over.

610
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:37,671
Mum?

611
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:42,259
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

612
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:47,013
Mum. Mum, look at me.

613
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,876
It's nice and warm in here.

614
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:21,631
I don't want you to go away.

615
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:26,011
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,816
Mum?

617
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:51,703
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

618
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,207
I can call Mrs Roach.

619
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:59,044
I don't want you to call anyone.

620
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:04,508
I just need to sleep.

621
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,806
- Mum...
-  Leave it!

622
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,214
There's something
in the house.

623
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,772
There's someone in the house!

624
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,829
Mrs Roach...

625
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,915
...can we come and stay
the night?

626
00:59:09,342 --> 00:59:11,343
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

627
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,762
Has someone
broken into the house?

628
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:16,848
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

629
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,767
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

630
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:21,061
Oh, I was so worried.

631
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,604
I told him not to call anyone.

632
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,523
He asked
if you could stay the night.

633
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,359
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

634
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,361
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

635
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,489
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

636
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:34,074
Yes. Talk soon.

637
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:35,617
No worries. Talk soon.

638
00:59:38,204 --> 00:59:40,747
I told you not to call anyone

639
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:42,707
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

640
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:46,086
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

641
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:48,296
An old lady who can hardly walk?

642
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:49,840
Do you want to make her sick?

643
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:53,885
Get that bloody thing off!

644
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:03,145
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

645
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:04,646
in front of our neighbours?

646
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,944
Is this what I have to do?

647
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:23,748
I'm sorry, Mummy.

648
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:26,001
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

649
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:28,003
What'd you say?

650
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,671
I said the Babadook...

651
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:31,298
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

652
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:35,135
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

653
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:37,679
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

654
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,391
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

655
01:00:41,392 --> 01:00:42,976
Alright, Samuel?

656
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,520
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

657
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,063
Nothing!

658
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:26,728
I feel sick.

659
01:01:26,729 --> 01:01:31,107
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

660
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:32,734
Mum, I don't think I need...

661
01:01:32,735 --> 01:01:35,779
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

662
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:01,471
Good boy.

663
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:24,161
Ohh!

664
01:02:24,162 --> 01:02:25,495
Mum!

665
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,224
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

666
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:50,770
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

667
01:02:52,023 --> 01:02:53,315
Hey.

668
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:56,026
Hey!

669
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,673
Here we go.

670
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:26,723
There's more
where that came from.

671
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,611
Oh!

672
01:03:43,116 --> 01:03:45,325
Aarggh!

673
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:46,576
What's the secret?

674
01:03:49,163 --> 01:03:50,872
...letter of Max's, didn't you?

675
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,415
No, not for a minute.

676
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,292
Don't lie.
You called me a Jezebel. Why?

677
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:56,503
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

678
01:03:56,504 --> 01:03:57,963
With fresh meat.

679
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:03,218
Only five...

680
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,637
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

681
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,933
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

682
01:04:09,934 --> 01:04:11,518
to stab her son.

683
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,687
His body was found
in their basement.

684
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:16,439
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

685
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:20,694
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

686
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,654
Little is known about the tragedy

687
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:26,616
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

688
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:29,035
He had just turned seven.

689
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:45,010
Samuel?

690
01:04:49,307 --> 01:04:50,849
Wake up, Mummy.

691
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:57,063
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

692
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:04,362
Don't go down there.

693
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,785
It's not safe.

694
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:50,826
Ohh... I thought you were dead.

695
01:05:51,953 --> 01:05:54,496
I thought you were dead.

696
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,012
We're gonna be together.

697
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:16,017
You just need to bring me
the boy.

698
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:40,917
You mean Samuel?

699
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,211
You can bring me the boy.

700
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:47,466
You can bring me the boy.

701
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:51,136
You can bring me the boy.

702
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:52,554
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

703
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:54,764
I think it's going to rain.

704
01:06:54,766 --> 01:06:56,183
No.

705
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:31,236
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

706
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:45,625
Oh, no.

707
01:08:51,132 --> 01:08:52,966
No! No!

708
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:02,517
Bugsy!

709
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:56,047
Samuel!

710
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:02,971
Samuel.

711
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:08,977
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

712
01:11:11,564 --> 01:11:14,024
You don't want him to die,
do you?

713
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:19,821
Samuel.

714
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:22,866
Are you listening to me?

715
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:29,247
Let me in, you little shit!

716
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:31,708
Let me in!

717
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:33,001
Let me in!

718
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,544
Let me in!

719
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:37,506
Let me in!

720
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:02,072
You little pig!

721
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,909
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

722
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:08,078
You don't know how many times

723
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,998
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

724
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,750
I just want you to be happy.

725
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:16,878
"I just
want you to be happy."

726
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:21,758
Sometimes...

727
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,595
...I just wanna smash
your head against a brick wall

728
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:28,849
until your fucking brains
pop out.

729
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:30,934
You're not my mother.

730
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:32,519
What did you say?

731
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,147
I said
you're not my mother!

732
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:38,692
I am your mother!

733
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:44,322
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

734
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,077
Get away!

735
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:50,996
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

736
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,003
- Argh!
- Argh!

737
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:43,006
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

738
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:45,175
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

739
01:13:45,176 --> 01:13:48,178
I'm OK.

740
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:54,100
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

741
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:58,396
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

742
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,524
But I just wanted you to know

743
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:03,610
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

744
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:05,654
I love you both.

745
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,700
Samuel.

746
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,247
I'm sorry.

747
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:20,085
I understand you're scared.

748
01:14:20,086 --> 01:14:24,089
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

749
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:27,175
I haven't been good at all.

750
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:33,473
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

751
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:40,480
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

752
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:45,861
We're going to
stay there tonight.

753
01:14:45,862 --> 01:14:48,780
Do you want that?

754
01:14:53,244 --> 01:14:56,329
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

755
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:09,509
I want you to meet your dad.

756
01:15:11,304 --> 01:15:13,847
It's beautiful there.

757
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:18,059
You'll be happy.

758
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:26,359
Sorry, Mummy!

759
01:16:14,826 --> 01:16:16,952
Mum!

760
01:16:16,953 --> 01:16:19,621
Mum!

761
01:16:19,622 --> 01:16:21,832
I'm not leaving you.

762
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:27,671
Mum? Mum?

763
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:37,556
You said
we'd protect each other.

764
01:16:43,354 --> 01:16:45,689
I know you don't love me.

765
01:16:47,108 --> 01:16:49,359
The Babadook won't let you.

766
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,695
But I love you, Mum.

767
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:55,490
And I always will.

768
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:09,171
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

769
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:16,094
I don't want you to go away.

770
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:17,679
No! No! No!

771
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,848
Mummy!

772
01:18:09,941 --> 01:18:11,441
Mummy!

773
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:13,527
Mummy!

774
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:15,487
Mummy!

775
01:18:15,488 --> 01:18:17,948
Mummy! Mummy!

776
01:18:17,949 --> 01:18:20,116
Mummy!

777
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:21,701
Mummy!

778
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:00,991
What is it?

779
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:02,826
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

780
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:22,012
Ooh!

781
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:34,566
What do you want?

782
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:39,905
What do you want?

783
01:20:17,777 --> 01:20:19,528
No.

784
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:22,531
Keep breathing.

785
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:28,954
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

786
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,377
No.

787
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:41,591
I think it's gonna rain.

788
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:43,593
Stop!

789
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:34,060
You are nothing.

790
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:47,782
You're nothing!

791
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,753
This is my house!

792
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,260
You are trespassing in my house!

793
01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:21,733
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

794
01:22:30,493 --> 01:22:32,661
No!

795
01:23:16,456 --> 01:23:17,664
Mummy, don't!

796
01:23:23,838 --> 01:23:25,922
Don't!

797
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:59,122
Aaaargh!

798
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:14,614
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

799
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:16,616
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

800
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:18,451
What time's the party?

801
01:25:18,453 --> 01:25:19,786
Any time after three is fine.

802
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:21,705
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

803
01:25:21,706 --> 01:25:23,290
Bye.

804
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:25,083
Bye, Sam.

805
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,460
That school's
a good choice.

806
01:25:27,462 --> 01:25:29,629
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

807
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,339
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

808
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,049
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

809
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,093
It's time to get back.

810
01:25:35,094 --> 01:25:38,513
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

811
01:25:38,514 --> 01:25:39,848
Mmm.

812
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:41,683
Are you having a party?

813
01:25:41,684 --> 01:25:43,435
It's Sam's birthday today.

814
01:25:43,436 --> 01:25:46,771
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

815
01:25:46,773 --> 01:25:48,273
That's not true.

816
01:25:48,274 --> 01:25:50,901
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

817
01:25:50,902 --> 01:25:53,195
That's unusual.

818
01:25:55,615 --> 01:25:59,034
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

819
01:25:59,035 --> 01:26:02,287
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

820
01:26:04,415 --> 01:26:06,500
Sam's just like his dad was.

821
01:26:06,501 --> 01:26:08,627
Always speaks his mind.

822
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:12,964
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

823
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:17,761
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

824
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:22,140
I'll take that for you.

825
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:43,036
Good shot.

826
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,330
Look, there's another one!

827
01:26:45,331 --> 01:26:47,415
Where's your bowl?

828
01:26:50,378 --> 01:26:53,588
Wow. You've got a lot today.

829
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:57,259
Am I ever gonna see it?

830
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,679
One day, when you're bigger.

831
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:10,522
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

832
01:27:48,853 --> 01:27:50,020
Argh!

833
01:27:52,356 --> 01:27:55,150
Argh!

834
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,360
It's alright.

835
01:27:57,361 --> 01:27:59,070
It's alright.

836
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:01,114
It's alright.

837
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:02,657
Shhh...

838
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,744
Shhh...

839
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:08,788
Shhh...

840
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:11,666
Shhh...

841
01:28:12,752 --> 01:28:15,170
Shhh...

842
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:37,275
How was it?

843
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:39,778
It was pretty quiet today.

844
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:43,406
Come here.

845
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:49,996
It's getting much better, Mum.

846
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,252
Wait!

847
01:28:55,253 --> 01:28:57,379
I have a new trick.

848
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:03,844
Life is not always as it seems.

849
01:29:03,845 --> 01:29:06,805
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

850
01:29:11,978 --> 01:29:14,855
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

851
01:29:24,365 --> 01:29:27,576
Abracadabra!

852
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:31,872
How did you do that?

853
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:38,962
Come here, you.

854
01:29:38,963 --> 01:29:40,172
Come here.

855
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:53,226
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
