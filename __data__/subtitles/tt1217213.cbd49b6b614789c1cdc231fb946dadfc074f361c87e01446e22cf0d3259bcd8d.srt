00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,720
Whoa!

363
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,920
DEWEY: That's the end of that chapter.

364
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
Boy, that's a beauty.

365
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>Flora and Fauna of the Fairies.</i>

366
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,920
Put a period there,
then we are pretty much done.

367
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Wait. I forgot to number the pages.

368
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,400
Oh! I'm going to have to start all over
on this large book.

369
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,920
-PERIWINKLE: Keeper. Keeper!
-Yes, what...

370
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,440
PERIWINKLE: The most amazing thing
happened. You'll never believe it.

371
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

372
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,360
PERIWINKLE:
I've never felt anything like it!

373
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,440
My friends didn't believe me,
but how could they because it's so...

374
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,000
DEWEY: Slow down.
I can only listen so fast.

375
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
PERIWINKLE: Yesterday,
at the border, my wings.

376
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
They actually... They lit up.

377
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
It's happening again!

378
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
Oh...

379
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
Well, I'll be a yeti's uncle.

380
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,480
In all my years.

381
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Your wings. They're sparkling.

382
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
Like yours.

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,320
(LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY)

384
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
I've written about the sparkling,

385
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,640
but I've never seen the sparkling
with my own peepers!

386
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,200
(CHUCKLING EXCITEDLY)

387
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
Oh, uh, follow me.

388
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,880
Now, step the footsies on the snowflake.

389
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,120
Just put your wings into the light.

390
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,200
The mainland.

391
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,600
(LAUGHING)

392
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,560
TINKER BELL: Oh, no.

393
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
(TINKER BELL GASPS)

394
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,000
Hello?

395
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
FAIRIES: Hello.

396
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Hello?

397
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,560
Two fairies born of the same laugh.

398
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,800
So that means...

399
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,280
You're my...

400
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
BOTH: So we're

401
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
sisters.

402
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,640
Yes! And your wings are identical.

403
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,560
That is why they sparkle.

404
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,480
BOTH: (EXCLAIM) Jingles!

405
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
(LAUGHING)

406
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,640
Ah... Oh, boy.
Maybe you shouldn't do that.

407
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,200
Um, I'm Tinker Bell.

408
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm Periwinkle.

409
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,000
So you must have been at the border.

410
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,320
Yeah. I was hoping to see
the animals cross.

411
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
I guess I didn't see you.

412
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
(CHUCKLES) Me either. (GASPS)

413
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
What?

414
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
(TINKER BELL GASPS)

415
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,800
I usually just wear them at home.

416
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,360
-Wow.
-LORD MILORI: Hello.

417
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,520
Keeper, are you in?

418
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,640
Yumping yetis, Lord Milori!

419
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,160
If he sees you, he'll send you back.

420
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,480
LORD MILORI: Keeper? Are you here?

421
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
Don't worry.
I'm going to take care of this.

422
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,720
Where are you?

423
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Ah. Come back later!

424
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,760
Keeper?

425
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
Whoa, boy. Can't get that one back.

426
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,720
I need to speak with you.

427
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,320
It's important.

428
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,400
I'll be right back.

429
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm right here, Lord Milori.

430
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
Did you receive that wing book?

431
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
You know, once upon a time,

432
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,560
you'd stop by just to say hello
and howdy-do.

433
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,240
(SIGHS) I'm sorry. Hello.

434
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,880
Howdy-do?

435
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,600
(SIGHS) Howdy-do.

436
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,800
This book has me worried.
What if a Warm Fairy brought it here?

437
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,640
DEWEY: Well, that might be nice,
then, meeting a Warm Fairy.

438
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,440
Especially one
with such good taste in books.

439
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,080
It's too cold.

440
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,280
Maybe if they were wearing a coat,

441
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,320
or one of them little sweater vests.

442
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,760
-They're nice.
-I'll remind you.

443
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
Crossing the border is forbidden.

444
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
There was a time when it wasn't.

445
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,240
The rule is there to keep the fairies safe.
That will never change.

446
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,320
But I...

447
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,880
If a Warm Fairy comes here,
you will send them back.

448
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
Of course.

449
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Thank you.

450
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,080
Well, you heard the Lord Milori.

451
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,200
He said you must go back home.

452
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,240
Of course, he didn't say when.

453
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
(BOTH GASP)

454
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Now, listen, you two,
it gets colder after the dark,

455
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,760
so it's best to get Tinker Bell
home before the first moonlight.

456
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,360
Thank you, Dewey.

457
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
Dewey?

458
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,800
That's his real name.

459
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,240
It's what my friends call me.

460
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,280
Thank you.

461
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680

463
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,040
So, um, I'm a Frost Fairy. I frost things.

464
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,880
-Oh. I'm a Tinker. I...
-Tinker things?

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,800
Yep. I even made this coat.

466
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,640
-Oh, I like it.
-Thanks.

467
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,760
PERIWINKLE: You're welcome.

(CHUCKLES) Sisters.

469
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
It's amazing. The dust travels
all the way from the Pixie Dust Tree.

470
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,800
Kind of like you did.

471
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,000
...Terence and I
barely escaped the pirate ship!

472
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
-Is he your boyfriend?
-Uh...

473
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,440
So Lizzy loves fairies?

474
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
Yeah. She even built a fairy house.

475
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,160
That's how I met her.
You see, me and Vidia...

Wow, you two look exactly alike!

I mean, except for your clothes
and your hair and Peri's a bit more pale.

504

But your noses are very similar.

505

Forget their noses.
She's a Warm Fairy. In Winter!

We got to show her around!

Bug? It's too cold for bugs over here,

but in one of Dewey's books,
I read about butterflies.

Oh, in Butterfly Cove,

...and the other
was from the warm seasons.

they met at the border...

...where Spring touches Winter.

851
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,560
But as their love grew stronger,
they wished to be together...

...and share each other's worlds.

and crossed.

that fairies must never again
cross the border.

01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,320
An acorn!

1075
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,480
Biggest one we could find.

1076
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,560
I love it!

1077
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,720
She likes acorns.

1078
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,920
Must be a Winter thing.

1079
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Not really.

1080
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Tink.

1081
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,000
You ready?

1082
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Ready.

1083
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,080
(BOTH WHISTLING)

1084
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,480
Ooh!

1085
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,000
Lovely!

1086
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,920
WOMAN: (SINGING) <i>I never knew</i>
<i>I lost you till I found you</i>

1087
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,720
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1088
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,080
<i>And you'd never guess</i>
<i>how close you are to me</i>

1089
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,440
<i>Now I want to</i>
<i>throw my arms around you</i>

1090
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,960
<i>Tell a thousand tales</i>
<i>that will astound you</i>

1091
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,400
<i>Everything about you</i>
<i>tells me this was meant to be</i>

1092
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,080
<i>Don't you see?</i>
<i>I'm on your side</i>

1093
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,360
<i>Let's take this ride</i>

1094
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,720
<i>And together we're facing the world</i>

1095
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,360
<i>Doing things nobody's done before</i>

1096
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,840
<i>And the great divide</i>

1097
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,240
<i>Doesn't seem so wide</i>

1098
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,680
<i>Anymore</i>

1099
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:29,680
So, is it true that glaciers are stealthy?

1100
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,280
You're sitting on one now, man.

1101
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,800
CLANK: (LAUGHING) Sneaky glacier.

1102
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:42,160
<i>I can't recall what life was like</i>
<i>without you</i>

1103
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:49,680
<i>Now it feels as though</i>
<i>we've never been apart</i>

1104
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,560
<i>Tell me every tiny thing about you</i>

1105
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,000
<i>Anything you'll say</i>
<i>I'll never doubt you</i>

1106
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,280
<i>We're meant to be together</i>
<i>I can feel it in my heart</i>

1107
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,920
<i>It's just the start</i>

1108
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,000
<i>I'm on your side</i>

1109
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,440
<i>Let's take this ride</i>

1110
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,760
<i>And together we're facing the world</i>

1111
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,440
<i>Doing things nobody's done before</i>

1112
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,840
<i>And the great divide</i>

1113
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,440
<i>Doesn't seem so wide</i>

1114
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:32,000
<i>And if you'll be there</i>
<i>beside me when I falter</i>

1115
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,360
<i>Then whatever comes I know</i>
<i>we'll take it all in stride</i>

1116
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,360
<i>I'm on your side</i>

1117
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,880
<i>The great divide</i>

1118
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,320
<i>It doesn't seem so wide</i>

1119
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,880
<i>I'm on your side</i>

1120
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,560
<i>Let's take this ride</i>

1121
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,480
<i>And together</i>
<i>we're facing the world</i>

1122
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,640
<i>Doing things</i>
<i>nobody's done before</i>

1123
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,520
<i>And the great divide</i>

1124
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,560
<i>Doesn't seem so wide</i>

1125
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,160
<i>Anymore</i>
