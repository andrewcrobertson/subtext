she's seeing anyone.

159

Yeah, that's the problem.

166

Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

167
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,767
That's not fair, Sukie.

168
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:24,904

I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

176

it's relevant to the modern

century lesbian.

178

my friend.

181

If you'll come help me

182
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,263
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

183
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:55,671
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

184
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,134
I have my own problems.

185
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,004
What problems?

186
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,500
Internal.

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,073
- Internal?
- Yes.

188
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,778
I don't know
how else to put it.

189
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,044
Problems with
what I feel internally.

190
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,947
How can you have
internal problems?

191
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,949
You got your ass all bricked up.

192
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,117
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

193
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:17,154
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

194
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,959
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

195
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,160
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

196
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,899
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

197
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,033
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

198
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,771
Please don't eat those peas.

199
00:09:29,771 --> 00:09:32,367
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

200
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,974
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

201
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,679
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

202
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,746
Where are you going?

203
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,341
Tallahassee, Florida.

204
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,651
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

205
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,312
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

206
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,951
Can't she move?

207
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,019
Tallahassee is very nice.

208
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,021
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

209
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,550
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

210
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,795
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

211
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:56,028
There's good birding.

212
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,700
Birding?

213
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,427
How have I missed out on this?

214
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:01,033
It's very pleasant.

215
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,036
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

216
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:06,137
I've been unhappy,

217
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,370
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

218
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,811
and it's not fair to them.

219
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,605
I'm only impatient with myself.

220
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,310
Well, we can fix that.

221
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,147
We'll have you running right
in no time.

222
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:18,182
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

223
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:21,020
We get our shit together, together.

224
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,791
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

225
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,321
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

226
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,696
Now you can come with me,

227
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,698
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

228
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:30,359
What's a drive-away?

229
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,701
Free one-way rental.

230
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,703
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

231
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:35,034
of the drive-away company
wants it,

232
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,135
if they got one going
near your destination.

233
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,841
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

234
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,206
Are you kidding? A birder?

235
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:45,209
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

236
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,179
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

237
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,016
You know how
parents and such love me.

238
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,787
They think I got charisma.

239
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,218
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

240
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:55,725
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

241
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,792
Isn't she something?"

242
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,222
I'm not sure.

243
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,762
Don't go finding a problem here.

244
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,588
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

245
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:04,096
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

246
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,659
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

247
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,166
SUKIE: <i>Oh, God!</i>

248
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,838
- (sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!
- (power drill whirring)

249
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,071
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

250
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,436
- I don't want it anymore.
- (dog barking)

251
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,438
(hushed): You said
she wouldn't be here.

252
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:19,881
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

253
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:21,410
That was a gift.

254
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,983
I wanted you to have it.

255
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:27,548
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

256
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,924
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

257
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,486
No, no, no, no.

258
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,257
And take Alice, too.

259
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,929
I never liked her.

260
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,623
And she won't stop barking!

261
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:39,065
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

262
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,561
Remember, you kicked me out?

263
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,694
(continues sobbing)

264
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:44,598
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

265
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,743
It's your dildo,
Susanne.

266
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,636
(Alice barks, growls)

267
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,143
Curlie's Drive-Away,

268
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,211
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

269
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,575
Curlie speaking.

270
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,917
MAN (on phone): <i>Okay,
it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

271
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,644
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

272
00:11:57,644 --> 00:11:59,514
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

273
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:02,715
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>- To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

274
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:03,793
Right.
<i>- Tallahassee.</i>

275
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:04,959
Sure.
<i>- You got it?</i>

276
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,587
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

277
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:08,897
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

278
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,690
By tomorrow.
<i>- No later.</i>

279
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,197
Uh-huh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

280
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,298
Okay.
<i>- Over and out.</i>

281
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,203
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

282
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:21,272
$250 deposit and a reference.

283
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,669
A reference?

284
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,506
Somebody local
I can break his balls

285
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:26,706
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

286
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:28,411
His balls.

287
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,249
Can the reference
be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

288
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,449
No kidding.

289
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:36,122
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

290
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,092
Tallahassee?

291
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,391
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

292
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:43,063
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

293
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,196
I think Curlie here...

294
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,934
Don't call me Curlie.

295
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,871
Isn't your name Curlie?

296
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,037
My name is Curlie.

297
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,841
We just met. It's too familiar.

298
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,909
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

299
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,207
No, I got good sense.

300
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,979
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

301
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,509
Okay. Is that a good car?

302
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,082
Not really.

303
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,712
You sell those shirts?

304
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:07,747
JAMIE: There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

305
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,716
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

306
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:11,927
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

307
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,786
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

308
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:14,996
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

309
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:16,294
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

310
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:17,460
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

311
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,725
Down and across.

312
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,232
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

313
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,794
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

314
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,532
MARIAN:
Direct route, down and across.

315
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:26,205
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

316
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,010
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

317
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,375
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

318
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,883
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

319
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:35,313
The interstate is not life.

320
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,249
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

321
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,185
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

322
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,549
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

323
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:42,551
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

324
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,025
He said it was a rush job.

325
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,158
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

326
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,522
Tomorrow can wait a day.

327
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,029
We could even go to Miami.

328
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,294
Bikinis and high heels.

329
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,362
(engine revs, tires squeal)

330
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,034
A medical doctor?

331
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,629
Or a reverend?

332
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:58,798
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

333
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,976
No, not for medical doctors, either.

334
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,670
Make up your mind--
which are you?

335
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,475
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

336
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:08,918
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

337
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:11,283
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

338
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,924
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

339
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:18,488
Well, we're here.

340
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,029
Okay. Who are you?

341
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:24,659
- The car.
- The car?

342
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,331
The Dodge Aries.

343
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,597
The Dodge Aries?

344
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:29,939
What are you, a mynah bird?

345
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,105
I'm Curlie.

346
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,975
I understand that.

347
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:34,636
You're not the Dodge.

348
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,706
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

349
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,609
♪ ♪

350
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,020
(doors open and close)

351
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,583
(engine starts, tires squeal)

352
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,718
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

353
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:53,259
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

354
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,493
And once we get to Tallahassee,
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

355
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,693
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

356
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,332
- soap and water.
- It won't.

357
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,301
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

358
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,765
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

359
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,833
Marian, it's art.

360
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,175
Stop saying it's art.

361
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,836
That doesn't end all discussion.

362
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,046
We're gonna be driving through

363
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,114
some conservative towns--
the South.

364
00:15:13,114 --> 00:15:14,907
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

365
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:16,876
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

366
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,647
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

367
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,913
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

368
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:23,355
That's "Peck-us,"
honey darling.

369
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,962
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

370
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,194
My project.

371
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,229
What's your project?

372
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,936
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

373
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,334
How long's it been?

374
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,107
Weeks?

375
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:42,308
Months?

376
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:44,574
Oh, my God, Marian.

377
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,939
Don't tell me it's been years.

378
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,875
H-How many years? Who was it?

379
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,218
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

380
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:52,813
Donna.

381
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,320
Yeah, Donna.

382
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,061
Oh, my God.

383
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,723
Oh, my God. Donna?

384
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,891
(sighs)
She work for Al Gore now?

385
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,266
Nader.

386
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,598
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

387
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,337
CURLIE:
Wait a minute.

388
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,275
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

389
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,938
Yes, I did.

390
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:22,282
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

391
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,778
and then these broads come in

392
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:26,253
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

393
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,288
You gave them the car.

394
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,092
You don't know who they were?

395
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,786
CURLIE:
I told you their names.

396
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,227
Their names, yes, but...

397
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:35,064
This place is a dump.

398
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:37,165
They drive the car
instead of you.

399
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,331
Is that bad?

400
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,893
Bad if they find the goods.

401
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,368
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

402
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,963
CURLIE:
I like clutter.

403
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,305
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

404
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,537
Sterile doesn't work for me.

405
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,209
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

406
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,771
- Dick-yank?
- CHIEF: Flint.

407
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:51,003
I'm a dick-yank?

408
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,411
Don't antagonize.

409
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,006
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

410
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,942
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

411
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,548
And you would?

412
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:59,913
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

413
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,585
(footsteps approaching)

414
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,784
Not per se.

415
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:04,258
"Per se"?!

416
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,722
They left a local number.

417
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,857
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

418
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,628
Someone whose balls I can break.

419
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,135
(grunts)

420
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,863
(groaning)

421
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:18,041
Now you've gone and done it.

422
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,078
(grunting)

423
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,005
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

424
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,810
- (thumping)
- (grunting and groaning)

425
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,516
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

426
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,288
Tomorrow.

427
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,554
(grunting and groaning continue)

428
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,194
(sighs) This is great.

429
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:41,559
This is so slutty.
I love this.

430
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,265
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

431
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:46,168
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

432
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,367
The Butter Churn awaits.

433
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,764
Jamie,
I think I'd prefer to...

434
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:50,733
No. No, don't even.

435
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:51,998
You come with me.

436
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,769
I'll show you how this is done.

437
00:17:56,378 --> 00:17:58,906
(chatter in foreign language,
audience laughter over TV)

438
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,579
(door opens, closes)

439
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,714
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

440
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,320
It's a dyke bar.

441
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:09,554
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

442
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,491
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

443
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,493
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

444
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,628
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

445
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,631
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

446
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,307
Hello?

447
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,640
(engine idling)

448
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,840
- (engine shuts off)
- (muffled music playing inside)

449
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,512
JAMIE: Confidence.

450
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,075
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

451
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,451
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

452
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,420
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

453
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,158
Jamie, I have done this before.

454
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:43,753
It's just like this.

455
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,260
One message.

456
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,823
You dig the female body.

457
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:49,165
Your body.

458
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:51,200
You're like this.

459
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,994
Not like this.

460
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,063
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

461
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:58,130
I have done this before.

462
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,538
I am not a schoolmarm.

463
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,100
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

464
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,036
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

465
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,741
Three years.

466
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:07,579
(hushed):
And four months and 14 days.

467
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,614

Fine?

478
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:31,669
Like, "You'll do"?

"Please, please

"You seem totally okay.

Are there any other mediocre

482
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,346
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

483
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,710
I said they all looked fine.

484
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,482
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

485
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,320
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

486
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,223
Why are you jousting with me?

487
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,621
I'm not jousting.

488
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,853
I'm asking which of these women

00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:52,591
you want to throw up

there's no tomorrow.

491
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,397
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

492
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:58,267
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

493
00:19:58,267 --> 00:19:59,763
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

494
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,029
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

495
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,195
They sense it,

496
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:04,537
whether you want to fuck them

497
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,000
or you think they're just fine.

498
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,474
I have to be me.

499
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,509
It has to be done
with authenticity.

500
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,511
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

501
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,206
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

502
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:15,713
You don't know
what our life was like.

503
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,451
You know nothing
about its worth.

504
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,881
Then why didn't
the two of you move

505
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,883
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

506
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,049
That didn't happen.

507
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,150
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

508

No, I'm not.

510
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,825
This is not me.

511
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:29,958

I can't do this.

No, Marian.

I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

You can do this.

515

You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

Your best self.

517
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,838
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

518
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,543
but this really isn't
right for me.

519
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,480

00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:41,153
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

1059
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:42,715
(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

1060
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:45,421
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

1061
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:47,423
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

1062
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:48,996
I guarantee you someone's there.

1063
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:51,592
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

1064
00:48:51,592 --> 00:48:54,034
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

1065
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:55,860
I'll take Alice.

1066
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,466
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

1067
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:59,699
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

1068
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:02,471
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

1069
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:05,573
CHIEF (over phone):
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

1070
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:07,608
Wetumpka, Alabama.

1071
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:09,247
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

1072
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:10,512
They hadn't been there,

1073
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:13,944
but a very personable
music lover

1074
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:15,616
told us of another juke joint

1075
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:17,519
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

1076
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,718
Stop!

1077
00:49:18,718 --> 00:49:20,489
Called Ike's.

1078
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

1079
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,098
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

1080
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,265
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

1081
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:29,135
I think the soccer team
was just confused

1082
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:31,137
about which joint
these girls were going to,

1083
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:32,699
so we're gonna drive...

1084
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:35,405
Stop saying words.

1085
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,078
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

1086
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,640
They arrived in Tallahassee

1087
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,182
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

1088
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:45,382
Tallahassee.

1089
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,021
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

1090
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:49,122
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

1091
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:50,618
Not a juke joint.

1092
00:49:50,618 --> 00:49:52,257
You should arrive
by early morning.

1093
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,390
I'll meet you there.

1094
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,656
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

1095
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:57,625
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

1096
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,561
We have not slept
since the night before last,

1097
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,662
- and we...
- (click, dial tone)

1098
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,268
Hello?

1099
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,700
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

1100
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:09,175
DESK CLERK:
Certainly.

1101
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:11,111
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

1102
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:12,541
or right here at the hotel,

1103
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:15,082
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

1104
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:16,710
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

1105
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,746
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

1106
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:22,188
Maybe we should stay here.

1107
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,717
Replenish the ice.

1108
00:50:26,425 --> 00:50:28,227
(piano playing
"Fly Me to the Moon")

1109
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:30,328
This is great, but how...

1110
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:32,726
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

1111
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:36,400
(softly):
Rainbow.

1112
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,533
Yes.

1113
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:39,997
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

1114
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:41,735
Like, a really, really good one?

1115
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:42,802
WAITER: Of course.

1116
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:46,839
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

1117
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,445
Theoretically.

1118
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:52,350
(Jamie sighs)

1119
00:50:56,884 --> 00:50:58,125
So...

1120
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:03,163
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1121
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,025
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1122
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:11,732
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1123
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,636
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1124
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:17,639
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1125
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,575
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1126
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:22,413
but I usually have stuff to do.

1127
00:51:23,218 --> 00:51:25,218
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1128
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:27,748
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1129
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:32,291
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1130
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,293
- (cork pops)
- Something I decided

1131
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:35,789
last night
while I was lying in bed

1132
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:38,792
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1133
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:43,060
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1134
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,534
Especially since, with you,

1135
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,569
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1136
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:47,637
Am I right?

1137
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,145
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1138
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:54,214
- Thank you.
- WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

1139
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:55,743
Yes, please.

1140
00:51:55,743 --> 00:51:57,943
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1141
00:51:57,943 --> 00:51:59,549
I mean, we're good friends,

1142
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,551
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1143
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,981
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1144
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:06,589
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1145
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:09,559
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1146
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,759
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1147
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,728
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1148
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:16,335
She was always saying
that this or that

1149
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:18,205
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1150
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,471
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1151
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:23,408
the sex was great.

1152
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:25,278
Ladies, have we decided?

1153
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,678
Don't rush us, buddy.

1154
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,715
First, we'll dance.

1155
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:37,323
("You Belong to Me"
by Diana Krall playing)

1156
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,532
Maybe I do overthink things.

1157
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:51,535
Yeah.

1158
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,539

I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1161

Ah, you know Debbie.

1162
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:07,144
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1163

on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1164
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:11,885

01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,997
Oh, my God.

1233
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,328
Marian.

1234
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,232
CHAUFFEUR: Sir?

1235
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:39,838
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1236
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:42,841
Tallahassee, sir.

1237
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:45,602
- Where to, exactly?
- (sighs)

1238
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:47,813
Yes, um...

1239
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:49,749
The track.

1240
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:51,817
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1241
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:53,610
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1242
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,084
JAMIE:
Oh, come on now.

1243
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,922
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1244
01:00:57,922 --> 01:00:59,858
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1245
01:00:59,858 --> 01:01:02,157
No. I like this one.

1246
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,732
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1247
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:07,558
Last night was beautiful,

1248
01:01:07,558 --> 01:01:09,230
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1249
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,836
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1250
01:01:10,836 --> 01:01:12,662
- Okay! -All right!
- (Jamie and Marian screaming)

1251
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:15,071
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1252
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,007
We're here for two things.

1253
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,338
- (screaming continues)
- (grunts)

1254
01:01:18,338 --> 01:01:20,142
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1255
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:21,847
- Screw you!
- (screaming)

1256
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:23,673
We're here for two items.

1257
01:01:23,673 --> 01:01:25,081
Whoa. She's naked.

1258
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,479
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1259
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:28,854
We're here for two items.

1260
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:30,988
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1261
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:33,089
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1262
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,893
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1263
01:01:34,893 --> 01:01:36,961
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1264
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:38,996
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1265
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:41,625
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1266
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,869
Let's get this show on the road.

1267
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:45,563
(screaming continues)

1268
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:47,807
Yeah, baby.

1269
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:55,045
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1270
01:01:56,114 --> 01:01:58,851
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1271
01:02:00,613 --> 01:02:02,349
Whoa.

1272
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:04,758
This is so groovy.

1273
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:07,761
Now I can love you forever.

1274
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:09,389
Whoa.

1275
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:10,797
And ever

1276
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:15,362
and ever and ever

1277
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:20,499
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1278
01:02:20,499 --> 01:02:24,976
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1279
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:29,079
BOTH: Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1280
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,710
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1281
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:38,022
(echoing): Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1282
01:02:38,022 --> 01:02:41,751
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1283
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:45,425
Never to wilt...

1284
01:02:45,425 --> 01:02:46,756
(bell rings)

1285
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:49,231
(snarling)

1286
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,969
Took 'em straight here.

1287
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:52,135
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1288
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,137
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1289
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:59,439
This is all they had?

1290
01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:01,177
What's all they had?

1291
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:06,853
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1292
01:03:06,853 --> 01:03:08,888
GOON:
What are you talking about?

1293
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:11,121
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1294
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,618
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1295
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:15,290
Come on, girls.

1296
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,995
Where's the last phallus?

1297
01:03:17,822 --> 01:03:20,196
(muffled chattering)

1298
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,495
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1299
01:03:22,871 --> 01:03:24,464
I-I...

1300
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:26,103
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1301
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,006
What have you done, jerk-off?

1302
01:03:28,006 --> 01:03:29,876
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1303
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,339
They gave you the combination,

1304
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,341
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1305
01:03:33,341 --> 01:03:35,046
- FLINT: I never slip up.
- GOON: Right, left,

1306
01:03:35,046 --> 01:03:36,850
- past the first number.
- (yells)

1307
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:39,919
(snarling)

1308
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:53,229
The senator is a good man.

1309
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,002
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1310
01:03:57,002 --> 01:03:58,366
Many of us did.

1311
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:00,874
- It was a different time.
- (muffled muttering)

1312
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:03,943
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1313
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:06,473
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1314
01:04:12,613 --> 01:04:13,920
Housekeeping.

1315
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,845
(snarling)

1316
01:04:15,845 --> 01:04:20,190
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1317
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:23,226
...thing.

1318
01:04:24,592 --> 01:04:28,528
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1319
01:04:28,528 --> 01:04:30,068
(beeping)

1320
01:04:31,137 --> 01:04:33,665
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1321
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:36,910
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1322
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,539
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1323
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:42,839
He was just a kid.

1324
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:46,150
(humming an upbeat tune)

1325
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:50,154
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1326
01:04:50,154 --> 01:04:52,288
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1327
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,192
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1328
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:58,591
(hushed):
You saw him, sort of.

1329
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:05,103
(continues humming)

1330
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,568
(stops humming)

1331
01:05:11,243 --> 01:05:13,507
(housekeeper screaming)

1332
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:16,807
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1333
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,447
Think of it: eBay,

1334
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:23,748
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1335
01:05:23,748 --> 01:05:26,223
Comments, reviews.

1336
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:28,621
Think of what
it would do to him.

1337
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:32,999
His children, his family,
his career.

1338
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:35,265
(gasps)

1339
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:39,203
- (goons yelling in distance)
- We're not unreasonable.

1340
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:40,974
We'll gladly pay for it.

1341
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,932
We just...

1342
01:05:42,932 --> 01:05:44,901
Will you please shut up!

1343
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,111
That wasn't my idea!

1344
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:47,739
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1345
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:48,806
I was experimenting.

1346
01:05:48,806 --> 01:05:50,082
But you liked it.

1347
01:05:50,082 --> 01:05:51,380
- FLINT: No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1348
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,118
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1349
01:05:53,118 --> 01:05:54,548
Drunk on cock.

1350
01:05:54,548 --> 01:05:56,352
- FLINT: No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1351
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,024
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1352
01:05:58,024 --> 01:05:59,916
- To understand life.
- No!

1353
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,523
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1354
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:03,788
(groaning)

1355
01:06:03,788 --> 01:06:05,097
(screaming)

1356
01:06:05,097 --> 01:06:08,034
CHIEF: God, man,
what are you doing?!

1357
01:06:08,034 --> 01:06:10,201
- (both screaming)
- (Flint yelling)

1358
01:06:11,963 --> 01:06:14,205
(Marian and Jamie whimpering)

1359
01:06:24,976 --> 01:06:27,350
(Marian and Jamie
whimpering loudly)

1360
01:06:31,224 --> 01:06:33,092
(gun clicks)

1361
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:37,525
(clicking)

1362
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,530
Mommy.

1363
01:06:44,732 --> 01:06:46,765
(crying)

1364
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:55,939
(door opens, closes)

1365
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:58,480
(dogs barking, yelping
in distance)

1366
01:07:00,418 --> 01:07:02,649
(dogs barking in distance)

1367
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,191
MARIAN: All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1368
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:07,687
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1369
01:07:07,687 --> 01:07:08,952
Then we switch hotels.

1370
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:11,064
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1371
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:12,494
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1372
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:14,892
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1373
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:17,136
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1374
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:24,308
(barking)

1375
01:07:24,308 --> 01:07:26,475
WOMAN:
Next customer, please.

1376
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:29,280
SUKIE: Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1377
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,007
Don't ask me why.

1378
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:33,812
(line ringing)

1379
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:35,583
MAN (over phone):
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1380
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,420
JAMIE:
I need to speak to the senator.

1381
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,951
MAN: <i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1382
01:07:40,951 --> 01:07:43,360
Someone who has his...

1383
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:47,067
...personal effects.

1384
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:03,182
- (airplane engine whirring)
- (barking)

1385
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,496
- (line clicks)
- GARY (over phone): <i>Who is this?</i>

1386
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,827
Senator?

1387
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:24,302
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1388
01:08:24,302 --> 01:08:27,173
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1389
01:08:27,173 --> 01:08:30,770
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1390
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,409
Everybody's things.

1391
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:35,181
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1392
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,183
If you're not alone,

1393
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:39,218
believe me, I'll know it.

(Alice barking)

1395
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,460
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1396
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,055
made a phone call
from here last night.

1397
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:53,331
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1398
01:08:54,961 --> 01:08:56,829
Well, this is for her.

1399
01:08:56,829 --> 01:08:58,270
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1400
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,535
You've missed them.

1401
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,274
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1402
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,785
♪ ♪

1403
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,856
JAMIE: Done.

1404
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,892
With what?

1405
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:29,235
Tell you later.
