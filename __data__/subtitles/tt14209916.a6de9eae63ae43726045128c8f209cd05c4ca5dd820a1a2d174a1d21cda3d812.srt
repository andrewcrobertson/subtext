1
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,060
Whoo!

2
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,070
Yeah!

3
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,460
Whoo!

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Mmm, mmm.

5
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,520
Whoo!

6
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,280
Whoo!

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,370
Mwah.

8
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,930
Whoo!

9
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,100
<i>You know the first thing I thought</i>

10
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,050
<i>when I saw you?</i>

11
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,890
<i>I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."</i>

12
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,330
<i>What if it's a her?</i>

13
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,320
<i>What would you call her?</i>

14
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,590
<i>Ragni, maybe.</i>

15
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,120
Sorry?

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,940
Ragni.

17
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,120
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

18
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,470
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

19
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,130
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

20
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,566
You kidding me?

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,860
- Texas is, like, a state, you know?
- I know.

22
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,870
There's about three or four hours

23
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,310
till we reach the peak.

24
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,140
Ah, great.

25
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,060
Sweetie, can I just say one last thing?

26
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,760
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,330
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

28
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,850
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

29
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,290
and I've already made my decision, Elsa.

30
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,290
Yeah, it's just that I don't want

31
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,290
to use your brother's band.

32
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,770
- Why not?
- Honey...

33
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,380
He's super, super good.

34
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,300
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,166
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,730
Yeah, I know this.

37
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,480
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,000
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

39
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,430
His singing is like shit.

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,620
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

41
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,350
Olaf!

42
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,230
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, God.

43
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,760
Wait for me.

44
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,750
Why are you so sensitive?

45
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,330
Told you I could get us here.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
It's beautiful.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,110
Thank you.
I love you.

48
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,880
Elsa.

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,740
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

50
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,140
Look.

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,100
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,150
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

53
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,720
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

54
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,070
We have such good luck in nature.

55
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,170
What do you see?

56
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,000
Hmm?

57
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,520
It's demented or something.

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,030
What?

59
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,446
- Can I get the camera? Give me the camera.
- Yeah.

60
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
Demented?

61
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,960
I-I-I think we should leave it.

62
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,840
It's-it's something wrong with it.
Come on.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,270
- Come on..
- Ah!

64
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,700
- Shh. Come on.
- It's so cute.

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,240
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.

66
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,530
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

67
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,140
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

68
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,240
Oh, fuck.

69
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,730
Don't panic.

70
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,950
What do we do?

71
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,690
"If it's black, fight back.

72
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,690
If it's brown, lay down."

73
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,330
But is it black or is it brown?

74
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,690
I mean, it looks brown to me.

75
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,430
We're in Appalachia.
It's black.

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,230
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

77
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,090
You're not a bear expert.

78
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,920
Whatever you do, don't...

79
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,080
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,170
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
- Run!
- Where do we go?

82
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,750
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

83
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,890
Run!

85
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,890
He's coming!
Come on!

86
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,500
No! It's following...

87
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,770
Olaf! No!

88
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,120
God!

89
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,866
- Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

90
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,610
Olaf!

91
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,370
This is drugs.

92
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,810
This is your brain on drugs.

93
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,380
It isn't glamorous or cool or kid stuff.

94
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,730
The thrill can kill.

95
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,550
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

96
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,820
...and pulling the trigger.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,010
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

98
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,190
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

99
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,190
Kenley Jones reports tonight it was found

100
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,490
on the body of a man who fell to his death

101
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,500
when his parachute failed to open.

102
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,280
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,980
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

104
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,980
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

105
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,140
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

106
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,080
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

107
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,900
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,950
wrapped in football-size packages

109
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,860
in a duffel bag the chutist was carrying.

110
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,480
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

111
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,400
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

112
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
Nothing.

113
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,100
Here's the I.D.

114
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
I know who that is.

115
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,450
Full name:
Andrew C. Thornton II.

116
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,620
Man was out of his mind.

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,720
- What's the "C" stand for?
- Hmm?

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,850
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,206
Thornton was one of Syd
White's guys out of Missouri.

120
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,120
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

121
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,040
Part of the Bluegrass Conspiracy.

122
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,960
And there's more of this out there.

123
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,120
They dumped it somewhere.

124
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,270
Hey, Reba,
you have a dog, right?

125
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,010
Had.

126
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,880
Border collie. Barry.

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,140
Sorry for your loss.

128
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,150
Border collie, huh?

129
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,280
That's a cool dog.

130
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,670
Did he play fetch and stuff?

131
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,970
He loved fetch.

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
What?

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Nothing.
I just...

134
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,150
That's just awesome.

135
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,660
Damn it, Gabe.

136
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,360
Hi, Daveed.

137
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,010
Uh, mind if I order first?

138
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,140
This won't take long.

139
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,450
Damn, I just bought these.

140
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,550
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

141
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,850
Did you hear about Thornton?

142
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,900
It's a tough way to go.

143
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,210
He only had 30 kilos on him.

144
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,940
Any idea where we could find the rest?

145
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,480
Chattahoochee.

146
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,870
Georgia?

147
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,610
There's an area called Blood Mountain.

148
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,480
When the plane's going down,

149
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
the pilots know where to drop our load.

150
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,220
And then we just go and get it.

151
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,490
I don't need a bunch of worried Colombians.

152
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,320
Now, I want you to take Eddie with you.

153
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,750
Eddie's in mourning.

154
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,580
Joanie just died.

155
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,890
And he quit.

156
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,800
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,500
She's not here anymore.

158
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,670
The sooner he moves on, the better.

159
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,720
Syd, I-I just don't...

160
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
Stop.

161
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,070
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

162
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,340
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

163
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,630
Grandpa Syd, watch.

164
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah, that's great.

165
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,690
Got to go.
Shift starts at 8:00.

166
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,590
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

167
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
Chicken's in the microwave.

168
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,870
Just hit "start."

169
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Thought you were off tonight.

170
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,620
We talked about this, remember?

171
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,230
Me picking up some extra shifts?

172
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,710
You said you were okay with it.

173
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,410
I was okay with it until I realized

174
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,630
why you want those extra shifts--

175
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,580
so you could go and do overtime
with Ray the Pediatrician.

176
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,580
Gross, Dee Dee.
Gross.

177
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,550
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

178
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,340
this weekend to see his band play.

179
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,080
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

180
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,860
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

181
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,566
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

182
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,260
It's Nashville.

183
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,950
He's a good guy, Deirdra.

184
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,480
Just...

185
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,870
Give him a chance.

186
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,830
Please don't do that.

187
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,350
Do what?

188
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,230
You know what.

189
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,090
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

190
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,790
Close my door.

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,420
That's enough for today.

192
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,590
Wait, what?

193
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,590
Hey, Eddie.

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,770
They spelled her name wrong, Daveed.

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,260
- It says "John."
- Oh.

196
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,650
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

197
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,830
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

198
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,050
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

199
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,050
I got to wait a week for it to heal first.

200
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,270
I got seven more days of "John."

201
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,350
The chutist has been identified

202
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,010
as Andrew Thornton of Paris, Kentucky.

203
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,450
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

204
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,190
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

205
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,720
Says you haven't seen Gabe in weeks.

206
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm so sad, man.

207
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,860
I'm so fucking sad.

208
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,760
Okay?

209
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,600
Can I get the, uh...
the penne, please?

210
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,260
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

211
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,310
It's just plain.

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,580
I knew you'd be late.

213
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,760
It finally came in.
Check it out.

214
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,670
How many weeks' allowance is that?

215
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,760
Like a thousand, but worth it.

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,540
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

217
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,850
My mom is gonna be home soon.

218
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,810
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

219
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,770
Why by lunch?

220
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,460
The light, Henry.

221
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,560
But I got to go pee.

222
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
Go outside.

223
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,950
Why do I skip school with you?

224
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,350
You're bossier than the teachers.

225
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,090
Now, the adoption people--

226
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,260
I'm not sure who I talked to over there--

227
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,530
told me I was supposed to be
getting me a Lab.

228
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,270
A fun one, a...
a man's-best-friend type.

229
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,970
I don't know if there was an error,

230
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,750
because the one I got is just kind of...

231
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,540
- Bob?
- ...I don't know,

232
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,150
just kind of fancy.

233
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,800
- Bob, Captain says it's time to go.
- Got it.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,150
Hey, look, I'm gonna have to call you back.

235
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,240
Hey, Reba.

236
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,410
You got plans for tonight?

237
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,030
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

238
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,820
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after Rosette?

239
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,730
- Oh.
- I have to go to Georgia

240
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,040
for the Thornton case,

241
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,690
and you said you were good at dogs.

242
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,690
I said I had a dog.

243
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,390
You don't have jurisdiction in Georgia.

244
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,030
A trucker overheard a couple of guys

245
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,660
talking at a bar last night.

246
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,440
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

247
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,140
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

248
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

249
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,190
I only had her for a day.

250
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,010
Please?

251
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,491
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

252
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,110
Just go.

253
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,880
We'll be fine.

254
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Thanks.

255
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,420
Can't believe I left the backpack.

256
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,250
I can. I know the way.

257
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,030
School's gonna call, you know.

258
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,030
You know what?
Let 'em.

259
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,380
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

260
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,000
So's your dad.

261
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,780
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

262
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,560
For a girl who likes to be left alone,

263
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,170
you do a lot of shit for attention.

264
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,956
Look, I'm not ditching for attention.

265
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,356
I just want to paint the waterfall.

266
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,660
Admit it.

267
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,620
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

268
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,990
Jesus! Fuck!

269
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,350
Coral, it's Sari.

270
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,870
Is Dee Dee over there?

271
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,830
School just called.

272
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,220
No.

273
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,470
Yeah, well, can you just put Elliot on?

274
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,590
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

275
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,220
so can you please just put him on?

276
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,410
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

277
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,700
What the hell is wrong with him?

278
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,530
Never mind.

279
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,010
50 cents.

280
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm not gonna see that wrapper outside

281
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,950
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

282
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,210
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

283
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,390
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

284
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,770
Vest pocket.
Come on.

285
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,000
Is that perfume?

286
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,830
That's none of your business.

287
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,270
Well, it smells really nice.

288
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,700
Yeah, well, it's European.

289
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,140
Oh.

290
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,756
Yeah, I'm expecting someone in a minute.

291
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,450
Is it too much?

292
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,650
Not at all.

293
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,020
Smells expensive.

294
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,500
Well, it is.

295
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,330
You want a sucker?

296
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,410
Sure.

297
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,610
I like the green one.

298
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,330
This is a red one.

299
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,930
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

300
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,680
Oh, shit.
He's here.

301
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,870
Am I in the right place?

302
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,350
Oh! Right.

303
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,010
Told you it was big.

304
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,650
Oh, it's big.

305
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,660
What's that smell?

306
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,140
It's European.

307
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,630
Someone been smoking?

308
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,370
Um, he was.

309
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,800
- Can you believe it?
- What?

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,196
You know, cigarettes kill people.

311
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,980
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

312
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,070
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

313
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,160
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,420
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

315
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,080
Just get out of here.

316
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,600
Get out.

317
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,730
Unbelievable.

318
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,080
You got a dusty beaver here,
Ranger.

319
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,170
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

320
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,330
Hey, Henry!

321
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,160
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

322
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,670
Hold on.

323
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,980
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

324
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,380
Marking our territory.

325
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,210
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

326
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,900
I'm not shitting.

327
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,830
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

328
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,270
My dad didn't have a chance to make any.

329
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,910
Hey, Henry.

330
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,790
Check it out.

331
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,760
It's drugs, I think.

332
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,550
It's drugs?

333
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,770
Remember that guy from assembly?

334
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,990
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

335
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,750
Yeah.
The guy from Vietnam with no legs.

336
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,300
No.

337
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,430
This is definitely cocaine.

338
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,170
Yeah.
Of course.

339
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm just not used to seeing it like that.

340
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,120
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

341
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,270
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

342
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,480
When I do it.

343
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Oh, yeah?

344
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
With who?

345
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,270
With Faulk.

346
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,750
After church.

347
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,710
Faulk does not do cocaine after church.

348
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,230
Are you friends with Faulk?

349
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,450
No. He's a pervert.

350
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,760
Then you wouldn't know.

351
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,190
Liar.

352
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,410
You're just mad you're never invited.

353
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,460
I don't care I'm not invited.

354
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,620
Sounds like you care.

355
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,370
Do some, then.

356
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,940
What?

357
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,080
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,950
Well, uh, we're exercising, though.
Shooting and stuff.

359
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,870
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

360
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,350
That wouldn't be good.

361
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,740
Fine.

362
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,170
Knife me.

363
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,740
Okay, so how do I do it?

364
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,960
You eat it.

365
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
How much?

366
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,620
Like a tablespoon's worth.

367
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,250
Oh!

368
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,250
Son of a bitch!

369
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,250
Oh, what the hell?

370
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,080
Rookie.

371
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,650
You do it, then.

372
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,560
Ugh.

373
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,760
Ah, shit!

374
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,850
What the hell?

375
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,140
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

376
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,940
Ugh!

377
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,770
How much do you think this stuff is worth?

378
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,820
Let's sell drugs together.

379
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,950
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and Faulk.

380
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,640
There's more.

381
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,220
Ow.

382
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,740
Something got into it.

383
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,350
A deer, maybe.

384
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,570
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

385
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,270
It'd be like this.

386
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,010
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like-- bang!

387
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,730
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

388
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,320
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

389
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,280
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

390
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,200
Your dad has definitely done cocaine.

391
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,900
My throat's really runny.

392
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,810
Stop that.

393
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,700
Did it do the cocaine?

394
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,490
Don't move a muscle.

395
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,410
Listen to me.

396
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,500
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

397
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,630
- Now we have trouble. You understand?
- Got it.

398
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,890
I'll take care of it.

399
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,070
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

400
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,240
- Grandpa Syd!
- Gabe, driving me nuts.

401
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
Little...

402
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,630
Fuck.

403
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,840
Joan loved this song.

404
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,100
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

405
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,250
Um, Eddie, listen.

406
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,550
Uh, when Joanie died,

407
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

408
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,990
It's fine.

409
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,780
No, I could've did more.

410
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
It's fine.

411
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,150
I should've been there.

412
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,430
I didn't need you there.

413
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,046
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

414
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,390
It's against my constitution.

415
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,310
I'm more than a drug dealer.

416
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,660
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

417
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,010
We're friends, right?

418
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,210
No.

419
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,090
Fine.

420
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,410
I think he's happy she's dead.

421
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,020
He's not happy she died.

422
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,370
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

423
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,150
if we can call it that.

424
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,150
Sometimes...

425
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,420
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

426
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,070
No, Joanie died of cancer.

427
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,380
I know.

428
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,470
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

429
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,950
You can't give no one cancer.

430
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,600
Yes, you can.
With stress.

431
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,690
Stop protecting him.

432
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,610
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

433
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
No!

434
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,790
Okay.

435
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,010
Okay, so we start...

436
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,130
- Did you notice my nails?
- Those are beautiful.

437
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,280
- Thank you. We start...
- Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

438
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,500
I'm wearing the stuff.

439
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,330
Oh. Did either of you see a girl,

440
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,110
13, come through here?
My daughter...

441
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,160
You lost your daughter in the park.

442
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,730
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

443
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,730
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

444
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,560
Well, I didn't know she was coming here.

445
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,380
You know, we get a lot of runaways,

446
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,650
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

447
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,130
with the way things are at home.

448
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,520
She's not a runaway.

449
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
She just came to paint the...

450
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Can someone just please point me

451
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
in the direction of Blood Mountain?

452
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,920
This is Blood Mountain.

453
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
- Sorry. I-I'm Peter.
- Oh.

454
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,006
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

455
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,660
We're about to head up there ourselves.

456
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,190
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

457
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,740
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

458
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,100
is a very important process.

459
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,540
We wouldn't want you distracted

460
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,450
by our little damsel in distress here.

461
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,150
Nothing can distract me

462
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,630
from making sure
the entire biological community

463
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,410
is safe for all our friends.

464
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,200
Friends?

465
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

466
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,510
He doesn't like to call them animals.

467
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,810
Well, I won't be a burden.

468
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,550
I'll get my hat.

469
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,160
Okay.

470
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,170
Shoes okay for hiking?

471
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,050
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

472
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,920
- I have on boots.
- Yep.

473
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,480
Come on, Eddie.

474
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm done playing this game.

475
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,440
You-you wanted...

476
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,280
You were the one who wanted to play this.

477
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,100
You still have three more questions.

478
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,180
- Listen.
- What?

479
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,700
I'm tired of playing this fucking game.

480
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,500
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

481
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,930
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

482
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,600
I didn't know rangers carried guns.

483
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,160
Park rangers are peace officers.

484
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,300
Which means we can shoot people.

485
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,860
Forest is a dangerous place.

486
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,950
That gang of pubes are dangerous.

487
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,430
"Gang of pubes"?

488
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,870
Teens.
Delinquents.

489
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,310
They've been attacking hikers.

490
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,960
They hurt anyone?

491
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,130
They cut them with a knife.

492
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,530
Call themselves the Doochamps.

493
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,530
Watch your back.

494
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,190
Pop-art punks pop up out of nowhere.

495
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,490
Out of nowhere.

496
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,370
Fuck is this?

497
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,430
He's afraid, buds.

498
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,130
Empty your pockets.

499
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,650
No.

500
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,130
Empty your pockets, please.

501
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
Since you asked so nicely.

502
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,530
You think this is a joke?

503
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,010
I do.

504
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,060
Get him, buds.

505
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,976
I'm shaking a fucking knife, man.
Come on.

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,626
- Just stab him.
- Come on, man. It's a fucking knife!

507
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,100
Go on!

508
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,980
Oh!

509
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,420
Come on, Rocky.
Come on, Rocky.

510
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,110
- Come on, Rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

511
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,240
Give me this fucking board!

512
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,820
You're going down, man!

513
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,520
Submit!
Submit!

514
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,860
What the...

515
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,440
Hold this!

516
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,780
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

517
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,760
Oh, my.

518
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,730
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

519
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,330
Shit!

520
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,870
I love this road.

521
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,610
Ah, love it up there.

522
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,616
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

523
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,130
What?
The falls.

524
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,786
The Secret Falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

525
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,226
- or take the loop.
- I love the loop.

526
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,700
Well, you can see the top of the...

527
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,710
This is a more direct...

528
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,530
All right.
We're going this way.

529
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,320
Well, crap.

530
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,800
Told you she shouldn't have come with us.

531
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,930
Just distracting you completely.

532
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,580
She can hear you.

533
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,840
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

534
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,500
What's taking you so long?

535
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
What'd you do?

536
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,820
Please tell me you found them like this.

537
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
They attacked me.

538
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,110
Are they dead?

539
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,610
Well, one might be.

540
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,820
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

541
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,090
Jesus Chr... They're kids.

542
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,230
I loved this fucking jersey,
man.

543
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,790
Okay, they're fine.

544
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,970
Thank God.

545
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,570
No fucking way.

546
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,890
Daveed?

547
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,770
What happened?

548
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,970
Hey.

549
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,160
Wake up.

550
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,550
Where'd you find this?

551
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,120
Whoa.

552
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,690
Where is this energy coming from, bud?

553
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,340
You tried to fucking kill me.

554
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,690
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

555
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,870
I tell him that all the time.

556
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,830
Where did you find this?

557
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,520
Up on the mountain.

558
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Where's the rest of it?

559
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,740
I don't know.

560
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,310
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

561
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,966
What do you think I'll do to just you

562
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,010
when you're already on the floor?

563
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,060
Okay.
Okay.

564
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,760
We stashed it under a gazebo.

565
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,630
Going back for it later tonight.

566
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,590
A gazebo?

567
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,760
It's a pavilion-type structure.

568
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,500
I know what the fuck a gazebo is.

569
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,240
I didn't.

570
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,420
Are my buds dead?

571
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,940
- Show us where.
- Oh, God.

572
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,160
You know,
I-I'm feeling kind of tired.

573
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,600
I think I should rest.

574
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,600
Okay.
Want a dirt nap?

575
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,080
Eddie, go get the gun.

576
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,650
It's in the glove.

577
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,996
I prefer we left guns out of this.

578
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,740
Yeah.
Same.

579
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,830
And I would prefer not to be stabbed.

580
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,660
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

581
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,480
Okay.

582
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,970
Okay.

583
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,190
All right, all right.

584
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,000
All right, I'm coming.

585
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,140
Relax.

586
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,020
It's getting real cold out.

587
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,770
Let's go.

588
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,870
So, where you guys from?

589
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,750
Shut up.
Keep walking.

590
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,230
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

591
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,230
It better not be a long hike.

592
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,886
Friend's pretty serious, ain't he?

593
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,406
Well, I don't think he's too happy

594
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,950
after getting stabbed in the shoulder.

595
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,630
Well, it wasn't me.

596
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,280
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

597
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,670
Getting stabbed sucks.

598
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,200
Hey, shut the fuck up.

599
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,340
<i>Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.</i>

600
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,170
I was wondering how Rosette is doing.

601
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,310
Realized I hadn't said a proper goodbye.

602
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,130
I...

603
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,780
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

604
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,440
Anyway, I...

605
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,320
Thanks again for helping out.

606
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,920
Bye.

607
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,630
Look at this.

608
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,060
Oh, no.

609
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,410
Look at this mess.

610
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,420
People don't have any respect.

611
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,580
This is gonna end up in scat,
this plastic.

612
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,820
I... Let me pick that up.

613
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,070
- All right. Thank you, Ranger.
- Dee Dee!

614
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,036
- That is sticking.
- I got some oil in the car.

615
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,120
Dee Dee! Henry!

616
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,770
'Cause if that stays open,

617
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,696
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

618
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,650
What kind of critters?
Huh?

619
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,386
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

620
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,430
- Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

621
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,000
- Dee Dee!
- Uh, skunks.

622
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,520
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

623
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,440
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

624
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,576
- Yeah, with their cute little outfit.
- I think they're cute.

625
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,660
Uh, skunks.

626
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Skunks. Hmm.

627
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,110
- Possums.
- Possums.

628
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,410
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

629
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,360
- Uh...
- Hey, possum.

630
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,456
Mrs. McKinndry!

631
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,800
Henry?

632
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,540
Here! Hello?

633
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,800
Henry?

634
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,280
Up here!

635
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,550
- Hey. Whoa.
- Oh.

636
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,350
Henry, what are you doing up there?

637
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,590
No.

638
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,380
- No, that's not safe at all.
- No.

639
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,290
It's too high.
You got to come down.

640
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,690
Get down here.

641
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,430
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

642
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,210
- No shit, Henry.
- It's high.

643
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,650
But there was a bear.

644
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,040
A really terrible bear.

645
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,650
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

646
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,520
- It was fucked!
- Hey!

647
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,520
That's inappropriate.

648
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,790
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

649
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,270
It attacked you?

650
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,310
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
- No, no.

651
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,360
Bears are very peaceful creatures.

652
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,200
You must have done something to upset it.

653
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,940
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

654
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,060
Nothing!
Y'all need to hide!

655
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,850
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

656
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,850
You have to listen to me!

657
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,720
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

658
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,420
The monster took her.

659
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,550
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

660
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,330
Get down here now.

661
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,730
A...

662
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,950
I...

663
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,560
Dee Dee!

664
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,740
Whoa!

665
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,930
Peter!

666
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,800
- No!
- Peter!

667
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,240
Oh! Oh, no!

668
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,110
It let me go!
He ran off!

669
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,330
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

670
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,680
Is it gone?

671
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,630
Do you see it?

672
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,560
Yeah.

673
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,700
Why are you shooting at me?

674
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,960
Get your ass down!

675
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,440
This is your fault.

676
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,990
Right behind you.
I saw it.

677
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,300
Stay down.

678
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,140
What?

679
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,200
Help me!

680
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,070
Help!

681
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,090
Ranger! Ranger!

682
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,570
Did it get you?

683
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,960
That asshole!

684
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,310
I'm gonna get him.

685
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,790
I'm gonna get that asshole.

686
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,540
I'll get help.

687
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,930
Where are you going?

688
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,320
God Almighty.

689
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,310
Hey.
What...

690
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,320
Where is it?

691
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,620
Hey!

692
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,810
What should I do?

693
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,420
Motherfucker!

694
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,810
Come back!
Help us!

695
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,040
Oh, fuck!

696
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,780
There's something wrong with it.

697
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,220
Yeah, I told you there was.

698
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,480
Why is it acting like this?

699
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,530
Did you feed it cocaine?

700
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,790
No. But you're safe.

701
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,710
Bears can't climb trees.

702
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,050
Of course they can!

703
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,060
Then why are you up here?

704
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,420
It's okay.
It's okay.

705
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,490
Okay.

706
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,070
No.

707
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,300
Henry, climb.
Henry, go.

708
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,740
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

709
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,300
- Climb.
- Go, Henry!

710
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,610
Go!

711
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,600
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

712
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,620
Go up!

713
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,490
Henry, go!

714
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,390
Oh, God.

715
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,010
- Go, Henry! No!
- Whoa!

716
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,230
No!

717
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,320
Oh, God.
Henry!

718
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh, God.

719
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,590
Oh, shit.

720
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,390
No, no, no, no!

721
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,570
Get off of me!
No, no!

722
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,750
Get off! Get off of me!

723
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,020
Henry, jump!
Jump down!

724
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,150
Move, Henry!

725
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,030
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

726
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,510
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

727
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,640
Come on. Let's go.

728
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,680
Come on.

729
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,920
Go. Hide.
Come here. Come here.

730
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,570
That was so messed up.

731
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,240
That little man was an expert on bears

732
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,940
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

733
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,770
Wait.
What did you say?

734
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,420
We found cocaine, Mrs. McKinndry.

735
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,376
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

736
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,550
and then went crazy on me and Dee Dee

737
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,860
and now on that guy back there.

738
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,780
Did you hear him scream?

739
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,080
He's so dead.

740
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,690
I'd love to not remember that.

741
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,700
But it kind of seems like

742
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,340
the thing that stays with a man forever.

743
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,350
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

744
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,360
Alive?
Yeah.

745
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,040
It chased her that way.

746
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,010
We got to go.
Let's go.

747
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,450
He get at you, too?

748
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,240
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

749
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,750
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

750
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,680
Keep him awake.

751
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,110
Yeah, I've been trying.

752
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,700
You piles of shit!

753
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,140
- You're the Doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

754
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,780
We found it.

755
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,700
"It's not ours."

756
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,230
I'm a park ranger.

757
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,410
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

758
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,280
They say I can't keep my park safe,

759
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,630
that I'm unfit for the big leagues.

760
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,500
I'd have been at Yellowstone by now

761
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,820
if it weren't for you shits!

762
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,980
- Buds.
- Huh?

763
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,160
There's someone outside.

764
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,810
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

765
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,120
Yeah.

766
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,040
Now, uh, open it when I-I count to three.

767
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,000
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

768
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,390
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

769
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,950
He took a bite out of my ass!

770
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,250
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

771
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,860
Now, open it when I say so.

772
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,650
Now.

773
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,570
That's a fucking bear.

774
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,580
What the fuck?!

775
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,750
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

776
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,120
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

777
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,340
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

778
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,540
Where's the bear?!

779
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,430
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

780
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,210
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

781
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,290
Close the door.

782
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,430
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, bud.

783
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,310
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

784
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,380
Shh.

785
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,560
He's up there.

786
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,960
He's up there.

787
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,720
I got it.
I got it.

788
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,700
Maybe the kid can help you.

789
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,000
Look, I'm done playing this game.

790
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,830
- What game?
- 20 questions.

791
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,400
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

792
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,790
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

793
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,930
Like, "Is it a spider?

794
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,930
Is it an arrow?"

795
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,360
What are you, new?

796
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,416
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

797
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,670
Everybody knows that.

798
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,330
Look, are we close to the gazebo?

799
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,030
Is that one of your questions?

800
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,680
Oh, is it bigger than a bread box?

801
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,850
No, no, no.
Daveed needs to ask.

802
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,240
Ask him if it's bigger than a bread box.

803
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,900
Is it bigger than a bread box?

804
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,430
- Yes.
- Whoo!

805
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,780
Yeah!

806
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,520
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

807
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,740
What?
No.

808
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,000
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

809
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,050
You have one question left.

810
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,930
Dee Dee!
Dee Dee!

811
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,500
You sure this is the way?

812
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,670
Pretty sure.

813
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,730
Dee Dee!
It's okay.

814
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,330
It's Mama.

815
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,770
Oh.

816
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,610
Thank God.

817
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,520
Ew! What the heck?

818
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,830
It's paint.
It's just red paint.

819
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,220
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

820
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,220
I'm a nurse, Henry.

821
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,910
Good point.

822
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,830
Come on.

823
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,140
Oh, smart girl.

824
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,670
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

825
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,720
Mrs. McKinndry, have you ever done cocaine?

826
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,240
What?

827
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,810
Why do you ask?

828
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,070
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects--

829
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,470
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

830
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,820
Well, it could create a habit for the bear.

831
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,390
What if they never want to do it again?

832
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,910
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

833
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,830
But Mama Bear and Papa Bear
would be very angry

834
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,090
because drugs--
especially cocaine--

835
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,310
are very, very bad.

836
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,010
What if they would never find out?

837
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,570
Oh, Henry.

838
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,840
We always find out.

839
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,670
Dee Dee!

840
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,610
Medic!

841
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,126
Just open it.

842
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,480
Yeah, open it. You think?

843
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,650
Can you just push? Harder.

844
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,136
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

845
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,396
- All right. You go.
- Let me do it.

846
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
You go. Yeah.

847
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,710
Please, show me how it's done.

848
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,040
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

849
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,060
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

850
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,100
What is that?

851
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,100
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

852
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,740
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

853
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,586
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

854
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,326
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

855
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,420
Oh, fuck.

856
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,856
Come on.

857
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,460
God, I'm trying.

858
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,030
Come on, push.

859
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,470
I'm trying.

860
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,420
You said they called in a concussion.

861
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,940
They did.

862
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,910
Jesus.

863
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,480
This guy's been shot.

864
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,310
Yeah.
Obviously.

865
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,880
Holy shit.

866
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
It's the ranger.

867
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,490
Tom.

868
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,260
Come here.
She's got a gun.

869
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,310
Tom!
Hello?

870
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,280
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

871
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
It's okay.

872
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,160
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

873
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,250
B...
B...

874
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,500
"Buh"?

875
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,600
B...
B...

876
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,320
Beth?

877
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,310
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

878
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,840
Uh...

879
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,250
Beth, we should go.

880
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,130
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

881
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,270
Bear.

882
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,960
Bear.

883
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,980
Let's go.

884
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,880
Tom, get up!

885
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,240
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

886
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,860
Hang on.
Push.

887
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,350
Oh, shit.

888
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,310
Sorry. Sorry.

889
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,310
Come on. Come on.

890
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,836
Anybody else surprised by

891
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,236
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

892
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,490
Leave him!

893
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,256
Our next story, the weather

894
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,126

- Go! Drive!

896
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,350
- Tom, get in!
- Wait! Wait!

897
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:11,340
- Wait!
- Oh, God.

898
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,920
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

899
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,920
Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

900
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,320
What the fuck is wrong with that bear?

901
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,490
What the hell have you got a gun for?

902
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,020
Hey, move! Move!

903
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,220
Put that away!

904
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,290
Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

905
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,550
- Oh, shit!
- Kill it!

906
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,770
Not the tree!

907
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,380
- The big fucking bear!
- Shut up!

908
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,030
Why is it chasing us?

909
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,510
Tom, try to shut the fucking door!

910
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,950
Close the fucking door, you dumbass!

911
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,590
Guys, you got to stop yelling at me!

912
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,120
Oh, shit.

913
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,660
Beth, speed up!

914
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,810
I don't know how to talk to him, you know.

915
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,890
Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

916
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,120
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

917
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,780
And what a man you are.

918
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,600
Attacking innocent people for no reason.

919
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,910
Can you not?

920
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,130
I'm sorry.
Just continue.

921
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,130
Well, when my daddy died,

922
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,570
my mama bought me this pet lizard.

923
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,530
It was the coolest little thing.

924
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,700
It had all these green scales on it.

925
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,010
She used to call it a tiny dinosaur.

926
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,880
I thought that was so awesome.

927
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,490
I was real bad at connecting with people,

928
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,170
but I practiced conversation starters

929
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,150
on that lizard every day.

930
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:40,060
And then
that's how I met Rocky and Joe.

931
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,240
That's my team, man.

932
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,280
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

933
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,380
Those are my buds, man.

934
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,900
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

935
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,730
Well, you know what?

936
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,340
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

937
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,390
but people...

938
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,990
people are good at hearing.

939
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,180
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

940
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,010
- Can we...
- It's okay.

941
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,890
Y'all are hugging.

942
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,310
It's okay.

943
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,060
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

944
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:39,390
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

945
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,920
I'm already angry with you.

946
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,140
It's gone.

947
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,500
What the actual...

948
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,286
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

949
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,716
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

950
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,220
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

951
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,766
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

952
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,070
It's just gone.

953
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,290
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

954
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,410
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

955
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,600
I'm-a give you one more chance.

956
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,340
Where's the ba...

957
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,160
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

958
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,520
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

959
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,000
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

960
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,390
I ain't fucking around.

961
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,560
Just do it.

962
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,960
Fuck.

963
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,010
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

964
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,660
I'm coming down there.

965
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,540
Uh...

966
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,600
Uh...

967
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,850
Uh...

968
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,210
Uh...

969
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,170
Shh!

970
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,170
I'm just trying to...

971
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,260
find a safe spot to hop down.

972
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,260
How did you get up there?

973
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,390
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

974
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:02,000
I hurt my hip a little.

975
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,610
I can try to catch you if you want.

976
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,170
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

977
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,190
Let's, uh, see, uh...

978
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,490
Get it.

979
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,840
Fuck!

980
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,410
Fuck!

981
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,586
Well, you brought that on yourself, kid.

982
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,200
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

983
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,850
I told you not to move.

984
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,940
How'd he take those two fingers off?

985
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,730
They're not even next to each other.

986
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,170
Fuck you!

987
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,950
Come out of there!

988
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,690
Shit! Come on out!

989
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,470
No fucking way!

990
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,910
God! Goddamn it!

991
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,220
You two, on your bellies.

992
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,350
Now! And no more moving.

993
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,360
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

994
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,710
Can you grab them for me?

995
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:54,010
Can I grab his fingers?

996
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,660
Okay.
Get 'em. Get 'em.

997
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,700
Slow.
Slow.

998
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,850
Easy.

999
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,360
Ugh, God.

1000
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,810
All right.

1001
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,380
Now, you get back on your belly.

1002
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,200
I'll hold on to these.

1003
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,860
Now, where you at?

1004
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,120
Shit.

1005
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,700
What?

1006
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,210
Oh, no. The river.

1007
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,180
Henry, look.

1008
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,270
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

1009
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,530
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

1010
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,320
We're on the right track.

1011
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,050
I can feel it.

1012
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,150
Mama?

1013
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,560
Fuck.

1014
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,340
Fuck, man.

1015
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,680
My fucking jersey, man.

1016
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,040
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

1017
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,700
Until that guy in the gazebo

1018
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,390
throws his weapon into the woods.

1019
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,570
Well, then we'll be here forever.

1020
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,960
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1021
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,790
We don't need to die because of this.

1022
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,790
Eddie, I got this.

1023
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,140
Do you?

1024
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,930
I have your fingers in my pocket.

1025
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,500
You're all gonna get arrested.

1026
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,850
Drug sentences since Nixon are fucked,

1027
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,590
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1028
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,630
of shitting in front of your cellmate

1029
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,590
and supervised shower time.

1030
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,940
Detective, Your Honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1031
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,640
I've never even done coke.

1032
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,730
I mean, maybe once.
Once-- at a party once.

1033
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,990
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1034
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,776
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1035
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,476
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1036
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,210
I like to shit in peace.

1037
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,910
Nobody move.

1038
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,790
It's a bear.

1039
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,360
Yeah.

1040
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,320
No, no.

1041
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,960
I'm not falling for none of your...

1042
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,340
Oh, fuck.

1043
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,340
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1044
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,690
Just play dead.

1045
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,230
Shh.

1046
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,090
Oh, fuck.

1047
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,460
Oh, man.
You fucked.

1048
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,650
Eddie, can you breathe?

1049
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,550
What the fuck?

1050
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,100
I think that's a yes.

1051
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,720
Can someone do something?

1052
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,250
Maybe your boy can do something.

1053
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,990
Can you just, like... move it?

1054
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,770
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1055
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,350
Dee Dee!

1056
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,340
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1057
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,220
Oh, God.

1058
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,180
Look.

1059
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,960
Hello.

1060
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,800
Is he okay?

1061
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,670
Help me, please.

1062
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,630
Does he have food?

1063
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,110
Her name was Elsa,

1064
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,330
and she was so beautiful.

1065
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,550
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1066
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,850
Were you attacked?

1067
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,670
Devil bear.

1068
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,946
My... I'm looking for my daughter.

1069
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,206
She was attacked by the devil bear.

1070
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,230
Have you seen her?

1071
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,780
You have?

1072
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,040
- Was she alive?
- Yes.

1073
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,916
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1074
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,566
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1075
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,590
I haven't...

1076
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,910
Henry!

1077
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,020
I'll show you.

1078
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,140
I'll show you.
Come.

1079
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,370
It's not moving.

1080
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,850
I think it died.

1081
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,940
It died on top of me?

1082
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,250
Check its pulse.

1083
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,770
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1084
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,980
I'm not sure.

1085
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,080
Uh, hey, guy?

1086
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Detective.

1087
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,560
Can we call a truce

1088
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,310
so I can see if the bear is dead?

1089
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,690
Yeah.

1090
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,350
Fuck.

1091
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,840
You okay?

1092
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,960
What do you think?

1093
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,430
S-Still breathing.

1094
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:07,520
We should go.

1095
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,040
He'll probably be all right.

1096
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,130
What the hell, man?

1097
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,610
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1098
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,480
Well, that's exactly what I'm afraid of.

1099
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,790
"She."

1100
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,220
What?

1101
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,960
The bear is a girl.

1102
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,700
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1103
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,610
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1104
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,450
Oh, shit.
She's moving.

1105
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,930
She's awake.

1106
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,190
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1107
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,840
Okay.

1108
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:40,900
Chill out. Just chill out!

1109
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,860
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1110
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,540
Stay back.

1111
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:50,250
What the hell?

1112
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,860
Okay. Okay.

1113
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,040
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1114
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,870
I will be goddamned.

1115
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:02,440
Should we shoot her?

1116
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,790
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1117
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,740
What the fuck?

1118
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,070
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1119
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,940
- Eddie!
- Daveed, help.

1120
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,510
What is this?

1121
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,030
No, no.

1122
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,946
- Ooh! Okay, I have...
- What is it doing?

1123
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,430
I-I don't like this.

1124
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,950
Please stop.

1125
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,040
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1126
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,160
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
- Don't shoot!

1127
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,220
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1128
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,576
Eddie, you got to fight back, all right?

1129
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,656
It's-it's playing with you.

1130
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,920
I'd stay still if I were you.

1131
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,140
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1132
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,360
Eddie, please don't die like this.
Eddie, please.

1133
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,750
Daveed!

1134
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,450
All we've been through!
Come on!

1135
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,890
Come on, help him!

1136
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:58,930
Get lower.
You're not listening!

1137
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,330
Eddie.

1138
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,020
Oh, my God.
He's gonna die.

1139
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,500
No!

1140
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,190
Hey, girl.

1141
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,680
There you go, girl.

1142
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,340
There you go.

1143
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,960
There you go.

1144
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,220
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1145
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,850
Go!

1146
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:47,490
Don't have to tell me twice.

1147
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,510
Come on!

1148
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:52,710
Daveed!

1149
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,420
That bag's worth 14 million.

1150
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,380
We had a truce, and a truce
is on God where I'm from.

1151
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,910
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1152
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,820
I need that bag.

1153
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,910
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1154
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,210
We're taking that bag to Syd, Eddie.

1155
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,180
Shot...

1156
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,090
No. I didn't.

1157
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,230
Run! Go, go!

1158
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,800
Oh, shit!

1159
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,910
Holy shit.

1160
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,876
- Dad. What are you doing here?
- Oh, shit.

1161
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,960
Where's Gabe?

1162
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,526
You didn't bring him here, did you?

1163
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,960
Calm down.

1164
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,090
He's safe at home watching TV.

1165
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,960
What?
How long has he been alone?

1166
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,710
You left him with me!

1167
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,660
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1168
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,310
Huh?

1169
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,150
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1170
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,670
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1171
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,810
The bear ate most of it.

1172
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,810
- What?
- The bear.

1173
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,770
It fucking did cocaine.

1174
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:20,380
A fucking...

1175
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,510
A bear did cocaine, Dad!

1176
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:23,860
Fuck this!

1177
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,780
Seriously, fuck this entire journey.

1178
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,690
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1179
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:31,690
Look at me.
Look at me.

1180
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,740
I'm on the hook here.

1181
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:38,480
A lot of cocaine was lost under my eye.

1182
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,310
And the people that I deal with,

1183
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,700
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1184
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,840
And look at me.

1185
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,230
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1186
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:51,670
if I don't get them every penny's worth.

1187
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:53,540
You hear what I'm saying?

1188
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,500
It's you and Gabe.

1189
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,490
You understand?

1190
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,060
We don't have a choice.

1191
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,420
There's a bag with the cop and the bear

1192
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,420
over at the pavilion structure.

1193
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,730
Come on.

1194
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,990
Come on, son.
Come on.

1195
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,490
Who's there?

1196
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,490
- Easy.
- Stay away.

1197
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,060
Where's the duffel?

1198
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,710
I gave it to the bear.

1199
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,710
You gave it to the bear?

1200
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,920
Yeah. The bear.

1201
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,360
It loves coke.

1202
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,330
Wh-Which way did it go?

1203
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,330
I'm not fucking around here.

1204
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:47,030
Syd White.

1205
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,380
Man, I've been following you for years.

1206
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,160
They all have.

1207
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:58,740
Reba.

1208
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,220
Oh, I always knew you were my girl.

1209
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,520
I got you now.

1210
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,530
Be careful when you cuff these guys.

1211
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,130
They're kind of shifty.

1212
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,840
What...

1213
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,400
What are you doing?

1214
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,410
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1215
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,240
You shot him?

1216
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,520
I told you not to hurt him.

1217
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,110
I don't work for you.

1218
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,900
The department trusted you.

1219
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,550
The state of Tennessee trusted you.

1220
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:35,210
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1221
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,040
I know.

1222
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,300
- I trusted you with Rosette.
- I know.

1223
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,260
Who's Rosette?

1224
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,520
The dog in my car.

1225
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,960
You left a dog in the car?

1226
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,910
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1227
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,820
How is she?

1228
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,710
She being a good girl?

1229
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:00,190
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1230
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,580
E-Enough.

1231
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,760
Tell me which way the bear went,

1232
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,330
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1233
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,940
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1234
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,070
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1235
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,900
but that's just me.

1236
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,810
Well, what do you guys say?

1237
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:16,950
What's so funny?

1238
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:21,600
Apex predator,

1239
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,820
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1240
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:33,570
Dead north, man.

1241
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,490
Yes, we will.

1242
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,270
Dead... dead north.

1243
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,960
Let's go.

1244
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,010
The devil bear is in there.

1245
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:26,670
You can't go in there.

1246
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,060
Do you have kids?

1247
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,710
We would have.

1248
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,370
I have to go find mine.

1249
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,580
And his name would be Texas.

1250
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,150
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1251
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,850
Here.

1252
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,080
Thank you.

1253
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,650
Bye, lady and little man.

1254
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,460
Bye, you both.

1255
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,300
Okay.

1256
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,430
Wait. What about me?

1257
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,580
Watch where you step.

1258
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,850
I got you. Stay close.

1259
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,370
What's that?

1260
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,650
Don't move.

1261
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:36,290
Stay still, Henry.

1262
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,440
They look like polar bears.

1263
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,640
Henry?

1264
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,830
Dee Dee?

1265
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,440
- Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1266
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,316
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1267
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,276
- No, no. Them, they're... they're harmless.
- Dee Dee!

1268
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,570
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1269
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,740
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1270
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,110
Are you hurt?

1271
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,546
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1272
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:00,890
That looks really deep.

1273
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:02,940
- Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow! Ow! Henry!

1274
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,500
Let's keep you warm.

1275
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,020
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1276
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,380
You smart girl.

1277
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,990
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1278
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,470
We found you.

1279
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,030
Put that on.

1280
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,820
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1281
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,470
Oh, my God.

1282
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,040
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

1283
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,256
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1284
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,280
Henry told me everything.

1285
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:21,780
Everything?

1286
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,266
You mean that you guys did drugs?

1287
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,700
- You told her?
- No.

1288
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,660
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1289
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,010
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1290
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,880
Um, what was that?

1291
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,830
Cocaine bear's back.

1292
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,490
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1293
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:38,890
Come on.
Let's go, Henry.

1294
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,280
Go that way.

1295
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,540
Go ahead.

1296
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,410
It's okay.
Come on.

1297
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,460
Look. It's a way out.

1298
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,200
- It's the falls.
- Oh, wow.

1299
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,090
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1300
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,170
Oh, God.

1301
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,000
This is it.

1302
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:03,100
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1303
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,580
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1304
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,410
You saw what that bear did to that hiker.

1305
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,840
What is that?

1306
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,070
Oh, fuck!

1307
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,240
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

1308
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,240
Come on.

1309
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,210
Eddie.

1310
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,380
Take this.

1311
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,000
Fuck.

1312
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:47,090
Thank you.

1313
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:58,680
Goddamn bear.

1314
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,280
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1315
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,600
You got what you wanted?

1316
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,810
Let's go.

1317
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,480
There's-there's a lot more out there.

1318
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,210
We got to keep looking, understand?

1319
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,100
We're not whole yet.

1320
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,180
I'm leaving, Syd.

1321
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,660
Go.

1322
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,300
Give me the bag.

1323
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,180
When did you all get so soft?

1324
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,170
All got sand in your pussies.

1325
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,710
Mom! How are we gonna get out of here?

1326
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,750
It's a dead end.
What do we do?

1327
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,530
Stay away from the bears.

1328
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,800
This way.

1329
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,500
Come on.
There's an opening.

1330
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,680
Henry, come here.

1331
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,020
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1332
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,760
He has a gun.

1333
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,910
No!

1334
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,600
Come on!

1335
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,260
The hell is this?

1336
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,650
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1337
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:46,520
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1338
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,350
I'm a mom.

1339
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,310
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1340
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,620
No, I'm not leaving without that cocaine!

1341
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:56,840
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1342
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,400
You understand?

1343
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,410
Go.

1344
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:04,290
- Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1345
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,160
It's stuck.

1346
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Fuck!

1347
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,250
Who are these guys?

1348
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,900
We're going home.

1349
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,126
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1350
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,460
Nobody's going anywhere!

1351
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,950
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1352
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,740
- Dad!
- Shut...

1353
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,570
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1354
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,170
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1355
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,270
Fuck.

1356
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,310
Get back!
Get... Fuckers!

1357
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,580
Stay away.

1358
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,780
- Whoa.
- Stay away.

1359
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:39,860
Whoa.
He hit the bear.

1360
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,230
Just give 'em the bag.

1361
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,020
Shoot the fucking bears!

1362
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,716
- Get over here.
- Whoa!

1363
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,326
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1364
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,230
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1365
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:49,880
The fuck's the matter with you?

1366
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,900
Shoot the little fucking cubs, Eddie!

1367
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,460
Get 'em off me!

1368
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,860
- Fuck him.
- Help me out!

1369
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,250
Ow. Eddie!

1370
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,980
- Ow!
- No.

1371
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,240
Coward.
Daveed!

1372
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,680
Here, catch.

1373
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,820
I am taking the fucking children home.

1374
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,050
Mama!

1375
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,010
Hell yeah, Mrs. McKinndry.

1376
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,310
Look around, Dad.

1377
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,360
Kids have been dragged into this.

1378
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,530
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1379
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,320
People are dead.

1380
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,450
You are no son of mine.

1381
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,760
Hey, you!

1382
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,370
You did this.

1383
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:30,026
You're the reason this is all happening.

1384
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,200
And it's a good thing he's not like you,

1385
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,200
because you're a piece of crap person

1386
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,370
and a bad dad!

1387
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:37,810
Who the fuck are you?

1388
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,940
I'm Henry,

1389
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,640
and I am so fucking tired!

1390
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,840
Yeah, me, too.

1391
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1392
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,800
She's protecting the cubs.

1393
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Oh, shit!

1394
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,550
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1395
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,856
- What? I'll be fine!
- It's gonna be okay.

1396
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,980
We're gonna be okay.

1397
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,240
Here, here, here.

1398
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,810
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1399
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,466
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1400
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:27,080
We're gonna be all right.

1401
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,690
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1402
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,950
Three, two, one. Jump!

1403
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,510
Oh, shit.

1404
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,840
Oh, shit.
We got to jump.

1405
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,660
Let's go!

1406
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,130
Come on. It's okay.

1407
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:33,060
- Eddie. Help.
- We made it.

1408
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:26,010
Get the shit out of here, you fuck!

1409
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,410
Oh, shit. He shot you.

1410
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,190
Help!
Help!

1411
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,330
S-Six more days of John.

1412
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:17,200
Okay.

1413
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,070
Six more days...

1414
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,510
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1415
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:23,730
You're more than a drug dealer, all right?

1416
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,520
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1417
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,810
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1418
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,480
Hey, hey, I...

1419
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,440
I got my last question.

1420
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,790
What?

1421
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,350
It's 20 questions.

1422
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,180
I got my last one.

1423
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,960
What?
All right. Sure.

1424
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,360
Is it Joanie?

1425
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,800
It's Joanie, right?

1426
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1427
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,370
How'd you guess?

1428
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:54,020
You're so fucking obvious.

1429
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:55,980
I just didn't want to guess it

1430
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,810
to have you crying on me all day.

1431
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,820
She's a nurse!

1432
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,430
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1433
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,650
He's in shock.

1434
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,520
Put pressure on him.

1435
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,890
I've called backup.

1436
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:17,180
Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1437
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:20,240
You should get going.

1438
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,360
Take care of yourself.

1439
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,720
Hi. Hi.

1440
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,770
Rosette.

1441
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,570
Whose dog is this?

1442
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,010
I think it's mine.

1443
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,700
Mine and Gabe's.

1444
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,140
Is it on cocaine?

1445
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,130
No.

1446
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,610
That's a good dog.

1447
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:00,980
So we just grab Gabe and go, right?

1448
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:02,450
Yeah.

1449
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,030
I knew you'd be okay.

1450
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:10,420
You're the toughest person I know.

1451
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,290
I think you get that from your mom.

1452
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,730
I think you're right.

1453
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,730
Thanks for coming to get me.

1454
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,040
I'm your mom.
I love you.

1455
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,910
You, too, Henry.

1456
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,260
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed Ray
on you too soon.

1457
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:27,040
No.
You deserve to be happy.

1458
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:30,090
Henry, let's walk over here.

1459
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:32,446
- Stay away from that. Come on.
- I want to look.

1460
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:33,830
I also don't want to look.

1461
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:35,440
- Ugh.
- Don't look.

1462
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,840
Let's just cruise on by.

1463
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,280
Oh, here come the po-po.

1464
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,760
Hey, Mom.

1465
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,110
I want to go to Nashville
with you and Ray.

1466
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,930
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1467
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,370
Rehab?

1468
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:50,020
We're cokeheads now.

1469
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:51,680
You know?

1470
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,246
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1471
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:54,670
- Mrs. McKinndry.
- Mm-hmm.

1472
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,800
Yeah, you're too grounded for rehab.

1473
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,100
Rodney, are you getting it?

1474
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:16,090
I swear to God, Carol.

1475
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,790
Well, then zoom in.

1476
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,910
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1477
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,710
Oh, they're so cute.

1478
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,230
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1479
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:25,490
Wait.

1480
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:27,170
Why are they looking at us like that?

1481
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,760
Oh.

1482
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,590
Oh, shit.

1483
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:07,450
Hey.

1484
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:09,660
Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hey.

1485
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,920
Daddy!

1486
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:03,160
- Is that for me?
- Hey.

1487
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,510
Yeah, what do you think?

1488
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,060
What's it eating?

1489
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,600
Oh, my God.

1490
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,610
They're weren't gonna put 'em back on.
