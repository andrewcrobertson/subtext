None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

968

so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

969
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,520
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

970
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,400
a man he'd never met before
in his life--

971
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,320

Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

980
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,840
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

981
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,480
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

982
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,320
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

983
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,160

he could hide something-- his ass.

he wore this watch up his ass.

- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1767
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:07,300
Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1768
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:10,660
- Would you make me a cup ?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1769
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:14,860
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it ?

1770
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,380
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1771
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:22,700
About the car, is there anything
I need to know ? Does it stall ?

1772
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:26,060
Does it smoke ? Does it make
a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?

1773
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:29,420
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive ?

1774
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:32,780
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1775
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:36,740
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1776
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:38,740
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:46,980
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1779
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:53,460
Mmm.

1780
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,540
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1781
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,420
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1782
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,100
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1783
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:05,940
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1784
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:09,300
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1785
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:13,220
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1786
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:17,100
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1787
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:19,980
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1788
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:22,860
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1789
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:27,100
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1790
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:31,100
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1791
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:33,500
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1792
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:36,380
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1793
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:39,940
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1794
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:45,100
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1795
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:47,020
with quilts and blankets,

1796
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:50,860
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1797
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:53,660
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1798
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:55,700
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1799
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,460
"Please" would be nice.

1800
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:01,700
- Come again ?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1801
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:07,180
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1802
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:11,740
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1803
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,140
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1804
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:17,940
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1805
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:21,220
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1806
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:24,100
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.

1807
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:26,820
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1808
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,860
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1809
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:34,340
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right ? I can feel your look.

- No, no, please. Go ahead.

from jingling and jangling ?

Hey, what is it ?

2074
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:01,140
What is it ?

2075
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:03,700
Is that what I think it is ?

2076
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,340
Mm-hmm.

2077
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,900
It's beautiful.

2078
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:12,420
[ Giggling ]
Goddamn it, what is it ?

2079
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:16,660
You let him go !
You let him go !

2080
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:19,580
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you !
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2081
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,460
- Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
Say, "Bitch, be cool !"
- Be cool ! Be cool !

2082
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:25,140
- Tell that bitch to chill !
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !

2083
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:27,980
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2084
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:29,780
- Let go of him !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2085
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:32,660
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right !
- I promise !

2086
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,540
- Tell her to chill !
- Chill out, Honey Bunny !

2087
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:36,460
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2088
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:39,820
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we ?

2089
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:42,700
- Don't you hurt him !
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !

2090
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:46,140
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?

2091
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:49,700
- Come on, Yolanda !
What's Fonzie like ?
- He's cool.

2092
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,620
- What ?
- Cool.

2093
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:54,420
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2094
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,340
We're gonna be cool.

2095
02:16:56,420 --> 02:17:01,100
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2096
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:03,180
And when I count three,

2097
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:06,060
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2098
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:09,460
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2099
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:12,460
And when you do it,

2100
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:14,500
you do it cool.

2101
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:16,820
You ready ?

2102
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,900
One,

2103
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:21,060
two,

2104
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:22,980
three.

2105
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:32,700
- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go !
- Yolanda !

2106
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:36,220
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

2107
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:38,300
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2108
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:42,020
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2109
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:47,100
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2110
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:50,420
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2111
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,340
But I don't want that.

2112
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,260
And you don't want that.

2113
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:56,940
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2114
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:59,020
So let's see what we can do.

2115
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:04,420
Now... here's the situation.

2116
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:08,220
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2117
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:11,580
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2118
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:14,460
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2119
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:18,300
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2120
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:21,180
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2121
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:24,060
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2122

- Vincent !
- [ Yells ]

2123
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:28,780
- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back !

2124
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:31,460
It's cool !
We still just talkin'.

2125
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:35,500
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.
- [ Yolanda Whimpering ]

2126
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:37,540
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2127
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:39,460
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2128
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:41,380
Tell her it's still cool.

2129
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:44,260
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby ?

2130
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:48,180
I-- I gotta go pee.

2131
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:50,100
I wanna go home.

2132
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:53,620
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2133
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:56,500
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2134
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:59,780
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2135
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:02,900
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2136
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:06,740
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2137
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:12,940
- Which one is it ?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2138
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:29,100
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2139
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:32,140
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2140
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:39,020
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2141
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,500
How much is there ?

2142
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,220
About 1,500 dollars.

2143
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:54,340
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2144
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:57,460
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2145
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,540
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh ?

2146
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:03,380
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

2147
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:06,740
No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !

2148
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:08,780
Vince, shut the fuck up !

2149
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:12,580
- Shut up !
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2150
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:15,460
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2151
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:17,380
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2152
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:21,620
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ?
- What ?

2153
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:26,220
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2154
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:28,900
You read the Bible, Ringo ?

2155
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:31,780
Not regularly, no.

2156
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:34,180
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2157
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:37,620
Ezekiel 25:17.

2158
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:40,420
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2159
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,340
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2160
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:44,260
and the tyranny of evil men.

2161
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:47,540
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2162
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:49,940
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2163
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:53,940
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2164
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:58,140
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2165
02:20:58,220 --> 02:21:01,140
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2166
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:04,140
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2167
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,620
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2168
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:10,980
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2169
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:14,060
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2170
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:16,980
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2171
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:19,860
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2172
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:22,260
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2173
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:25,620
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2174
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:28,500
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2175
02:21:28,540 --> 02:21:33,220
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2176
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:36,100
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2177
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:39,580
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2178
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:41,500
Or it could mean...

2179
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:44,860
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2180
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:48,700
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2181
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:50,940
Now, I'd like that.

2182
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:53,780
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2183
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:55,660
The truth is,

2184
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:58,540
you're the weak...

2185
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:03,140
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2186
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,340
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2187
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:10,380
I'm tryin' real hard...

2188
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:12,620
to be the shepherd.

2189
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:29,140
Go.

2190
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:48,460
I think we should be
leaving now.

2191
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:51,340
-  [ "Surf Rider" ]
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
