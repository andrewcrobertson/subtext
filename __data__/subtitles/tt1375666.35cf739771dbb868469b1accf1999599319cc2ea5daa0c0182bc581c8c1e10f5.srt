00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:20,598
Paradox.

510
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,184
So a closed loop like that

511
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:25,458
will help you disguise the
boundaries of the dream you create.

512
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:27,568
But how big do these levels have to be?

513
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:30,991
It could be anything from the
floor of a building to an entire city.

514
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:34,578
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

-A maze?
-Right, a maze.

516
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:37,579
And the better the maze…

517
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,499
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

518
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,871
Exactly.

519
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:46,246
-My subconscious seems polite enough.
-Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

520
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:49,344
No one likes to feel someone
else messing around in their mind.

Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

522
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:55,266
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

523
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,852

doesn't know the layouts.

He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

-No, not his ex.

-No.

No, she's dead.

Three.

540
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:52,613
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

541
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:56,742
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

542
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:59,574

Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject

665
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:15,915

plant it deep in his subconscious.

this into an emotional concept.

-is stressed, to say the least.
-Can we run with that?

00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:36,602
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

672
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:40,236
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

reconciliation, for catharsis.

Maurice always said it was
his most precious gift to you.

-A will.
-Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1014
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:26,831
That's an alternate.

1015
01:14:27,002 --> 01:14:29,402
This would supersede
the other if you want it to.

It splits up the component

-I just don't know.

He loved you, Robert.

he called me in to his deathbed.

He could barely speak.

1026
01:15:02,246 --> 01:15:06,490
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

1027
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:10,619
He pulled me close.

1028
01:15:13,299 --> 01:15:15,381

01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,671

The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1036
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:46,367
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1037
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,953
And the truth that, as we
go deeper into Fischer

1038
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,913
we're also going deeper into you.

1039

gonna like what we find.

We were working together.

1041
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,344
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:05,799
I kept pushing things.

1043
01:16:05,977 --> 01:16:09,641
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

1044
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:15,018
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there

1045
01:16:15,194 --> 01:16:17,902
that we could get trapped so deep

1046
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:22,073
that when we wound up on the
shore of our own subconscious

1047
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:25,197
<i>we lost sight of what was real.</i>

1048

We built the world for ourselves.

How could you stand it?

1055
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,019
It wasn't so bad at
first, feeling like gods.

1056
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:01,235
<i>The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.</i>

1057
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:05,777
Eventually, it just became
impossible for me to live like that.

1058
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,365
And what about for her?

1059
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:14,748
<i>She had locked something
away, something deep inside her.</i>

<i>A truth that she had once
known, but chose to forget.</i>

Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades

back into youth like that?</i>

<i>I knew something was wrong with her.

[SOBBING]

1682
02:11:51,265 --> 02:11:54,348
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1683
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:10,611
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1684
02:12:10,785 --> 02:12:12,446
I will!

1685
02:12:52,618 --> 02:12:55,360
You remember when you
asked me to marry you?

1686
02:12:55,538 --> 02:12:56,653
Yes.

1687
02:12:56,831 --> 02:12:59,869
You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together.

1688
02:13:02,587 --> 02:13:04,077
But we did.

1689
02:13:06,007 --> 02:13:08,374
<i>We did. You don't remember?</i>

1690
02:13:13,056 --> 02:13:15,889
I miss you more than I can bear…

1691
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:20,261
But we had our time together.

1692
02:13:21,607 --> 02:13:23,689
And I have to let you go.

1693
02:13:25,777 --> 02:13:27,563
I have to let you go.

1696
02:14:47,776 --> 02:14:51,440
You know, the will means that
Dad wanted me to be my own man

1697
02:14:52,531 --> 02:14:54,568
not just to live for him.

1698
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:58,696
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1699
02:15:08,464 --> 02:15:09,704
What happened?

1700
02:15:10,174 --> 02:15:11,881
-Cobb stayed.
-With Mal?

1701
02:15:12,051 --> 02:15:13,291
No, to find Saito.

1702
02:15:15,596 --> 02:15:17,337
He'll be lost.

1703
02:15:19,892 --> 02:15:21,724
No, he'll be all right.

SAITO: Have you come to kill me?

1705
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,458
I'm waiting for someone.

half-remembered dream.

Impossible.

We were young men together.

1711
02:16:06,272 --> 02:16:08,604
I'm an old man.

Filled with regret.

I've come back for you.

1715
02:16:26,375 --> 02:16:30,209
To remind you of something.

1716
02:16:33,508 --> 02:16:35,875
Something you once knew.

1717
02:16:38,721 --> 02:16:40,962
That this world is not real.

1718
02:16:45,895 --> 02:16:50,389
To convince me to honor our arrangement?

1719
02:16:51,234 --> 02:16:53,976
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1720
02:17:00,077 --> 02:17:01,408
Come back…

1721
02:17:03,956 --> 02:17:07,324
