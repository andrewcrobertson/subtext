1
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,836
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

2
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,737
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

3
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,974
<i>Day shift starting</i>
<i>in T-minus 15 minutes.</i>

4
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:28,610
<i>Farmers to report</i>
<i>to mess hall immediately.</i>

5
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:30,313
<i>If you are experiencing</i>
<i>any symptoms,</i>

6
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:31,948
<i>such as fever, cough,</i>

7
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,017
<i>vomiting,</i>
<i>or difficulty breathing,</i>

8
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,685
<i>proceed to the medical bay</i>
<i>for examination.</i>

9
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:40,156
<i>The safety and well-being</i>
<i>of our colony</i>

10
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:43,028
<i>is Weyland-Yutani's</i>
<i>top priority.</i>

11
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>Attention all workers...</i>

12
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:49,132
<i>Did you hear about</i>
<i>the claustrophobic astronaut?</i>

13
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>He needed space.</i>

14
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,168
I'm begging you,
you got to stop.

15
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,172
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

16
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,739
Huge waist.

17
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,810
See that cornbread.

18
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:04,180
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm on this seafood diet.

19
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:06,084
I see food, I eat it.

20
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,052
That's so bad.

21
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:10,719
You always laughed
at that one.

22
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,124
Yeah, when I was 12.

23
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,396
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

24
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:21,099
We owe him three months today.

25
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:23,869
He'll call again.

26
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:29,172
Well, maybe we won't be here
when he does.

27
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,083
Andy.
Stay close to me.

28
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:44,154
<i>Wake up. Wake up now.</i>

29
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:46,789
<i>We're all</i>
<i>Weyland-Yutani slaves.</i>

30
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,192
<i>The company pays us</i>
<i>with food and shelter</i>

31
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:52,328
<i>and takes our lives</i>
<i>in exchange.</i>

32
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,432
<i>Don't believe their lies.</i>

33
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,333
<i>They own you!</i>

34
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,102
Andy, Andy.
Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,405
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

36
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,407
-What did I do?
-It's a scam.

37
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,209
The ball is never under
the cup that you pick.

38
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:07,343
It's a trick.

39
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,013
But how am I
gonna get the money?

40
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:10,980
Money for what?

41
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:15,118
To pay for the horse
when we get to Yvaga.

42
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,053
You're gonna get a horse?

43
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:19,690
I wanna call it Raindy.

44
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,327
Do you get it?

45
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,861
-Raindy.
-No, I like it.

46
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,431
Yeah, it's good.

47
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,867
Okay, so you just
wait over there.

48
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,070
Okay, I might be a minute.

49
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,271
Stay out of trouble,
all right?

50
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:38,241
<i>All employees will be seen.</i>

51
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,409
Good luck.

52
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,011
<i>Line up in an orderly fashion.</i>

53
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,379
<i>Next.</i>

54
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,348
<i>Full name</i>
<i>and occupation, please.</i>

55
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,885
<i>Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am.</i>
<i>Farming.</i>

56
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:51,120
It's about my travel papers.

57
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:53,825
<i>I met my quota, and I should</i>
<i>be free to go now.</i>

58
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,291
Right?

59
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,793
Go where?

60
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:58,428
<i>Yvaga.</i>

61
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,765
<i>It's an independent system,</i>
<i>but it's fully terraformed.</i>

62
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,834
<i>You can actually see</i>
<i>the sun out there.</i>

63
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,171
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

64
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:10,807
<i>Uh, they died</i>
<i>three cycles ago.</i>

65
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,343
Lung disease, from the mines.

66
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:16,112
<i>It's just me</i>
<i>and my brother now.</i>

67
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,313
<i>They sell us hope</i>

68
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,315
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

69
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:25,090
<i>They sell us hope to keep</i>
<i>us slaves. Wake up now.</i>

70
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,034
I'm sorry,
but you're not eligible

71
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:39,335
for contract release yet.

72
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,436
Due to a shortage of workers,

73
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,071
you're being
transferred to the mines.

74
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,007
<i>Wait, what?</i>

75
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:46,175
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>I reached the required hours.</i>

76
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,343
You have to let me go.

77
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,513
Unfortunately, quotas have
been raised to 24,000 hours,

78
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,181
so you'll be released
from contract

79
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,349
in another five to six years.

80
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,585
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful

81
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:57,220
for your ongoing service.

82
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:59,455
-Rain!
-Hey!

83
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:00,857
Hey, stop!

84
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,927
Get off him! You bastards!

85
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,529
I got you, I got you.

86
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:07,966
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

87
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:11,836
Okay.

88
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:15,405
You're okay.

89
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm resetting you.

90
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,176
I got you.

91
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,111
It's okay.

92
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,481
I shouldn't
have left you alone.

93
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,486
<i>They sell us hope</i>

94
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:32,622
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

95
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:34,893
<i>Wake up now. They own you.</i>

96
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:39,295
<i>Hi, Rain.</i>

97
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:40,963
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I know</i>
<i>I've been calling you all day,</i>

98
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>but, look,</i>
<i>something's come up,</i>

99
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,167
<i>and I think you should</i>
<i>know about it.</i>

100
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,838
<i>So, come by the trailers</i>
<i>and bring Andy.</i>

101
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,103
Hey.

102
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,303
Oh, for...

103
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:22,271
<i>Game over, man.</i>

104
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:25,208
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

105
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,911
I told you she'd show up.

106
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,880
You owe me five bucks.

107
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,149
<i>Andy!</i>

108
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,219
Why'd the blind miner
fall down the well?

109
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:37,522
Why?

110
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,525
'Cause he couldn't see
that well.

111
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,926
Please don't encourage him.

112
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:45,897
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

113
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,269
-Kay.
-Rain.

114
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:54,437
-Hi.
-Hi!

115
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,540
Hi.

116
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,408
I missed you.

117
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,311
And I know my brother
missed you, too.

118
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,985
I'm really glad you came.

119
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,486
I heard about your dad.

120
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:11,523
I'm really sorry.

121
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,357
Well, between the hailstorms

122
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,658
and the new diseases
every cycle...

123
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,460
Yeah, everybody's dying,
right?

124
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,197
So, should we show her?

125
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,297
Show me what?

126
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,333
Okay, so, last night,

127
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,002
we're loading up
the last Tesotek,

128
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,470
we're about 200 miles
above the ground,

129
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:28,604
and then all of a sudden...

130
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,008
The hauler picks up
this beacon.

131
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,143
So Navarro tracks it,
and it turns out

132
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:35,445
there's this big Wey-Yu ship

133
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,113
drifting
right above our heads.

134
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,247
Drifting?

135
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,082
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

136
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,185
Some old relic. It's probably
damaged or obsolete.

137
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:43,486
Like that guy over there.

138
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:44,522
Bjorn.

139
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:48,257
Okay, just tell her.

140
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,059
Why are we all
sitting around here

141
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:51,594
waiting for travel permits
that the company

142
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,696
are never gonna give to us?

143
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:54,997
'Cause that hauler
has enough power in it

144
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:55,998
to get us to Yvaga.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,101
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

146
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,304
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

147
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,638
Decommissioned ships
still carry

148
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,106
tons of functional equipment.

149
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,541
And the hyperlink shows

150
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,412
that ship
still has a few pods left.

151
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,617
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

152
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:17,220
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

153
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,521
Before someone else does.

154
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,624
You guys are insane.

155
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,059
-Well, of course we are.
-No. No, we're not.

156
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:24,360
-This is...
-That's what I said.

157
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,563
Are you gonna help us?

158
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,734
Sorry,
what do you need me for?

159
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,369
Andy.

160
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,238
-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

161
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,439
Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,175
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

163
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,576
He can access
a terminal on the ship

164
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,278
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

165
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,613
It's the only way to get in.

166
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,816
Okay,
but what if we get caught?

167
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:48,518
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

168
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,286
Right, Rain's not comin'.

169
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,322
Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

170
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:56,425
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

171
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,593
He's not your
brother though, is he?

172
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,830
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

173
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,364
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

174
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,065
that your dad
found in the trash.

175
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,004
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

176
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,636
Let's go.

177
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:07,603
-Rain?
-What?

178
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,706
-I didn't say anything.
-Rain, wait.

179
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,808
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

180
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,142
can be a dick sometimes,
all right?

181
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,712
But he is right
about something.

182
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,780
You need to wake up.

183
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:17,848
Because this company,

184
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,949
they're not gonna
give us anything.

185
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,317
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

186
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:27,223
Rain, I just...

187
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,060
I don't want to end up
like our parents.

188
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,829
Do you?

189
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:40,436
Is it as easy as you're making
it sound, this plan of yours?

190
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,705
You won't even have to get out
of the <i>Corbelan.</i>

191
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,509
That much
I can promise you, okay?

192
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,181
Come on. What do you say?

193
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,107
Bjorn, hurry up,
let's go.

194
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:23,147
All right, I'm starting
her up. Batteries on.

195
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:26,351
Lovely.

196
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,621
Could I get hydro,
please?

197
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:31,757
Comm panel.

198
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:34,891
Ground spoilers.

199
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:36,194
They are armed.

200
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,361
First time
in space, huh?

201
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:39,397
Yeah.

202
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,933
You too? Boop!

203
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,201
-Fuel pump.
-On.

204
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,268
Two space virgins
coming through.

205
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,738
Right, take a good look
outside the window

206
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,843
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

207
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,488
You good?

208
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,524
I'm good.

209
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:08,526
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

210
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,478
Are you sure
this is a good idea now?

211
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,581
Sure, Dad.

212
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:37,355
Here comes the crush.

213
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,810
That's how it's done,
bitch.

214
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,333
Is that...

215
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,068
Yeah.

216
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,838
That is our sun.

217
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,818
They say Yvaga has
the most incredible sunsets.

218
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,387
I've seen them.

219
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:21,357
In my dreams.

220
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,394
I can't wait
to see them with you.

221
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:27,766
Yeah.

222
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:32,803
You know, I heard that
cryo-sleep just makes years

223
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,570
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

224
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,641
So when we wake up
in Yvaga tomorrow,

225
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:39,310
we'll wake up with a hangover.

226
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,654
There she is.

227
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,424
That's not a ship.

228
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,859
No.

229
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,794
<i>Fuck,</i>
<i>that's big. What is that?</i>

230
00:17:57,796 --> 00:17:59,930
<i>Decommissioned outpost?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

231
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,597
<i>Probably got dragged</i>
<i>into our orbit.</i>

232
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,666
Okay, Navarro,
let's get closer, please.

233
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,736
Okay.
I'm gonna match its roll.

234
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,823
<i>Hazard proximity alert.</i>

235
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,157
What's wrong?

236
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,694
It's just the belt's a bit
closer than I thought.

237
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:32,630
How long?

238
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:35,799
It's 36 hours, give or take.

239
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:36,800
Till what?

240
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,870
Before the station crashes
against the rings.

241
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,938
Sorry, what?

242
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,406
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

243
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,641
36 hours.

244
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:47,145
We should be in and out
in 30 minutes.

245
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,645
Yeah?

246
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,780
Andy.

247
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,481
Yeah, tops.

248
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,719
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

249
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:58,587
I have just one directive.

250
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,458
To do what's best for Rain.

251
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,394
Your dad wrote it.

252
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:04,930
Yeah.

253
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,831
That and too many dad jokes.

254
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,167
I'm happy...

255
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:11,435
to help.

256
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:17,910
Be careful out there.

257
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:35,827
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

258
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:39,528
Put that on.

259
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,064
Now,
why I gotta put this on for?

260
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,631
So you don't
freeze your balls off.

261
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,767
Mate,
you gotta stop obsessing

262
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,201
about my balls, man.
It's unhealthy.

263
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,435
Keep talking
and I'll chop 'em off.

264
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,737
Aw, you really want
'em for yourself, don't you?

265
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,040
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

266
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,473
Oh, shut up a minute.

267
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,243
Gloves, here, take these.

268
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:55,812
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

269
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:57,047
-Come over here.
-Bjorn, leave him alone,

270
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:59,082
for fuck's sake.

271
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,482
Andy, take no notice.

272
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,550
All right, okay,
won't be my fault

273
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:02,620
when he breaks somethin'.

274
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:11,593
There's a synth hatch

275
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:12,862
right ahead. I'm gonna dock.

276
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:14,199
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Just bring us in slow.</i>

277
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,794
Oh, fuck me,
it's cold in there.

278
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,828
What's that?

279
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,030
<i>It's a temp-scanner.</i>

280
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:48,699
<i>It's gonna lead us</i>
<i>to the pods.</i>

281
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:53,036
Okay, compression
is good enough.

282
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,138
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

283
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,572
Andy...

284
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:57,974
<i>...you're up.</i>

285
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,277
<i>It's your time to shine.</i>

286
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:07,150
<i>Yes! Andy!</i>

287
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:08,253
<i>Beautiful work.</i>

288
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:09,821
<i>Okay.</i>

289
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,291
<i>Congrats.</i>
<i>You're not a virgin anymore.</i>

290
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,659
<i>All right.</i>

291
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,605
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

292
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:01,037
<i>Fuck.</i>

293
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,173
<i>Guys, it looks like</i>
<i>we're in zero-g.</i>

294
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:04,910
<i>Yeah, I can feel it</i>
<i>in my stomach.</i>

295
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:11,613
Wait, what's that?

296
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:12,882
Gravity generators.

297
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:15,852
When offline, they still purge
themselves every few minutes.

298
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:17,789
<i>Prevents the place</i>
<i>from blowing up.</i>

299
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,895
<i>Oh, fuck me,</i>
<i>there goes my stomach again.</i>

300
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,131
<i>Okay, straight ahead.</i>

301
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:04,801
<i>According</i>
<i>to the scanner,</i>

302
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:06,004
<i>the pods should be in here.</i>

303
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:36,099
<i>Jesus.</i>

304
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:37,333
<i>Andy, you good?</i>

305
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:38,436
Yeah.

306
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:47,445
<i>All right, great news.</i>
<i>I've got eyes on the pods.</i>

307
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,185
<i>Fuck!</i>

308
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:57,455
<i>Bjorn, you okay?</i>

309
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Fuck!</i>

310
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:02,125
<i>I think I fractured</i>
<i>my asshole.</i>

311
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:09,367
<i>Fuckin' hell. Don't fuck</i>
<i>with this gravity purge, man.</i>

312
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:26,282
<i>Thank God,</i>
<i>there's still</i>

313
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,485
<i>some power left in this relic.</i>

314
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:46,336
<i>Okay, watch out.</i>
<i>Gravity's coming back.</i>

315
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:48,840
<i>Fuckin' hell.</i>

316
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:57,347
All right, here we go.

317
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:58,516
Let's see what we got.

318
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:00,986
Okay.

319
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:08,358
-Shit.
-What's the problem?

320
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,959
Pods don't have enough fuel.

321
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:11,261
What do you mean?

322
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:13,062
<i>They're loaded up</i>
<i>for three years in stasis.</i>

323
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:14,130
Yeah,
but it takes nine years

324
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,431
to get to Yvaga, mate.

325
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,133
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm aware of that.

326
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:18,534
Fuckin' hell.

327
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:20,069
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

328
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:21,204
-I knew it.
-Just relax.

329
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,305
Maybe you guys
should just come back.

330
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,141
<i>No, no,</i>
<i>we're not givin' up now.</i>

331
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,843
Yvaga's
the nearest system.

332
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,979
So what are we supposed
to do now? Huh?

333
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:32,115
-What are we gonna do?
-Shut up.

334
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:35,084
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

335
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:37,020
We should find
more fuel there.

336
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:40,256
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

337
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:41,324
Come on, Andy.

338
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:43,261
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

339
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:04,516
Hold.

340
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:07,585
Yeah, 400 yards away,
dead ahead.

341
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,386
What's with the military shit?

342
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:11,487
What?

343
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,422
All that military shit.

344
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:15,325
-Well, it's effective.
-Is it?

345
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:16,459
-And cool.
-It's not very cool.

346
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:18,461
You just look like a twat.

347
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:19,962
-I'm sorry.
-All right, chill.

348
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:21,230
<i>Let's keep it movin'.</i>

349
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,298
<i>If you do that again,</i>
<i>I'll fuck you up.</i>

350
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,366
-Bjorn, back off!
<i>-You understand?</i>

351
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:25,435
<i>Just as long as he stays</i>
<i>out of my way.</i>

352
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:28,071
Why is he being
such a dick to him?

353
00:26:28,073 --> 00:26:30,907
Because of what happened
to his mom.

354
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,442
-What do you mean?
-Last cycle,

355
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,177
there was a gas leak
in the mines,

356
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,312
so a synthetic made the call
to seal them

357
00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:38,214
with Bjorn's mom
still trapped inside.

358
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:39,482
What?

359
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,217
Synthetics can't harm humans.

360
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:44,255
It sacrificed three miners
to save a dozen.

361
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:47,559
That, they can do.

362
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,299
That's terrible.

363
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:41,312
I got you, I got you.

364
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:44,949
Come on, come on, come on.

365
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:48,186
Easy, easy.

366
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,426
Good job.

367
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,265
Kay!

368
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,732
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,634
Hey, hey, hey.

370
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,402
I'm right here.
I'm right here. You're okay.

371
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:08,671
I'm gonna go
check on the pods.

372
00:28:26,524 --> 00:28:28,426
No, no. Don't worry.

373
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,093
I'm not sick.

374
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:32,130
What's wrong, then?

375
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,166
Nothing is.

376
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,071
Oh, girl.

377
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:44,142
Who's the father?

378
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:46,578
Some asshole.

379
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:51,716
Just don't tell my brother,
okay?

380
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:54,550
He has enough things
to worry about.

381
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:57,019
No. I won't say anything.

382
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:59,724
I'm just happy this baby
will get to see the sun.

383
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:24,115
I think
we're almost there.

384
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:30,152
Okay, Navarro.

385
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:31,554
<i>Airlock 5-B,</i>
<i>that's our way out</i>

386
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:32,688
<i>once we find this cryo-fuel.</i>

387
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,656
On my way.

388
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:35,258
<i>Welcome to the</i>

00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:58,347
This place
gives me the creeps.

396
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:01,319
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

397
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,120
He's all right now.

398
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:05,588
Do you get it? He's all right.

399
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,392
Can you turn
yourself off, please?

400
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,126
You said you were nervous

401
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:11,127
and I was trying
to make sure you were...

402
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:14,430
Jesus! You know, I can't
wait to get in them pods

403
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:16,267
and never see you again,
you know that?

404
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,236
<i>You'll see me in Yvaga.</i>

405
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:21,637
<i>No,</i>
<i>you're not going to Yvaga.</i>

406
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:22,775
<i>Bjorn, stop!</i>

407
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:24,607
<i>I'm not?</i>

408
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:25,741
Well done.

409
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:27,811
Oh, she didn't tell you?

410
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:30,682
Yeah, yeah, it's a
non-Weyland-Yutani system,

411
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,118
so no fake people allowed.

412
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:38,122
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

413
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:42,491
Andy, look.

414
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:43,794
<i>Rain could end up in prison</i>

415
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:44,761
<i>if she takes you with her.</i>

416
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:46,329
<i>And if you guys</i>
<i>stay in Jackson,</i>

417
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,663
<i>it's just a matter of time</i>

418
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:49,768
<i>before you get decommissioned</i>
<i>again by the company.</i>

419
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:52,501
<i>You understand?</i>

420
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:54,472
<i>I need you on the ship</i>
<i>to guard the pods.</i>

421
00:30:55,306 --> 00:30:56,507
But once we get there...

422
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,275
Decommish.

423
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:00,409
Lights out for good.

424
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:03,346
You done?

425
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:04,515
<i>Just tellin' the truth.</i>

426
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:10,586
<i>That's okay.</i>

427
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:13,826
<i>If it's what's best for Rain,</i>
<i>it's what's best for me.</i>

428
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,530
You're a good guy, Andy.

429
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,200
We're all gonna miss you.

430
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,874
So he didn't know?

431
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,344
I just did not
have the heart to tell him.

432
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,514
You shouldn't feel bad.

433
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,282
Shit.

434
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:41,384
You're not gonna throw

435
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:43,287
your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

436
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,926
He doesn't care.
It doesn't matter to him.

437
00:31:49,694 --> 00:31:51,295
Okay? He's not...

438
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:53,932
you know, real.

439
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:19,624
The signal's
coming from in here.

440
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,802
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

441
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,837
Yeah.

442
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,839
<i>Doesn't look</i>
<i>decommissioned to me.</i>

443
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,306
No, it doesn't.

444
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,542
But it's definitely deserted.

445
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:42,478
Hey, Andy, look at this.

446
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,582
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

447
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,950
if I just amp up the juices.

448
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,922
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

449
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:52,923
All right, enough.

450
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:55,226
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

451
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:59,428
It's a joke.
I was joking.

452
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,465
What the fuck?

453
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,867
Watch out.

454
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,611
<i>Shit.</i>

455
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:19,682
It's only a synthetic.

456
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:23,619
Fuck.

457
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,756
I thought it was a real person
there for a second.

458
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:27,423
<i>What happened in there?</i>

459
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,293
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

460
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:31,393
The fuel must be in that room.

461
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:33,031
Let's grab it
and get the fuck out of here.

462
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:40,438
All right. Andy?

463
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,054
Bjorn,
take the torch please.

464
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:03,392
I don't think
there's any pods in here.

465
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:04,761
Nah,
just cooling equipment.

466
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:06,531
Uses the same type of fuel,
though.

467
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:13,806
Yes.

468
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,007
<i>Forty-five Ks.</i>

469
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:20,010
<i>It's more than enough fuel</i>
<i>to get us to Yvaga.</i>

470
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:22,446
Right. Bjorn, give me
a hand with this, please.

471
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:33,790
Bjorn, pull it out
on three, all right?

472
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:34,991
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

473
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:36,394
One, two...

474
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:38,627
three.

475
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:39,896
Fuck!

476
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:41,099
-Fuck.
-My fingers.

477
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:43,969
I can't feel my fingers.

478
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,777
<i>It really hurts.</i>
<i>Just froze my hands off.</i>

479
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:55,544
-What's happening?
<i>-Fuck.</i>

480
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:57,848
Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

481
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,417
Andy, the door.

482
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,420
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

483
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:05,521
What does that mean?

484
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:06,859
Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

485
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,025
So you're trying
to tell me that

486
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,492
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

487
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,560
but can't open
a random fucking door

488
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:12,796
to a random room?

489
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:14,766
Well, obviously,
that's no random room.

490
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:19,938
Come on!

491
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:21,672
Come on!

492
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:40,792
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

493
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:46,062
If Andy
can't open those doors,

494
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,866
I doubt
we'll have better luck.

495
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,467
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic

496
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:52,601
and we're just trespassing.

497
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:55,473
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

498
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,042
Not yet.

499
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,113
I think it's in here.

500
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,884
Bjorn!

501
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:08,754
Tyler!

502
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:14,425
They're in there.

503
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,163
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:21,164
If this module
is still working,

505
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:24,234
I can try to transfer
its credentials to Andy.

506
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:26,204
A higher clearance
should open that door.

507
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,574
Shit. It's stuck.

508
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:08,013
It's so hot in here, man.

509
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:33,872
Whoa.

510
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,638
Sick.

511
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,108
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

512
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,144
Yeah, okay, Mom.

513
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:45,115
Help me! Help!

514
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,249
Oh, no! What do I do?

515
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:47,853
The module. Take it out!

516
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:54,658
You okay?

517
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:57,260
That was fucked up.

518
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:58,895
Here.

519
00:37:58,897 --> 00:37:59,998
Let me see.

520
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,665
Yes, okay.

521
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:04,834
All right.

522
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,836
-Got it.
-Hey.

523
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:07,873
Rain.

524
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:10,876
This is from that synthetic.

525
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:13,879
Try putting it
on Andy's module.

526
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,117
I'm so sorry.

527
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:21,552
Let's just get outta here.

528
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:24,122
Andy?

529
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,060
All right, let's see.

530
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:32,330
Okay.

531
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,634
Fuck.

532
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,736
Rain, did I do something
wrong? He's just frozen up.

533
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,105
He's just rebooting.

534
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:43,942
It's gonna take
a couple of minutes.

535
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:08,699
Here, let me get you
something for those fingers.

536
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:17,943
The fuck was that?

537
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:22,680
All right,
stay there a second.

538
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,786
Tyler?

539
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:33,859
Hey,
what are you guys doing?

540
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,834
Bjorn?

541
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:46,169
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

542
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:47,237
I'm not
playing around.

543
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,204
There's something
in the water.

544
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:49,705
What do you mean?
What is it?

545
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:50,607
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

546
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:51,943
There's something
in the fuckin' water.

547
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:57,748
Bjorn!

548
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:02,218
Fuck!

549
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,255
What the fuck
was that?

550
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,895
Andy!

551
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:13,131
Bjorn!

552
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,371
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

553
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:22,472
Bjorn!

554
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,780
-Tyler!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,348
Come on!

556
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,417
-Come on! Help me!
-No, stop. Stop. Don't...

557
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:36,186
-No! Navarro!
-Those things will get out.

558
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:38,121
If they come in here...
If they come in...

559
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:39,257
-If they come...
-No!

560
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:44,329
Fuck. Fuck.

561
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,457
Andy! Let's go!

562
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:15,892
Go! Bjorn!

563
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:16,928
Andy, the door!

564
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:19,062
-Bjorn!
-Come on, come on.

565
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:20,098
Come on, come on, come on!

566
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:23,833
Get out of there!

567
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:24,901
Come on, come on,
come on!

568
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,502
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Go, go, go!

569
00:41:26,504 --> 00:41:27,939
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

570
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:33,543
Go! Go!

571
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:35,878
-Bjorn, come on!
-Go! Go!

572
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,454
Andy, the door!

573
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:52,528
Stay still.
Stay still.

574
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,297
I know!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

575
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:57,934
It's choking her.

576
00:41:57,936 --> 00:41:59,502
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

577
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:00,538
-It's choking her!
-Shit.

578
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:02,872
Stop! Bjorn!

579
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:04,440
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

580
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,875
-Stop!
-What's it doin'?

581
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:07,110
Is it fuckin' killin' her?

582
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:09,281
I do not believe that's
what the creature is doing.

583
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:10,849
No.

584
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,250
Andy?

585
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,852
Based on the rhythmic
dilatation of those bladders,

586
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:18,221
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns,

587
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:21,391
I'd surmise it's feeding her
oxygen to keep her alive.

588
00:42:21,393 --> 00:42:23,261
For what purpose,
I do not know.

589
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,498
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

590
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,534
I'm an ND-255
Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

591
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:33,938
Originally built for mining
and safety tasks.

592
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,172
You guys call me Andy.

593
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:37,409
It's that module.

594
00:42:39,244 --> 00:42:40,278
Yes.

595
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:44,414
That new module didn't
just upgrade my credentials.

596
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,149
It substantially
updated my AI,

597
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:48,953
and it's mending my motor
systems as we speak.

598
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:52,121
A most overdue upgrade,
I must say.

599
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:53,222
Shit. I'mma fucking
fry this thing.

600
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:54,324
-Okay, wait.
-Don't!

601
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:55,958
-Why not?
-That amount of current

602
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,327
will violently
contract its tail flexors

603
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,528
and will break her neck.

604
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,029
So what,
you got a better idea?

605
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:01,297
What should we
fucking do then, huh?

606
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,166
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey.

607
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:05,003
Andy, do you know
how to help her?

608
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:07,136
I'm afraid my
knowledge database

609
00:43:07,138 --> 00:43:08,604
has not really changed.

610
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:10,139
I do not know
what this creature is

611
00:43:10,141 --> 00:43:11,576
or how to remove it safely.

612
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:16,614
But there's someone
in this room who might.

613
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:49,479
I need to secure
Z-01 compound.

614
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:51,481
Mission's priority. All other
priorities rescinded.

615
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:53,483
Must complete the mission.

616
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:54,984
I'm sorry...

617
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:56,519
but your mission has failed.

618
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:58,590
What? No, I...

619
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,231
Can you tell us
what we can do to help her?

620
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,667
You don't help her. You run.

621
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:12,535
Get out, however you got in.

622
00:44:12,537 --> 00:44:14,270
No, no, no.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

623
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:16,439
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin'
her, okay? You understand?

624
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:19,208
Then have mercy
and end her life now.

625
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,013
If not, you all die.

626
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:25,648
So what the fuck
is he sayin'?

627
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,183
What's it doing to her?

628
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:28,351
The parasitoid is implanting

629
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:30,119
the Plagiarus Praepotens
in her.

630
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:31,387
I beg your pardon?

631
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:34,223
A seed that will amalgamate
with her DNA

632
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:35,558
and rapidly grow out of her.

633
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,128
What's gonna grow out of her?

634
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:51,543
XX121 Xenomorph.

635
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,543
One of our towing ships

636
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:57,213
first made contact with this
specimen two decades ago.

637
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,247
Of the seven crew members

638
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:00,616
aboard the <i>USS Nostromo,</i>
only one survived,

639
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:03,486
blowing the creature
out of the airlock.

640
00:45:03,488 --> 00:45:06,389
We've been searching
for it ever since.

641
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:09,725
170 days ago,
our search came to an end

642
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:11,996
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board...

643
00:45:12,497 --> 00:45:14,230
presumed dead.

644
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,431
But of course,

645
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:19,602
lack of oxygen and food is
of no true consequence to this

646
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:21,270
perfect organism.

647
00:45:21,272 --> 00:45:23,308
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

648
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:26,509
Clearly.

649
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:30,012
It wreaked havoc
over this station,

650
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:32,615
until what was left of our
security forces shot it dead.

651
00:45:32,617 --> 00:45:35,320
Only to trigger its swan song.

652
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:37,453
Acid for blood?

653
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,355
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

654
00:45:39,357 --> 00:45:41,224
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

655
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:42,492
Hey, shut up!

656
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:44,293
Nobody cares about your
fucking ship anymore.

657
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:46,162
Okay, okay. Okay.

658
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:48,331
What if we use the cryo-fuel

659
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,100
to freeze
the root of the tail?

660
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:54,005
Maybe if it's frozen,
it won't choke her.

661
00:45:55,173 --> 00:45:56,307
That could work.

662
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,604
All right, get it off!
Get it off!

663
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,359
It's gone. It's off
of you. It's off of you.

664
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:53,563
It's off. It's off. It's off.

665
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:55,331
You're okay. You're okay.

666
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,634
I wouldn't be so sure.

667
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:03,339
What are the odds?

668
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:05,741
60 to 40 against your friend.

669
00:47:05,743 --> 00:47:06,711
What are the odds on what?

670
00:47:08,746 --> 00:47:10,548
That the creature's
finished its job already.

671
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:14,319
What is he
talking about?

672
00:47:16,187 --> 00:47:17,653
Listen to me.

673
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:20,389
Humans go through
too many emotional stages

674
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:22,525
before accepting the cold,

675
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:24,828
yet rational -sometimes
hardest -path.

676
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,763
You must help them.

677
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:27,898
You must help them.

678
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:34,205
Andy?

679
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:36,305
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry

680
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:37,774
but we can't let her back
on the ship.

681
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,709
-Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
-What're you doing?

682
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:40,911
-You must understand.
-You see?

683
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:41,912
That's what I mean
by "funny ideas"!

684
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:44,313
What're you talking
about? No, he's...

685
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:45,816
-No! No!
-You fuckin' bitch!

686
00:47:45,818 --> 00:47:47,316
Hey! Andy! Andy!

687
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:48,451
We're gonna go.

688
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:49,685
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm right here.

689
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:51,322
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

690
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,590
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

691
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:55,458
-I'm here.
-Bjorn! No.

692
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,627
Bjorn, we're not leaving
without them!

693
00:47:57,629 --> 00:47:58,795
-I'm here.
-Bjorn!

694
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:02,565
-Where are they?
-You need to listen.

695
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:03,666
We have to start the ship,
okay?

696
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:04,835
-Just go and start the ship.
-Where's Rain? How...

697
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:06,770
Forgive me.

698
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:09,338
I've been nothing
but a burden to you.

699
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,508
Today, I can finally help.

700
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,813
And you won't see me
as a child anymore.

701
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:17,850
What?

702
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,749
Andy!

703
00:48:29,394 --> 00:48:30,428
-Hey!
-Bjorn!

704
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:55,186
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

705
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:57,286
Navarro, undock!

706
00:48:57,288 --> 00:48:58,456
<i>Undock the ship!</i>

707
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:03,659
<i>Undocking initiated.</i>

708
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:06,328
<i>Please clear the airlock.</i>

709
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:19,442
What the fuck is he doing?

710
00:49:19,444 --> 00:49:20,710
They can't
just leave without us.

711
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,580
He thinks Andy's
trying to kill Navarro.

712
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:25,316
What?

713
00:49:26,551 --> 00:49:27,685
Wait, is he?

714
00:49:31,556 --> 00:49:32,724
I don't know.

715
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:38,327
Andy? Andy?

716
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:40,732
Andy, open the door.

717
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:49,373
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop them.

718
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:51,373
Bjorn?

719
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,608
<i>Bjorn, what are you doing?</i>

720
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,609
<i>You can't just leave us here.</i>

721
00:49:53,611 --> 00:49:54,845
<i>You gotta come back</i>
<i>and get us.</i>

722
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:57,582
Sorry, I can't do that until
she turns that psychopath off.

723
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,017
What's going on?

724
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,353
Andy, uh...

725
00:50:03,856 --> 00:50:06,722
-Andy, he's glitchy.
-What?

726
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:07,690
I just need
to get away

727
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:09,293
from this airlock right now.
I just need...

728
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:12,595
Navarro?

729
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:14,563
Are you all right?

730
00:50:14,565 --> 00:50:15,866
What's wrong?
What do you need?

731
00:50:22,507 --> 00:50:23,541
Navarro?

732
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,716
Oh, God.

733
00:50:33,718 --> 00:50:35,419
Oh, my God,
what is that?

734
00:50:38,623 --> 00:50:40,589
Navarro, please.
Navarro! Navarro!

735
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:41,925
Hey, hey, hey.

736
00:50:42,928 --> 00:50:45,063
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

737
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:52,002
Someone talk to me!

738
00:50:52,004 --> 00:50:54,372
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro,
what's going on?

739
00:51:04,817 --> 00:51:05,851
Help!

740
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:08,086
-Help!
-Kay!

741
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,957
What's happening?
What's happening?

742
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,427
Please don't let me die.

743
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:20,462
Someone help!

744
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:06,905
Bjorn?

745
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:08,570
Kay?

746
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:10,472
We have to go get them.

747
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:15,513
<i>T-minus-47</i>
<i>minutes to impact event.</i>

748
00:53:16,982 --> 00:53:18,114
Doesn't make any sense.

749
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:20,016
No, I thought you said
we had hours.

750
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:21,785
The explosion pushed
the station's axis off

751
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:23,552
by a few degrees,

752
00:53:23,554 --> 00:53:25,922
just enough to hit the
asteroid belt a lot sooner.

753
00:53:25,924 --> 00:53:27,159
Where did they crash?

754
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:29,025
Romulus Hangar Bay,

755
00:53:29,027 --> 00:53:30,193
on the other side
of the station.

756
00:53:30,195 --> 00:53:31,595
-Okay.
-Let's go.

757
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:45,110
<i>T-minus-45</i>
<i>minutes to impact event.</i>

758
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:52,550
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

759
00:53:58,957 --> 00:54:00,524
There's still hope.

760
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,200
We need to find a way

761
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:11,770
to cross
to the Romulus module.

762
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:21,577
No, no, no.

763
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:23,348
They must've spread
from the lab.

764
00:54:27,185 --> 00:54:28,752
I don't see
another way.

765
00:54:28,754 --> 00:54:29,855
Andy, can...

766
00:54:33,759 --> 00:54:35,557
I heard your voice
in my head.

767
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:36,993
Calling.

768
00:54:36,995 --> 00:54:40,163
ND-255
artificial person.

769
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:42,032
Your model
was once the backbone

770
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:43,800
of our colonization efforts,

771
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:45,769
and it's an honor to be
in your presence.

772
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:47,738
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

773
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:50,874
I'm Science Officer Rook,

774
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:53,877
and I humbly request
your services now.

775
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:56,712
I'm afraid I have
just one directive.

776
00:54:56,714 --> 00:54:59,750
To do what's best for...

777
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:03,953
Your upgrade came
with a new directive.

778
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:05,323
It overrides the old one.

779
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:07,092
I see.

780
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:09,961
What's required of me...

781
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:11,828
Sir?

782
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,165
To finish our mission.

783
00:55:21,306 --> 00:55:22,740
-Andy!
-Andy!

784
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:24,941
Andy.

785
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:26,742
My apologies.

786
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:28,945
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

787
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:29,981
Follow me.

788
00:55:31,682 --> 00:55:33,249
What? Our situation?
How do you...

789
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:35,253
Andy! Andy!

790
00:55:43,395 --> 00:55:45,627
The parasitoids
have no eyes.

791
00:55:45,629 --> 00:55:47,263
They track you by sound,

792
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:49,165
but primarily,
by heat signature.

793
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,268
What?

794
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:52,102
Your body temperature.

795
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:53,269
Right.

796
00:55:53,271 --> 00:55:55,105
If we raise the temperature
in the room

797
00:55:55,107 --> 00:55:56,705
to match our bodies,

798
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:58,875
would that make us
invisible to them?

799
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:00,345
If we're quiet enough?

800
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:02,848
Just one way to find out.

801
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:11,323
Hey.

802
00:56:14,192 --> 00:56:15,659
This is all my fault.

803
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,865
Yeah, it is.

804
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:24,336
Yours, mine,
and everyone else's.

805
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:29,107
We all decided
to do this together.

806
00:56:33,744 --> 00:56:35,046
We'll get to them.

807
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:42,954
<i>T-minus</i>
<i>40 minutes to impact event.</i>

808
00:57:14,186 --> 00:57:15,318
The hallway's
temperature

809
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,953
is now equal to your bodies,

810
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:19,055
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

811
00:57:19,057 --> 00:57:22,825
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature

812
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:24,227
and you'll be exposed.

813
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:26,162
Sweat, goosebumps.

814
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:28,398
That's your skin trying to
cool your body down.

815
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,001
So watch out for those.

816
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:33,838
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

817
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:31,614
Come on. Come on!

818
01:00:31,616 --> 01:00:35,120
Come on! Come on!

819
01:00:44,262 --> 01:00:45,962
Okay. Okay.

820
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:47,999
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

821
01:01:00,578 --> 01:01:02,111
Fuck!

822
01:01:02,113 --> 01:01:03,281
Stay back, stay back, please.

823
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,287

829
01:02:05,477 --> 01:02:07,677

The lever
with the red button,

834
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:22,594

01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,151

841
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:55,527
I have the key.
I have the key.

01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:01,731
Oh, my God.

843
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:24,055
Run.

844
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:26,757
Go! Go!

845
01:03:50,816 --> 01:03:52,381
Wait!

01:03:52,383 --> 01:03:53,418
Wait!

01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:55,854
Come on!

848
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:06,629
You almost closed
the door on him.

849
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:09,665
Yes, but I didn't.

850
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,233
I calculated
the timing perfectly

851
01:04:11,235 --> 01:04:12,637
with more success
than last time.

852
01:04:13,738 --> 01:04:14,773
Won't you agree?

853
01:04:15,874 --> 01:04:17,640
We're getting close.

854
01:04:17,642 --> 01:04:20,209

open the door.

-Don't look

-over there. Andy.
-Tyler, what's wrong?

872
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,898
Hey, I need you to open
that door right now, okay?

873

waiting for us to do.

have a baby. Okay?

-It takes that door

01:07:58,096 --> 01:07:59,428
You're one of us, man.
You're one of us!

889
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,529
Kay, it's the only way.

890
01:08:00,531 --> 01:08:01,530
-Open the fucking door. Andy!
-You have to

891
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:02,464
-fucking run. All right?
-Andy, please!

892
01:08:02,466 --> 01:08:03,332
-It's the only way.
-Andy!

893
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:05,634
-You have to run!
-Please!

894
01:08:05,636 --> 01:08:07,736
Open the fucking...

895
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:10,675
Kay! Kay!

896
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,409
No, no, no.

897
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,445
Kay!

898
01:08:25,556 --> 01:08:26,624
I'll open it.

899
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:28,892
She's all right. She's moving.

900
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:30,661
No. It's all right.

901
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:40,469
Andy,
open the door, please.

902
01:08:40,471 --> 01:08:42,941
Andy, I need to go
and get her.

903
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:45,809
I'm truly sorry.

904
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:47,610
There was nothing I could
have done to save her.

905
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:50,180
You could have opened
the fucking door!

906
01:08:50,182 --> 01:08:51,984
We'd all be dead if I had.

907
01:08:54,152 --> 01:08:55,684
We need to move
before the creature

908
01:08:55,686 --> 01:08:56,853
finds its way into this room.

909
01:08:56,855 --> 01:08:57,923
Andy...

910
01:09:00,058 --> 01:09:02,426
what's your prime directive?

911
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:05,730
I'm afraid
I have a new directive.

912
01:09:06,731 --> 01:09:08,965
To do what's best
for the company.

913
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:14,004
I need to remove that module.

914
01:09:14,006 --> 01:09:16,607
I'm afraid that's not in the
best interest of the company.

915
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:24,749
We need to move.

916
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:26,617
Now.

917
01:09:36,494 --> 01:09:38,096
How could you do that?

918
01:09:39,463 --> 01:09:40,498
What?

919
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:42,801
Leave someone behind?

920
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:48,706
Where are we going?

921
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:54,010
To finish a task Rook
has entrusted upon me.

922
01:09:54,012 --> 01:09:56,012
When completed,
he'll clear the <i>Corbelan</i>

923
01:09:56,014 --> 01:09:58,848
for departure and open
the docking bay doors.

924
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,184
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

925
01:10:01,186 --> 01:10:03,186
And I'll return to Jackson.

926
01:10:03,188 --> 01:10:04,455
And stay in Jackson.

927
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:11,196
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

928
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:23,541
We're here.

929
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,834
<i>Romulus Beta Lab.</i>

930
01:10:50,836 --> 01:10:55,740
<i>All personnel require</i>
<i>A-1 security clearance.</i>

931
01:10:57,843 --> 01:10:59,175
What is that?

932
01:10:59,177 --> 01:11:02,544
Probably some fucked up
bio-weapon, I'm sure.

933
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:03,882
<i>Actually, quite the opposite.</i>

934
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:07,716
<i>Andy, tell them.</i>

935
01:11:07,718 --> 01:11:09,551
<i>Tell them what I told you.</i>

936
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:11,087
Our colonies are dying.

937
01:11:11,089 --> 01:11:14,259
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

938
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,259
Toxic mine fumes.

939
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:19,595
It's all one unforeseen
tragedy after the other.

940
01:11:19,597 --> 01:11:22,999
<i>Mankind was never truly suited</i>
<i>for space colonization.</i>

941
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:25,137
<i>They're simply too fragile.</i>

942
01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:28,006
<i>They're too weak.</i>

943
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,075
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

944
01:11:32,077 --> 01:11:33,877
"The perfect organism."

945
01:11:33,879 --> 01:11:35,814
That's how we should
refer to human beings.

946
01:11:37,015 --> 01:11:40,784
<i>So, I set this wrong right.</i>

947
01:11:40,786 --> 01:11:43,889
<i>I took its gift for humanity.</i>

948
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:49,025
Inside the parasitoids
I bioengineered

949
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:50,659
from the Xenomorph's DNA,

950
01:11:50,661 --> 01:11:52,898
I discovered a unique
non-Newtonian fluid.

951
01:11:53,765 --> 01:11:55,932
<i>Life.</i>

952
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:59,601
<i>In its most primal,</i>
<i>unadulterated form.</i>

953
01:11:59,603 --> 01:12:01,271
<i>This microorganism</i>
<i>can be the most</i>

954
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:04,240
<i>destructive pathogen</i>
<i>ever observed.</i>

955
01:12:04,242 --> 01:12:07,243
<i>But acetylated</i>
<i>and synthesized in our lab,</i>

956
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:08,878
<i>I've turned it</i>
<i>into the miracle</i>

957
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,083
<i>Mr. Weyland died</i>
<i>searching for.</i>

958
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,684
Prometheus fire.

959
01:12:14,718 --> 01:12:17,655
The divine gift to humanity.

960
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:22,192
<i>Z-01 contains</i>
<i>the genome responsible</i>

961
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:24,160
<i>for the Xeno's ability</i>
<i>to accelerate</i>

962
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,863
<i>and slow down</i>
<i>its metabolism at will.</i>

963
01:12:26,865 --> 01:12:30,133
<i>Its symbiotic capableness</i>
<i>easily rewrites</i>

964
01:12:30,135 --> 01:12:31,970
<i>the host's DNA</i>
<i>through its blood.</i>

965
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:39,809
<i>This is a much needed and well</i>
<i>overdue upgrade for humanity.</i>

966
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:43,313
<i>We simply cannot wait</i>
<i>for evolution anymore.</i>

967
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:46,116
Yeah, can we
get out of here now?

968
01:12:46,118 --> 01:12:47,851
My mission is to take
this back to the colony

969
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:49,020
for further development.

970
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:51,356
Rook is tracking the compound.

971
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,722
When detected inside our ship,

972
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:54,858
he'll open
the docking bay doors

973
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,928
and set the hauler on
autopilot back to the colony.

974
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,264
Wait.

975
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:03,101
Do you see it?

976
01:13:07,806 --> 01:13:09,405
There.

977
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:11,042
The fucking thing's
huntin' us.

978
01:13:12,377 --> 01:13:15,178
Right. New plan.

979
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:16,414
Can you manage yourself
with a gun?

980
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,018
Yes, I fucking can.

981
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,724
Right, this is an
F44AA pulse rifle.

982
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:30,692
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

983
01:13:30,694 --> 01:13:32,061
It's what the
Colonial Marines used.

984
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:33,930
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

985
01:13:33,932 --> 01:13:35,433
So, right,
you put that under your arm.

986
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:40,272
That's it.
Right, this hand here.

987
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:45,275
All right.
Aim it towards Andy.

988
01:13:45,277 --> 01:13:46,444
Pull the trigger halfway.

989
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:48,947
Don't worry, the safety's on.

990
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:55,051
See?

991
01:13:55,053 --> 01:13:56,819
Aiming assistance.

992
01:13:56,821 --> 01:13:58,054
If that thing
comes towards you,

993
01:13:58,056 --> 01:14:00,890
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

994
01:14:00,892 --> 01:14:02,761
-Where'd you learn all this?
-Uh...

995
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:06,196
Games and magazines.

996
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:08,464
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

997
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:10,200
450 rounds.

998
01:14:10,202 --> 01:14:12,003
And you mustn't fire
a single one.

999
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,007
Acid for blood. Remember?

1000
01:14:17,075 --> 01:14:19,075
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

1001
01:14:19,077 --> 01:14:20,910
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

1002
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:22,278
You shoot that creature

1003
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,816
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

1004
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:26,182
And we all die.

1005
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,017
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

1006
01:14:28,019 --> 01:14:30,019
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

1007
01:14:30,021 --> 01:14:32,290
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

1008
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,224
Maybe.

1009
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:35,393
Big maybe.

1010
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:38,296
I found us a way
through the conveyor belt.

1011
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,098
This way.

1012
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,869
Andy.

1013
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:47,806
Are you there?

1014
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:24,909
<i>T-minus</i>
<i>20 minutes to impact event.</i>

1015
01:15:36,855 --> 01:15:38,888
There's a lift
at the end of this corridor.

1016
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,558
It will take us
directly to our ship.

1017
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:55,271
There's more
of those things.

1018
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:57,273
Yeah, that's not good.

1019
01:15:57,275 --> 01:15:59,577
They seem to have been
here for quite some time.

1020
01:16:07,118 --> 01:16:08,153
Andy?

1021
01:16:27,572 --> 01:16:29,441
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:16:34,346 --> 01:16:36,114
Busy little creatures.

1023
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,094
I think we better go back
and find another way.

1024
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:52,564
That might be a good idea.

1025
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,933
Andy,
see if you can open this gate.

1026
01:16:56,935 --> 01:16:58,403
Stop.

1027
01:17:00,105 --> 01:17:01,172
What?

1028
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:15,251
Kay!

1029
01:17:15,253 --> 01:17:17,053
Hey!

1030
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:18,089
Tyler!

1031
01:17:19,224 --> 01:17:20,356
Tyler!

1032
01:17:20,358 --> 01:17:21,393
Kay!

1033
01:17:24,195 --> 01:17:25,230
Kay!

1034
01:17:30,301 --> 01:17:31,336
Kay!

1035
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:45,417
Kay!

1036
01:17:46,384 --> 01:17:47,452
I got her, I got her.

1037
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:52,722
It's all right. We got you.

1038
01:17:52,724 --> 01:17:54,058
She's alive.

1039
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:04,333
Okay, we got you,
we got you.

1040
01:18:04,335 --> 01:18:06,102
Hold on.

1041
01:18:06,104 --> 01:18:07,303
Okay.

1042
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:12,008
We're here,
we're here.

1043
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:13,543
Tyler, she's losing
a lot of blood.

1044
01:18:13,545 --> 01:18:15,580
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

1045
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:18,047
How do you know?

1046
01:18:18,049 --> 01:18:20,616
There's no dead
parasitoid by her feet.

1047
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:22,587
Andy, this is on you.
So you do something.

1048
01:18:23,455 --> 01:18:25,056
Please! Andy!

1049
01:18:30,061 --> 01:18:33,329
25% of the human genome
is shared with rats.

1050
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:34,732
And it worked on the rat.

1051
01:18:39,537 --> 01:18:40,572
Come on, Kay.

1052
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,274
Don't.

1053
01:18:45,276 --> 01:18:46,411
What choice do I have?

1054
01:18:47,345 --> 01:18:48,611
We take her back to the hauler

1055
01:18:48,613 --> 01:18:50,513
and we put her
in the cryo-pod. Okay?

1056
01:18:50,515 --> 01:18:52,148
That will keep her alive
long enough to

1057
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:54,016
get her proper treatment
back at the colony.

1058
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:55,585
I don't trust this.

1059
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:57,053
Andy, will she make it?

1060
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:58,356
If we hurry.

1061
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:18,743
Go! Go!

1062
01:19:25,683 --> 01:19:27,049
I see it. I see it.

1063
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:28,317
This is it,
this is it.

1064
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:30,286
I got her.
I got her. I got her.

1065
01:19:30,288 --> 01:19:32,121
You're okay.
You're okay.

1066
01:19:32,123 --> 01:19:33,792
We're so close.
We're so close.

1067
01:19:36,528 --> 01:19:38,261
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

1068
01:19:38,263 --> 01:19:40,630
Hey, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

1069
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:41,765
You see, you're so close.

1070
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:43,334
You just gotta hang in there.

1071
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:48,772
Watch out!

1072
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:55,378
Tyler?

1073
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,815
Tyler!

1074
01:20:27,145 --> 01:20:28,779
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

1075
01:20:35,653 --> 01:20:37,153
Andy!

1076
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:46,397
No! Tyler!

1077
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:59,502
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

1078
01:21:59,504 --> 01:22:01,504
This goes
straight to our ship.

1079
01:22:01,506 --> 01:22:04,775
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

1080
01:22:04,777 --> 01:22:07,412
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

1081
01:22:08,513 --> 01:22:10,212
Can you do that?

1082
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:14,316
Yes?

1083
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:15,620
What about you?

1084
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:18,356
I'll find a way back.

1085
01:24:13,404 --> 01:24:14,705
Let me take it out.

1086
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:17,642
And I'll fix you in return.

1087
01:24:22,815 --> 01:24:24,049
Listen to me.

1088
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,850
You'll die in here

1089
01:24:26,852 --> 01:24:28,350
and that's not
in the best interest

1090
01:24:28,352 --> 01:24:30,588
of the company or mine.

1091
01:25:02,855 --> 01:25:06,825
Come on. Andy, please.

1094
01:25:20,438 --> 01:25:21,472
Andy.

1095
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:25,944
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, no.

1096
01:25:26,677 --> 01:25:29,513
No, I'm sorry.

1097
01:25:48,901 --> 01:25:50,701
It won't
hold them off for long.

1098
01:26:17,229 --> 01:26:19,162
Come on.

1099
01:26:19,164 --> 01:26:20,696
<i>You're</i>

1100
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:22,935
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1101
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:26,535
Open the door.

1102
01:26:26,537 --> 01:26:28,737
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I must deny your petition.</i>

1103
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:31,207
<i>I just can't risk</i>
<i>compromising the compound.</i>

1104
01:26:31,209 --> 01:26:33,742
<i>But know that I'm grateful</i>
<i>for the invaluable help</i>

1105
01:26:33,744 --> 01:26:35,180
<i>you two have provided</i>
<i>to the company.</i>

1106
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:38,784
Son of a bitch!

1107
01:26:44,089 --> 01:26:46,156
Andy, open it.

1108
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:47,192
-Here.
-Open.

1109
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,192
It's not working.

1110
01:26:49,194 --> 01:26:50,693
God damn it!

1111
01:26:56,868 --> 01:26:59,535
<i>I can't lie</i>
<i>about your chances,</i>

1112
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:01,006

01:27:20,759 --> 01:27:22,225
<i>Press it,</i>

1114
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,763
<i>so I can take control of your</i>
<i>ship and fly you out of here.</i>

1115
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:28,965
Who are you?

1116
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:30,102
<i>A friend.</i>

1117
01:27:32,037 --> 01:27:35,005
<i>Your companions died</i>
<i>so you could live.</i>

1118
01:27:35,007 --> 01:27:36,873
<i>Press the button...</i>

1119
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:38,709
<i>and let me</i>
<i>honor their sacrifice.</i>

1120
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:50,554
Andy, can you tell me
one of your jokes?

1121
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,723
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1122
01:27:57,262 --> 01:27:59,896
-'Cause they taste funny.
-They taste funny.

1123
01:27:59,898 --> 01:28:01,867
I don't understand
cloning at all.

1124
01:28:02,934 --> 01:28:04,136
That makes two of us.

1125
01:28:05,636 --> 01:28:08,604
I read a great book
about zero gravity.

1126
01:28:08,606 --> 01:28:10,641
-I just couldn't put it down.
-Couldn't put it down.

1127
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:14,712
Rain?

1128
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:16,281
Rain?

1129
01:28:17,249 --> 01:28:19,182
Rain, what are you doing?

1130
01:28:19,184 --> 01:28:20,718
I'm turning off
the gravity generator.

1131

<i>two, one.</i>

1135
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:41,206
Rain, are you sure about this?

1136
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,007
Only one way to find out.

1137
01:28:50,382 --> 01:28:51,649
It works.

1138
01:29:10,202 --> 01:29:12,304
Rain! You're at 40%.

1139
01:29:23,815 --> 01:29:24,881
20%.

1140
01:29:36,161 --> 01:29:38,163
Rain!

1141
01:29:48,739 --> 01:29:50,142
Oh, fuck.

1142
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,885
Stay behind me.

1143
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:06,424
Andy, be careful.

1144
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:33,751
Rain!

1145
01:30:50,335 --> 01:30:51,803
Andy, you okay?

1146
01:30:57,976 --> 01:30:59,811
We need
to get to the elevator.

1147
01:31:14,059 --> 01:31:16,326
The elevator won't work
without gravity.

1148
01:31:33,245 --> 01:31:34,279
Ready?

1149
01:31:44,289 --> 01:31:46,224
Rain!

1150
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,371
Fuck.

1151
01:32:14,052 --> 01:32:15,086
No.

1152
01:32:26,264 --> 01:32:27,499
It's a gravity purge!

1153
01:32:38,176 --> 01:32:39,475
Andy!

1154
01:32:39,477 --> 01:32:40,512
Come on.

1155
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,226
Andy!

1156
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:35,258
Get away from her.

1169
01:36:33,745 --> 01:36:36,214
-Thank you.
-You're gonna be just fine.

1170
01:36:37,115 --> 01:36:38,216
Both of you.

01:37:07,745 --> 01:37:09,314

<i>Have a nice day.</i>

1185
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:29,298
Now you better listen to me
here, now, you two.

01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:32,303
You are insignificant in the
great scheme of things. You...

No.

1188
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:58,229
