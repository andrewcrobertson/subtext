Good, cold evening, gentlemen.

45
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,785
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.

46
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,994
Might that be you?

-[Ace] Who wants to know?
-Well, I do.

I'm Dr. King Schultz.

-What kind of doctor?
-[Schultz] Dentist.

Now, are you the Speck Brothers,

51
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,469

at the Greenville slave auction?

00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,347
-So what?
-So, I wish to parley with you.

is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

Hello, you poor devils.

59
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:25,408
Is there one amongst you who was formerly
a resident of the Carrucan plantation?

60
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,578
[Django] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

61
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,960
Who said that?

62
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,297
What's your name?

of these three gentlemen again,

My good man, did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture,

84
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,998

with lethal intention?

I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
but I didn't want you to do anything rash

92
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,041
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

93
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,420

94
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,964

00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,386
I only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me.

97
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,472
And I do believe I have...
One, two, three, four...

98
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,517

attest to that fact.

-No doubt.

down to a minimum,

101
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,401
I'd like to finish my line of inquiry
with young Django.

-[Dicky] God-fucking-damn it!
-As I was saying...

104
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,578
if you were to see
the Brittle brothers again,

105
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,079
you could recognize them?

106
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,721
Yeah.

108
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,545

for young Django, here?

109
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,470
That iron is nasty business.

110
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,852
Could you hold this for a moment?

111
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,147
Thank you.

112
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,441

113
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,818
Also, if I were you,

114
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,781
I'd take that winter coat
the dear, departed Speck left behind.

115

for young Django, here. And since
he won't be needing it anymore,

122
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,789
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

123
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,792
Also, Mr. Speck,

124
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,379

So, as I see it,

133
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,008
when it comes to the subject
of what to do next,

134
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,886
you gentlemen have two choices.

135
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,597
One. Once I'm gone,

136
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,641
you could lift that beast
off the remaining Speck,

137
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,351
then carry him to the nearest town.

138
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,813
Which would be at least 37 miles
back the way you came.

139
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,669
Or, two.

140
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,234
You could unshackle yourselves...

141
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,069
take that rifle,

142
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,114
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

143
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,367
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country.

144
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,578
Choice is yours.

145
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,663
Oh, and on the off chance

146
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,416

amongst you,

00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,359
[innkeeper] <i>Sheriff! Help!</i>

177
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
Alas.

178
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,697
Now, we must act as our own bartender.

179
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,785
Sit down, my boy.

180
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,047
-What kind of dentist are you?
-[chuckles]

181
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

182
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,310
But these days,
I practice a new profession.

183
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,487
Bounty hunter.

184
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,739
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

185
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:50,533
No.

186
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
Well...

187
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,582
The way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

188
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,001
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

189
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,378
[clicking tongue] Hat.

190
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,675
<i>Prost.</i>

191
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,978
The state places a bounty on a man's head.

192
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,106
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

193
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,068
After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities.

194
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,613
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

195
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,949
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

196
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:36,204
I truly have killed him, at which point,
the authorities pay me the bounty.

197
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,291
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh-for-cash business.

198
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,919
What's a bounty?

199
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,132
It's like a reward.

200
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,302
You kill people
and they give you a reward?

201
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,638
Certain people, yeah.

202
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,848
-Bad people?
-Ah!

203
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,309
Badder they are, bigger the reward.

204
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,770
Which brings me to you.

205
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,107
And I must admit, I'm at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to you.

206
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,694
On one hand, I despise slavery.

207
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,114
On the other hand, I need your help.

208
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,742
If you're not in a position
to refuse, all the better.

209
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,498
So for the time being, I'm gonna make
this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.

210
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,709
Still, having said that...

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,066
I feel guilty.

212
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,969
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

213
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,936
I'm looking for the Brittle brothers.

214
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,027
However, at this endeavor,
I'm at a slight disadvantage,

215
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,738
insofar as I don't know
what they look like.

216
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,243
But you do. Don't you?

217
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,495
I know what they look like, all right.

218
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,202
Good.

219
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,957
So, here's my agreement.

220
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,876
You travel with me until we find them.

221
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,211
-Where we going?
-Ah,

222
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,089
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

223
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,299
but I don't know where.

224
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,929
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find them.

225
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,180
And when we find them...

226
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,726
you point them out, and I kill them.

227
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,500
You do that?

228
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,275
I agree to give you your freedom.
25 dollars per Brittle brother,

229
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,152
-that's 75 dollars.
-[chatter outside]

230
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,739
And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

231
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,416
Okay, boys. Fun's over.

232
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:47,918
Come on out.

234
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,884
All right, folks. Calm down.

235

Go about your business.

236
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,806
These jokers'll be gone, soon.

237
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,688
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

238
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,859
Scare all these nice people!

239
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,446

240
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:21,911
than to come into Bill Sharp's town
and show your ass?

-[gunshot]
-[woman gasps]

247
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,936
Now, you can get the marshal.

248
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,524
[innkeeper] Marshal! Marshal!

249
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,734
-[Schultz] Should we wait inside?
-Can't we just leave?

250
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,898
After you.

251
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,991
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

252
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,161
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

253
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,331
I want two men, two rifles
up on this roof,

254
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,041
two men, two rifles on that roof.

255
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,877
All the barrels aimed at that front door.

256
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,840
Somebody get poor Bill out of the goddamn
street.

257
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,134
You, in the saloon!

258
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,346
We got 100 rifles aimed
at every way out of that building.

259
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,058
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

260
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,438
You and your nigger come out, right now,
with your hands over your head

261
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,605
and I mean right now!

262

[Schultz] <i>Is this the marshal</i>
<i>I have the pleasure of addressing?</i>

263
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,279
Yes, it is.

264
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,823
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

265
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,950
[Schultz] Na, wunderbar, <i>marshal.</i>

266
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,288
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

267
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:53,419
and, just as you have instructed,
I am ready to step outside

268
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,298

273
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,691
You mean, like you did our sheriff?

274
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,277
Shot him down like a dog in the street!

275
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,571
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

276
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,907
Do I have your word, as a lawman,

277
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,327
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street?

278
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,375
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

279
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,961
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

280
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,673
Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.

281
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,969
They're a little tense out there,

282
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,723
so don't make any quick movements
and let me do the talking.

-[door opening, closing]
-Come ahead.

284

-You unarmed?
-[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

285
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,114
Marshal Tatum, may I address you

286
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,576
and your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey,

287
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,578
as to the incident that just occurred?

288
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,261
Go on.

289
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,679
Thank you.

290
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,210
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

291
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,338
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

292
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,008
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

293
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,304
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

294
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,433
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck

295
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,687
with a price on his head of 200 dollars.

296
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,398
Now, that's 200 dollars, dead or alive.

297
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,191
The hell you say?

298
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,279
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news,

299
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,239
but I'm willing to wager

300
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,118
this man was elected sheriff
at some time in the past two years?

301
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,288
-Yeah.
-[Schultz] I know this

302
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,082
because three years ago,
he was rustling cattle

303
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,627
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

304
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,630
Now, this is a warrant

305
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:08,095
made out by circuit court judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

306
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,389
You're encouraged to wire him.

307
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:15,436
He'll back up who I am
and who your dear departed sheriff was.

308
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,070
In other words, marshal...

00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,930
And after this...

515
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,725
we'll see if you break eggs again.

516
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,229
John Brittle!

517
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,794
You remember me?

518
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:16,216
[girl gasps]

519
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,433
I like the way you die, boy.

520
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,817
Goddamn son of a bitch!

521
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,742
[grunts]

522
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,336
Keep it funny!

523
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,008
[screams]

524
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,561
[Little Raj groans]

525
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,196
Y'all wanna see something?

526
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:22,031
[cocks gun]

527
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,743
[Little Raj groans] No!

528
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,619
-[groans]
-[gunfire]

529
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,416
[cocks gun]

530
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,943
Who were they?

531
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,633
That's Big John, that's Little Raj.

532
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,415
Where's Ellis?

533
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,263
He's the one hightailing it
across that field right now.

534
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,436
-You sure that's him?
-Yeah.

535
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,438
-Positive?
-I don't know.

536
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,191
-If you're positive?
-I don't know what "positive" mean.

537
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,692
-It means you're sure.
-Yes.

538
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,819
-"Yes," what?
-Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

539
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,417
I'm positive he dead.

540
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:20,715
Django!

541
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:27,222
Everybody calm down.
We mean no-one else any harm.

542
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,932
Who are you two jokers?

543
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,352
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

544
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,814
of the criminal justice system
of the United States of America.

545
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,275
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

546
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,986
In my pocket is a warrant

547
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:46,491
signed by circuit court judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas

548
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,370
for the arrest and capture, dead or alive,

549
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,375
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

550
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,126
They were going by the name Shaffer.

551
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,257
[Schultz] You know them by the name
of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name

552
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,354
was Brittle.

553
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,886
These are wanted men.
The law wants them for murder.

554
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,304
Now, I reiterate.

555
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,391
The warrant states "dead or alive,"

556
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,769
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

557
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,106
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

558
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,944
I realize passions are high...

559
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,446
but I must warn you,

560
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,284
the penalty for taking deadly force
against an officer of the court

561
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,119
in the performance of his duty is...

562
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,955
you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

563
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:42,046
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

564
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,466
Gimme.

565
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,067
Satisfied?

566
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,826
May I have that back, please?

567
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,958
Get off my land.

568
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,877
Posthaste.

569
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,632
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,
and let's get out of here.

570
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,387
[Schultz whistles]

571
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,911
Yeah, that's them sons of bitches.

572
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,856
[men shouting and whooping]

573
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,619
[man 1] Come on, men!

574
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,289
[man 2] We're coming for you, nigger!

575
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:55,430
[Big Daddy] Now, unless they start
shooting first, nobody shoot them.

576
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,349
That's way too simple for these jokers.

577
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,853
We're gonna whup
that nigger-lover to death.

578
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:06,357
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip
that garboon myself.

579
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,990
Damn...

580
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,742
I can't see fucking shit
out of this thing!

581
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,161
[Randy] We ready or what?

582
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,872
[Big Daddy] Hold on,
I'm fucking with my eyeholes.

583
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,374
Oh. Oh, shit.

584
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,793
I just made it worse.

585
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,047
-[Harry] Who made this goddam shit?
-[O.B.] Willard's wife.

586
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,090
[Willard] Well, make your own
goddamn masks!

587
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,886
Look, nobody's saying they don't
appreciate what Jenny did.

588
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,555
[Redfish] If all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

589
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,474
I could've cut it better than this.

590
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,893
[Randy] What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

591
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,644
[Robert] Not too good.

592
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:48,191
I mean, if I don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good, more or less,

593
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,861
but when I start riding, the bag's
moving all over, and I'm riding blind.

594
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:52,904
Shit.

595
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,157
I just made mine worse.

596
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,911
Anybody bring any extra bags?

597
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:03,164
[Redfish] No, nobody brought an extra bag!

598
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,916
I'm just asking.

599
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,001
[O.B.] Do we have to wear them
when we ride?

600
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,252
Well, shitfire!

601
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,589
If you don't wear them as you ride up,
that defeats the purpose!

602
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,508
[Redfish] Well, I can't see
in this fucking thing!

603
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,427
I can't breathe and I can't ride
in this fucking thing.

604
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,638
[Willard] Well, fuck all y'all.
I'm going home.

605
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,557
Now, I've watched my wife work all day,

606
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,394
getting 30 bags together for you
ungrateful sons of bitches,

607
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,940
and all I can hear is criticize,
criticize, criticize.

608
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,276
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothing.

609
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,781
Now, look. Let's not forget
why we're here.

610
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,492
We got a killer nigger
over that hill, there.

611
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,702
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

612
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,956
Okay, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

613
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:50,711
[Robert] I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

614
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,589
-[Randy] Yeah.
-[Robert] But, not pointing any fingers...

615
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,716
they could have been done better.

616
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,012
So, how about no bags this time...

617
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:05,768
but next time, we do the bags right,
and then we go full regalia.

618
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:08,229
-[man 1] I like that idea.
-[man 2] You get my vote, brother.

619
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,982
Wait a minute! I didn't say no bags.

620
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,234
But nobody can see.

621
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,779
-So?
-So, it'd be nice to see.

622
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:22,076
Goddamn it, this is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see.

623
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:25,413
So what? All that matters is,
can the fucking horse see?

624
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,789
That's a raid!

625
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,959
-[men shouting]
-[Harry] Sons of bitches!

626
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,420
I can't see shit!

627
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,382
[Big Daddy] There he is.
Get that nigger out from under that wagon.

628
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,343
And get that nigger-lover
out of the wagon!

629
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,929
-That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!
-What?

630
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,764
-They tricked us.
-Where are they?

631
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,433
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

632
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,816
-Oh! [laughs]
-Bullseye.

633
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,485
[men screaming]

634
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,196
[Django] Look at them run.

635
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,328
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

636
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,087
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

637
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,968
Would you care to?

638
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,977
[Big Daddy] Can't see shit out of this!

639
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,521
-He's getting away.
-I got him.

640
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,609
[Schultz] Big Daddy's getting away.

641
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,751
I got him.

642
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,366
[bullet whistling]

643
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,742
[Big Daddy grunts]

644
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,156
Got him.

645
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,965
[horse neighing]

646
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:00,132
[chuckles]

647
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,676
The kid's a natural.

648
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,106
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

649
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,359
Broomhilda's a German name.

650
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,487
If they named her, it stands
to reason they'd be German.

651
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,073
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

652
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,827
Broomhilda is the name of a character

653
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:31,455
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

654
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,791
There's a story about Broomhilda?

655
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,543
Oh, yes, there is.

656
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,252
Do you know it?

657
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,344
Oh, every German knows that story.

658
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,352
Would you like me to tell you?

659
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,771
Well...

660
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,776
Broomhilda was a... princess.

661
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,657
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

662
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,995
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

663
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,289
What she do?

664
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,168
I can't exactly remember.
She disobeys him in some way.

665
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,838
So, he puts her on top of the mountain.

666
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,798
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

667
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,635
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere.

668
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,015
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there,
to guard the mountain.

669
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,855
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

670
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,694
And there, Broomhilda shall remain...

671
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:50,368
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

672
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,912
Does a fella arise?

673
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,123
Yes, Django. As a matter of fact, he does.

674
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,501
A fella named Siegfried.

675
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,378
Does Siegfried save her?

676
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,632
Quite spectacularly so.

677
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:10,179
He scales the mountain
because he's not afraid of it.

678
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,141
He slays the dragon
because he's not afraid of him.

679
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,561
And he walks through hellfire...

680
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,024
because Broomhilda's worth it.

681
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,822
I know how he feel.

682
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,284
I think I'm just starting to realize that.

683
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,086
Now, look... Django...

684
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,926
I don't doubt that, one day,
you'll save your lady love.

685
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,472
But I can't let you go to Greenville
in a good conscience.

686
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:59,228
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't a place for you to visit.

687
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,022
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

688
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,111
But let me ask you a question.

689
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,079
How do you like
the bounty hunting business?

690
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,041
Kill white folks and they pay you for it?

691
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,419
What's not to like?

692
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,880
Now, I have to admit, we make a good team.

693
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,008
I thought you was mad at me
for killing Big John and Little Raj.

694
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,635
Yeah, on that occasion,
you were a tad overzealous,

695
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,179
but normally, that's a good thing.

696
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,432
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

697
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,184
What you mean, "partner up"?

698
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:42,730
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

699
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,317
I give you a third of my bounties.

700
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:51,155
So, we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts...

701
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,991
I'll take you to Greenville myself...

702
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,369
and we'll find where they sent your wife.

703
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,584
Why you care what happen to me?

704
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,171
Why you care if I find my wife?

705
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:08,957
Frankly...

706
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,595
I've never given anybody
their freedom before, and now that I have,

707
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,014
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

708
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
Plus, when a German meets
a real-life Siegfried,

709
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,977
that's kind of a big deal.

710
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,982
As a German, I'm obliged to help you

711
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,902
on your quest to rescue
your beloved Broomhilda.

Oh, no. She ain't no field nigger.

So, do we offer to buy her?

01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,310
So...

813
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,355

814
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,527
a man wants to buy a horse.

815
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,737
Needs to buy a horse.

816
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,243
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
knocks on the door and asks the farmer

817
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,121
to buy his horse. And you know
what the farmer says?

818
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,206
The farmer says, "No."

819
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:32,254
Well, I say, fuck that farmer.
And I'm stealing that horse.

820
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,632
Fair enough.
But now, you're a horse thief,

821
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,760
and they hang horse thieves.
Not to mention, the horse goes back

822
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,513
to its original owner,
because the horse is still his property.

823
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,308
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

824
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,769
If we ain't gonna try to buy her,
how we gonna get her?

825
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,691
May I offer an alternative plan of action?

826
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,025
Go ahead.

827
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:55,757
So...

828
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:00,782
The man walks up to the farmer's farm,
he knocks on the farmer's door...

829
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:06,538
and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

830
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,250
-Mm-hmm.
-And makes an offer so ridiculous,

831
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,919
the farmer is forced to say, "Yes."

832
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,882
-We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
-No, it's far too big.

833
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,759
But apparently, this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

834
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,597
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

835
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:24,861
What?

836
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:29,642
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

837
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:30,812

-Good to see you again.
-Mr. Moguy!

858
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:41,383
Thank you for your assistance in creating
the opportunity for this appointment.

859
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,093
[Leo] Nonsense, it's my job.

860
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,513
So, this is the One-Eyed Charly
I've heard so much about!

861
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,848
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

862
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,060
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

863
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,603
Just call me Leo.

864
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,148
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

865
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,068
[Schultz] How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

866
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,654
[Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

867
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,364
when we went to boarding school together.

868
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,659
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

869
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,829
One could almost say I was raised
to be Calvin's lawyer.

870
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,664
One could almost say youse a nigger.

871
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,708
What did you say?

872
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,836
-I said--
-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

873
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,924
Now, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

874
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:27,137
-Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
-[laughs] What civilized people aren't?

875
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,597

Don't speak French to him,

878
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,895
it'll embarrass him.

There you go.

882
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,034
Why do you want to get
in the Mandingo business?

883
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,373
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

884
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,669
[Candie] Quit stalling, now.
Answer the question.

885

[men continue grunting]

886
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,590
The awful truth?

887
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,719
I'm bored. This seems
like a good bit of fun.

888
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,310
Well, come on over.

889
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,979

-[Candie] Keep fighting, niggers!
-And, I might add, an honor.

Look at that.

918
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,175
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

919
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,677

921
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,014
No.

[Candie] Mr. Moguy, I want you
to take care of my new boy, here.

951
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:18,219
You find him a room with a soft bed,
then bring him up a pony to lick his pole.

952
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,598
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, you hear?

953
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,183
-Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.
-Before you go... Roscoe,

954
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,352
get Fred here a tall beer.

955

You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.

Yes, sir.

[Candie chuckles]

960
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,129
Where'd you dig him up?

961
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,716
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

962
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,094
I've heard tell about you.

963
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:04,474
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good,

964
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,602
ain't nothing nobody is selling
is worth buying. I'm curious.

965
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,355
What makes you such a Mandingo expert?

966
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,026
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

967
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,448
-What did you say, boy?
-Calm down, Butch.

968
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:22,909
No offense given.

[Schultz] Monsieur Candie,

01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:30,583
I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

973
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,963
you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

974
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,841
-Yes. I'll have a beer.
-Wonder-bar!

and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.

You are... Well, you are a neophyte.

01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:55,566
I'm simply trying to ascertain if this
cowboy, here, is taking advantage of you.

980
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,363
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

981
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,116
I didn't seek you out for your advice.

982
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:05,660
I sought you out to purchase
a fighting nigger

983
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,704
at above top-dollar market price.

984
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,165
I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

985
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,126
it would be to discuss business.

986
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,131
Well, we weren't talking business yet.

987
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,050
We were discussing my curiosity.

988
01:10:23,383 --> 01:10:24,429
Thank you.

Sheba, you stay right there.

991
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,522
I know you didn't mean me.

992
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,358

994
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,070
Now, according to Moguy,

995
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,533
if I do business with you,
I'm doing business with both y'all.

996
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,327
He does the eyeballing,
you the billfold? Is that it?

997
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:52,331
[chuckling] Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

998
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,655
Hmm.

999
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:55,850
So...

1000
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,339
Bright Boy, Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

1001
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,091
and you was none too impressed, huh?

1002
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,760
Not for top dollar.

1003
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,139
Then we got nothing more to talk about.

1004
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,808
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

1005
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,977
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell, so...

1006
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,146
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

1007
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:18,941
He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

1008
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:23,488
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

1009
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:29,410
Well, you won't sell your best.

1010
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,746
You won't even sell your second best.

1011
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:35,750
But your third best? You don't want
to sell him either,

1012
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:39,879
but if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

1013
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,965
[laughing] ...who knows what could happen?

1014
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,386
And what do you consider ridiculous?

1015
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,475
For a truly talented specimen?
The right nigger?

1016
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,103
How much would you say, Django?

1017
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,275
Twelve thousand dollars.

01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,617
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

1020
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,702
but now, you have my attention.

-Ah.
-Good morning, gentlemen.

1024
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,018
Good Dr. Schultz.
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1025
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,104
You couldn't have picked a better one.

1026
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,357
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the victoria?

1027
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,067
[Schultz] Oh, thank you very much.

1028
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,069
[Candie] You can tie
your horse up back there.

of my phrenologist colleagues

1031
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,965
is I believe there is
a level above bright...

1032
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:12,054
above talented, above loyal,
that a nigger can aspire to.

1033
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,143
Say, one nigger
that just pops up in 10,000.

1034
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,103
The exceptional nigger.

1035
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,148
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

1036
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,609
The sun is up.

1037
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,486
It's shining on all of us.

1038
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,618
Have a seat, doc.

1039
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,704
Thank you. Quite an honor.

1040
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,706
The honor is all ours. Thank you.

1041
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,917

1045
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,551
more frequent.

1046
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:53,964
Right, boy?

1047
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,016
You are that one in 10,000.

1048
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,436

not catch up, nigger.

1051
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,163
-Touch your guns, you die.
-[Candie] Everybody calm down.

1052
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,999
Now, I saw the whole thing. No harm done.

1053
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,252
-Are you kidding me? This nigger just--
-I said, no harm done!

1054
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,338
Now, take your hand off your pistol!

1055
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,509
Butch, that means you, too.

1056
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,221
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

1057
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,725
Hoot, get back up on your horse.

1058
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,019
[Hoot] He broke my collarbone.

1059
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:44,689
For God's sake,
somebody please help Hoot, here,

1060

back up on his goddamn horse.

1061
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,652
-[Nick] Yes, sir, boss.
-Oh, you are one lucky nigger.

1062
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,905
You better listen to your boss, white boy.

1063
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,116
Oh, I'm gonna go walking
in the moonlight with you.

1064
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,784
You wanna hold my hand?

I'm worse than any

Indeed!

01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,345
May we stop for a moment so I may
put a word in my man's ear?

1091
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:43,349
I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1092
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,644
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1093
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:50,815
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1094
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,903
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1095
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,863
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1096
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,870
-You're sure it's her?
-He didn't call her by name,

1097
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,248
but she's a young lady,
whip marks on her back

1098
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:10,376
and speaks German.
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1099
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,963
in this instance, I think
it's pretty safe. Point being...

1100
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,424
don't get so carried away
with your retribution.

1101
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,718
You lose sight of why we're here.

1102
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,931
-You think I lost sight of that?
-Yes, I do. Stop antagonizing Candie.

1103
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,645
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or, more than likely, get us both killed.

in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.

I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1106
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,322
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.

1107
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,575
I recall the man...

1108
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,620
who had me kill another man
in front of his son,

1109
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,330
and he didn't bat a eye.

1110
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:51,167
You remember that?

1111
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:54,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

1112
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,840
What you said was that this is my world.

1113
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,135
And in my world, you gotta get dirty.

1114
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:05,014
So, that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting dirty.

1115
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:12,146
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1116
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,024
that was the general gist.

1117
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,779
See you at Candyland.

1118
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,998

1119
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,168

but your ass can fight.

shut these goddamn dogs up?

1128
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:39,817

1137
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,658
A night. Day.

1138
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,994
Half the other night.

1139
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,039
How far he get off the property?

1140
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:36,915
About 20 miles off prop.

1141
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,626
Pretty far, considering that limp he got.

1142
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:45,341
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1143
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,884
One of this new lot.

1144
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:51,305
Way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1145
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:54,141
[D'Artagnan] Please, Monsieur Candie,
I ain't got it in me no more.

1146
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:57,227
Now, now, now. Now, no begging.

1147
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:00,314
No playing on my soft heart.

1148
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,487
-You in trouble now, son.
-Yes, sir.

1149
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,701
You know, I done paid 500 dollars for you.

1150
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,621
When I pay 500 dollars,

1151
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,332
I expect to get five fights
out of a nigger

1152
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,626
-before he roll over and play dead.
-Sir...

1153
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,921
You got to understand,
I'm running a business here.

1154
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:28,008
-You fought three fights.
-But I won every one!

1155
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,511
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
But that last one,

1156
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,679
you muddled the line
between winning and losing.

1157
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,893
Still, the fact remains.

1158
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,939
I pay 500 dollars,
I want five goddamn fights.

1159
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,525
So, what about my 500 dollars, huh?

1160
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,404
What about my 500 dollars?

1161
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:51,615
You gonna reimburse me?

1162
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,832
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1163
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,376
[all laughing]

1164
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,092
[Schultz] I'll reimburse you.

1165
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,263
You will?

1166
01:22:16,354 --> 01:22:17,391
Yep.

1167
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,896
You'll pay 500 dollars...

1168
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:27,234
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1169
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:28,485
No, he won't.

1170
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,573
He just tired of you
toying with him, is all.

1171
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,159
Matter of fact, so am I.

1172
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:38,203
But we ain't paying a penny
for that piccaninny.

1173
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,372
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1174
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,250
You heard him.

1175
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,638
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1176
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:00,058
He ain't never seen a nigger like you
ever in his life.

1177
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,561
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1178
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,275
That's right.

1179
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:08,692
[Candie] For that matter...

1180
01:23:10,224 --> 01:23:11,361
nor have I.

1181
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,952
Now,

1182
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:23,123
seeing as you won't pay a penny
for this piccaninny, here...

1183
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,795
you won't mind me handling this nigger
any way I see fit?

1184
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,507
He's your nigger.

1185
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:37,346
Mr. Stonesipher?

1186
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,725
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1187
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:44,186
[Stonesipher] Marsha!

1188
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,230
Marsha, get him!

1189
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,024
[dogs barking]

1190
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:50,484
Get him, get him!

1191
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,404
[all whooping]

1192
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,788
[D'Artagnan screaming]

1193
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,257
[screaming continues]

1194
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,979
Your boss looks a little green
around the gills

1195
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,981
for a blood sport like nigger-fighting.

1196
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,190
No.

1197
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,777
He just ain't used to seeing a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

1198
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,637
Mm.

1199
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:37,781
You are used to it?

1200
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,076
I'm just a little more used
to Americans than he is.

1201
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,245
-[Candie] Huh.
-Now,

1202
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,581
[in French accent] Monsieur Candie...

1203
01:24:46,231 --> 01:24:47,549
[in normal voice] whenever you're ready.

1204
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,419
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1205
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,796
Let's get to it.

1206
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,425
Because as of now, if he's an example...

1207
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,468
I ain't impressed.

1208
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,097
Follow me.

1209
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:23,666
[clicks tongue]

1210
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,092
[Jessie] Line them up
to the left here, now, boy.

1211
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,387
Stand up straight, now!

1212
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:07,618
Get up there.

1213
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,308
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1214
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,519
I said give me a line! Give me a line!

1215
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:14,563
Get in line, there! Straighten up!

1216
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,245
[Candie and Leo speaking indistinctly]

1217
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,792
-[Candie] Hello! Stephen, my boy!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1218
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,502
Hello, my ass.

1219
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,922
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1220
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,882
Oh, Stephen, you have
nails for breakfast?

1221
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,051
What's the matter? Why you so ornery?

1222
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,094
-You miss me, huh?
-[laughing] Oh, yes, sir.

1223
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,681
I miss you like a hog miss slop.

1224
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:35,936
-Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
-[both laugh]

1225
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,856
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1226
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,900
[laughs]

1227
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:46,822
Now, I asked you,
who this nigger on that nag?

1228
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:47,977
Hey, Snowball.

1229
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:53,161
Wanna know my name
or the name of my horse, you ask me.

1230
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:56,373
[Stephen] Just who the hell
you calling "Snowball," horse boy?

1231
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:59,501
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag
down here in the mud so fast,

1232
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,045
-make your head spin.
-Whoa, whoa! Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1233
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:05,632
Let's keep it funny. Django here's a
Freeman.

1234
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,552
-This nigger here?
-That nigger there.

1235
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:12,305
Let me at least introduce
the two of you. Django?

1236
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:15,350
This is another cheeky black bugger
like yourself, Stephen.

1237
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,060
Stephen, this here's Django.

1238
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,770
You two ought to hate each other.

1239
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:23,024
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1240
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:27,028
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1241
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,738
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1242
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:32,409
And you, you old, decrepit bastard,
ought to show them hospitality.

1243
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,911
-You understand that?
-[Stephen] Yes, sir. Him, I understand.

1244
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,247
But I don't know why I got to take
lip off this nigger.

1245
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,374
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1246
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,003
-Yes, sir. I understand.
-Well, good.

1247
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,673
They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

1248
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,509
He gonna stay in the Big House?

1249
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,262
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

1250
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,931
-In the Big House?
-You got a problem with that?

1251
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,475
No, I ain't got no problem with it.

1252
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,686
If you ain't got no problem
burning the bed, the sheets

1253
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,105
and everything else
when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1254
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,357
That is my problem. They are mine to burn.

1255
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,943
Now, your problem, right now,
is making a good impression.

1256
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:09,112
I want you to start
solving that problem, right now,

1257
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1258
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,242
Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.

1259
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,065
[Candie] Go on, now.

1260
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,582
[Stephen] Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in the Big House.

1261
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,710
-Your daddy rolling over in his grave.
-Man, the lip on him.

1262
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,880
-[Stephen muttering indistinctly]
-Phew! He's getting worse and worse. Now!

1263
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:31,593
[screaming] Where is my beautiful sister?

1264
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:33,470
There she is!

1265
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,555
[Candie whooping]

1266
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,100
Dr. Schultz,
this attractive Southern belle

1267
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,477
is my widowed sister.

1268
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:44,397
Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1269
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:49,361
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly?

1270
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,906
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get over by that pen.

1271
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:55,575
-[Tommy] Come on, Charly. Go on.
-[Bill] Let's go. Come on, now.

1272
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,702
You know where it is. Like you on a rope.

1273
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,831
[Tommy] Niggers don't walk
around here, niggers run.

1274
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:04,000
[Schultz] Ah, Monsieur Candie?

1275
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,177
[Candie] Mm?

1276
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,696
About that matter, about the nigger girl
you were talking about?

1277
01:31:09,921 --> 01:31:10,966
Nigger gal?

1278
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:14,344
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1279
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,805
Ah, yes, Hildi! What about her?

1280
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:21,518
Do you think, before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1281
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:25,855
You little dickens, you! [laughs]
I don't see why not.

1282
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:28,400
Stephen, when you get through
showing them to their rooms,

1283
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,361
go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up
and smelling real nice,

1284
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,823
-and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here.
-[laughs] Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1285
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:37,325
there's something I ain't
told you about, yet.

1286
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:41,162
-What?
-Uh... Hildi in the hot box.

1287
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,917
-[Candie] What's she doing there?
-[Stephen] What you think she doing there

1288
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,919
in the hot box? She being punished.

1289
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,714
-[Candie] What she do?
-[Stephen] She run off again.

1290
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:54,092
Jesus Christ, Stephen!
How many people ran away while I was gone?

1291
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,553
-Two.
-When did she go?

1292
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,014
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1293
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:02,475
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1294
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:06,521
[Stephen] Lucky for her, they was out
chasing D'Artagnan's ass.

1295
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,858
Bill and Cody went looking for her,
found her, brung her back.

1296
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,444
-Now, she a little beat up.
-Mm.

1297
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,405
But she done that to her own damn self,
running through them bushes.

1298
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,115
[Candie] How long she been in the box?

1299
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,201
[Stephen] How long do you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1300
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,079
And the little bitch got
10 more days be in there.

1301
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,291
-Still, take her out.
-Take her out? Why?

1302
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,334
Because I said so, that's why.

1303
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,588
Dr. Schultz is my guest.
Hildi is my nigger.

1304
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:34,841
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1305
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:38,094
-But Monsieur Candie, she run off.
-Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1306
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:40,889
What is the point of having a nigger
that speaks German

1307
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:43,433
if you can't wheel them out when you have
a German guest?

1308
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,727
-I...
-Now, I realize it is inconvenient,

1309
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:47,604
but still, you take her ass out.

1310
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:48,843
Yes, sir.

1311
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,942
[Candie] Lara Lee, will you
and Cora be responsible

1312
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:56,613
for getting Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz, here?

1313
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,866
-[Lara] Of course, darling.
-Now, gentlemen, I do apologize,

1314
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:03,078
but I am weary from our travels
beyond words.

1315
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:05,663
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1316
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,876
[clicking tongue]

1317
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:13,546
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up out of there!

1318
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:15,590
Cora, come here.

1319
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:19,844
Get over there, get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr....

1320
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,347
-What'd you say your name is? Shoots?
-Schultz.

1321
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,891
Schultz. Get her back
over here. Hurry up, girl.

1322
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:26,049
Yes, sir.

1323
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:11,646
[Broomhilda screaming]

1324
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:14,440
[Hoot] Come on, girl. Stand up.

1325
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:16,901
[Broomhilda] No!

1326
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:18,820
[gasping]

1327
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:26,995
[screams]

1328
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,956
[Broomhilda screaming]

1329
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:48,016
Is you coming with me, or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1330
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:53,938
["Ancora Qui" by Elisa playing]

1331
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,620
[Lara exhales]

1332
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:24,654
Hello, ladies.

1333
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:28,116
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1334
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,289
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1335
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,251
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1336
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,838
I've heard a lot of good things about you.

1337
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,008
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't you know.

1338
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,592
[both chuckle]

1339
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:50,179
[Schultz] As I look
at you now, Broomhilda,

1340
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:54,851
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1341
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,690
The doctor here speaks German.

1342
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,902
And I've been informed you do as well?

1343
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,323
Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.

1344
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:14,370
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1345
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,290
[Lara laughs]

1346
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,624
Astonishing.

1347
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,585
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1348
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,884
-And I shall bring--
-[Schultz] Much obliged.

1349
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:36,059
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1350
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,654
<i>Ja.</i>

1351
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:00,917
[speaking in German]

1352
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,294
Don't be afraid.

1353
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:07,965
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1354
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:42,821
Hmm.

1355
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,061
<i>Pardon.</i>

1356
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,798
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1357
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,005
<i>Danke.</i>

1358
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:05,565
{\an8}[speaking in German]

1359
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:37,930
{\an8}[laughs]

1360
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:23,309
<i>Ich verspreche es.</i>

1361
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:39,951
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1362
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,452
[gasps]

1363
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:45,873
[sighs]

1364
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:51,712
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1365
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:55,258
-Hurry up, girl.
-These ready, Miss Cora.

1366
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:56,842
No, no, no. They drinking, tonight.

1367
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:59,679
Go downstairs, get the big jug
with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like.

1368
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,848
Get your pretty ass out the way. You know
you like it.

1369
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:05,726
That's because you knows
what I like. [laughs]

1370
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,812
[Cora] Ooh! Come on
with these biscuits, girl.

1371
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:11,691
Look, Monsieur Candie,
they were all fine specimens,

1372
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:12,900
no doubt about it.

1373
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,697
But the best three by far were Samson...

1374
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:20,700
-What's that other one's name?
-Goldie.

1375
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,261
Goldie,

1376
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:23,953
and Eskimo Joe.

1377
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:27,123
By the way, why is he called "Eskimo" Joe?

1378
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:30,459
You never know how these
nigger nicknames get started.

1379
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:33,838
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1380
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,881
[all laughing]

1381
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:40,094
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.

1382
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:41,971
We all know that.

1383
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,932
You will never sell him,
and I can see why.

1384
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,392
He's a champion.

1385
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:49,645
Mm-mm-mm. All three are champions.

1386
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:51,856
Samson's the champion.

1387
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:54,150
Them other two pretty good.

1388
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,946
-Calvin, what's this nigger you let--?
-It's all right, it's all right.

1389
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,823
You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,

1390
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:04,785
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger-fight game,

1391
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:09,206
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1392
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,309
Is that right?

1393
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:14,545
[Schultz] Hence, I have big ideas when it
comes to presentation.

1394
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:16,964
-Mm.
-[Schultz] I need something more

1395
01:42:17,048 --> 01:42:18,215
than just a big nigger.

1396
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,470
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1397
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:24,972
-Need to have what? What?
-Panache. Uh...

1398
01:42:26,015 --> 01:42:28,601
-A sense of showmanship.
-Showmanship, yes.

1399
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:32,063
I want to be able to bill him
as the Black Hercules.

1400
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,731
[all laughing]

1401
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,567
-The Black Hercules! Isn't that clever?
-More like Nigger-les.

1402
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,694
[all laughing]

1403
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:40,613
I said, and I quote...

1404
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:46,827
"I would pay top dollar
for the right nigger."

1405
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:50,998
Now, I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1406
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,418
But is he right as rain?

1407
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:01,467
Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know
there is no-one in the nigger-fight game

1408
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:05,471
that appreciates the value of showmanship
more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.

1409
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:06,593
Nobody.

1410
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:08,891
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1411
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:10,476
-in the nigger-fight game.
-Mm-hmm.

1412
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:13,479
-And that is a nigger that can win fights.
-Mm-hmm.

1413
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:18,025
Now, that should be your first,
second, third, fourth and fifth concern.

1414
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,736
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1415
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,739
then you can start to implement
a grand design.

1416
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,368
In other words, first thing is first.

1417
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,828
First thing's first.

1418
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,835
[whispering in German]

1419
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:39,505
-[chuckles]
-Ooh! I see you two getting on.

1420
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:41,632
Famously!

1421
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:44,802
Oh, Monsieur Candie, you cannot imagine

1422
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:48,848
what it's like not to hear
your native tongue in four years.

1423
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,100
Well, hell, I can't imagine
two weeks in Boston!

1424
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,269
-[all laughing]
-[Stephen howls with laughter]

1425
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:56,897
Two weeks in Boston!
[laughs] Monsieur Candie, you a mess.

1426
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,859
[laughs] Two weeks in Boston!

1427
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:05,573
[Schultz] I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1428
01:44:05,698 --> 01:44:09,910
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1429
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:11,954
[Candie] Well, be careful, now,
Dr. Schultz.

1430
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,915
You might've caught yourself
a little dose of nigger-love.

1431
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:17,626
-Nigger-love's a powerful emotion, boy.
-[Stephen] Mm!

1432
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:21,130
It's like a pool of black tar.
Once it catches your ass, you caught.

1433
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:24,091
Yes, sir, you stuck. [chuckles]

1434
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,509
[Lara] I don't know, doctor.

1435
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:28,763
You can lay on all the German
sweet talk you want, but...

1436
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:32,683
it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1437
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:34,935
[Lara chuckles]

1438
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,938
Well, naturally!

1439
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:43,110
It is the soaring eagle that attracts
her attention, not the plucked chicken.

1440
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:44,653
[all chuckling]

1441
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,531
[Candie] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1442
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,450
You are quite
the dapper European gentleman.

1443
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:52,953
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes.
Put your elbow in these dishes, you hear?

1444
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:54,663
You know that nigger, don't you?

1445
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:57,333
-Who?
-"Who?"

1446
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,919
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talking about.

1447
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,464
At the table?

1448
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:05,591
I don't know him.

1449
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,384
You don't know him.

1450
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:09,887
-No.
-"No," what?

1451
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:11,701
No, sir.

1452
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,643
[chuckles]

1453
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:18,437
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1454
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,068
[tuts] Okay.

1455
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,614
Yeah. If you say so.

1456
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:38,332
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1457
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,335
But if it was my money...

1458
01:45:43,212 --> 01:45:45,256
I wouldn't pay no 12,000 dollars for him.

1459
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,091
What would your price be?

1460
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,885
Well, if I was inclined to be generous,

1461
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:53,055
and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1462
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:55,558
nine thousand.

1463
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:58,143
Maybe.

1464
01:45:58,864 --> 01:45:59,895
[Candie] Dr. Schultz.

1465
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:04,650
Let me re-clarify how this whole
negotiation came about.

1466
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:07,314
It wasn't me who came to you
to sell a nigger.

1467
01:46:07,414 --> 01:46:08,237
Sure wasn't.

1468
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,073
-It was you who approached me to buy one.
-Sure was.

1469
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:14,118
[Candie] That 9,000 dollars Bright Boy's
been bandying about

1470
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:17,246
ain't too far off. If I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that

1471
01:46:17,329 --> 01:46:19,540
-I could do so any day of the week.
-Any day.

1472
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:23,836
But like you said in Greenville, doctor,
I don't wanna sell him.

1473
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:29,133
It was only your ridiculous offer
of 12,000 dollars

1474
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:31,385
-that made me even consider it.
-Mm-hm.

1475
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:44,231
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1476
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:45,733
[chuckles]

1477
01:46:47,857 --> 01:46:48,944
[Schultz bangs table]

1478
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:53,073
Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
Eskimo Joe, 12,000 dollars.

1479
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:56,452
Hooray, doctor. Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1480
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:59,914
However, that is a tremendous
amount of money.

1481
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,417
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,
I have a lawyer.

1482
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:05,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1483
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:08,839
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1484
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:12,384
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1485
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:15,137
-Mm-hmm.
-Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined

1486
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,555
by a physician of my choosing.

1487
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,727
-[Candie] Naturally.
-So, say I return in about...

1488
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:26,815
-five days' time.
-Five days?

1489
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,525
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1490
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:30,819
And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy

1491
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:33,197
can hash out the finer details
between themselves.

1492
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:37,326
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1493
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:39,476
Gentlemen...

1494
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:42,289
may I propose a toast?

1495
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:46,377
To Eskimo Joe.

1496
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:50,130
Or shall we call him the Black Hercules?

1497
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,716
-[all laughing]
-[Schultz] To the Black Hercules.

1498
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:55,886
-[Stephen] The Black Hercules!
-The Black Hercules.

1499
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:58,931
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.

1500
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:00,140
[chuckles]

1501
01:48:00,224 --> 01:48:04,311
Mm. Hildi? Top my drink off.

1502
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:11,819
So, Hildi, how you like serving
at the big table in the Big House, huh?

1503
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,447
When Monsieur Candie
talk to you, you answers.

1504
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,617
-I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
-[Candie] Mm-hmm!

1505
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,245
It's better than sizzling in that hot box

1506
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:23,580
or dragging your ass
through a bramble bush.

1507
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:27,042
Maybe not quite as much fun as getting
to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1508
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:28,919
-huh, sugar bear?
-She like them niggers.

1509
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:30,963
-Like Samson? Huh?
-[Broomhilda] No, sir.

1510
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,759
You know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here
might be interested in seeing

1511
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:39,138
Hildi's peeled back, seeing as how
they don't have many niggers

1512
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:40,222
where he come from.

1513
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:42,975
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone
with Hildi, here,

1514
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,311
did you just speak German,
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1515
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:50,065
-No, we just talked, and--
-[Candie] So you haven't seen her back?

1516
01:48:50,352 --> 01:48:51,400
I haven't.

1517
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:54,695
No, no, no. Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1518
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:58,532
Hildi, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back, here. Go on.

1519
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:02,536
[Lara] Uh... Calvin! I just got her
all dressed up and looking nice.

1520
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:05,748
[Candie] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf!

1521
01:49:05,831 --> 01:49:08,792
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1522
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:11,503
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the nigger's endurance for pain.

1523
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:15,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1524
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:17,760
Hildi's got something like
four lashes on her back.

1525
01:49:17,843 --> 01:49:20,095
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1526
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:22,181
Look at that, doctor.
It's like a painting.

1527
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:23,348
[shouting] Calvin!

1528
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:27,227
[whispering] We are eating. Ain't no-one
wanna look at her whipped-up back.

1529
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:30,981
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

1530
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,984
After dinner, then, Stephen. After dinner.

1531
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:36,987
During the brandies, gentlemen. Hmm?

1532
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:44,995
[Lara] Cora, come get this girl.

1533
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:50,375
-She a mess.
-Yes, ma'am.

1534
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:55,422
Oh. Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up. Come on in here.

1535
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:06,183
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1536
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:08,018
You say you ain't know him.

1537
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:11,605
-[Broomhilda] Huh?
-I said...

1538
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:15,567
you said you ain't know him.

1539
01:50:17,486 --> 01:50:18,490
[Broomhilda] I don't.

1540
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,489
Yes, you do.

1541
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:24,118
Mr. Stephen...

1542
01:50:25,559 --> 01:50:26,578
I don't.

1543
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,789
Why is you lying to me?

1544
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:32,748
I ain't.

1545
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:34,586
Then why is you crying?

1546
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,464
You scaring me.

1547
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,466
Why is I'm scaring you?

1548
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:41,635
Because you scary.

1549
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:49,184
[Schultz] <i>To speak German this afternoon</i>
<i>with Hildi was positively soul-enriching.</i>

1550
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:52,729
[Candie chuckles] Doctor, that warms
my heart to hear that.

1551
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:55,691
You stay right here.

1552
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:06,118
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1553
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:08,662
Why, yes. Yessirree Bob, I did.

1554
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:12,291
In that case,

1555
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:16,670
allow me to propose another proposition.

1556
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,255
I'm all ears.

1557
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:19,923
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1558
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:22,509
-Monsieur Candie--
-[Candie] Stephen.

1559
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:25,679
[bangs table] You just
interrupted Dr. Schultz, here.

1560
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:29,433
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1561
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:32,102
My ears ain't worth a damn, these days.

1562
01:51:32,227 --> 01:51:33,312
Excuse him.

1563
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:36,273
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1564
01:51:37,566 --> 01:51:39,234
You mean get up out of my chair?

1565
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,486
If'n you could manage it.

1566
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:45,032
-Why?
-It's about dessert.

1567
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:46,158
What about dessert?

1568
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:49,620
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1569
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:51,830
[chuckling] We're having white cake!

1570
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:54,458
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing, back there?

1571
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:59,087
You right, Monsieur Candie, you right.
I'll handle it myself. [chuckles]

1572
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:00,672
[whispering] Meet me in the library.

1573
01:52:00,839 --> 01:52:04,218
[speaking] I just can't understand
why you won't come talk to these niggers.

1574
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:06,220
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1575
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:11,016
Fine, fine. Friend Stephen,
I... will be along momentarily.

1576
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:12,685
Yes, sir.

1577
01:52:13,332 --> 01:52:14,394
[Candie] Well...

1578
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,316
Gentlemen, as you can see, talented
as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,

1579
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:23,028
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1580
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:24,905
[all chuckling]

1581
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:27,282
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1582
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:35,582
You may clear the dinner service.

1583
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:40,837
[Cora] <i>You heard him.</i>
<i>Go on, get. Hurry up, girl.</i>

1584
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:42,089
So, Dr. Schultz...

1585
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:45,676
why don't you regale us
with a tale of the circus?

1586
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:48,637
-The circus? [laughs]
-Yes.

1587
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:56,645
What is the matter?

1588
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:07,114
Them motherfuckers ain't here
to buy no Mandingos.

1589
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:09,074
They wants that girl.

1590
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:10,826
[chuckles]

1591
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:14,288
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hmm?

1592
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:17,332
They playing your ass for a fool,
is what I'm talking about.

1593
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:21,378
They ain't here
for no muscle-bound Jimmie.

1594
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:23,297
They here for that girl.

1595
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:26,383
What... What girl? What, Hildi?

1596
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:30,262
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?
Them niggers know each other.

1597
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:35,058
-He just bought Eskimo Joe, I--
-Did he give you any money?

1598
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:37,561
-No, not yet, but--
-Then he ain't bought diddly.

1599
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,981
Not yet, no how.
But he's just about to buy...

1600
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:44,026
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1601
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:47,529
"Thank you, Stephen."
"You're welcome, Calvin."

1602
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,870
Where you getting all this?

1603
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:59,541
Why would they go through all that trouble
for a nigger with a chewed-up back

1604
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:00,876
ain't worth 300 dollars?

1605
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:04,755
They doing it 'cause that nigger Django's
in love with Hildi.

1606
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:06,465
She probably his wife.

1607
01:54:07,341 --> 01:54:10,344
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1608
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:12,971
is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.

1609
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:17,434
If she's who they want...

1610
01:54:18,477 --> 01:54:22,606
why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1611
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:25,984
You wouldn't pay no never mind
to no 300 dollar.

1612
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:28,278
But that 12,000?

1613
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:31,573
That made you real friendly,
now, didn't it?

1614
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,078
Yes, it did.

1615
01:54:39,915 --> 01:54:40,955
His wife, huh?

1616
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:48,799
If it had been a snake,
it would've bit me.

1617
01:54:49,049 --> 01:54:50,384
[chuckles]

1618
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:54,012
Those lying...

1619
01:54:55,347 --> 01:55:00,977
goddamn time-wasting sons of bitches.

1620
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:04,481
[claps] Sons of bitches!

1621
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:07,901
[Lara] ...out of New Orleans,
so I have quite a bit of practice

1622
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:10,570
with theater types. [chuckles]

1623
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:14,616
Oh, there you are! I was beginning
to think that you and that old crow

1624
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:17,744
-run off together.
-[all chuckling]

1625
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:19,538
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1626
01:55:20,288 --> 01:55:23,041
Lara Lee, I was just looking
out the big window.

1627
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,253
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1628
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,754
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1629
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:30,757
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball?

1630
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:32,551
-Hmm?
-Of course, brother.

1631
01:55:32,684 --> 01:55:33,987
-Thank you, darling.
-[giggles]

1632
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:50,485
-Yeah. Business never sleeps.
-Mm-hmm.

1633
01:55:52,904 --> 01:55:57,409
Apropos, before your exit,
we were discussing

1634
01:55:57,492 --> 01:56:00,078
the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1635
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:02,747
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1636
01:56:03,165 --> 01:56:05,292
And we will again, in a moment.

1637
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:23,226
Who's your little friend?

1638
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:27,272
[clears throat]

1639
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:29,983
This is Ben.

1640
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:35,906
He's a old Joe that lived around here
for a long time.

1641
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:38,533
And I do mean a long damn time.

1642
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:43,747
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1643
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,374
and my daddy's daddy.

1644
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:49,294
Till he up and keeled over, one day...

1645
01:56:52,714 --> 01:56:53,924
Old Ben took care of me.

1646
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,805
Growing up the son
of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1647
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:06,394
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lot of black faces.

1648
01:57:08,605 --> 01:57:13,235
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1649
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:18,281
surrounded by black faces.

1650
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:23,537
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out, I...

1651
01:57:24,412 --> 01:57:25,956
I only had one question.

1652
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:33,213
-Why don't they kill us?
-[laughs]

1653
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:37,676
Now, right out there on that porch,

1654
01:57:38,301 --> 01:57:40,428
three times a week for 50 years,

1655
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:45,016
Old Ben here would shave my daddy
with a straight razor.

1656
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:51,231
Now, if I was Old Ben, I would've
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1657
01:57:51,398 --> 01:57:54,442
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1658
01:57:57,487 --> 01:57:58,488
But he never did.

1659
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:01,691
Why not?

1660
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:06,913
You see, the science of phrenology...

1661
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,000
is crucial to understanding

1662
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:13,211
the separation of our two species.

1663
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,340
In the skull of the African, here...

1664
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:21,428
the area associated with submissiveness

1665
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:26,683
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1666
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:29,728
[sawing]

1667
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:35,775
[sawing]

1668
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:43,783
[Candie] If you examine...

1669
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:47,537
this piece of skull, here...

1670
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:53,856
[blowing]

1671
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:57,672
[Candie] ...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1672
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:04,596
Here, here and here.

1673
01:59:05,388 --> 01:59:11,269
Now, if I was holding the skull
of an... Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1674
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:14,439
these three dimples would be found
in the area of the skull

1675
01:59:14,522 --> 01:59:17,317
most associated with creativity.

1676
01:59:18,443 --> 01:59:19,819
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1677
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:22,572
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1678
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:24,991
unburdened by genius,

1679
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:29,788
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1680
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:32,153
servility.

1681
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:34,542
Now, Bright Boy.

1682
01:59:35,877 --> 01:59:37,921
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1683
01:59:40,799 --> 01:59:42,592
But if I took this hammer here...

1684
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,971
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1685
01:59:48,306 --> 01:59:50,475
you would have the same three dimples...

1686
01:59:51,476 --> 01:59:53,061
in the same place...

1687
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,189
-[wand chimes]
-[Candie] ...as Old Ben.

1688
01:59:57,399 --> 01:59:58,608
[roaring] Hey!

1689
01:59:58,733 --> 02:00:00,860
Now, lay your palms flat on that tabletop!

1690
02:00:01,236 --> 02:00:04,072
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1691
02:00:04,155 --> 02:00:06,658
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1692
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:11,955
There have been a lot of lies
said around this dinner table tonight,

1693
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:13,707
but that, you can believe!

1694
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:17,711
Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind
as to collect the pistols

1695
02:00:17,794 --> 02:00:19,337
hanging off these boys' hips, here?

1696
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,845
-Thank you ever so much.
-[Leo] Doctor.

1697
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:32,559
Where were we?

1698
02:00:37,522 --> 02:00:38,548
Jackass!

1699
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:43,695
Ah, yes!

1700
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:46,740
I do believe you were just getting ready

1701
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:49,117
to make me a proposition
to buy Broomhilda.

1702
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:50,911
Am I right?

1703
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:56,466
Right.

1704
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,128
Bring out Hildi!

1705
02:01:03,423 --> 02:01:04,758
[Stephen] Get over there yonder.

1706
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:08,595
-Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!
-[screams]

1707
02:01:08,678 --> 02:01:10,388
[Stephen] Lay your hands flat
on that tabletop.

1708
02:01:10,472 --> 02:01:11,639
[Candie] Now, shut your mouth!

1709
02:01:15,643 --> 02:01:16,853
Dr. Schultz,

1710
02:01:17,395 --> 02:01:21,441
in Greenville, you yourself said
that for the right nigger,

1711
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:25,653
you'd be willing to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1712
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:29,407
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1713
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:32,994
To which you said, "12,000 dollars."

1714
02:01:34,162 --> 02:01:37,707
Now, considering y'all have ridden
a whole lot of miles,

1715
02:01:37,999 --> 02:01:42,170
went through a whole lot of trouble
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1716
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:44,631
to purchase this lovely lady right here,

1717
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:47,967
it would appear
that Broomhilda is, in fact,

1718
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:50,053
the right nigger.

1719
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:53,765
And if y'all wanna leave
Candyland with Broomhilda...

1720
02:01:55,099 --> 02:02:00,522
the price is 12,000 dollars.

1721
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:04,400
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1722
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:08,071
Yes, I do, doctor.

1723
02:02:09,072 --> 02:02:11,449
You see, under the laws
of Chickasaw County,

1724
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:14,994
Broomhilda here is my property.

1725
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:20,917
And I can choose to do
with my property whatever I so desire.

1726
02:02:22,252 --> 02:02:24,212
And if y'all think my price...

1727
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:28,758
-for this nigger, here, is too steep...
-[yelps]

1728
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:31,177
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1729
02:02:35,265 --> 02:02:38,643
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1730
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:41,145
-Right in front of both y'all!
-Easy, big fella.

1731
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:45,400
Then, we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1732
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:49,487
Now, what's it gonna be, doc? Huh?

1733
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:51,614
-[Broomhilda sobs]
-What's it gonna be?

1734
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:54,909
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1735
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:57,875
Yes, you may.

1736
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:03,543
[Broomhilda sobs]

1737
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:12,933
That 12.

1738
02:03:16,973 --> 02:03:18,933
-Sold!
-[screams]

1739
02:03:19,183 --> 02:03:21,603
[Candie] To the man
with the exceptional beard

1740
02:03:22,061 --> 02:03:24,689
and his unexceptional nigger.

1741
02:03:30,945 --> 02:03:32,780
-Mr. Moguy.
-Yes, Calvin?

1742
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:37,076
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt
for 12,000 dollars, please?

1743
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:38,870
Twelve thousand dollars.

1744
02:03:42,206 --> 02:03:44,250
It was a pleasure
doing business with y'all.

1745
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:46,196
Now, gentlemen...

1746
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:49,756
if you care to join me in the parlor...

1747
02:03:50,965 --> 02:03:52,842
we will be serving white cake.

1748
02:03:54,218 --> 02:03:57,138
["Für Elise" by Ludwig van Beethoven
playing on harp]

1749
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:10,586
[D'Artagnan screaming]

1750
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:23,558
Well done, Calvin. [chuckles]

1751
02:05:25,643 --> 02:05:26,652
Excuse me.

1752
02:05:27,145 --> 02:05:28,187
Excuse me, ma'am?

1753
02:05:29,605 --> 02:05:31,607
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1754
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,027
Take your hands off the harp.

1755
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:38,740
[Stephen] Doctor.

1756
02:05:39,574 --> 02:05:42,076
-Doctor, you can't go in there.
-Stephen, Stephen--

1757
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,370
-He ain't got no business going in there.
-Let it be.

1758
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:47,790
He's just a little upset,
that's all. I'll handle this.

1759
02:06:14,192 --> 02:06:15,265
White cake?

1760
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:18,446
[Schultz] I don't go in
for sweets. Thank you.

1761
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:20,968
Hmm.

1762
02:06:25,551 --> 02:06:26,579
[Candie chuckles]

1763
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,875
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1764
02:06:32,126 --> 02:06:36,547
[Schultz] Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1765
02:06:37,006 --> 02:06:38,091
D'Artagnan.

1766
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:42,303
And I was wondering what Dumas
would make of all this.

1767
02:06:43,554 --> 02:06:44,604
Come again?

1768
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:51,687
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

1769
02:06:52,355 --> 02:06:53,981
[Candie] Yes, of course, doctor.

1770
02:06:54,148 --> 02:06:55,900
I figured you must be an admirer.

1771
02:06:55,983 --> 02:06:59,445
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1772
02:07:00,571 --> 02:07:04,117
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1773
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,993
I wonder what he would've made of it.

1774
02:07:08,538 --> 02:07:09,914
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1775
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:17,130
Yes. His approval would be a dubious
proposition at best.

1776
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:18,696
[chuckles]

1777
02:07:19,799 --> 02:07:21,092
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1778
02:07:23,594 --> 02:07:25,304
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1779
02:07:29,642 --> 02:07:32,478
-Are these Broomhilda's papers?
-[Candie] Yes, they are.

1780
02:07:32,728 --> 02:07:34,188
-May I?
-[Candie] Of course.

1781
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:35,419
Thank you.

1782
02:07:38,025 --> 02:07:40,903
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1783
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:43,156
and of course, her freedom papers, doctor.

1784
02:07:43,406 --> 02:07:45,449
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1785
02:07:46,868 --> 02:07:49,453
-Right over there on that little table.
-[Schultz] Thank you.

1786
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:12,165
Thank you.

1787
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:17,607
Broomhilda Von Shaft.

1788
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:22,236
Consider yourself a free woman.

1789
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:36,209
Mr. Candie.

1790
02:08:38,586 --> 02:08:42,048
Normally, I would say <i>auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1791
02:08:42,632 --> 02:08:46,802
But since what <i>auf Wiedersehen</i>
actually means is "till I see you again,"

1792
02:08:47,553 --> 02:08:50,556
and since I never wish
to see you again, to you, sir...

1793
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,851
I say goodbye.

1794
02:08:58,231 --> 02:08:59,296
Let's go.

1795
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:01,767
Come on.

1796
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:05,696
[Candie] One more moment, doctor.

1797
02:09:07,621 --> 02:09:08,658
What?

1798
02:09:13,537 --> 02:09:15,331
It's a custom here, in the South...

1799
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:19,168
once a business deal is concluded,
that the two parties...

1800
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:21,087
shake hands.

1801
02:09:22,505 --> 02:09:25,508
-It implies good faith.
-I'm not from the South.

1802
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:26,634
But you are...

1803
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,345
in my house, doctor.

1804
02:09:30,888 --> 02:09:32,556
So I'm afraid I must insist.

1805
02:09:32,765 --> 02:09:33,793
Insist?

1806
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:36,143
On what? That I shake your hand?

1807
02:09:36,227 --> 02:09:39,272
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist
in the opposite direction.

1808
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:43,192
-You know what I think you are?
-What you think I am?

1809
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:44,527
No, I don't.

1810
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:48,447
I think you are a bad loser.

1811
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:51,659
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1812
02:09:52,285 --> 02:09:53,341
[Candie] Nevertheless...

1813
02:09:54,161 --> 02:09:56,872
here in Chickasaw County,
a deal ain't done

1814
02:09:57,415 --> 02:09:59,667
until the two parties have shook hands.

1815
02:10:00,584 --> 02:10:03,254
Even after all that paper signing,
don't mean shit...

1816
02:10:04,588 --> 02:10:07,675
you don't shake my hand.

1817
02:10:08,926 --> 02:10:14,181
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away 12,000 dollars?

1818
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:15,933
I don't think so.

1819
02:10:17,566 --> 02:10:18,644
Mr. Pooch?

1820
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:24,483
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand...

1821
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:26,777
you cut her ass down.

1822
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:31,188
[cocks gun]

1823
02:10:49,258 --> 02:10:52,136
You really want me to shake your hand?

1824
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:55,556
I insist.

1825
02:10:57,016 --> 02:10:58,893
If you insist!

1826
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:18,954
[screaming] No! Calvin!

1827
02:11:20,498 --> 02:11:21,874
Calvin!

1828
02:11:28,089 --> 02:11:30,424
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1829
02:11:33,511 --> 02:11:35,513
[sobbing]

1830
02:11:43,145 --> 02:11:44,814
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1831
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,316
-[screams]
-Help, he's killing everyone!

1832
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,734
[screams]

1833
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,073
[groaning]

1834
02:11:58,869 --> 02:12:01,038
[Leo screams]

1835
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:05,918
-[man 1] Holy--!
-[Maynard] Shit!

1836
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:07,795
-[man 2] Son of a--!
-[Maynard] Bitch!

1837
02:12:08,546 --> 02:12:11,382
-[gunfire]
-[men yelling]

1838
02:12:11,757 --> 02:12:14,176
-[man 3] Damn it!
-[Maynard] Fucking... Get the...

1839
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:16,720
[Jessie groaning]

1840
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:19,473
[Maynard] Damn it,
son of a bitch! What...?

1841
02:12:19,765 --> 02:12:22,393
What the... Fucking... Goddamn it!

1842
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:26,063
-What the fuck is going on?
-[screams]

1843
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:29,817
You shot me! You stupid son of a...

1844
02:12:29,984 --> 02:12:31,235

You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

2011
02:24:02,467 --> 02:24:05,887
The 11,500-dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland

2012
02:24:05,971 --> 02:24:08,390
is in the form
of a "wanted, dead or alive" bounty

2013
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:10,475
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

2014

2015
02:24:12,519 --> 02:24:14,855
Smitty Bacall is the leader
of this murderous gang

2016
02:24:14,938 --> 02:24:16,982
of stagecoach robbers,
the Bacall Gang.

2017
02:24:17,691 --> 02:24:20,610
There's a 7,000-dollar
"wanted, dead or alive" bounty on him,

2018
02:24:20,986 --> 02:24:24,322
1,500 dollars for each
of his three accomplices,

2019

Dandy Michaels,

2020
02:24:26,408 --> 02:24:29,786

2022

2023
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:37,711
Because they just got away with murder.

2024

2037
02:25:15,957 --> 02:25:18,126
Yesterday, as a free man,

2038
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:23,131
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German, white partner,

2039
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:24,674
Dr. King Schultz.

2040
02:25:25,258 --> 02:25:28,094
We tracked the Bacall Gang
all the way from Texas

2041
02:25:28,386 --> 02:25:29,721
to Chickasaw County.

2042
02:25:30,263 --> 02:25:32,849
We finally found their ass
laying low in Candyland.

2043
02:25:33,225 --> 02:25:35,977
We went in there to get them,
things went sour...

2044
02:25:36,937 --> 02:25:39,814
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

2045
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:43,944
then everybody there decided to blame me,
so here I am.

2046
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:48,240
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

2047
02:25:48,698 --> 02:25:51,034
And all y'all know I ain't
supposed to be on this trip.

2048
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:54,537
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

2049
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:57,874
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing

2050
02:25:57,958 --> 02:26:00,293
they'd expect is y'all
riding back in there and getting it.

2051
02:26:01,002 --> 02:26:02,087
[Roy] Well, what's the deal?

2052
02:26:03,046 --> 02:26:06,633
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

2053
02:26:06,716 --> 02:26:08,760
No, no, no. I ain't gonna
tell you who they are.

2054

But you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

2055
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:17,560
