1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,125
Universal definitely has
an intense commitment

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:07,501
to preservation and
restoration of its film library.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,300
<i>The restoration of Jaws is
a tremendous responsibility.</i>

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,595
<i>Centennial Project is</i>

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,094
<i>Universal Pictures' 100th anniversary.</i>

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,722
<i>We are releasing 100 of our titles.</i>

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:25,352
Thirteen of our classic titles are
being fully restored on a film level.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,776
<i>In the case of Jaws,
this is history, culture.</i>

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,352
Whoa. Hold on.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,404
<i>What's exciting about this digital age</i>

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,448
<i>where we're able to restore these movies,</i>

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,151
<i>we can bring these classic movies</i>

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,282
back to life in a way that makes them

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,534
more vivid than even we remember them

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,706
when we went to the cinema to see them.

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,339
The restoration of Jaws
began with, literally,

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,884
going through our records,
our vault inventory,

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,963
and understanding what
elements were at our disposal.

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,555
<i>Universal has
always had a strong commitment</i>

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,642
<i>to preservation, restoration
in their film heritage.</i>

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,816
<i>In the library,
in the vaults we have here,</i>

22
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,237
we've got over
a million pieces of material.

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,657
<i>Around the world, we've got over
three million pieces of material.</i>

24
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,036
<i>In Jaws, there's about
2,700 pieces of this altogether.</i>

25
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,290
<i>When we started on the Jaws project</i>

26
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,245
<i>we determined that luckily, we
were able to use the original negative</i>

27
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>and that was our primary source.</i>

28
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,890
Working with a negative is always
gonna get you a better resolution.

29
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,592
<i>But passes on the element add up.</i>

30
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,351
The negative of Jaws was
pretty crummy, was pretty bad.

31
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,016
<i>The first thing we want
to do when we have that element,</i>

32
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,111
<i>we wanna make sure</i>

33
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,028
<i>that all the perforations are
correct, we don't have any tears.</i>

34
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,278
<i>Many sections had vertical scratches</i>

35
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,826
<i>running through significant
portions of the film.</i>

36
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,863
Come on in the water!

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,492
We felt the best result
was to do a wet gate scan.

38
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,300
<i>There is a special liquid
that will take all the scratches</i>

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,252
<i>and basically erase them.</i>

40
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,140
<i>As the film is on the scanner,</i>

41
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,934
<i>it's literally passed
through this liquid bath</i>

42
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,395
<i>so that those scratches are not visible</i>

43
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,814
<i>to the light that's
passing through that film.</i>

44
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,277
With <i>Jaws</i> the colorists need to have</i>

45
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,401
<i>as much information to
work with as possible.</i>

46
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,908
<i>We're checking to make sure that
the full range of the image is there.</i>

47
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,070
That's really what the
scanning process is about.

48
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,908
<i>Once we had the digital scans,</i>

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,667
<i>we went ahead and dealt with
issues such as film movement and dirt.</i>

50
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,374
<i>We have very high-end
graphics and editing systems.</i>

51
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,254
<i>These tools enable us
to take the digital data</i>

52
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,961
<i>that results from the film scans</i>

53
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,010
<i>and manipulate those pixels
in many different ways.</i>

54
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,260
<i>With Jaws, each damage was different.</i>

55
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,516
Just would have to
look at it and see if you

56
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,853
could take a frame after the
damage or a frame before.

57
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,648
<i>Part of a good frame here,
a good frame there.</i>

58
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,119
<i>Composite it together
and digitally clean it out.</i>

59
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,280
<i>You could spend three to
four hours on one frame.</i>

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Chief Brody!

61
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,997
When you're working with
an original negative,

62
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,080
<i>across some of the cuts, you
see tremendous differences</i>

63
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,586
<i>in color, brightness, contrast.</i>

64
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,757
<i>Our colorists do a great job
at matching all those shots.</i>

65
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,768
We had a particular
issue inside the cabin.

66
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,310
<i>Those windows didn't match cut-to-cut.</i>

67
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,065
I had to balance out the view
from the inside which changed.

68
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,737
<i>The viewer should not be distracted</i>

69
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,439
<i>because the levels of light are changing.</i>

70
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,241
<i>Nothing materially
was changed about the film.</i>

71
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,370
But the image on a really, really
good hi-def TV screen looks better

72
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,581
than the film looked when
first projected in 1975.

73
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,659
See that?
I got the crème <i>de la</i> crème.

74
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,294
Right there.
Mary Ellen Moffit.

75
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,003
She broke my heart.

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,885
The <i>audio side on</i> Jaws,

77
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,931
<i>our project was
to build a 7.1 up mix.</i>

78
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,099
<i>It's an iconic film.</i>

79
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,053
We're very sensitive to the
integrity of the original mix.

80
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,263
At that time, it was an analogue process.

81
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,440
They recorded on 35 mm mag.

82
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,360
<i>We're taking all that sound information</i>

83
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,936
<i>and adding additional channels to it.</i>

84
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,365
<i>That process consists
of taking the original dialogue,</i>

85
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,818
music and effects mono-tracks

86
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:51,281
and realizing that we're now
gonna place it in a 7.1 audio codec.

87
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,959
<i>To do that, you're gonna have to go
and get backgrounds and sound effects</i>

88
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,663
that can get you to move
left to right on the screen.

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,626
<i>Once you've got all those elements</i>

90
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,458
<i>picked out, then you've got the music.</i>

91
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,544
<i>There's certainly a number
of things about Jaws that are unique.</i>

92
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,222
A lot of that on
the audio side goes back to

93
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,050
those first two notes
in John Williams' score.

94
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,720
<i>They set the tone for the shark.</i>

95
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,022
Oh, God, help!

96
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,859
<i>Throughout the film, you
don't necessarily see the shark,</i>

97
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:32,030
<i>but you hear those notes, and
so the sound really drives that film.</i>

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,826
<i>In some places you don't hear anything.</i>

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,252
<i>You're underwater and
there's nothing but score.</i>

100
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,757
<i>That is what lets you know that
something is about to happen.</i>

101
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,054
Hey. He's taking it.

102
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,602
Go!

103
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,815
Boys, I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

104
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,857
The sound is better than
we've ever heard it before.

105
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,031
<i>Our whole intent is to be able to fulfill</i>

106
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,034
<i>the audio experience
in that 7.1 remix.</i>

107
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,373
<i>They put kind of a dinosaur sound</i>

108
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,999
when the shark is sinking
at the end of the film

109
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,580
and you can hear it better.

110
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,544
It doesn't overpower anything, it's just

111
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,174
gonna be a little more
audible to the ear now.

112
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,474
<i>The outputs of this
process are both film and digital.</i>

113
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,802
<i>We're restoring high
resolution digital files,</i>

114
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,854
<i>as well as recording a new negative.</i>

115
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,770
We do both because digital files,

116
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,942
while they are convenient to work with

117
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,111
<i>and they allow us a wide range of options,</i>

118
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,194
<i>for an archival means, we still
want a piece of film to put away.</i>

119
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,816
This is our cultural heritage.

120
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,326
<i>It's very important to
preserve the physical film,</i>

121
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,446
the 35 mm film and the negative.

122
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,618
<i>Film is a known commodity.</i>

123
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,747
<i>We can put that on a shelf and
store it in the proper conditions</i>

124
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,169
<i>and that thing will last 100 years plus.</i>

125
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,420
<i>It's the movie the people remember.</i>

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,798
It's just really crystal
clear and very vivid.

127
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,715
<i>I, quite honestly, have
never seen this level of commitment.</i>

128
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,098
We're very passionate about <i>Jaws</i>
and using the tools that we have

129
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,180
<i>it allows us to get the best
possible restoration.</i>

130
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,979
There's something else out there.

131
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,070
What is it?

132
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,363
It was a shark.

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,072
Originally in the theater,
you might have seen

134
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,116
<i>film movement as the print wore out.</i>

135
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,112
<i>Or you might have seen dirt
as the print got dirtier.</i>

136
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,540
<i>But today, with a digital file cleaned up</i>

137
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,789
<i>it looks like that
on play one and play 1,000.</i>

138
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,995
<i>The new Jaws is</i> still <i>the Jaws Jaws.</i>

139
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,257
<i>It's enhanced by
the HD Blu-ray experience.</i>

140
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,926
People are gonna like what they see.

141
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,052
<i>It looks amazing.</i>

142
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,591
<i>This shark, swallow you whole.</i>

143
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,138
<i>But I'll catch him and kill him.</i>

144
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,390
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

145
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,646
You're going to need a bigger boat.

146
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,771
The wonderful thing about this restoration

147
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,607
<i>is what you get is something
that for both sight and sound,</i>

148
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,327
is something that I didn't even
get when I made the movie.
