1
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,076
Mum!

2
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,810
Mum!

3
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,231
Mummy!

4
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,986
Mum!

5
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,319
Mum!

6
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,409
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,131
"And he climbed down that chimney,
straight into the huge black pot."

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,929
"And that was the end
of the big, bad wolf."

9
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,011
Did they really kill the wolf, mum?

10
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,559
I'm sure they did.

11
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,398
I'll kill the monster when it comes.

12
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,317
I'll smash its head in.

13
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,195
It's time to go to sleep now, sweetie.
It's very late.

14
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,160
Can we read it again?

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,459
"A long time ago, just yesterday, in fact,

16
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:55,005
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf..."

17
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,951
- What have you done?
- It's not broken. It just slipped.

18
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,248
I don't want you firing things off
in the house.

19
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,543
Watch this. When the monster comes,
I'm gonna do this.

20
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,461
Please don't!

21
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,880
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

22
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,469
Stand still, please.

23
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,465
- Look at me, mum.
- Come on, Samuel.

24
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,641
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

25
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,137
- Nothing in my hands. Nothing in my hands.
- I don't want you making weapons.

26
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,185
It doesn't work if you don't look at me.

27
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,392
This monster thing has got to stop,
all right?

28
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,157
Don't do that!

29
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,208
Ready?

30
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,173
Come on.

31
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,304
Quick. You're late already.

32
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,891
- What have you got in there?
- See you later, alligator!

33
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,146
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

34
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,698
- What?
- One with your milk in it.

35
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,860
I don't want milk.

36
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,661
No worries. I'll make you another one.

37
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,334
Ah, just where a woman should be,
in the kitchen.

38
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,629
Hm! Get to work, woman!

39
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,206
Do you want a cuppa?

40
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,917
No. I'm heading for the dementia ward.

41
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,924
Oh, it's a few years
before you end up there, isn't it?

42
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,802
Right?

43
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,227
Amelia. Your son's school is on the phone.

44
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,026
Oh, my god. Did he hurt anyone?

45
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,650
A dart could have gone into a child's eye
or even worse.

46
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,610
I'm gonna have a serious talk with him.

47
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,831
Mrs vanek, we've had the talks.
We've had the sessions with the counsellor.

48
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,831
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

49
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:26,876
He'll be separated from the other children.
The monitor will supervise him one on one.

50
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,379
Samuel won't cope with this.
He already feels so different.

51
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,555
I'll have a talk with him.
A serious talk.

52
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:37,386
Mrs vanek, the boy
has significant behavioural problems.

53
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,267
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

54
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,349
What he needs is some understanding.

55
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,067
I have 24 other first
graders in that class.

56
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,567
Do you want me to put them all at risk
because of your son?

57
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,485
I think I'll just find another school.

58
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,817
Mrs vanek, you can't just take the boy
out of school.

59
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,621
You see to your business, and I'll find a
school that sees my son as a human being

60
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,618
and not just another problem
to get rid of.

61
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,496
That's very unfair.
We're only trying to help the boy.

62
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,871
Please stop calling him the boy.

63
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,172
His name is Samuel.

64
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,132
We can see Ruby and auntie Claire
at the park today.

65
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,436
You can play on that swing you like
for as long as you like, ok?

66
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,102
Mrs Bowen hates me.

67
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,979
No, she doesn't.

68
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,565
You just need a break, that's all.

69
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,407
Don't tell auntie Claire what happened.

70
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,868
I'll tell her later.

71
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,241
- Mum, come and look at this.
- I can do it again.

72
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,960
Sam, don't bother the lady.

73
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,211
Oh, no, no, no, that's all right. We have
to go home and see daddy, though.

74
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,050
- My dad's in the cemetery.
- Oh, that's...

75
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,342
He got killed driving mum
to the hospital to have me.

76
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,842
Samuel.

77
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,056
- I'm sorry. He just...
- No, that's all right. I shouldn't have...

78
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,185
Well, your mum's very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

79
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,186
We have to go.

80
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,233
- Say, "see you later," Katie.
- Bye.

81
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,981
The artist was so drunk, he
vomited in front of his own installation.

82
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,983
I ost all these sales.

83
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,370
- You're not listening.
- Oh, lam, I am.

84
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,914
So you lost all these sales.
And then what happened?

85
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,867
Ruby, don't play there. It's wet.

86
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,495
Mum! Mum!

87
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,665
I'm gonna smash its head!

88
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,719
- Be careful.
- Mum, mum, I'm gonna smash it.

89
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,516
What would you like me to do
for Wednesday?

90
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,640
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

91
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,933
I was hoping Ruby would change her mind.

92
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,569
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

93
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,864
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

94
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,656
- She wants to have a Princess party.
- Mum! Mum!

95
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,451
That's ok. We don't have to come.

96
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,825
- You can still come.
- Mum!

97
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,376
She just doesn't wanna share the day
with Sam any more.

98
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,291
- I understand.
- Mum!

99
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,466
- I understand.
- Mum, I can go really high. Watch.

100
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,640
Maybe you wanna celebrate his birthday
properly this year, anyway... on the day.

101
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,929
Yeah, we'll see.

102
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,345
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy,

103
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,477
then this birthday thing rolls around
and I end up feeling awful.

104
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,183
I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.

105
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,612
We'll be fine. We'll be absolutely fine.

106
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,360
Mum! Look at me!

107
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,655
Mummy!

108
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,001
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, mrs roach.

109
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,376
You look tired, little one.
Have you been in the wars today?

110
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,883
A few wars.

111
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,010
He's had a big day, that's all.
He's just exhausted.

112
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,260
- Poor little sweetheart.
- Bugsy.

113
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,011
Hello, darling. Hello.

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,482
You look tired too, love. You ok?

115
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,276
Nothing five years of sleep wouldn't fix.

116
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,191
I'll put your rubbish out for you, Gracie.

117
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,986
No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.

118
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,489
I'll do it now, then it's done.

119
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,243
You can choose one tonight.

120
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,211
- Where'd you get this?
- On the shelf.

121
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,673
"If it's in a word or it's in a look,
you can't get rid of the babadook.

122
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,722
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

123
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,192
"then you can make friends with
a special one, a friend of you and me."

124
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,525
"His name is mister babadook,

125
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,576
"and this is his book."

126
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,323
"A rumbling sound, then three sharp knocks.

127
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,827
"Ba ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!

128
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,424
"That's when you'll know he's around.
You'll see him if you look."

129
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,847
"Ba ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!"

130
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,806
We might read another one tonight, hey?

131
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,847
But you said I could choose.

132
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,228
"This is what he wears on top.
He's funny, don't you think?

133
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,528
"See him in your room at night..."

134
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,736
Mum, does it hurt the boy?

135
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:36,086
Mum? Does it live under the bed? Mum?

136
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,246
Mummy!

137
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,754
Mummy!

138
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,842
"How sweetly they sang..."

139
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,014
"Telling of the happiness
and loveliness at the bottom of the ocean

140
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,558
"and entreating the seals
not to be afraid."

141
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,547
It's that time of the night again, time...

142
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:09,134
- If that's what the doctor ordered...
- Oh, yeah. That's what the doctor ordered.

143
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,773
Mum! It's in my room!

144
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,399
- What is?
- The babadook!

145
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:58,326
Oh, no. No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

146
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,453
The closet doors were closed,
and now they're wide open.

147
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,750
It's just a book. It can't hurt you.

148
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,050
You've had a big day.
You're just exhausted.

149
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,048
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, mum.

150
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,261
Nothing bad's gonna happen, Sam.

151
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,305
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,128
Mum, it's nine o'clock.

153
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,267
He's not running a fever any more.

154
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,650
No, no, no, my sister's going to take him.
Put it back.

155
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,740
Put it back or it goes in the bin.

156
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,904
Sorry. What was that?

157
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,322
Oh, no, no, I couldn't get to the phone.
He was vomiting.

158
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,499
Yeah, yeah, no worries. [I'll see you soon.

159
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,578
Samuel, no monster talk
at auntie Claire's, ok?

160
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,833
Samuel. No babadook, no nothing.
All right?

161
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,054
88. Number 88. Two fat ladies...

162
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,432
Good, Elaine. Another few days
and someone could call out bingo.

163
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,947
Number 11. Who has number 117?

164
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,031
Legs 11.

165
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,903
Ok. Let's see what else we've got.

166
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,659
Five billion. Anyone got five billion?

167
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,549
Beverly's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

168
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,639
Are you all right?

169
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,767
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

170
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,598
How are you? How's g wing?

171
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,309
Fine, yeah, just a bunch of old people.

172
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,656
You don't have to be fine, you know?

173
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,075
Just a bit stressed at the moment.

174
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,945
Why don't you go home?

175
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,035
Old cranky bitch, she goes after lunch.
I can cover for you.

176
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,120
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

177
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,550
- I'll give you my pay.
- Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.

178
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,842
You've got a sick boy. Life's too short.

179
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,675
You're so sweet, Robbie.

180
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,270
- You should go.
- Yeah.

181
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,518
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

182
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,446
Where have you been?

183
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,911
You weren't at work.
I've rung you a million times.

184
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,906
- What happened?
- He scared the crap out of Ruby, that's all.

185
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,458
He insisted on talking
to this bloody babadook thing.

186
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,420
All day, just talking to the air.
Even freaked me out.

187
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,568
- I'm so sorry.
- You need to get him to see someone.

188
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,833
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

189
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,334
It's not rubbish. It's real!

190
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,507
Don't you talk
to your auntie Claire like that!

191
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,805
- Where did you get those firecrackers?
- You got them for me on the Internet.

192
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,679
Well, that's the end of the Internet.

193
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,437
If the babadook was real,
we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?

194
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,065
It wants to scare you first.
Then you'll see it.

195
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,938
Well, I'm not scared.

196
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,991
You will be
when it creeps into your room at night.

197
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,734
That's enough.

198
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,286
You will be when it eats your insides.

199
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,872
I've decided you're not having
your birthday with Ruby.

200
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,699
No cake, no games, that's the end of it.

201
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,373
Samuel!

202
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,394
Ladies and gentlemen,
mum and dad.

203
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,060
Life is not always as it seems!

204
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,309
It can be a wondrous thing!

205
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,862
But it can also be very treacherous.

206
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,158
Don't worry, dad, I'll save mum.

207
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,161
I'm gonna trap the babadook like this.

208
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,341
When it's trapped, I'm gonna kill it!

209
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,384
Samuel?

210
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,978
- I was putting something back.
- All your father's things are down there.

211
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,185
He's my father! You don't own him!

212
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,947
Just thought I'd see how you were going.

213
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,244
Can I come in?

214
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,365
Hey, Matey. This is for you.

215
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,459
My mum always got me a model plane
when I was sick.

216
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,706
I'm not sick.

217
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,877
Oh. I... I thought...

218
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,630
No, he's not, actually.
The truth is, he's so disobedient,

219
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,258
- he can't go to school any more.
- You said that's not true!

220
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,135
How many six-year-old boys do you know
who still believe in monsters?

221
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:19,934
I hate you! She won't let me have a birthday
party and she won't let me have a dad!

222
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,705
Oh.

223
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,046
Don't eat it.

224
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,726
The babadook did it, mum.

225
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,987
Go and watch a DVD.
I'll make something else.

226
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,325
- The babadook did it!
- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

227
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:01,038
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys.

228
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:06,916
Welcome to the great Martin's
DVD school of magic.

229
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,588
Life is not always as it seems.

230
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:13,084
It can be a wondrous thing.

231
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,463
But it can also be very treacherous.

232
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:22,264
On this DVD, you will learn magic tricks

233
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,970
to surprise, to delight

234
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:31,231
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

235
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,002
Do you think this is funny?

236
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,842
Oh, no. No, no.

237
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,467
Give it to me!

238
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,894
Aaah!

239
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,059
Do you wanna die?

240
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:07,199
Mum! Mum! Mum!

241
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:12,002
Mum! Mum! Mum!

242
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,210
Mum! Mum!

243
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,014
Don't let it in!
Don't letitin! Don't let it in!

244
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,307
Don't let it in! Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

245
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,426
Mum, do we have
to go to Ruby's party?

246
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,480
I've already got this doll, mum.

247
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,066
Well, now she's got a twin.
They can go shopping together.

248
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,316
Off you go.

249
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,743
He's just really tired.

250
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,875
Go and play right now.

251
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,172
Claire tells me you're a writer.

252
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,967
Oh. No, not really, not any more.

253
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,389
What kind of writing did you do?

254
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,386
I wrote some articles for some magazines
and did some kids' stuff.

255
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,763
You just need to get back into it,
that's all.

256
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,855
It must be difficult.

257
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,605
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

258
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:44,985
and a few of them have lost their husbands,
and they find it very hard.

259
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,323
How's Richard's merger going?

260
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:54,373
Oh, good.
I mean, his workload's just ballooned.

261
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,201
- I've got the kids 24-7, it feels like.
- Tell me about it.

262
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,083
I don't even have time to go to the gym
any more. It's ridiculous.

263
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,834
That's a real tragedy.

264
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,710
Not having time to go to the gym any more?
How do you cope?

265
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,093
You must have so much to talk about
with those poor disadvantaged women.

266
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,103
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

267
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,562
I'm not hurting anybody.

268
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,903
Bye.

269
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,325
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

270
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,872
What are you doing? Hey!

271
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,873
How would your mum know if it's real
or not? She never comes to our house.

272
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,301
Mum told dad she didn't want to go
to your house cos it's too depressing.

273
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,388
The babadook
would eat your mum for breakfast.

274
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,807
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

275
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,347
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

276
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,430
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

277
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,981
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

278
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,852
- Isn't it time you moved on?
- I have moved on.

279
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,611
I don't mention him. I don't talk about
him. What strain is that on you, Claire?

280
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,360
You're not even good enough to have a dad.

281
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,408
Everyone else has one and you don't.

282
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,121
I do have a dad.

283
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,707
I listen to your life, day in, day out,

284
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,128
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

285
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:27,299
- 1 do. I want to know how you are.
- You don't come to our house any more.

286
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,918
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

287
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,800
I can't believe you just said that.

288
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,098
You can't stand
being around him yourself.

289
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,593
Your dad died
so he didn't have to be with you.

290
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,303
- That's not true!
- And your mum doesn't want you.

291
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,231
- No one wants you.
- Ah!

292
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,491
- What did you do?
- She said I didn't have a dad.

293
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,909
She kept saying it.

294
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,575
Is she all right?

295
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,581
Stay here and look after the children!

296
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,624
Do you want another one to get hurt?

297
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,713
Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!

298
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,428
Mummy! Mummy!

299
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,177
Mummy! Mummy!

300
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,142
- Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?

301
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,017
There is no babadook!

302
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,525
Get out!

303
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,363
- Get out!
- Samuel?

304
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,652
- Mummy!
- Stop this now.

305
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,528
Get out! Get out! Get out!

306
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,580
Mum! Mum! Mum!

307
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,133
Please help me!
There's something wrong with my son!

308
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,149
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

309
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,406
That's when the brain overheats.
It always looks worse than it is.

310
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,203
I've never seen anything like this.

311
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,624
We'll have to wait until the tests come
back. All his other results are normal.

312
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,329
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

313
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,583
- Very committed to the monster theory.
- That's an understatement.

314
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,008
- All children see monsters.
- Not like this.

315
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,093
And it's getting worse.
He's becoming aggressive.

316
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,313
He can see a psychiatrist. I can refer you.

317
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,023
- It takes a few weeks to get in.
- That'd be great.

318
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:57,070
But can you just give me something for now,
just... to make him sleep?

319
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,034
Just until...

320
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,033
Just until we can get an appointment.

321
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:11,293
Please. I haven't slept in weeks, and...
And neither has Samuel.

322
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,420
And when we go home tonight,
this whole nightmare will start up again

323
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:18,754
and I'm really... I'm really not coping.

324
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:28,605
I can give you a short course of sedatives,
just until the tests come back.

325
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:33,527
Most mothers aren't too keen on them
unless it's really bad.

326
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,025
It's really bad.

327
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:49,160
These can make children feel foggy,
perhaps some temporary nausea.

328
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,207
They'll certainly help him sleep, though.

329
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,753
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

330
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,389
- Why don't people like me?
- Why do you say that?

331
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,101
Ruby said people don't like me
cos I'm weird.

332
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,690
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

333
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,573
You just need to take your medicine,
have a big sleep and not worry.

334
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,823
I don't want you to die.

335
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,447
I'm not gonna die for a long time yet.

336
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,251
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

337
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,004
Just take your pill so you can go to sleep.

338
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:43,339
I've got the day off tomorrow.
Maybe we could do something.

339
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,721
Will these make the babadook go away?

340
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,345
I think so. But you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

341
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,983
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

342
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,561
Then I won't mention it.

343
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,695
I promise to protect you. Come on.

344
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,829
Come on.

345
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,379
Can you stay here with me?

346
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,589
Yes.

347
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,050
I love you, mum.

348
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,806
Me too.

349
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,362
Her nose is broken in two places.
She's gonna need surgery.

350
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,573
- I'll pay for everything.
- You can't even pay your own bills.

351
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,874
Look, I really have to go.

352
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,920
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

353
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,463
What?

354
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,087
A book turned up at our place.

355
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,341
I threw it away, but somebody glued it
back together and put it on our doorstep.

356
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:56,050
Amelia...
I just can't help you right now.

357
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,476
I don't expect you to help.
I... I just wanted...

358
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,771
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

359
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,314
I have to go.

360
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,620
Claire?

361
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,335
Hello?

362
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:37,220
Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!

363
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:51,109
Hi. I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

364
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,697
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Somebody sent me...

365
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,400
A children's book.

366
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,494
And...

367
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,701
And it contained violent and graphic images
of my child and me being murdered.

368
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,702
Can we have a look at the book, please?

369
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,959
I burnt it.

370
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,792
- You burnt it.
- Yes.

371
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:16,467
Well, unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do about it.

372
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,804
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

373
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,101
What's he been saying?

374
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,931
Nothing. He's just making these... noises.

375
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,773
How do you know it's the same person?

376
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,188
Because of what he wrote in the book.

377
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,982
The book you burnt?

378
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,231
Yes.

379
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,460
Ok. Don't worry about it.

380
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,063
Did you get your things done?

381
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,734
Mrs roach has Parkinson's.
That's why she shakes like this.

382
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,733
Samuel, you don't have to say everything
that goes through your head.

383
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,861
Oh, it's all right, love.

384
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:21,612
He wanted to know, so we talked about it.

385
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,455
He sees things as they are, that one.

386
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,750
Oskar was the same.
He always spoke his mind.

387
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,579
Do you have to keep on bringing him up?

388
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,295
Hey, bugsy.

389
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,575
Ugh!

390
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,583
Don't come in here.

391
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,386
I don't wanna buy anything.

392
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,511
- Are you Amelia vanek?
- Yes.

393
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,854
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue flannery,

394
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,897
from the department
of community services.

395
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,857
My son's only been away for two days.

396
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:19,483
He's not actually registered
at babbage bay any more.

397
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,732
If I could just come in and meet Samuel
and get you to look at these papers,

398
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,863
that'd be great.

399
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,489
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house at the moment.

400
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,331
I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.

401
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,965
Hello, Samuel.
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

402
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,964
How are you?

403
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,684
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
mum gave me.

404
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,599
Not drugs. Tranquillisers.

405
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,433
From the doctor. He had a fit yesterday.

406
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,190
- I'm really tired, actually.
- That's no good.

407
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,824
May I have a glass of water, please?

408
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:09,488
Yes, of course. I'll get you one.

409
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,215
It's a real mess.
I just found this cockroach infestation.

410
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:25,591
I normally have the house sprayed, I did
actually already have it sprayed, but...

411
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,386
There's this hole in the wall
behind the fridge and that's why I...

412
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:39,309
I didn't mean a hole in the wall.
There was a hole in the wallpaper.

413
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,236
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

414
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,656
We've caught you at a bad time.

415
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,741
I'll leave you with this.

416
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:51,241
We're required to come back in a week
to talk through your options.

417
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,031
Here's my card.

418
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,497
Mum!

419
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,499
I think I'm gonna vomit.

420
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,644
What was that noise I heard?

421
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,069
- I didn't hear any noise.
- Howling, doors slamming.

422
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,196
I declare,
Bonnie thinks this house is haunted.

423
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,785
Mum.

424
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,950
I'm gonna go to bed.

425
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:38,873
- Are you sick?
- Oh, no...

426
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,371
It's only six o'clock.

427
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,672
Don't you wanna stay up
with your mum for a while?

428
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,166
No.

429
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,261
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

430
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,434
You have to stay up for
a while, sweetheart.

431
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,911
Where's its mother, skip?
Koalas don't leave their babies about.

432
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,244
- Hey, you off now, then?
- Yep, soon as I fuel up.

433
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,021
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch on the radio.

434
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,286
I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

435
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,170
"And the prince and the Princess
lived happily together

436
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,970
"in a beautiful palace
for the rest of their days."

437
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:21,744
Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!

438
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,030
Where are we going?

439
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,702
We're going downstairs.

440
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,871
- Why?
- Because we are.

441
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,560
Iris, Iris, Iris.

442
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,349
No.

443
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,401
Glass and mirror attachment.

444
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,654
Clean and Polish shower doors or mirrors
for a streak-free shine.

445
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,487
As part of this special, we'll even
include the garment and upholst...

446
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,290
I don't wanna give it to anyone at work.

447
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,004
All right, give all my shifts away.
That's just what I need.

448
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,343
I can't help it if I'm sick.
What do you expect me to do?

449
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,720
You do that!

450
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:01,111
Mum, I took the pills,
but I feel sick again.

451
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,536
I need to eat something.

452
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,160
I couldn't find any food in the fridge.

453
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,082
You said to have them with food.

454
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,131
I'm really hungry, mum.

455
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,431
Why do you have to keep talk-talk-talking?

456
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,759
Don't you ever stop?

457
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,063
- I was just...
- I need to sleep.

458
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,812
I'm sorry, mummy,
I was just really hungry.

459
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,736
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

460
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:19,352
I'm so sorry. I don't know why I said that.
That was terrible.

461
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:25,404
I've had absolutely no sleep.
I didn't know what I was saying.

462
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,286
I'll cook you something, eh?

463
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,239
What would you like?

464
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,074
I'm not hungry any more.

465
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,674
We really need to get out of this house.

466
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:46,011
We've been cooped up here too long,
that's the problem.

467
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,177
Do you want to go to Wally's?

468
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:56,480
You can have anything you want, all right?

469
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,274
Even ice cream for breakfast if you like.

470
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:05,147
Give it back now. Give it back.

471
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,109
Stop it. Sit down. Sit down.

472
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,488
- No!
- Now.

473
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,821
- Give my drink back.
- Sit down, please.

474
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,838
Where are we going?

475
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,835
I just wanna drive for a little while.

476
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,891
Aah!

477
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,811
Mummy! Mummy!

478
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,685
Babadook!

479
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,615
You ran straight into me!

480
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,248
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

481
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,044
Driving on the wrong side of the road
with a kid in the back!

482
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,007
You could have killed someone!

483
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,596
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

484
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,930
Hey! Crazy bitch!

485
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,015
Hi, sweetheart.

486
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,695
Mum?

487
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,328
I can call auntie Claire.

488
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,413
I can call and she can come over.

489
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,002
Mum?

490
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,843
Auntie Claire doesn't wanna
talk to us any more.

491
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,845
Mum? Mum, look at me.

492
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,414
It's nice and warm in here.

493
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,378
I don't want you to go away.

494
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,716
I'm not going anywhere.

495
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,901
Mum?

496
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,576
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

497
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,957
I can call mrs roach.

498
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,128
I don't want you to call anyone.

499
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,175
I just need to sleep.

500
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,758
- Mum...
- Leave it!

501
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,007
Something in the house.

502
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,684
There is someone in the house!

503
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,204
Can we come and stay the night?

504
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,176
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

505
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:23,132
Has someone broken into the house?
Sam said that...

506
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,639
No, no, no. We're fine.
Samuel's just being very disobedient again.

507
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,812
Oh. I was so worried.

508
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,023
- I told him not to call anyone.
- He asked if you could stay the night.

509
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,102
No, no, no, we're fine.
I just have a headache, that's all.

510
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,651
- I really have to go, though, now, Gracie.
- Uh...

511
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,734
- I'm so sorry for troubling you.
- Yes. Talk soon?

512
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,194
No worries. Talk soon.

513
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,451
I told you not to call anyone
and you deliberately disobeyed me.

514
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,375
Do you wanna frighten mrs roach?

515
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:57,879
An old lady who can hardly walk.
Do you wanna make her sick?

516
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,261
Get that bloody thing off!

517
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:12,431
Is this the only way I can trust you not
to embarrass me in front of our neighbours?

518
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,980
Is this what I have to do?

519
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,752
I'm sorry, mummy. It's just that the
babadook made you crash the car,

520
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,711
- and then...
- What did you say?

521
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,049
- I said the babadook...
- The babadook isn't real, Samuel.

522
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,840
It's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

523
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,430
I just didn't want you to let it in!

524
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,724
I'll make sure nothing gets in tonight,
all right, Samuel?

525
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,222
Nothing is coming in here tonight.

526
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,770
Nothing!

527
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,479
I feel sick.

528
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:38,851
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

529
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,477
Mum, I don't think I need...

530
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,572
I am the parent and you are the child,
so take the pill.

531
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,214
Good boy.

532
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,242
Mum!

533
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,933
Hey, bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

534
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,646
Come here, sweetie.

535
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,440
Hey.

536
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,769
Hey.

537
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,543
Here we go.

538
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,766
There's more where that came from.

539
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,816
Decide, or we all die!

540
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,243
What's the secret...

541
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,041
- Letter of Max's.
- Not for a minute.

542
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,335
Don't lie.
You called me a jezebel. Why?

543
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,208
- The north...
- Natural corset...

544
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,548
With fresh meat...

545
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,967
Only five in a...

546
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,380
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

547
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:19,227
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife to stab her son.

548
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,688
His body was found in their basement.

549
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,767
The woman later attacked officers
with the knife.

550
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,399
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

551
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,362
Little is known about the tragedy,

552
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:34,610
but neighbours say the boy
was celebrating his birthday today.

553
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,740
He had just turned seven.

554
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,882
Samuel.

555
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,513
Wake up, mummy.

556
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,806
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

557
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,648
Don't go down there.

558
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,536
It's not safe.

559
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,077
I thought you were dead.

560
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,413
I thought you were dead.

561
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,347
We can be together.

562
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,601
You just need to bring me the boy.

563
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,584
You mean Samuel?

564
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,625
You can bring me the boy.

565
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,209
You can bring me the boy.

566
01:06:57,222 --> 01:07:00,214
- You can bring me the boy.
- Stop calling him the boy.

567
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:04,221
- I think it's going to rain.
- No.

568
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,849
No. No.

569
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,986
It isn't real, it isn't
real, it isn't real.

570
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,410
Oh, no.

571
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,628
Oh, no.

572
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,750
No.

573
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,761
No!

574
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,889
Bugsy.

575
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,422
Samuel!

576
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:10,714
Samuel.

577
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,268
Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.

578
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,812
You don't want him to die, do you?

579
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,400
Samuel, are you listening to me?

580
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,701
Let me in, you little shit!

581
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:42,413
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

582
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,293
Let me in!

583
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,238
You little pig.

584
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,610
Six years old
and you're still wetting yourself.

585
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:19,707
You don't know how many times
I wished it was you, not him, that died.

586
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,451
I just want you to be happy.

587
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,873
"I just want you to be happy.”

588
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:33,763
Sometimes I just wanna smash your head
against a brick wall

589
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,512
until your fucking brains pop out.

590
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:38,600
You're not my mother.

591
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,310
What did you say?

592
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:42,855
I said you're not my mother!

593
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,942
I am your mother!

594
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,656
Run, run, run, as fast as you can!

595
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,284
- Get away!
- Didn't I tell you not to play with weapons?

596
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,453
Ow!

597
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:52,842
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
I just wanted to make sure you were ok.

598
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,844
I'm ok.

599
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:02,431
I know this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

600
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:06,264
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

601
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:11,319
I just wanted you to know
that I'd do anything for you and Sam.

602
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,483
I love you both.

603
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,984
Samuel.

604
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,992
I'm sorry.

605
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,751
I understand you're scared.

606
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,790
I haven't been good since your dad died.

607
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,967
I haven't been good at all.

608
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,924
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

609
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,189
I just spoke with mrs roach.

610
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,069
We're gonna stay there tonight.

611
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,314
Do you want that?

612
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,871
I wanna make it up to you, Sam.

613
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:17,217
I want you to meet your dad.

614
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,589
It's beautiful there.

615
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,764
You'll be happy.

616
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,234
Sorry, mummy!

617
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:27,280
Mum! Mum!

618
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,532
I'm not leaving you.

619
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,371
Mum. Mum.

620
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,472
We said we'd protect each other.

621
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:53,727
I know you don't love me.

622
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,018
The babadook won't let you.

623
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,320
But I love you, mum.

624
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,111
And I always will.

625
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:16,879
You let it in! You have to get it out!

626
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,793
I don't want you to go away.

627
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,598
No! No! No! Mummy!

628
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,230
Mummy!

629
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:24,314
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

630
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,023
Mummy!

631
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,326
Mummy! Mummy!

632
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,534
- What is it?
- You can't get rid of the babadook.

633
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,884
Ow!

634
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,438
What do you want?

635
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,196
What do you want?

636
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,148
No.

637
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:30,364
Keep breathing.

638
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,617
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
Ten more minutes and we're there.

639
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,828
No.

640
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,250
I think it's gonna rain.

641
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,251
Stop!

642
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,718
You are nothing.

643
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,369
This is my house!

644
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,669
You are trespassing in my house!

645
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,350
If you touch my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

646
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,082
Mummy, don't!

647
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,546
Don't!

648
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,273
Watch out for your mum's leg, little one.

649
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,274
He's fine. I've had the stitches out.

650
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,448
- What time's the party?
- Any time after three is fine.

651
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,321
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

652
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,541
Bye. Bye, Sam.

653
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,081
That school's a good choice.

654
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,047
I've been doing a lot of reading about it,
so I think Sam'll be happy there.

655
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,718
He's been out of school over two weeks
now. It's time to get back.

656
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:46,175
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

657
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,055
- Are you having a party?
- It's Sam's birthday today.

658
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:54,601
My first birthday I've ever celebrated.

659
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:58,559
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. My first party on the day.

660
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,856
That's unusual.

661
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:06,650
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

662
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:09,950
He got killed driving mum
to the hospital to have me.

663
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:16,206
Sam's just like his dad was,
always speaks his mind.

664
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:20,547
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

665
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:25,386
My cousin's not coming
because I broke her nose in two places.

666
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,764
I'll take that for you.

667
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,362
Good shot!

668
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,913
I ook. There's another one.

669
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,865
Where's your bowl?

670
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,246
Wow. You've got a lot today.

671
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,917
Am I ever gonna see it?

672
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,136
One day, when you're bigger.

673
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:17,971
You go outside,
and you don't come in until I tell you.

674
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:07,901
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

675
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,448
Shh.

676
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,326
Shh, shh, shh.

677
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,576
Shh.

678
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,287
Shh, shh, shh.

679
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,877
Shh.

680
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,443
- How was it?
- It was quiet today.

681
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,981
Come here.

682
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:57,324
It's getting much better, mum.

683
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,660
Wait.

684
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,837
I have a new trick.

685
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,752
Life is not always as it seems.

686
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,589
Nothing in my hands, nothing in my hands.

687
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,687
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

688
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,276
Abracadabra!

689
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,492
How did you do that?

690
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,996
Come here, you. Come here.

691
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,846
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
