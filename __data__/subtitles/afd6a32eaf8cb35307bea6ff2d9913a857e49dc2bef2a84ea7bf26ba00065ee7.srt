1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,807
Okay, Will,
whenever you're ready.

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,596
Okay, just walking
into the room and

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,062
sitting down the way you sometimes see
at the top of a documentary.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,441
Where they use the B-roll,

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,278
but the person... the subject
didn't realize they were gonna use it.

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,571
But it's all natural.

7
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:35,744
Hi there. I'm Will Ferrell.
One of the greatest actors in the world.

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,081
A long time ago,
back when I was at <i>Saturday Night Live...</i>

9
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,458
Will Ferrell.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,169
I haven't made
a lot of friends here. Really.

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,421
...I met a guy named Andrew Steele.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,008
He was hired as a writer
the same week I was hired to perform.

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,801
Hello, I'm Robert Goulet.

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,304
He wrote a bunch of sketches for me.

15
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,638
Hello, you got Saddam.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,308
And he eventually became
the head writer of <i>SNL.</i>

17
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,185
Will you put the antlers down?

18
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,981
Andrew was Iowa-born and raised.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,441
501 jeans,

20
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,817
shitty beer,

21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,527
hitchhiking type of guy.

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,613
Three days.

23
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,696
No sleep.

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,867
Basically, a lovable curmudgeon

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,912
with a super weird,
creative sense of humor.

26
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,289
We worked
at <i>Saturday Night Live</i> for years,

27
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,791
and he kept bringing up

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,251
that he wanted to do
an after-school special.

29
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,338
Do you know the dangers
of diabetic ketoacidosis?

30
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,049
We goofed off a lot.

31
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,009
We drank a lot.

32
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,762
If you've ever
scratched your head and said,

33
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,639
"Why did Will Ferrell make that?"

34
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,809
there's a good chance
Andrew Steele was involved.

35
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,062
Why did I make a Lifetime TV movie?

36
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,439
Sarah can work.
I'll stay at home with the kids.

37
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,025
Why did I make a movie all in Spanish?

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,694
{\an8}Let's have
a race back to the house!

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,323
{\an8}Why did I make
a bunch of commercials for a shitty beer?

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,868
While this was all happening,
we both got married,

41
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,245
became dads,

42
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,039
and, over the years,

43
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,250
he became one of my closest friends.

44
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,421
When the pandemic hit,
we didn't see each other for a long time.

45
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,259
And then one day, I was in the middle
of shooting a movie in Boston,

46
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:19,097
and I got this email from Andrew.

47
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,181
"Hey, Will."

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,977
"Something I need you to know."

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,062
"I'm old now,

50
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,650
and, as ridiculous and unnecessary
as it may seem to report,

51
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,778
I'll be transitioning to live as a woman."

52
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,990
"In the last ten years,

53
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,284
I've been trying to understand
what's going on."

54
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,245
"Tried to get rid of it
over and over again throughout my life."

55
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,164
"Now I'm giving up the fight."

56
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,501
"When I was young,
I thought all boys felt like me."

57
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,671
"Then I thought,
'Maybe I'm just a weirdo.'"

58
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,592
"Then I pushed it away for many years
and ended up in therapy."

59
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,845
"It's a wonderful thing
when your mind and body

60
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,141
revolt against the unnatural,
despondent thing you've become."

61
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,020
"I doubt being a trans woman
will change my personality that much."

62
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,731
"Instead of an asshole, I'll be a bitch."

63
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,442
"I think it's made me a lot happier."

64
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,613
"I'd like to say my happiness
translates to a bright, carefree future

65
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,657
full of courage and confidence,
but no such luck."

66
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,660
"I... I carry self-doubt and fear around me,

67
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,913
like the comedian I've been
my whole life."

68
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,623
"I'm not gonna be good at this."

69
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:33,379
"It's really going to be slow
and awkward and terrifying and joyful."

70
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,508
"Mainly, I'm hoping
I don't lose anyone I care about."

71
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,511
"Thanks, name forthcoming."

72
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,392
That letter was really hard to send.

73
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,312
I kept rewriting it
over and over again and

74
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,565
trying to say what I wanted to say.

75
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,360
It was just... whoa.

76
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,738
This is... crazy.

77
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,244
The biggest question when people come out
of the closet is, "Will I still be loved?"

78
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,248
I've met trans people
who were not loved when they came out.

79
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,584
I don't doubt that Will is my friend,

80
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,711
but I'm not Andrew Steele anymore.

81
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,381
Okay, where do we go from here?

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,263
When I sent
the email out to Will,

83
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,851
he responded pretty quickly
that he supported me coming out.

84
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>♪ All by myself
Alone at home feeling blue... ♪</i>

85
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:19,402
I wrote her a note
saying I loved her and supported her,

86
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,572
and we'd check in with each other
whenever we could.

87
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,157
Oh!

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,450
Jackpot!

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,996
But... I still had a lot of questions.

90
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,791
And I have
a lot of questions I wanna ask Will.

91
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,338
Like what does being trans mean to him?
Does he think I'm a woman?

92
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,758
Does he know any trans people besides me?

93
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,593
Why the name Harper?

94
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,804
And how long did she feel this way?

95
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,390
What made her keep this in for so long?

96
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,312
Is he curious about hormones
and surgeries and hair removal?

97
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,150
Does he wanna ask me all the questions
you're not supposed to ask trans people?

98
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,694
Does she still like shitty beer?

99
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,322
Why does he think
Natty Light is a terrible beer?

100
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,115
Or is she just totally into wine now?

101
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,911
It's a fucking delicious beer.
It's the best beer out there.

102
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,247
How am I supposed to treat her?
Does she want it to change?

103
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,125
Will I be making a completely new friend?

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
Hello?

105
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,841
So then he called me,

106
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:29,180
and his idea at the time was, he knows
that I've been across this country

107
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,765
almost as much as a truck driver.

108
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,685
I've driven it. I hitchhiked. I...
I've been everywhere. I love it so much.

109
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,769
I made it.

110
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,356
I just don't know
if it loves me back right now.

111
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,984
After she had come out and transitioned,
she had kind of lamented,

112
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,489
"Gosh, I don't know if I can go
to these same places as Harper."

113
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,033
A kind of light bulb went off in my head
and was like,

114
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,077
"Harper, would you wanna do a road trip

115
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,206
where we visit these places
as this new version of yourself?"

116
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,625
"And at the same time,

117
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,420
we'd figure out
what this all means to us."

118
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,717
<i>♪ I drive a big freightliner

119
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,932
<i>♪ An' I drive to all the points

120
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,977
When I road-tripped as a guy,

121
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,229
I brought three T-shirts,

122
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,314
three underwears...

123
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,108
...and a pair of jeans.

124
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,779
Yeah, this is gonna be hard.
And the shoes are the hardest part.

125
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,447
Oh my God.

126
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,201
Every way
that this suitcase can be expanded,

127
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,953
I'm going to expand it.

131
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,879
I just brought a couple pair of shoes
'cause that's all you really need.

132
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,048
I got this deer hunter jacket,

133
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,719
which I'll probably hardly wear.

134
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,014
Sherlock Holmes costume.
I think I should bring it.

135
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,976
I'm just worried this isn't gonna fit.

136
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,146
Dang it.

137
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,106

139
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,571
Gotta have chairs, a cooler.

140
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,656
You never know when you're gonna stop

141
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,659
and need to drink a cold Natty Light

142
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,245
or whatever Will drinks.

143
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,123
Some kind of craft beer.

144
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,125

<i>I incessantly rang my call button.</i>

151
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>- I said, "Do they need help up there?"</i>
- Right. Of course.

152
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,738
<i>And they said, "Please, sir."</i>

153
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,990
- You're...
<i>- "Please relax."</i>

154
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,450

00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,377
- Gonna pick you up in the city.
<i>- All right.</i>

158
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,755
- Hey, I'll see you in New York, okay?
<i>- Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

159

We have
16 days out there on the road.

160
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,662
I'm sure a lot of things will come up,
but... it... it's weird.

161
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,622
We are good friends.

162
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,293
But are we?
Like, it's a weird thing to say.

163
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,004
I was always Harper Steele.

164
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,339
So Will was always
friends with Harper Steele.

165
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,011
But there was this persona
that he was also friends with

166
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,597
that I don't particularly like
or need right now.

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>Harper, I made it onto the flight.</i>

168
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,100
<i>Um...</i>

169
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,227
<i>All systems go.</i>

170
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,981
So many of us don't know
what the rules of engagement are.

171
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,610
And in terms of our friendship
and our relationship,

172
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,820
it's... it's... it's uncharted waters.

173
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>I'll see you later. Bye.</i>

174
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,496
I don't know why
he picked some weird spot.

175
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,958
Maybe it's just a celebrity thing.
He doesn't like to be out in the open.

176
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,588
What the fuck? Oh my God.

177
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,173
Yeah.

178
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
You made it.

179
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,847
Thanks for picking me up.

180
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,350
- What is this?
- Yeah. Van Cortlandt.

181
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,601
- Oh, that's...
- Remember?

182
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,519
- Oh, hey, old buddy.
- How are ya?

183
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,479
I do remember.

184
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,899
- Remember all our...
- Yeah, we golfed up here two times.

185
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,901
I still have my... my card.

186
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,403
My New York City golf permit.

187
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,687
- Wanna get in a round?
- Let's get in a round.

188
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,699
Okay. Oh Jesus.

189
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,661
- You look great, by the way.
- Oh, hey, thank you.

190
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,912
I love your jacket.

191
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,373
- I'm an expert packer.
- Oh yeah. That's...

192
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,125
- There we go.
- Yeah, no. That'll stay.

193
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
I can't wait to get in this.

194
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,299
How does this baby handle?

195
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,009
Uh, shittily.

196
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,429
- It handles shittily.
- Shag carpet everywhere.

197
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,723
- So comfortable.
- Oh, it's so luxurious.

198
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,184
- So luxurious. Let's go.
- All right, let's go.

199
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,533
I'd say we're gonna leave the city,
but I wanna have breakfast with my kids,

200
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,702
and then we'll hit the road after that.

201
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm excited to see your kids again.
I haven't seen them in a long time.

202
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,169
Hey!

203
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,522
- Hey!
- Hi, guys.

204
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,840
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

205
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,134
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good to see ya.

206
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,028
Emma, I haven't seen you...
When was the last...

207
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,889
I saw you at <i>SNL</i> one time, I think,
like, maybe three or four...

208
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,743
- Before the pandemic.
- I met you even before that.

209
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,686
- You guys were all super little.
- Yeah.

210
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,731
And at one point,
you brought out a little tiny saxophone?

211
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,814
- I did?
- Yeah.

212
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,859
And you started doing a bit, like...

213
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,902
<i>♪ Playing in a family band ♪</i>

214
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,028
- Really?
- And then...

215
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,532
- I didn't know you could play.
- Then I played a little instrument.

216
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,745
And you two just stared at us like,
"This is not funny, nor is it good."

217
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,308
- Now here's the dilemma.
- Okay, uh-oh.

218
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,834
- There's a Greek omelet.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,502
And there's an Athenian omelet.

220
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,004
The...

221
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,256
- Hello. Take your order?
- Hello.

222
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,817
- Yes.
- What shall I get you?

223
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,136
- Okay.
- Do you have sis... some tzatziki?

224
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,054
- Yeah, we do.
- Oh!

225
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,099
- It's a Greek diner.
- For the table. Tzatziki for the table.

226
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,226
- No...
- No, not for the table.

227
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,687
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Thank you.

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,691
Um... uh... What... So...

229
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,235
I wanna be clear.

230
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,155
Harper, you still... Harper's still Dad.

231
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,532
Harper's still Dad, still Pop.

232
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,533
- Pop.
- Pop.

233
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,118
But pronouns, she.

234
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,453
- She.
- Yeah.

235
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,706
Harper's still Dad because she said
she was Dad, you know?

236
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,251
How... how did you give the news?
Did you guys all get together?

237
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,544
- No.
- No, email.

238
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,837
- Just like you.
- Oh.

239
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,256
I was at Popeyes.
I was picking up my biscuit.

240
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,342
- Right.
- And I go, "Holy shit."

241
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,425
- Holy shit.
- "I gotta pull over for this."

242
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,556
I mean, when the divorce happened,
we kind of knew a little bit.

243
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,310
We got that note about... from Harper
about how we might find women's clothes.

244
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,437
She was wearing women's clothes.
I was like, "Okay."

245
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:38,609
And then after that, we got the full,
you know, "I'm using she/her pronouns."

246
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,820
- Yeah.
- So it felt gradual to me.

247
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,238
It didn't feel like a shock.

248
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,073
For the most part,

249
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,408
you guys just took it in stride.
Or was it...

250
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,036
- It was easy to accept immediately.
- Right.

251
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,663
But, um, for me,

252
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,500
I think I had a moment of, like, um...

253
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,461
My dad was
my only sort of masculine representation,

254
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,880
and so I sort of idolized that
in a weird way.

255
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,508
Still my dad, but I think, for me,

256
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,469
the only thing I lost
was that masculine figure,

257
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,346
but you don't really need it.

258
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,641
- Food is here!
- Gorgeous.

259
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,601
- You're gonna love it.
- You called it.

260
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,063
- And tza-tza-tza-tza...
- Yes. Everyone, get your own.

261
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,858
- Yes! Tza... Yeah, tza-tza-tza...
- Tzatziki!

262
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,237
- Aah.
- You guys know what we're doing?

263
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,613
- Yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,616
Are you guys worried about me
on this trip at all?

265
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,495
I think I'm more worried
about your mental health.

266
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,747
I'm more worried
about your physical safety.

267
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,665
- Yeah.
- Like...

268
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,962
But also, the things you love scare me
sometimes. Being in the middle of nowhere.

269
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,046
- Yeah.
- Especially...

270
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm actually learning to be
a little more afraid of that stuff.

271
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,676
After this transition, it's scary.

272
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,262
I'll be honest, I wrestle with, like,
"Why am I doing this?"

273
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,723
And, um, at first, I was like,
"I'm not gonna do it."

274
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,142
And then I just started to think about,

275
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,021
like, well, coming out
was really hard for me,

276
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,107
and, um, it may be... stupid,

277
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,612
but I felt like that might be a good way
for me to come out more, basically.

278
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,695
- Yeah.
- Like...

279
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,198
Does it help to know I take jujitsu?

280
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,094
- Yeah.
- Twice a month.

281
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,829
Could you demonstrate something
or send a video?

282
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,623
'Cause I... I... I don't see it,

283
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,083
but I could... I guess I could see it, but...

284
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,378
I usually don't like to do my practice
on a full stomach.

285
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,462
- Okay.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,923
All right. Well...

287
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,674
Yeah. Uh...

288
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,385
Yeah, we gotta get going, but I really...

289
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,346
I could talk to you guys
on the phone tomorrow.

290
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, yeah.

291
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,475
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.

292
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,643
- I love you too.
- Hey.

293
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,103
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

294
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,612
- By the way, for the record...
- Yeah, for the record.

295
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,989
I'm very excited
to be on this trip with you.

296
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,950

let's both hug him, like, way too long.

304
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,803
You can do that.

305
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,430

we went downstairs to lunch.

where we were
kind of on the same wavelength

in a lot of different ways...

335
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,856
I do remember
I was trying to get to know everyone.

336
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,692
And there was a group of people
looking at me or like,

337
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,820
"We don't get what this guy does.
He doesn't seem that funny."

338
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,364
They all thought
Will Ferrell was a dud.

339
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
But, you know, I just...

340
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,702
I knew that Will was not the dud.

341
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,663
You were just an ambassador for me

342
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,042
to be like, "No, don't write him off.
He's actually really funny."

343
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,628
Last read-through.

344
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
Lots of food, lots of scripts.

345
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,443
We've been around each other

346
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,926
in a lot of circumstances
that are very strange.

347
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,386
My whole writing career,
my whole creative life,

348
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,016
I performed as a character named Andrew.
That's the way I think about it, at least.

349
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,605
And so coming out to my friends
was especially hard.

350
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,652
And I really can't tell
if they think I'm Harper.

351
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,947
I think they might think
that I'm still Andrew,

352
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,323
and now I wear dresses.

353
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
- Tina! Oh my goodness. Thank you.
- Yay!

354
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,055
- Nice to see you!
- Oh my God.

355
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,705
- Hey.
- Hey!

356
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,380
Uh, thank you,
everyone, for coming.

357
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,674
This is very heartening for me. I...

358
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,052
When I came out,
all of you responded. Everyone...

359
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,263
Tim was a little negative. But...

360
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,265
I thought she was joking at first.

361
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,060
- I fucking... I love him.
- "She's joking. This is not fucking real."

362
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,939
I'm gonna send
the most racist, sexist jokes back to her

363
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,190
and see what she says.

364
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,693
- Hey, cheers.
- Yes.

365
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,611
- Here's to Harper!
- Thank you!

366
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,779
Thank... thank you.

367
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,658
So you... you're driving.
You're driving for how long, where?

368
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,077
Okay, we're gonna drive down to D.C.,

369
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,872
and then
we're gonna cut down to Indianapolis.

370
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,708
- We're gonna go see a Pacers game.
- Wow.

371
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,210
Then we're gonna go to Iowa City,

372
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,795
where I was raised.

373
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,130
Do you have family there?

374
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,525
My sister.
We're gonna walk through the old house.

375
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,717
And then...

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Oklahoma, maybe?

377
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,137
We're going to
the stock car race in Oklahoma.

378
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,599
What are you most
looking forward to on this trip?

379
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,766
Here's the thing.

380
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,019
- Will proposed the idea...
- Yeah.

381
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,314
...knowing that my transition might change

382
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,816
the way I navigate the country,
which is true.

383
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,902
- That is true.
- Absolutely true.

384
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,987
- I fear it. I do fear it.
- Sure.

385
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,365
Um, Will knows that I like shitty bars,
I like truck stops.

386
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
- I like the lowest, worst places.
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,203
Yes!

388
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,831
I walked down an alley
a couple... a couple weeks ago,

389
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,417
and I was like, "Nope, I don't like this."

390
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,520
- Don't do that..
- Not safe for you anymore.

391
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,422
- Yeah.
- When is it safe to walk down an alley?

392
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:21,220
No one's ever asked a you
for the list of your places.

393
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,597
If anyone goes somewhere
where you've been,

394
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,390
no one said, "Ooh, I'd love your list."

395
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,311
"What corners have
the best dumpsters of found furniture?"

396
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,230
And I have that list.

397
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,773
Will will be in the car.

398
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,484
I'm a narcoleptic,
and I'm not a good driver.

399
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,405
<i>♪ Say look-a-here, mister ♪</i>

400
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>♪ I need a place to stay tonight... ♪</i>

401
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>♪ A hotel room is fine... ♪</i>

402
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,133
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

403
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,380
All right, fine.
Well, there's no turning back now, so...

404
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,924
Oh, okay. Oh jeez.

405
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,009
<i>♪ I'm only passing through, mister ♪</i>

406
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,470

409
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,399
- Okay, so here's a question.
- Okay. Oh, okay.

410
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,277
I'm curious
how you settled on your name.

411
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,320
Yeah. So my dead name's Andrew.

412
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,905
- I was Andrew, you know.
- Yeah.

413
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,989
Um...

414
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,996
And... So my first impulse
was to make it easy on everyone else.

415
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,207
You know? Like, this...

416
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,295
I'm... I'm... I'm like, "Hey, I'm... Hey,
there's nothing weird going on over here."

417
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,338
- "So I'm just changing..."
- "Nothing to see."

418
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,091
"Nothing to see.
I'm just gonna change Andrew to Angie."

419
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,884
- "You guys, that's pretty easy."
- Yeah.

420
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,014
And then I was driving down
to my first electrolysis thing,

421
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,266
and I was saying the name in my head,

422
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,768
and it just sounded like
wet cardboard to me.

423
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,813
- Yeah.
- It sounded like, "Ugh. This is wrong."

424
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:59,192
So I started trying to,
like, imagine other names.

425
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,863
Like, I mean, I was thinking Chandelier.

426
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,034
And then I go,
"Harper. You love the name Harper."

427
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:11,955
My mother went to school with Harper Lee,

428
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,334
the person, the woman
who wrote <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

429
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,920
- Right.
- When I said it, my whole body felt warm.

430
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,505
- Wow.
- And I was like...

431
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,301
- You literally had a visceral reaction.
- I did. I said it out loud.

432
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,595
I was saying them out loud.
I said, "Harper."

433
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,557
And I was like, "Ooh, wow. That...
That's it. That's what it's gonna be."

434
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,808
- Gosh.
- And that was it.

435
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,062
Yeah, if you had to change your name,
what would you do?

436
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,814
I hated my name growing up.

437
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,775
My real name is John William.

438
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,112
- But my folks called me Will.
- Yeah.

439
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,697
And I remember in first grade,

440
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:50,410
there were six or seven kids
who either had the name Mike or Steve.

441
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,328
Oh, okay.

442
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,913
And I just was like, "Please."

443
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,499
- "Why can't I be a Mike or a Steve?"
- "Or a Steve."

444
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,002
- Those names were cool and tough.
- "Why do I have this weird name?"

445
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,213
- And hard. Yeah. I would...
- Like Steve.

446
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,297
"What's up, Steve?"

447
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,423
- Yeah.
- And Mike.

448
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm gonna take this time
to thank you

449
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,807
for letting us visit the nation's capital.

450
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,017
One of my favorite cities.

451
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,021
- I'm not a big D.C. person.
- Oh, you don't love American history?

452
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,565
Oh shit. Come on.

453
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,111
- I just think D.C. is a little boring.
- We're gonna change that.

454
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,656
I wanna show you
something that's very special.

455
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,739
Okay.

456
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,035
- It's right here.
- Uh-huh. Parking lot?

457
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,328
The reflecting pool.

458
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,039
- Oh, there's no water in it.
- There's some water.

459
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,166
Right down here.

460
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,086
Magnificent, right?

461
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,631
Ooh, I'm nervous.

462
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,882
Yeah, me too.

463
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,261
The next 15 minutes, we could be
talking with President Joe Biden.

464
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,889
- How do you think we're getting in there?
- 'Cause of this.

465
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,433
- The moneymaker.
- Yeah.

466
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,811
Is the president in there?
We just wanna say hi to the president.

467
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,354
Hey! Joe!

468
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,231
No, no, he's not there.

469
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,381
You know, for years,
I crossed this country in a dress,

470
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,906
but I never let anyone see me.

471
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,909
So if I had to get out and get gas,

472
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,329
there's this furtive,
and embarrassing, and hurried attempt

473
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,165
to throw on
a pair of overalls or something.

474
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,500
- And look like a guy and...
- Yeah.

475
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,462
I used to bring
an emergency set of clothes with me.

476
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,798
The fear of having a cop pull me over
for a speeding ticket...

477
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,110
...and be dressed as a woman was...

478
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,469
- It was horrible.
- Right.

479
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,761
Now...

480
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,972
...going out into the world just as me,

481
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:38,268
without any chance
of going stealth as Andrew again,

482
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:43,315
I will see the country that I love
as myself, which I've never done.

483
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,785
If you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second
here to look through some old journals.

484
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,912
Okay.

485
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,707
Whoa, look at your journals.

486
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,752
When did you start journaling?

487
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,964
It wasn't till I felt
my life was kind of falling apart.

488
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,177
And this one, uh,
it's called "Journal Number One."

489
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,555
It's called
"Unmentionables and Other Private Stuff."

490
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
Why did you type it
instead of longhand?

491
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,063
I did it
because I wanted to just put it down.

492
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,357
- Bad writing and all. Mistakes.
- Yeah.

493
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,484
- Run-ons.
- All kinds of mistakes, yeah.

494
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:32,447
- Stream of consciousness, yeah.
- This one's about my therapist.

495
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,201
"My therapist today
batted down my silly notion

496
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,411
that I might be a girl instead of a boy."

497
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,330
- Wow.
- "She's not buying it."

498
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,832
"At one point,
she said I was living in fantasy."

499
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,750
Wow.

500
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,670
"The weird feelings
of sickness and dread I described to her

501
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,090
while I'm dressed in my male clothes
didn't make any sense to her."

502
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,969
"She needed me to describe the feelings
to her, which I couldn't."

503
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,263
"She seemed to think
dressing up like a woman

504
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,182
has a lot of defiance and anger in it."

505
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,725
"She's got a theory."

506
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,478
"I, on the other hand,
am losing faith in theories."

507
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,191
- Let's see. That's seven years ago.
- Wow.

508
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,201
- I'll get snacks. You get chairs.
- All righty.

509
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,051
You got us a lot of stuff.

510
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,929
Well, we're on the road, buddy.
Pringles. You like Pringles?

511
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,099
- I do. I love Pringles.
- I didn't know which Pringles you liked.

512
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,310
You ready for this one? Fuego.

513
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,436
Okay.

514
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,733
- I am not having Fuego Pringles.
- Yeah, you are. Yeah. Yeah, you are.

515
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,568
Oh, Scorchin' BBQ.

516
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,156
- Oh, part of the Scorchin' line.
- That's... Oh yeah. The whole Sco...

517
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,450
We've gotta ration these.

518
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,619
'Cause we may never
run into another Walmart.

519
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,912
'Cause in case
we have a... a flat tire,

520
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
we gotta ration.

521
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,332
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,462
Uh, I was gonna ask you
'cause I was thinking about it. Um...

523
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:16,718
Were you a little worried about
how to talk to me when I came out to you?

524
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,017
Sometimes, I think
that... people who aren't trans,

525
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,479
I think they're sometimes afraid
to say the wrong thing around me.

526
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,481
- That's what I'm getting at.
- Yeah.

527
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,775
And I didn't know when I first saw you,

528
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,320
and I was just curious
if there was anything there that...

529
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,447
I probably was...

530
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
um...

531
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,580
- Yeah, probably a little nervous.
- Okay.

532
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,707
- In the sense...
- I mean, I was nervous.

533
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,293
- I'm in a dress.
- Yes.

534
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,961
It's like... That was terrifying.

535
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:57,842
Yeah, I... I... I guess I was...
I was worried about what... If there...

536
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,678
What the new ground rules were.

537
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,389
- Okay, yeah.
- If there were any.

538
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,059
- Yeah.
- Uh, if it was... um...

539
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
You know.

540
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:15,527
Yeah, just how much
had quote/unquote changed,

541
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,821
or was the same or what, you know.

542
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,841
Yeah, that's a difficult one,
the changing and the sameness and...

543
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,065
There are no ground rules with friends,
I'm telling you.

544
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,369
That's what I need you to know.

545
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,787
- But that's what...
- Yeah.

546
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,499
- You immediately put me at ease.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:33,503
Yeah, I don't... Well, 'cause I...
'cause I know there's no ill intention.

548
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,006
So whatever you say,
I could not possibly be angry.

549
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,175
- Yeah.
- Um...

550
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,054
What else did I get here, buddy?
I got more Pringles.

551
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,639
Philly Cheesesteak.

552
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,144
- Man! You're the man!
- What about the woman?

553
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,478
What about the woman?

554
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,815
- You're still the woman.
- Yes! Still the woman! Yeah!

555
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,358
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

556
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,448
Oh, there she goes. Gah!

557
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,951
- She's back in business.
- Back in business, oh yeah.

558
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,413
Is there some reason

559
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,999
why we're not stopping
at greasy diners every morning?

560
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,586
- I don't know.
- It's my favorite kind of restaurant.

561
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,423
The mecca. We are in the mecca.

562
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,841
Hey there.

563
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,095
- Hi, how are you? Thank you.
- Sit wherever you like.

564
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,222
Kimberly, you like it all?

565
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,142
- Our best one is, we got the All-Star.
- Yeah.

566
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,163
- Done deal. That's what I'm getting.
- Two eggs, wheat, white, raisin toast.

567
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,607
Bacon, ham, or sausage.
You get a waffle or a biscuit and gravy.

568
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,941
- Two of those.
- Absolutely.

569
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,705
- Wait.
- No, no, no, no, I'm just kidding.

570
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,862
And how about you, sir?

571
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,739
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

572
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,074
- Ma'am. I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

573
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,953
Ah, but that's quite all right.
I'm gonna get the, um, All-Star Special.

574
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,748
All right. Thank you very much.
And I'll take your menus.

575
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,957
- You're welcome.
- Great.

576
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,041
Yeah.

577
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,252
I have an order.

578
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,298
I don't like being misgendered that much,
but what can I do, pal?

579
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,260
- It's, uh...
- You know what?

580
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,595
It's gonna ha... I mean...

581
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,056
It is gonna happen.
You know what you should do?

582
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,392
You should go, "What do you want,
little lady who's a woman?"

583
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,604
- Huh. "And for the little lady."
- "Now for the little lady..."

584
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,356
- You don't have to.
- The little lady.

585
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,983
- Who has wheat?
- Uh, I got the white.

586
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,985
- I got the wheat.
- Wheat? There you go.

587
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,240
You excited for the game tonight,
by the way?

588
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,992
I'm excited. But I'll be honest.

589
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,788
Walking through all those bros
in a bro-ey environment

590
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,374
has been my hardest part of my...

591
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,168
- Right.
- My, um, transition.

592
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,546
I was that person.
I went to basketball games.

593
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,464
- I know... I know the culture.
- Right.

594
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,216
And I'm gonna go back in that culture,

595
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,845
and there's a lot of that still in me
that does not like what's happening.

596
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,265
- Yeah.
- And I'm not totally comfortable with it.

597
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,560
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

598
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,604
When I walk
into that basketball stadium...

599
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,982
- You look fantastic.
- Oh, thank you.

600
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,192
- I love the jacket.
- I worked on it.

601
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,737
...I am a woman,
and that's how I need to be seen.

602
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,533
But I'm not sure...
It's just they may not see me that way.

603
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,451
This is an odd thing to say.

604
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,620
- I may not see myself that way.
- Mm-hmm.

605
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,289
But you sort of running point

606
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,417
makes this a fuck of a lot easier
than if I was just alone,

607
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,086
and I gotta keep that in mind
throughout this trip.

608
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,464
'Cause, obviously,
I'm getting a little free pass here,

609
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,884
but I'm not saying
it's not gonna be difficult.

610
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:38,146
I gotta tell you,
we've been to a lot of Laker games.

611
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,063
Yeah.

612
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,984
I've never seen Jack Nicholson,
I've never seen Leonardo DiCaprio,

613
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,904
I've never seen Vince Vaughn
at a basketball game

614
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,739
sitting next to their trans friend.

615
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,783
- Right.
- I've just never seen it myself.

616
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,664
Yo!

617
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,253
It's so complicated
because I used sports all the time

618
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,634
to let people know that I was not a woman.

619
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:13,598
I mean, not that women can't like sports,
but I was trying to... you know...

620
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,143
- Yeah, try... You were always... Yeah.
- I was trying to be that guy.

621
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,145
By doing that all the time,

622
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,564
I did learn a lot about sports,

623
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,025
and I do kind of like it.

624
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,696
Oh!

625
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,198
- Yeah!
- Yes!

626
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,283
Wow.

627
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,244
<i>All right, Pacer fans,
I need you to cheer.</i>

628
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,121
<i>I got a special guest.</i>

629
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,124
Let me hear you, Pacer fans!

630
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,670
What do we think of the Sixers?

631
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,173
What do we think of the Pacers?

632
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,510
Sixers!

633
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:54,138
Pacers!

634
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,600
I wanna thank you, Indianapolis.
I'm here with my friend Harper Steele.

635
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,745
- She just transitioned.
- Wait, we're off. We're off.

636
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,830
We're off.

637
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,232
Indy, you've showed us nothing but love.

638
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,484
- We're off.
- Thank you!

639
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,777
Woo-hoo!

640
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,322
<i>Great to see Will Ferrell here.</i>

641
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,199
<i>Uh, there's the governor.</i>

642
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,043
<i>Just over there,
kinda trying to get him off the court</i>

643
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,662
<i>so we can start the game.</i>

644
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,208
So you're working your way across
the country? How do you end up here?

645
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,877
Harper and I
have known each other for 30 years,

646
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,131
and we're, uh,
we're going across the country.

647
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,176
- To basketball field houses or anything?
- No, this was just...

648
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,805
This is our first
professional sporting event

649
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,432
since Harper's transition.

650
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,227
So the Pacers were nice enough
to allow us access.

651
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,272
<i>Pacers have the ball
to start the quarter up one.</i>

652
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,902
Oh man, it's started.

653
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,822
Wait, was that the governor of this state?

654
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,905
Mm-hmm.

655
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,286
What's his name?

656
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,664
Eric Holcomb.

657
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,876
- Holcomb?
- Yep.

658
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,085
Where do you see that?

659
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,423
<i>We start
with breaking news out of Indianapolis</i>

660
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,342
<i>as Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb
signs a bill</i>

661
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,387
<i>banning all gender-affirming care
for minors...</i>

662
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,807
<i>A number of bills relating
to health care, access to bathrooms...</i>

663
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,811
<i>More than 70 LGBTQ bills
have been filed in the Texas legislature.</i>

664
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,772
<i>...makes Kansas the 20th state...</i>

665
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,524
<i>North Dakota's governor
signed a bill into law...</i>

666
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,694
<i>...provide a legal definition
of sex across the Tennessee code.</i>

667
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,530
<i>...law would
"preserve biological sex as a distinct..."</i>

668
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:39,744
<i>Transgenderism must be
eradicated from public life entirely.</i>

669
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,420
- Here's where I dropped the ball.
- Oh, okay.

670
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:54,383
I obviously didn't anticipate
meeting the governor of Indiana.

671
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,468
Oh, yeah.

672
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,429
- And I... He asked what we were doing.
- Right.

673
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,390
And we told him,
and he seemed... he seemed to...

674
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,142
- Okay with that.
- Be, "Oh, great."

675
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,521
And I... I wish I had
the wherewithal to go, like,

676
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,232
"What's your stance on trans people?"

677
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,191
Or "What's..."

678
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,443
I actually didn't know
he was the governor,

679
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,530
and then, later in the conversation,
someone said something...

680
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,366
And I did. I heard, like,
"I want you to meet the governor."

681
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
- Oh!
- And I'm like, "Oh."

682
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,994
This must happen to you a lot.

683
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,622
The photo you don't wanna be in.

684
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,705
Yeah.

685
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,917
- I don't get that very often.
- Right.

686
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,004
And someone comes in, and there's
someone down there on the floor snapping.

687
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,798
"This person's with Will Ferrell."

688
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,509
But then I'm in this photo
with this governor,

689
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,469
and I don't know his politics.

690
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,346
- Right.
- And, uh, I mean...

691
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,640
- That was the thing. That was...
- No...

692
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,100
That was my negative take...

693
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,561
That was the one place
where I was like, "I should've..."

694
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,564
Just to see what he happened to say.

695
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,314
Yeah.

696
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,943
So walking into that arena...

697
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,026
Yeah.

698
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,155
- 20,000 people, right?
- Yeah.

699
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,573
How did that feel?

700
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,369
I know that all of this
is going to make it easier for me

701
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,538
to walk into these kind of places later.

702
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,456
I did it. It's done.

703
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,335
I'm sort of looking for some of that
a little bit more on this trip.

704
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:16,215
Like, I'm gonna have to peel off
a few times and just...

705
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,551
- Sure.
- So I can feel what it feels like.

706
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,635
By yourself, right?

707
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,345
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

708
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,395
It's fascinating to me.

709
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,565
There's so many trans people out here
all around the country,

710
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,817
living their lives in these places.

711
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,901
Yeah.

712
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,737
To me,

713
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,699
connecting with more people like that
would be something I would like to do.

714
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,493
Oh, we're heading to Peoria.

715
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,705
There's, uh, a woman there
we're gonna meet named Dana Garber,

716
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,208
who, um, transitioned later in life,

717
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:56,464
and she has been deeply involved
in the trans community in Peoria,

718
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,882
which is fascinating to me

719
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,508
because I did not know...

720
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,426
Of course.

721
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,969
...any trans people growing up.

722
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,053
Yeah.

723
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,145
Thanks for having us
in your city, in Peoria.

724
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,313
Yeah.

725
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,940
Are you from here originally?

726
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,317
- Yeah, this is Pekin right here.
- Okay.

727
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,110
And I've been here my whole life.

728
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,194
- Oh wow.
- Yep.

729
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,031
Did you transition like me?

730
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,407
Ki... I'm 61. So...

731
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,368
- And I'm 65.
- Okay.

732
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:29,205
I started... I came out to my family
when I was 55.

733
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,873
Okay. Wow. Okay, so it's...

734
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,917
- So very similar to Harper.
- Yeah.

735
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,463
I know from my own experience,
but I'm gonna guess that was really tough.

736
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,757
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,928
Yes. So I knew a long time ago
that, you know,

738
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,847
that I should have been a girl.

739
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,849
On my first day of kindergarten,

740
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,103
I walked in and I sat down with the girls.

741
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,273
So the teacher's talking about
class rules, you know.

742
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,608
- Yeah.
- So she took us to potty.

743
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,068
And I got in the girls' line.

744
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,570
She grabbed me by the hand
and said, "No, baby."

745
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,156
"You gotta go in the boys' line.
You're a boy."

746
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,285
And everybody started making fun of me.

747
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,287
So I got, like, a panic attack,

748
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,248
and I went in the bathroom,
threw up and everything.

749
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,084
And the teacher came in there,
like, "Are you sick?"

750
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,545
And she called my mom,
and my mom came and got me.

751
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,340
And I... I told her what had happened.
And she said, "Honey, you're a boy."

752
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,136
"You can't go in there with the girls.
You got different body parts and stuff."

753
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,346
- And I didn't know that, you know?
- Right.

754
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,098
It wasn't about body parts.

755
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,059
You know,
it was about who I am in here, so...

756
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,021
You know, it's like,
what was wrong with me, you know?

757
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:39,191
I used to pray to Jesus
every night when I was in grade school,

758
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,820
you know, fix me or kill me,
one or the other, you know?

759
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,322
- It was horrible.
- Yeah.

760
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,241
It was like,
"Why am I like this?" You know?

761
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:54,749
Got in a really bad place mentally,
and I got pretty suicidal for a while.

762
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,001
- Yeah.
- And I thought the only way...

763
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,879
I thought,
"I don't really wanna die," you know,

764
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,424
"but I don't
wanna go on like this either."

765
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,843
So that's when I started counseling,

766
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,138
and my counselor was really awesome.

767
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:13,476
She's more like, "If you wanna do this,
then try it," you know?

768
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:18,689
Because I wasn't living
my auth... authenticity, you know? So...

769
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,607
Yeah.

770
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,986
Um... Now, my experience was that I had a...
kind of not a good therapist.

771
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,030
- You know how that works sometimes.
- Yeah.

772
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,157
And, uh, much later,

773
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,993
I got a... a better... A gender therapist,

774
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
and we kept talking.

775
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,289
And it was still a year,
but once I got to...

776
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,792
my est... my first estrogen pill...

777
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,001
This is silly to me.

778
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,604
I'm sure any person...

779
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,838
But that first estrogen pill
is like, "Ta-da!"

780
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,216
"Magic! Ah, this is
the most amazing feeling."

781
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,426
- You're not feeling anything for months.
- Wow.

782
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,429
But I just like...
mentally, I was just like... like,

783
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,265
"Why did I wait so long?
I love this." You know?

784
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,767
- Me too.
- Yeah.

785
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:02,441
Have you faced hate
in this community at times, or...

786
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,527
I think I've had a few incidents.

787
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,321
My voice gets me misgendered a lot,
and I just...

788
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,966
- I hate... I hate the voice.
- You hate your voice.

789
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,910
- I really do like passing.
- Yeah.

790
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:17,081
And I would love to pass.
I just... The voice was killing me.

791
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:22,169
I don't really want
this low, male voice, you know?

792
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,713
I... I did that, too, for a while, you know.

793
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,508
- I went to this vocal therapy course.
- Yeah.

794
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,927
Sat down one night,
and I'm really thinking,

795
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,639
was I doing this for me
or for society, you know?

796
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,974
Wow, right, right.

797
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,144
And I... No, I'm doing it
for everybody else but me.

798
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,770
This is my voice, you know?

799
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:45,109
A lot of transitioning
is learning to accept yourself, I think.

800
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,408
Hey, I just wanna point out

801
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:56,120
that this is... basically
the first time I've ever done this.

802
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,873
- I can't sing.
- That doesn't matter!

803
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,961
- I don't think it matters.
- Okay.

804
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,380
- How about Sonny and Cher? How about...
- Whoo!

805
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,133
You... you wanna take this?

806
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,218
- I got this.
- You got the first line.

- On the mic, you were good.

822
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,885
Oh, no, I can take hold of a mic.

823
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,722
- But I've never seen you that way before.
- It was amazing for me.

824
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,267
Do you think we need... This could be fun.

825
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,351
Yeah, okay.

826
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,856
...like, a theme song for this road trip?

827
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
Oh!

828
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,027
- We could call someone.
- Who are you thinking?

829
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,404
Fred Armisen comes to mind, right?

830
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,488
- Fred.
- Fred.

831
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,581
Let me think who else that we know

848
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,089
And we thought you're one of our friends,

00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,925
who's so talented in so many ways,

850
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,596
that you would be able
to come up with a theme song.

<i>- Fun friends on the road?</i>

854
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,980
- Friends on the road, for sure.
- Friends on the road.

Harper and Will and stuff like that.

856
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,775
I want it to be kind of jazzy.

857
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,235
- I want it to be jazzy.
<i>- Oh.</i>

858
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,112
- With an up tempo.
- Yeah.

859
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,323
- But not too up.
- No. And it also needs a little...

860
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,033
<i>- Let me write this down.</i>
- Yeah.

861
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,286
But then it's gotta stop you
in your tracks and make you think.

862
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,288
- Very sad.
- Maybe bring a tear to your eye.

863
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,291
Yeah, it should bring a tear
to your eye too. Yeah, do that.

864
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,669
And a little twang like some country
'cause we're in the middle of the country.

865
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,255
<i>- So up-tempo jazz.</i>
- Jazzy.

866
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,381
- Jazz.
<i>- Fun.</i>

867
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,925
- Fun, but it's gotta make you cry.
- You gotta cry.

868
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,552
Yeah, you gotta cry.

869
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,763
<i>- Tear to your eye, fun.</i>
- Jazzy.

870
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,907
- Jazzy. Don't forget jazzy.
<i>- With a little country.</i>

871
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,183
With a little country.

872
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,852
- Yeah, please don't forget jazzy.
<i>- Okay.</i>

873
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,021
- Uh, thank you so much.
<i>- Love you.</i>

874
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,606

00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,505
But anytime in the next couple days
or something, I don't know.

877
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,154
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>
- Yeah.

Here's a question.

889
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,854
Do you think
you're a worse driver as a female driver?

890
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,609

Huh? No.

897
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:13,377
- Don't you recognize him? He's in movies.
- That's okay. Roll up the window.

898
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,678
Oh shit. This is my sister.
I better get this one.

899
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,761
Okay.

900
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,931
Uh, hi, Eleanor.

901
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,853
I'm gonna put you on speaker
so Will can ask you some questions.

902
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,355
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Eleanor, I don't wanna impose.

903
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,859
- Are you sure it's okay if I stay?
<i>- Oh my God, of course it's okay.</i>

904
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,571
Do you have... do you have
a humidifier set up in my room?

905
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,074
- I would... Don't listen to your sister.
- No, don't indulge...

906
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,868
- Don't indulge him.
- Oh!

907
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,791
Will's sleeping
on the couch for that.

908
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,997
What products do you have
in your guest bathroom?

909
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Stop!

910
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,626
<i>Tell Will I'll put
my Chanel face cream down there.</i>

911
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,170
- Oh.
- Thank you. Yes.

912
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,091
- I'm feeling it.
- I can tell.

913
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,928
I'm getting closer to Iowa City,
and I am feeling it.

914
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,806
This is the home turf.
You're excited.

915
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,396
Oh my goodness.

916
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,190
Fantastic. I love it.

917
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,740
- Hi.
- Hello.

918
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,826
Huh?

919
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,371
- Good to see you.
- This is my friend Will Ferrell.

920
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,998
- Hi, Will.
- How are you?

921
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,501
Oh, should this be a housewarming gift?

922
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,878
Oh, thank you.

923
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,381
- Do you like Pringles?
- I love Pringles.

924
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,635
All right, just around the corner.

925
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,095
Okay.
Bathroom in there, by the way.

926
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,932
- Thank you. This is great.
- Yeah.

927
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,769
Eleanor, what was your reaction
when you got the news?

928
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,187
I was totally surprised.

929
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,687
Um...

930
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:02,194
And I think my reaction was... sorrow.

931
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,779
Uh-huh.

932
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,864
And the reason I felt sorrow

933
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:11,870
was I thought about how much pain
Harper must have suffered over the years.

934
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,123
And also knowing, like, immediately

935
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,126
how stressful that moment was
of coming out.

936
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:23,465
And so the most important thing to me
was not to be so careful in my response

937
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,967
but to respond quickly.

938
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,884
You did.

939
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,388
So she knew
it's not something I need to think about.

940
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,598
- I'll talk to you more later.
- Yeah.

941
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,978
I think what you said,
which was so... heartening...

942
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,064
...was, "Oh good.
I've always wanted a sister."

943
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,775
- I did say that, yeah.
- That's what you said.

944
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,193
Pow. Just like that.

945
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,739
I was gonna tell a funny story,
though, because I always think of this.

946
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,992
I think it was around eighth grade.

947
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:55,455
Eleanor gave me a pair of her bell-bottoms
that she didn't want anymore,

948
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,292
and they were white, frilly bell-bottoms.

949
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,462
And once I got 'em,
they were my favorite article of clothing.

950
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,339
I wore them all around. I loved them.

951
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,885
And I went to the skate park
with my skate friends.

952
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,886
- Yeah.
- Uh...

953
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,472
And we skated around that night,
and I was feeling good in my white...

954
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,716
- In your white bell-bottoms.
- My bell-bottoms.

955
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,770
And, uh, I come out of that skate park,
and it's like, uh...

956
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,066
"Hey, we gotta come back next week.
They're doing it again next week."

957
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,612
And someone goes,
"Yeah, but don't bring those faggy pants."

958
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,529
Oh.

959
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,408
And, uh, the pants disappeared
right at that moment.

960
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,286
There's no part of you that was like,
"Shut up. These pants are cool."

961
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,290
So many times in my life, some,
probably, effort for Harper to get out

962
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,708
was just squashed.

963
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,460
- Yeah.
- Over and over again.

964
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:45,088
And I just remember that one
kind of clearly. So...

965
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,300
Uh, Eleanor,
you haven't touched your Pringles.

966
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,219
- Sour cream and onion.
- Oh, I totally forgot.

967
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,389
Are you familiar with their Scorched line?

968
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,766
- I'm not.
- Yeah.

969
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,161
- That might be too much for me, yeah.
- I think so.

970
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,853
- Oh, why thank you.
- Mm.

971
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,355
- Oh, a little taste of...
- Oh.

972
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,773
Oh. Don't... Oh!

973
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,856
Mm.

974
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,693
And where did these come from?

975
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,614
We got them at a Walmart.
It was in Indianapolis.

976
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,450
They taste different.
You can tell they're from Indiana.

977
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:17,412
Oh yeah, definitely.

00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,045

00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,629

cute Harper Steele when she was confused.

985
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,766
And this is probably around the age

986
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,977
where I started to feel
just kind of weird.

987
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,894
Yeah.

988
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,523
And, uh...
you just start to think to yourself

989
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,192
that, uh, everyone feels the same way.

990
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,819
So you're just kind of quiet...

991
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,739

It's like, "We all feel that way, right?"

00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,971
I swear to God, I love this photo.

998
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,931
Yeah.

999
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,393

1003
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,370
This is the house that I grew up in.

1004
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,501
I used to skateboard. Did all
my early skateboarding tricks out here.

1005
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,588
- I used to do my pole-vaulting this side.
- Down this, like...

1006
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,591
Yeah, we had this...
I had... My mother built a little...

1007
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,677
Uh, she helped me build
a pole-vaulting mat

1008
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,055
out of a bunch of potato sacks and...

1009
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,848
- So you'd run down that way.
- Yeah. Choo.

1010
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,517
And then...
But in the backyard was where...

1011
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,269
- The puck was. Yeah.
- Okay.

1012
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,273
And I'd smack it, and I'd...
You know, seven feet.

1013
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,516
What was I gonna do all summer,
play with other people?

1014
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,152
No, I pole-vaulted.

1015
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,785
I came home from City High one day,
and I was just kinda bored.

1016
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,496
So I started acting like I was drunk
on the way home.

1017
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,299
And... Oh, I could ride that.

1018
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Hey, can I ride that?

1019
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,877
Do you mind if she borrows your unicycle
just for a second?

1020
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,795
What?

1021
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,047
Could she just ride your unicycle
for a second?

1022
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:32,964
Why?

1023
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,050
- She knows how to ride one.
- Sure.

1024
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,527
- Yeah, thanks.
- Oh, that's awesome.

1025
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,261
I'm in heels,
so it might be a little hard.

1026
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,823
- What's your name?
- My name's Quinn. Yours?

1027
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,325
- That's Will Ferrell.
- Cool.

1028
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,203
I like to have this up here,
so when I fall, it's gonna be good.

1029
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,813
She was bragging
about being able to ride a unicycle.

1030
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,358
Is that your mode of transportation,
pretty much?

1031
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,651
This was my mode of transportation
in junior high.

1032
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,319
- Give me a second.
- Yeah.

1033
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,488
- I'll stand...
- It's been many years, okay?

1034
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,281
- All right.
- Once you're on though...

1035
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,117
- Whoa!
- Once you're on.

1036
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,701
There we go.

1037
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,495

No, no, no.

1040
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,210
It's so... it's so unstable.

1041
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,608

Yeah. Well, have a good day.

- Wow.

1052
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,550
I'd go to junior high
like that every day for two years.

1053
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,412
- Man, that's weird.
- I know.

1054
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,998
Very weird.

00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,381

1076
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,847
Just... I don't know, I just thought...
I... I... I never asked you, like...

1077
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,390
Okay, go.

1078
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,310
- Go.
- How... how are your boobs?

1079
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,187
- As if...
- Now you got boobs.

1080
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,813
I love my boobs.

1081
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:58,276
When you woke up from that s... Was it...

1082
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,779
I like to think it was like...

1083
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,951
Was it just like the heavens
were sing... in a way?

1084
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,329
I joke that I did puberty
in about four hours.

1085
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,291
But... as soon as I woke up,

1086
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,751
I was like,

1087
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,504
"This is amazing."

1088
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,381
Yeah.

1089
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:23,718
Every time I've done something that's
made me feel better in my own body...

1090
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,095
- Yeah.
- For myself...

1091
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,973
- It's amazing.
- There's... It... it... it... it's been...

1092
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,559
- Exhilarating. Yeah.
- Yeah. Guns a-blazing.

1093
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,020
- Yup. That's great.
- So...

1094
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,357
- So that was my experience with the boobs.
- Okay. What... Okay.

1095
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,858
So this... this is a big one,

1096
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,820
but... but maybe, you know,
maybe we save this for later.

1097
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,363
You are a friend of mine.

1098
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,324
I invite any friend of mine
to ask me these questions.

1099
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,326
I am not afraid to talk about it.

1100
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:53,290
Do you foresee wanting to have
other physical augmentation?

1101
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,627
- Possibly.
- In the future.

1102
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,880
When I first started
thinking about transitioning,

1103
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,674
in terms of bottom surgery,

1104
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,801
I was like, "Well, I'm 61."

1105
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,721
"I'm not gonna be a..."

1106
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:12,350
"I'm not out there
with a super active sexual life, really."

1107
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,310
Yeah.

1108
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,104
- But there's also the dysphoric side.
- Yeah.

1109
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:21,484
Looking in a mirror and seeing something
that doesn't fit with how I feel.

1110
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,485
- So...
- Yeah.

1111
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,903
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

1112
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,907
- That's a tough one to answer.
- Right.

1113
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,492
But, uh... Was there
any more boob questions you needed?

1114
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,287
- No, but I did wanna ask, however...
- Okay.

1115
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,164
Have you been to the...

1116
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,876
have you been in Nordstrom's Rack
since you've gotten your own rack?

1117
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,253
- Very good. Very... Very good.
- Ha-ha!

00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,718
Thank you. I knew as soon as I said it,
I got Best Joke of the Year.

1120
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,262
I hate analyzing comedy
because it kinda ruins it.

1121
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,365
- In this case, it won't.
- You gotta break it down.

1122
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,141
- You do...
- You gotta.

1123
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,895
- "Harper, What exactly did he do there?"
- But let me explain how he got there.

1124
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,605
Will started with,

1125
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,316
"When you got your new rack."

1126
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,360
The connection is, "Did you go..."

1127
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,861
"...to Nordstrom?"

1128
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,529
Ah!

1129
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,813
- God. Wow.
- And the two racks, different racks.

1130
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,159
One of them's different,
but they're the same rack.

1131
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,535
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1132
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,796
- Thank you.
- Seen any famous people today?

1133
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,939
- No.
- Okay.

1134
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,733
Just you.

1135
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,967
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah!

1136
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,472
- Fireworks...
- Fireworks world!

1137
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,808
- This is gigantic.
- Oh my God.

1138
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:41,815
- Holy Nishiki!
- I want something dangerous.

1139
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,233
Ooh, Gator Gun.

1140
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,944
Yeah, that's it.
Honey Badger. It's the Honey Badger.

1141
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,945
- Set it down.
- Yep.

1142
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,155
Pull the fuse,
or pull the sticker off the fuse.

1143
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,599
- You're gonna light that, then run away.
- Light, and book.

1144
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,287
How many clean undies do you have left?

1145
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,832
I'm getting down to the...

1146
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,333
- Nitty-gritty?
- Yup, yup.

1147
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,775
So...
we're heading to Meeker, Oklahoma.

1148
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,859
Uh-huh.

1149
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,864
And this is in the category
of places you would have visited

1150
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,407
and not thought twice about.

1151
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,826
And so what are you feeling?
What are you thinking?

1152
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,954
I'm nervous and anxious, like...

1153
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,666
You know I love these kind of places.

1154
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:46,463
You know that I spent my life
driving back and forth across the country,

1155
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,256
going to little towns like this,

1156
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,967
stopping in bars,
drinking, meeting people.

1157
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,761
But I just don't know if I can anymore.

1158
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,352
Okay.

1159
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:07,275
So you... You're gonna call me
if... if it's feeling dicey.

1160
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,443
I'm gonna... You know what?

1161
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,154
- I'm gonna put it on speed dial.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,198
- And you come running in.
- Yep.

1163
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,991
With that mug of yours.

1164
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,328
- I could go in with you right now.
- No.

1165
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,081
I would feel better if that were the case,
but I just wanna try this thing.

1166
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,543
I'm not gonna have an exper...
I won't be able to try this on my own.

1167
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,420
- I might as well try it now.
- Yeah.

1168
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:30,964
Oh...

1169
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,180
- How you doing?
- Doin' well.

1170
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,927
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good.

1171
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:17,720
What's your name?

1172
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,638
Dominique.

1173
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,891
- Dominique. Harper Steele.
- Harper Steele.

1174
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,184
What's going on?

1175
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,435
Who are you?

1176
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,563
My name's Harper. Who are you?

1177
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,689
I'm Mama T.

1178
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,440
You're Mama T?

1179
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,985
- Oh yeah.
- All right. I heard about you.

1180
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,148
Yeah.

1181
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,989
I haven't heard about her.
Sorry about that.

1182
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,199
- We's just messin' with you.
- Okay.

1183
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,243
Y'all from Oklahoma?

1184
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,079
No, no, no it's all right. I've been...

1185
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:47,292
That's why I came in here.
I've been in a lot of bars in my life, so...

1186
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,878
Trying to feel like if I can go back
to bars since I transitioned.

1187
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,356
- That's the problem.
- Yeah.

1188
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,135
Whoa.

1189
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:03,725
- Oklahoma, thank you. Oh, thank you.
- Harper, where you from?

1190
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,769
- I'm from, uh, Iowa.
- Iowa!

1191
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,064
Yeah, Iowa, but I live in New York now.

1192
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,234
- You're on the East Coast.
- I'm on the East Coast. Yeah.

1193
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,445
How's that going for you guys?

1194
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,405
Or gals.

1195
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,865
I... I... Thank you.

1196
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:23,578
I like... I like, uh, Iowa more,
but I can't make any money there.

1197
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,288
- So...
- Oh really?

1198
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,123
Yeah, I write for TV.

1199
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,794
I'm gonna text my friend.
He's parking the car out there.

1200
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,297
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

1201
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,380
Hey.

1202
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,008
<i>- Come on in.</i>
- Okay.

1203
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:41,137
Hey. Hi.

1204
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,616
I want you to meet these guys.
These are my friends.

1205
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,434
- Is this Will Ferrell?
- Yes, it is.

1206
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,353
- For real?
- Yeah!

1207
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,938
- This is my friend Harper.
- How you doin'?

1208
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,582
- Nice to meet you, bro.
- Hey.

1209
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,524
- Not a bro though.
- She.

1210
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,648
- It's a she, but that's okay.
- Oh. Sorry.

1211
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:58,071
That's all right.
You can try again.

1212
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,322
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1213
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,991
About a year and a half ago,
I transitioned.

1214
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,454
And now Will wants to kind of go out
in the middle of the country with me.

1215
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,290
- Oh my goodness. That's great.
- That's cool. Hey, it's...

1216
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,043
I like your support for your friend.

1217
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,755
No, that's amazing.
There's not a lot of that nowadays.

1218
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,924
- You know?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1219
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,676
I got a lot of... friends...

1220
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,221
Do you have a lot of trans friends?

1221
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,491
- Not trans, but they are bi.
- I do.

1222
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,393
- Yeah? You do?
- Oh yeah. Sure.

1223
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,977
Sure.

1224
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,814
Wait, Harper,
these are Native American...

1225
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,067
- They want to sing us a... Yeah.
- Native America, here we go.

1226
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,320
So here we go. Here's a little bit
of Oklahoma and Native America.

1227
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,437
Yeah!

1228
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,396
Whoo!

1229
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,189
- Wow.
- Nice to meet you.

1230
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,233
- Wow.
- Welcome to Oklahoma.

1231
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,944
- That's beautiful.
- Welcome to Native America.

1232
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,155
- Yeah, exactly.
- Thank you.

1233
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,114
Thank you.

1234
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,955
Wow.

1235
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,293
- Be safe. So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1236
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:38,588
- That was very...
- I tried to give you a bit of Oklahoma.

1237
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,506
- That was very touching, buddy.
- Thank you.

1238
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,010
- Enjoy your time here. Be safe.
- Thanks for comin'.

1239
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,095
- Hey. Thanks for having us.
- Yup.

1240
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:47,764

- Hi, Travis. This is my friend Harper.
- How you doing?

1249
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,621
- Harper, Travis.
- Nice to meet you.

1250
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,064
I used to come out
to these kind of places before

1251
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,025
when I was... still a guy.

1252
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,695
And then I transitioned,
and I got a little afraid because...

1253
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,698
- You know what I'm saying. So...
- Yeah. No, don't be afraid.

1254
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,783
Yeah, okay.

1255
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,828
- If you enjoy it, come out.
- All right, thank you.

1256
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,329
- You know?
- Yeah.

1257
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,672
- Don't worry about it. You know?
- No, I think that's... that's good to hear.

1258
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,342
That's not how I felt. I keep hearing
on the news all this terrible stuff.

1259
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,426
Are you happy?

1260
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,096
Oh, I'm 100% happier. You bet I am.

1261
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,016
Thank you.

1262
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,685
Thanks, guys. Pleasure.

1263
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:25,403
I'm a little bit in shock.
And that's not on them. That's on me.

1264
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,825
I'm not really afraid of these people.

1265
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:31,993
Yeah, right.

1266
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,829
I'm afraid of hating myself.

1267
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,247
Whoa.

1268
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:42,837
And I'm like, "You are a freak.
What are you doing here?"

1269
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,172
There's just... That is sitting underneath.

1270
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,466
And then...

1271
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,178
Agh!

1272
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:52,889
Yeah.

1273
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,151
Oh boy.

1274
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,282
God...

1275
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,577
Yeah, it's okay. I just...

1276
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,871
- It's okay.
- I don't even... Oh my God.

1277
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,664
Yeah.

1278
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,256
Agh.

1279
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,260
Thanks, buddy. Ooh.

1280
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,198
December 2016.

1281
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,577
"I know some mornings, like this one."

1282
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,580
"I wake up without any connection
to the world,

1283
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,250
positive that to connect with
a woman or a man,

1284
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,544
I would have to lie and hide myself."

1285
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,880
"That is very depressing."

1286
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,760
"I dream of a world where I can lay
my vulnerabilities out there -

1287
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,638
open for everyone
until they are my strengths."

1288
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,556
"I am longing for this."

1289
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,061
That's one of the things
I was gonna ask about

1290
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,647
which we kind of haven't touched upon.

1291
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,901
- I'm assuming you wanna start dating?
- Yeah.

1292
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,070
- Yes.
- Right? And you wanna...

1293
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:37,118
And you wanna go out
and go to the bar and pick up someone

1294
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,829
or be picked up, that kind of encounter.

1295
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,832
- I am a monogamous person.
- Yeah.

1296
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,043
And I... I'm optimistic.

1297
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,253
- Yeah.
- I'm 61.

1298
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:51,257
But I would love to be
in a relationship again.

1299
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,219
And are... In your mind's eye,
are you interested in a trans woman?

1300
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:56,846
- Uh...
- Sure.

1301
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,639
- A man? Or... Yeah.
- Sure.

1302
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,225
- Sure. Yeah, sure.
- Okay, yeah. Gotcha. Okay.

1303
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:05,229
I mean, for me, it sounds corny,
but the type is the one that...

1304
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,398
- It's a blank canvas at this point.
- Yeah.

1305
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:11,402
And the one that I can wake up
in the morning, drink coffee in bed,

1306
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:14,321
and talk about the stupid movie
we watched the night before.

1307
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,407
- That's the main thing. Yeah.
- That's...

1308
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,617
I really have to say,
I know that sounds corny.

1309
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,328
But I am waiting
for that experience to happen.

1310
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,415
And I'm 61,
so the clock's ticking.

Okay. We're gonna go there tonight.

1325
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,952
Oh, you gotta eat it in one hour though.

1326
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,371
- One hour?
- I think that's what it said.

1327
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:05,872
You could do it.

1328
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,792
I mean,
I don't know if <i>I</i> could do it,

1329
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,212
but I know of
a certain Victorian-era detective

1330
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,297
who would find it delicious.

1331
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,256
No, no.

1332
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,300
- Oh yeah.
- Oh boy.

1333
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,521
Yeah!

1334
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,150
Ladies and gentlemen,

1335
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:37,321
the world's greatest private investigator,
Sherlock Holmes.

1336
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,993
Ricky Bobby!

1337
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,914
Not Ricky Bobby, Sherlock Holmes.

1338
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,460
- I packed this hoping...
- Yes.

1339
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,796
- To get you at some point.
- And here it is.

1340
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,967
- Oh boy!
- Hey! Hi, how are you?

1341
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,969
- Blessed, brother.
- Nice to meet you.

1342
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,772
How do you want me
to announce you?

1343
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,964
- Sherlock Holmes from London, England.
- Yep.

1344
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:07,226
- With his guest, Harper Steele.
- Harper Steele.

1345
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,311
- Ms. Harper Steele.
<i>- Miss</i> Harper Steele?

1346
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,063
- Ms.
- Yeah, Ms. Harper Steele.

1347
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,023
Ms. Harper Steele. Done.

1348
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:16,694
We have Sherlock Holmes
all the way from London, England,

1349
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,572
with his guest, uh... Harper Steele,

1350
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,950
Ms. Harper Steele. And he has
one hour to eat a 72-ounce steak.

1351
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,540
Oh, can I get a beer?

1352
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,431
I'm eating out of nervousness.

1353
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,226
As much as I've been in a fishbowl
in various times in my life...

1354
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,227
Yeah.

1355
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,979
...this trumps all of it.

1356
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,863
Last night was...

1357
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,662
The room started to feel
very... wrong to me,

1358
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:54,416
and, I mean, the crowds
that come around you so quickly.

1359
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,168
I was feeling a little like

1360
01:10:57,169 --> 01:11:00,464
my transness was on display, I guess.

1361
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:06,095
And suddenly,
that sort of made me feel... not great.

1362
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,557
You know? Um...

1363
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,060
Oh, the saddest part for me is, uh...

1364
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:19,566
I just feel...

1365
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,238
Oh boy.

1366
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,824
Oh! Okay.

1367
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,201
I feel like I let you down in that moment.

1368
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,078
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You know?

1369
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,161
And...

1370
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,040
I was like, "Oh shit. I got..."

1371
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:38,210
"We gotta worry
about Harper's safety."

1372
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,753
You know? Like, what...

1373
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,882
That's where I just...
I feel like I... Yeah.

1374
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,440
I was gonna read
some of the tweets we've been receiving

1375
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:02,568
since we started this trip.
You wanna hear this one?

1376
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,361
"Ah, very important

1377
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,406
you have another gender bender
for the kids to see."

1378
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,243
"It's so trendy and cool,
even Will Ferrell's doing it."

1379
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,289
"It really sucks that Will Ferrell
shows up to his first Pacers game

1380
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,540
with a trans woman."

1381
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:17,791
"Who's that dude?"

1382
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,377
Oh yeah, yeah. Here's a good one though.

1383
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,629
"Will Ferrell stopped in Iowa City today."

1384
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,382
"He and Ryan Reynolds are making
a road trip documentary

1385
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,176
supporting trans kids and rights."

1386
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,844
Ryan's...

1387
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,556
I didn't realize
Ry... Ryan's a part of everything.

1388
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:34,558
- Oh, here's one just about you.
- Okay.

1389
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,101
- Wanna hear this one?
- Yes, please.

1390
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,730
"Great,
a satanic Illuminati pedophile in Iowa."

1391
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,483
And that's me?

1392
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,568
Yeah. How do you feel about that?

1393
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,866
It just feels ridiculous. I don't...
I have no emotional... I mean...

1394
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,788
That stuff, you can't underestimate
the damage that all that does.

1395
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,792
When you're trans,
you ingest a lot of that shit,

1396
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,377
and it sits in your head.

1397
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,921
- Those tweets are in my head.
- Yeah.

1398
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,854
When... when hatred is pointed
at me and trans people,

1399
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,899
they're like, "You're not a woman."

1400
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,526
"You'll never be a woman."

1401
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,280
Okay, I... you know,
I am a trans woman. I'm fine with that.

1402
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,242
- But I am feeling something, you know?
- Yeah.

1403
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,869
And it's not unhealthy.

1404
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,456
It's made me actually healthier
in many respects.

1405
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,291
- Yeah, yeah.
- It saved my life, I think.

1406
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,210
And I'm not joking about that.

1407
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,715
Did you come really close
at any point to... to...

1408
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,637
I know you had dark thoughts,
but suicidal though... I mean, did you...

1409
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,599
Was it that intense at times?

1410
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,644
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1411
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,729
- Yes, I, uh...
- Yeah.

1412
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:06,525
I'm gonna say...
six years ago, maybe,

1413
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,652
I went to the gun place,

1414
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,488
and......the guy,

1415
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,615
he asked me, uh,

1416
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,828
"Is it for, uh, targets,
or is it for, uh, security?"

1417
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:21,498
And I was like, "Oh," uh,
'cause I know nothing about guns.

1418
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,334
- Me neither.
- Right, and I'm like, "Um..."

1419
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,920
"Uh... well, yeah, maybe both."

1420
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:29,381
"I'm in a kinda isolated house."
I'm trying to lie.

1421
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,217
So I picked it up,
and I was looking at it,

1422
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,802
and I was super scared.

1423
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,096
- Golly.
- I walked out of there.

1424
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,640
I was just like,
"Okay. I'm gonna come back."

1425
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,017
"I'm gonna think about it."

1426
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,644
Up until the moment,
really, I transitioned,

1427
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,855
I didn't wanna have a gun around me.

1428
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:48,233
- Because it could be an impulsive thing.
- Yeah.

1429
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:52,279
Because there was definitely moments
where I thought, "I wish I had that gun."

1430
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,033
But the moment I transitioned,

1431
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,618
all I wanted to do was live.

1432
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:58,619
- Oh.
- Just live.

1433
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,537
Live and... and continue on the path...

1434
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,539
Oh my God. I got this free gift.

1435
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,725
...being really who you are.

1436
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,583
- Yes.
- Wow.

1437
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,994
This is already awesome.

1438
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:49,461
I feel such a strong
Albuquerque connection with Harper

1439
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,839
because I was here working on <i>MacGruber</i>

1440
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,343
when we all first found out
that you were transitioning.

1441
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,931
And it was here
exactly one year ago today.

1442
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,685
I will say

1443
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:08,355
part of me feels like I should have
made that decision 40 years ago,

1444
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,358
but I wouldn't have met you guys.

1445
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:15,529
I would not have gotten hired at...
started a comedy world, probably.

1446
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,906
- I would have had a different life, so...
- Yeah.

1447
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,908
Too many good things happened.

1448
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,582
Ooh! Are you guys feeling
the same thing I'm feeling? A little...

1449
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,626
- Yeah, it's pretty high.
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

1450
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,461
What is it?

1451
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:34,506
- You guys hear those dogs down there?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

1452
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,842
Yeah, do...

1453
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,970
Quiet!

1454
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,847
Shut your dog up!

1455
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,851
Shut your damn dog up!

1456
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:50,355
The neighborhood
is sick and tired of your dog!

1457
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,110
Now more dogs are barking!

1458
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,869
- Oh my goodness.
- Wow.

1459
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,205
- Make a toast.
- It is an honor to be here.

1460
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:11,418
I have so much respect for you
and the journey that you've gone on,

1461
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,463
and I'm... I could not be more proud of you

1462
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,050
and... and love, uh, love you very much.

1463
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,861
- Thank you so much.
- To you. To both of you.

1464
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,512
And here's to, uh,
a good rest of the journey.

1465
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,432
I'm gonna really pop it.

1466
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:26,725

1483
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,160
Hey, Kristen,
it's Harper and Will.

1484
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,080
Just checking in to see
how the song's coming,

1485
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,499
if it's coming along.
And if it's not, that's okay.

1486
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:36,503
And, uh, once again,
to echo what Harper's saying, no pressure.

1487
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,130
- No pressure.
- But I just...

1488
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,632
We would like to know how are you fee...

1489
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,135
Are you happy
with the direction you have so far?

1490
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,303
- Right. Okay. Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you.

1491
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:53,145
Ooh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Dunkin' Donuts.

1492
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,688
- No.
- Why can't we?

1493
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:56,440
- No.
- Oh, just this once?

1494
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:59,568
We never have
to stop again. Just wanted to stop once.

1495
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,946
This trip has been horrible.

1496
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:04,573
We haven't stopped once.

1497
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,575
Wanted Dunkin' Donuts.

1498
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,244
This stupid trip.

1499
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,538
All we've done is talk to trans people.

1500
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,375
We've not done one fun thing.

1501
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,419
Name one fun thing we've done.

1502
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,921
- What are you talking about?
- Name one fun thing.

1503
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,092
Okay. But... Really?
Maybe you're just hungry.

1504
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:26,511
I wanted to go to Dunkin' Donuts.

1505
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,680
That's all I wanted to do.

1506
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,349
I never get to do anything I want.

1507
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,578
Could someone
take a picture of us?

1508
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,205
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1509
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:57,501
- Is... The Grand Canyon was in the picture?
- Of course it was!

1510
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:59,753
- You got some canyon.
- Oh, okay.

1511
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,880
- Where you guys from?
- Syracuse, New York.

1512
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,089
- Oh, so...
- Oh!

1513
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,257
I'm a New Yorker.

1514
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,719
- New Yorker. We're on a road trip as well.
- Yeah.

1515
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,139
- Harper transitioned...
- I transitioned, and we're just sort of...

1516
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,184
We're kinda discussing
what that means for our friendship.

1517
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,938
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Yeah, good. I would love it.

1518
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:22,818
I'm just wondering how early you knew,
how early you wanted to.

1519
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,779
I think growing up in Iowa,

1520
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,908
it was so impossible
to think something like that.

1521
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,702
- Uh-huh.
- So I just think I couldn't...

1522
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,372
I thought I was weird.
I knew something was weird about me.

1523
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,040
I definitely knew that and...

1524
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:41,795
But I also came around to thinking
that... the kind of weird I was was normal.

1525
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:46,383
So about ten years ago, it just started
to explode in me a little more.

1526
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:47,968
- And I just...
- Wow.

1527
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:51,388
I kept fighting it and fighting it
and talking to therapists and...

1528
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,431
- Yeah.
- You know what?

1529
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,934
- I'm a retired therapist.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

1530
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,145
I had a patient very early in my career,

1531
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,524
so now we're talking... 30 years ago,

1532
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,109
and he came in and said,

1533
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,571
"I'm happily married. I love my wife."

1534
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,488
Yeah, yeah.

1535
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,824
"But I dress in her clothes
whenever I can."

1536
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:13,535
- Yeah.
- "And I don't think I'm..."

1537
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,163
"I don't... I don't...
I don't know what I am."

1538
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,875
- Yeah, yeah. How did you work through it?
- Yeah.

1539
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:23,378
- I was very closed-minded about it.
- Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:27,173
Sort of afraid
to go into really unknown territory.

1541
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
- It was unknown to me.
- Yeah.

1542
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:32,596
Can I tell you, I had a therapist
like that that sort of stopped me.

1543
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:33,680
Ah, I...

1544
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,849
And... and... and again, I'm not...

1545
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:39,102
I stopped myself enough
that I don't blame anyone.

1546
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,105
- Yeah, that's...
- I tried to be open and supportive.

1547
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:45,233
But I know
that a lot of my subtle messages were...

1548
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,443
Of course.

1549
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:49,613
- But I've got this my whole life.
- "But you love your wife and..."

1550
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:51,114
Yeah, I know. So...

1551
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,533
- "You love your wife, your life."
- Yeah.

1552
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,660
- "Why would you do this?"
- You know?

1553
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,246
- Surgery is a huge...
- "Can you manage it?"

1554
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:03,126
Yeah. I know that I was a blockade
in that man's... in that person's life.

1555
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,470
- Here's your blue chair.
- Okay.

1556
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:19,935
If you named that beer,
what would the name of the beer be?

1557
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,312
- There's no question.
- Yeah.

1558
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,689
Cornelius Danderhoff.

1559
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,859
- Your beer's called Cornelius Danderhoff?
- Mm-hmm.

1560
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,195
- Keep that name.
- Okay.

1561
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,241
This is Dolores O'Brien.
I'm gonna drink her all up.

1562
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,370
But I wanna show you something.

1563
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:43,124
I have something very special
for my good friend Cornelius Danderhoff.

1564
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,003
- Oh!
- It's a coat.

1565
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:49,756
It's a beverage jacket.

1566
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:52,008
It's a... a beverage...

1567
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,720
Well, I don't think of... I actually don't
think of Dolores as a beverage.

1568
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,598
But I don't know
how you wanna think of it.

1569
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,850
No, Cornelius is gonna love this.

1570
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,435
Oh, just... huh...

1571
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:04,479
Check this out.

1572
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:07,440
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1573
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:10,026
You look adorable, Dolores.

1574
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:14,322
This new jacket of yours
reminds me of my own.

1575
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,657
You look adorable.

1576
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,827
- Oh, Cornelius. That's so sophisticated.
- Cornelius.

1577
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,412
Guess what?

1578
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,163
I have a surprise for you.

1579
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:27,252
- Look how sharp you look, Cornelius.
- Oh, Cornelius. Really.

1580
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,587
Cornelius, you need to lose a few.

1581
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,799
- Well, help Cornelius lose a few pounds.
- I...

1582
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:35,010
- Look how sharp Cornelius looks.
- Look at...

1583
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,595
"Hey, hi. Would you like
to go on a date sometime?"

1584
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,557
- "No." Well, that was a little forward.
- "My word!"

1585
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:07,042
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

1586
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,919
- Swimming in a... public place.
- In a public place.

1587
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,504
You're taking a chance.

1588
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:12,505
Yeah.

1589
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,924
- I wanna make you feel at home.
- Oh.

1590
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,676
So...

1591
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:24,100
Mark Spitz!

1592
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,438
Double cannonball!

1593
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,150
Is it set?

1594
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:37,155
God, that's freakin' sexy.

1595
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:39,616
Relaxing with Mark Spitz.

1596
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:41,951
Okay.

1597
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:47,373
It's good. It's sexy.
I hope that comes out.

1598
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:51,002
So swimming in a... a public pool.

1599
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,340
I mean, I love it. I really do love it.

1600
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,591
- Okay.
- I love it.

1601
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,885
I would've liked my suit
to fit better, honestly,

1602
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:02,138
but I don't think I'm any different
than any woman on the planet

1603
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,848
when it comes to bathing suits.

1604
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:07,852
I'd be a little more comfortable
in a perfectly fitting suit, I think.

1605
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,145
I think you look great.

1606
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:13,441
Thank you. I really...
I... I do believe that you mean that. Right?

1607
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:18,571
The irony that I have done
so many shirtless things

1608
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,740
and things in my underwear or in a Speedo

1609
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,742
is that I'm a fairly modest person.

1610
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,494
No, I know that. I know that.

1611
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:27,831
When it comes to comedy,
though, which you love...

1612
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:30,416
- Whatever it takes.
- You will sacrifice yourself.

1613
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,585
That's why I was excited no one was here.

1614
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:37,841
'Cause I put the Speedo on, I used to be
kind of like comedically out of shape.

1615
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:39,884
Now I'm like, "Oh boy." Not good.

1616
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:42,762
I mean,
I know you're being honest.

1617
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:43,972
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1618
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,474
I know you're a little overweight, uh,

1619
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,476
in places
that you don't wanna be right now.

1620
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,394
Right.

1621
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:52,939
But when you put on that suit in D.C.,
you are a handsome man.

1622
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:54,691
To our great looks.

1623
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:56,067
To our great looks.

1626

1627
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:15,962
- You're not much of a gambler.
- No.

1628
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:19,424
Why don't you take me
to a very fancy dinner?

1629
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:22,427
'Cause they've got
some five-star restaurants now in Vegas.

1630
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,221
Oh, okay, even though
you have yet to pay for anything.

1631
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,890
- Yeah.
- I'm not opposed to that.

1632
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:28,641
- Okay.
- Let's dress up.

pull a Sherlock on you.

1634
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,145
Okay.

1635
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:35,732
Maybe this is an opportunity
to have more of a normal experience.

1636
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,943
It would make me feel good
because I feel like I would be

1637
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,322
in another environment
that I haven't really been in.

1638
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:44,115

- I'm going to dinner with a friend.
- Okay.

1653
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,372
Um...

1654
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,376
But I... I just need a disguise.

1655
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:38,169
I need... I need a realistic-loo...

1656
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:42,632
- I don't want people to know it's me.
- So are you trying to change...

1657
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:43,841
- I'm Will Ferrell.
- Oh.

1658
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,135
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Very nice to meet you. Yeah.

1659
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:47,720
So, yeah, I just...

1660
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,807
Tonight, we wanna go to dinner
without a famous person.

1661
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,058
- I see, okay.
- Yeah.

1662
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,019
Probably stick away
from some of the brighter colors

1663
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,938
so it doesn't draw attention to you.

1664
01:27:57,021 --> 01:28:00,191
- Right.
- So do something more natural.

1665
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:04,696
<i>♪ They call you Lady Luck ♪</i>

1666
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:10,076

<i>♪ And yet... ♪</i>

1668
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:16,207
This looks like... not someone who lives
in Vegas, but someone who visits, right?

1669
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,294
That's interesting.

1670
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,587
- Dress sizes are crazy, don't you think?
- Yes.

1671
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,441
- I'll try that one.
- That is cute.

1672
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,217
- Right? Thank you.
- Yeah, it is.

1673
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,137
<i>♪...the best that I can do... ♪</i>

1674
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,723
I like that.
That one looks better that way.

1680
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,758
William.

1681
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:10,219
<i>♪ Luck let a gentleman see... ♪</i>

1682
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,347
Oh my God.

1683
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,767
What is going on?

1684
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:18,394
Oh my God.

1685
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:22,273
I'm not Will. I'm David Abernathy.

1686
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,234
Oh, David Abernathy.
Do we have a reservation tonight?

1687
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,444
We do.

1688
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,071
Oh my God.

1689
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,954
Oh, thank you, David.

1690
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,415
- You sit here.
- Okay.

1691
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,041
And there.

1692
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:43,710
Thank you.

1693
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:46,923
Oh.

1694
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:48,566
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, sir.

1695
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,718
- Hello.
- Welcome to the SW Steakhouse.

1696
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,696
- Thank you.
- What a pleasure to have you.

1697
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,098
- Thank you.
- Thank you. I'm David. This is Harper.

1698
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,808
Hi, David. Hi, Harper. I'm John.

1699
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,494
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you both.

1700
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,558
- I'm David Abernathy.
- You're Dav... Sorry?

1701
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,398
- David Abernathy.
- David Abernathy. I'm John Bortles.

1702
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,983
I... I managed Bette Midler
for a little while.

1703
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,027
- Oh wow.
- And Air Supply.

1704
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,029
- Glad to have you.
- Wait.

1705
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:13,866
- I believe we'd love... two Montagues.
- A Montague.

1706
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,370
Excellent choice. I'll get that started.
One of our signature drinks.

1707
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,247
Cheers to, uh...

1708
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,791
- Cheers to our little experiment.
- Yeah.

1709
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,627
I don't know if it's working or not.
I can't tell.

1710
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,087
I can't either, but...

1711
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,551
This whole trip, obviously,
you're taking the heat off me.

1712
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:32,677
- Yeah.
- Um...

1713
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:37,557
And that's just not the life
of a real trans person.

1714
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,892
But when I was in the Goodwill today,

1715
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:44,981
I just felt way more comfortable,
and that's a bit of a result of this trip.

1716
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:46,524
- Yeah.
- For sure.

1717
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,317
- Like...
- Another cocktail?

1718
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:52,321
Yeah, I would love a,
uh... just a glass of... of Cab.

1719
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,489
Thanks, John.

1720
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,995
Okay,
it's a complicated subject for me.

1721
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,414
Sometimes, the better my makeup looks,

1722
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,833
the worse I feel about my face.

1723
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:06,252
Well... But you look...

1724
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,296
You look great.

1725
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:14,385
But there's something about...
the slow process of getting

1726
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,971
used to who I am...

1727
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,054
Yeah.

1728
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,143
...that the... "prettier" I get,

1729
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,770
the more I see the flaws.

1730
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:28,649
I know what you mean. It's like, "Okay,
I'm putting 'my best foot forward...'"

1731
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,736
Right.
And I don't feel like I... I can... Yeah.

1732
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,821
It's making me very self-aware of my...

1733
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,031
Right.

1734
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:37,533
...unfortunately, very masculine face.

1735
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,744
So I look in the mirror, and I...

1736
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,955
- It's like this is getting closer.
- Yeah.

1737
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:47,084
But now I'm like,
"Wow, I got a... I got more to do."

1738
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,339
But having spent almost two weeks
with you now, I'm just like...

1739
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,175
I'm just sorta like...

1740
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:56,969
"I'm just with Harper."

1741
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,639
I'm forgetting...

1742
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:02,196
- The dead name?
- The dead name.

1743
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,435
It's just getting fully...

1744
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:09,440
replaced, and I don't... I don't know.

1745
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,524
I mean,

1746
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:12,944
thanks.

1747
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:17,823
Do you feel lucky sitting across the table
from someone who looks like this?

1748
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:22,495
I feel very fortunate
to be sitting across the table

1749
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,664
from Bette Midler's old manager.

1750
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,123
- Old manager.
- Yeah.

1751
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,085
- Do you think John... Oh, here comes John.
- Okay, good.

1752
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,421
You think John knows it's me?

1753
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,302
- Nickel & Nickel Cabernet. Enjoy.
- Thanks, John.

1754
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:39,804
My pleasure.

1755
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:41,638
Mm.

1756
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,476
John is suspicious. So just be honest.

1757
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,979
- John's onto me.
- Yeah, John...

1758
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:10,960
Imagine someone
who goes on a trip with a friend

1759
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,795
and is up for anything and everything.

1760
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:13,754
Stop.

1761
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,799
And there's literally one thing
they wanna do.

1762
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,595
- One fun thing. That's it.
- We've done so many good things.

1763
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,764
One fun thing that they dreamed about,

1764
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,558
that <i>they</i> journaled about.

1765
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:29,186
You never said
you journaled about Dunkin' Donuts.

1766
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,022
I did journal about Dunkin' Donuts.

1767
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:32,231
"Dear journal..."

1768
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,066
If I could go, today's the day.

1769
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,277
"...I have discovered something called..."

1770
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,655
"Something that's changed my life.
It's a place called Dunkin' Donuts."

1771
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,116
"Each donut is my friend."

1772
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:44,994
- No.
- "I finally found my... my place."

1773
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,713
- Whew.
- This feels like a long way to go.

1774
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:01,510
Are you okay? Want me to take the other...

1775
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:04,055
Yeah, could you carry all this?

1776
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:06,432
Oof!

1777
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:23,199
So... there's a few passages in my journal

1778
01:34:23,282 --> 01:34:26,243
that I just felt like
just talk to this very place.

1779
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,748
11/27/15.

1780
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,211
"Here we go into another holiday season
of uncertainty."

1781
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,673
"Suicidal thoughts, regrets,

1782
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:43,636
manic daydreams of a safe life
in small hidden houses away from the world

1783
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:45,971
where I can create and live in peace."

1784
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,060
"I fantasize about owning
an apartment in Mojave, California."

1785
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,438
"I'm fixated on moving to Mojave."

1786
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,400
"I can't get it out of my mind."

1787
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,704
"In December,
I found a house in Trona, California."

1788
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:14,083
"It cost ten thousand dollars,
and I couldn't stop obsessing over it."

1789
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,627
"I offered to buy it,

1790
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,588
and now it looks like I will own it."

1791
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:24,969
"My own space to dress like a woman,
walk around like a woman."

1792
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,304
"Miles from anyone."

1793
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:03,007
How... how long have you had it?

1794
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:09,430
I bought it about six or seven years ago.

1795
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,318
Oh my God.

1796
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,153
Yeah. Um...

1797
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:29,200
And I just was looking for, uh...

1798
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:33,329
some place to go where I could

1799
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,998
get away from people and...

1800
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,502
There's something I liked about this.

1801
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:44,381
That it was just so...
so far away from everything else?

1802
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:47,384
Yeah, it was just hidden
in a downtrodden community, and...

1803
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:48,468
Yeah.

1804
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:50,554
I felt I...

1805
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:54,016
kinda fit in out here.

1806
01:36:54,099 --> 01:36:55,099
Mm-hmm.

1807
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:57,394
Because...

1808
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,110
Yeah.

1809
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:06,945
I just...

1810
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:10,407
I just hated myself so much.

1811
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:22,919
Fuck.

1812
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,047
I just felt like a monster.

1813
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,260
- I fucking hated it.
- It's okay.

1814
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,221
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is okay.

1815
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:33,764
- Everything's okay.
- Yeah.

1816
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:35,975
Yeah, so...

1817
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:38,143
...I... I kind of fancied,

1818
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:41,981
um, a mid-century modern house out here,
and I would go to town on it.

1819
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:47,695
And I'll show you inside, and you'll see
how it got vandalized.

1820
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:27,818
I don't want...

1821
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,029
I just don't want anything to do with it.

1822
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:34,158
I was just gonna say,
what's... what's the plan now?

1823
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,577
- Give it to somebody?
- Uh-huh.

1824
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,289
I know it's, um...

1825
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:43,584
I mean, I was gonna be a woman here.

1826
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:45,836
That was it. I was gonna...
That was my plan.

1827
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,589
I had no... There wasn't any way
to make it work either,

1828
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:51,050
because I would've been afraid
of these people, too,

1829
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:54,803
so I just was gonna close the curtains
and walk around this house,

1830
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,805
and it was a safe space.

1831
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:59,975
- Were you able to ever, like, dress here...?
- Yeah. I mean, this was...

1832
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:03,145
- I worked in there in women's clothes.
- Yeah.

1833
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:05,147
And I brought women's clothes with me,

1834
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:09,068
and I... sat out here at night
in women's clothes.

1835
01:39:09,568 --> 01:39:11,362
I... I... I loved it.

1836
01:39:12,404 --> 01:39:16,367
But it just is not the path.
It's just not the way to do it.

1837
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,661
It's not the... You can't hide. It's not...

1838
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:20,996
It catches up with you,
and it's just stupid.

1839
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,666
And I don't wanna be
afraid of people anymore.

1840
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:26,335
That's just sad and terrible.

1841
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,255
- Yeah, I get to be in the world.
- Yeah.

1842
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:31,924
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, right.

1843
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:33,050
And, also, like...

1844
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:38,931
I don't have to lie to you anymore.
You know what I mean?

1845
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:41,558
- Right.
- You're like, "Oh, you got a crazy house."

1846
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:43,519
Yeah, it's my little thing I'm doing.

1847
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:45,789
There's always a lie under there,
and I don't like that.

1848
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,898
Yeah, I don't like
lying to my friends at all.

1849
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:50,609
- And here you are.
- I know.

1850
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:54,196
One of my really good friends,
and I just was lying to...

1851
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:55,322
And I don't... I don't...

1852
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,766
Again, it's not the worst thing
that I was trying to be safe

1853
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,953
'cause I didn't know how people
were gonna react. I was scared.

1854
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:04,331
But no, I don't...
I don't want to do that anymore. I can...

1855
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:09,294
I can... I have a few secrets
that I'm not gonna let you have.

1856
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:10,671
Okay?

1857
01:40:10,754 --> 01:40:13,799
Like, I... There's some record places
that I'll never tell you about.

1858
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:17,553
- I'll get it outta you.
- No, you won't. That's secret.

1859
01:40:17,636 --> 01:40:18,637
And, uh...

1860
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,767
I stole something
from your house one time.

1861
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:26,061
I already know what it is.

1862
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,896
Oh.

1863
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,149
You are a good friend.

1864
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,905
Uh,
should we go do some fireworks?

01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:22,177
- I'm not seeing what you're seeing.
- What does that say?

1886
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,781
Over there? "Dunkin' Donuts."

1887
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:27,975
I think this trip was stupid if we didn't...
if we don't get to go to Dunkin' Donuts.

1888
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:31,436
- You gotta be kidding. Jesus.
- I think this whole trip was stupid.

1889
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,313
There, I said it.
You wanted me to be honest.

1890
01:42:34,356 --> 01:42:35,356
Okay.

1891
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,901
Okay, here we go.

1892
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:40,654
- Guess what?
- Wait.

1893
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:42,364
- Yes.

1894
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:43,447
Yes.

1896
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:52,374

Your classic donut or Munchkins?

01:42:52,457 --> 01:42:54,668

<i>- I do!</i>

1898
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:57,629
Order something!

1899
01:42:57,713 --> 01:42:58,922
I need more time.

1900
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:00,174
- No!
- No!

1901
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:02,885
Just a... a classic glazed.

1902
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,470
- Well, are you fucking happy? Come on.
- Yeah.

1903
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:09,308

- Oh my God.

1904
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:10,391
Mmm!

1905
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,394

- Yeah.

1906
01:43:12,477 --> 01:43:14,271
They're nice and cold.

1907
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:17,232
- It's great.
- 3,000 miles.

1908
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:18,316
Really great.

1909
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,778
Is... How's the trip now?

1910
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:25,365
It's... honestly, it's, like,
the best trip I've ever had.

1911
01:43:28,952 --> 01:43:30,579
It's been a really good trip.

- Oh my goodness!
- So good to see you.

1918

Good to see you!

1919
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:58,023
Harper and Will, what... what has been
the best part of the trip, would you say?

1920
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,277
Boy, we've had some great...
We've had a lot.

1921
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:06,114
Was there anything you learned about Will
that you didn't know,

1922
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:09,034
or, Will, that you learned about Harper
that you didn't know?

1923
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,745
For me, I had no idea

1924
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:16,458
the kind of... the despair that Harper felt
for so long, you know? It's like...

1925
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:19,503
- Mm-hmm.
- And she hid it really well. She hid it.

1926
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:21,337
Um...

1927
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:25,092
What I really learned about Will...

1928
01:44:25,717 --> 01:44:28,720
Like, we've been friends for 27 years,
you know?

1929
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:30,596
But...

1930
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:35,185
Yeah. I mean...

1931
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:41,900
I mean, he loves me.
You know what I mean?

1932
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,027
He's watched me now break down.

1933
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:48,198
I've watched that, what'd you call,
bag of cement break down too.

1934
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,703
And... I don't know, it just...

1935
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:56,665
He cared so much about this.

1936
01:44:57,874 --> 01:44:59,835
And cared about

1937
01:45:01,169 --> 01:45:03,630
making sure that I wasn't in pain and...

1938
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:06,258
It just... Yeah.

1939
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:08,593
I just... It was very sweet for me.

1940
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,305
Yeah.

1941
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,432
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

1942
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,019
Will, what color are you gonna go with?

1943
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:17,936
Green.

1944
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:22,065
Going with the color
of the homeland, the Emerald Isle.

1945
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:25,319
- So beautiful.
- I love that, for St. Paddy's Day.

1946
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:46,631
God, what do we say? You don't wanna,
like, upset the artistic process.

1947
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,426
<i>- Call has been forwarded to...</i>
- God!

1948
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:52,763
<i>At the tone, please record your message.</i>

1949
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:54,723
Hi, Kristen.

1950
01:45:54,806 --> 01:45:55,640
Hi, Kristen.

1951
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:59,102
It's Will and Harper, and we're, uh...

1952
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:02,481
Gosh, we've almost
officially made it across country.

1953
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:05,650
We're gonna go down
to the beach here, and, uh...

1954
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,028
- Well, we're just checking in.
- Yeah.

1955
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:09,780
Hey, anything you wanna send us

1956
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:13,075
in the next anywhere from two
to eight minutes would be great.

1957
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,661
- Look at that. There it is.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1958
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,330
- The ocean.
- Beautiful.

1959
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:23,460
- It does feel good, right?
- Yeah.

1960
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:26,630
- I mean, it's a long drive.
- Yeah. I know.

1961
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:27,798
You know?

1962
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:31,801
Oh!

1963
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:33,970
- Wow.
- That's great.

1964
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,603
We've dropped these chairs
in some very nice places, haven't we?

1965
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:43,271
- Yeah.
- The Grand Canyon.

1966
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:45,148
- Yep.
- The Mississippi River.

1967
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,358
Mighty Mississippi.

1968
01:46:46,858 --> 01:46:49,069
On a... In a Walmart parking lot.

1969
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:55,659
- I will never forget this.
- Yeah.

1970
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:57,661
We'll never forget this trip.

1971
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:03,667
Because if it's in a week
or six months from now...

1972
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:04,750
Yeah.

1973
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,838
...the joy...

1974
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:08,921
Yeah.

1975
01:47:09,464 --> 01:47:12,342
...the joy I'm gonna feel just seeing you.

1976
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:17,889
Which I always felt, but it's like,
man, I really got close to my friend Will.

1977
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:20,058
- I still...
- Yeah.

1978
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:23,687
I'm gonna think of something tomorrow
that I forgot to ask you.

1979
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,189
I'm gonna think
of a bunch of stuff I should've said

1980
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:27,691
that I wanted to tell you.

1981
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,651
- But...
- We have time.

1982
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:32,028
- We have time and...
- I mean, yeah.

1983
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,494
I got you a little present.

1984
01:47:41,246 --> 01:47:42,581
- You did?
- Yeah.

1985
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,708
Because one of...

1986
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:48,962
We've obviously had
this back-and-forth on beauty.

1987
01:47:49,045 --> 01:47:50,045
Yeah.

1988
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,508
- And... being okay with...
- Yeah.

1989
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,927
With kind of, you know...

1990
01:47:57,804 --> 01:48:01,183
Whether it's makeup
or finding the right dress, it... it...

1991
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:05,770
making yourself feel good
as a woman, beautiful.

1992
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:09,441
So... I thought to myself,

1993
01:48:09,524 --> 01:48:12,277
"I know what I wanna get Harper
at the end of the thing."

1994
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:15,739
Her own pair of diamond earrings.

1995
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:18,325
- Not diamond earrings. Really?
- Yeah.

1996
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,371
Oh my God.

1997
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:26,332
So...

1998
01:48:29,377 --> 01:48:30,377
Just to...

1999
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:35,383
Just as kind of obviously
a memory of the trip,

2000
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:37,260
but just, like, it's okay to...

2001
01:48:39,095 --> 01:48:42,766
It's okay to feel pretty
and do nice, pretty things for yourself.

2002
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,810
Oh jeez.

2003
01:48:53,276 --> 01:48:55,195
I don't... Jeez.

2004
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,073
It's just so cool.

2005
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,283
It's just so sweet.

2006
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,702
You know?

2007
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:04,037
This is very special.

2008
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:07,207
- I'm going in. I'm going in!
- Whoa!

2009
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,088
Hey, it's pretty good!

2010
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:16,590
Dolores.

2011
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:18,926
Cornelius.

2012
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:21,096
So what's next?

2013
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:23,807
For me,

2014
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:27,310
tomorrow, I'm running it back.

2015
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:30,564
I gotta get back to New York,
so I'm gonna drive back across.

2016
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,191
What are you doing, by the way?

2017
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:36,361
I've literally got nothing.
I'm wide open.

2018
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,031
- You wanna go back with me?
- Yeah, let's just run it back.

2019
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,200
- Take a new route.
- New route. Great.

2020
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,244
- I got a lot of ideas.
- Yeah.

2021
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:47,038
- I got some fun places to stop.
