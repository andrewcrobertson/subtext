1
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:39,663
Beautiful.

2
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,470
Focus more on the arm whip
than wrist snap, okay?

3
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,407
It'll give you more velocity.

4
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,102
I had a long talk
with Mom this morning.

5
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:53,415
She said your bad dreams
are getting worse.

6
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,020
She also said

7
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,684
there was something
you needed to tell me.

8
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,321
Remember... Remember that day

9
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:05,193
you let me ride my
bike to practice?

10
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,156
You rode through the
storm drain, didn't you?

11
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:08,562
By the old mine.

12
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:10,465
Why? Did something happen?

13
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,267
No. Nothing happened, Dad.

14
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:15,569
I just freaked myself
out a bit. That's all.

15
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,684
Is that why you started carrying
around Bunny Bear again?

16
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:27,510
Before you say no,

17
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:29,217
Mom thinks one way
of tackling this

18
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,283
is for you to let go
of some of the things

19
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,356
you needed when you were little.

20
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,455
I agree.

21
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:39,762
But we also agree that
when that happens,

22
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,133
it's entirely up to you.

23
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,495
Let me toss the
gear in the shed,

24
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,856
and then we can go
grab some pizza.

25
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:30,215
Dad?

26
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,751
Dad?

27
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:41,358
Dad, are you in there?

28
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,593
Dad?

29
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:09,951
Dad?

30
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,184
Dad, what's happening?

31
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:12,719
Dad!

32
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,186
Run!

33
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:16,690
No!

34
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,899

Five more minutes. Okay, dude?

40
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,352
I thought we said
no more <i>Bunny Hop.</i>

41
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,421
It's better than
<i>Little Baby Bum.</i>

42
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,030
Hey.

43
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,065
Hey, babe. You look awful.

44
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,898
You look like a waffle.

45
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:18,069
Yeah, well, I didn't
sleep for shit.

46
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,370
I thought you said you were
gonna stop working so late.

47
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:22,408
It wasn't that.

48
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,541
There were deer or something

49
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,615
- in the backyard again.
- Hmm.

50
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:27,419
What time is it?

51
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,422
10:17.

52
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:32,383
Why?

53
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:33,855
Oh, I don't know.

54
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:35,053
My sister?

55
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,058
Liam and the girls?

56
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,595
11:00 a.m. brunch?

57
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,559
Family brunch.

58
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,897
Okay. I am going to shower.

59
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,834
Come on.

60
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,571
You're a zombie.
You're a zombie.

61
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,738
I'm gonna... Come.
I'll get you!

62
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:55,872
You're gonna give
him nightmares.

63
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,544
You're a zombie!
Please, he loves it.

64
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,542
Don't you, <i>ti cheri?</i>

65
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,949
Yes, let Auntie eat you!

66
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,417
Was there a blackout last night?

67
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,250
Uh, no, not that
I know of. Why?

68
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,989
Clocks are all out of whack,
and the fridge is defrosted.

69
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,029
Oh!

70
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,463
Oh, wow.

71
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,197
Yeah, the place looks
amazing, Karina.

72
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:18,298
Thank you, Arlene.

73
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,233
Yeah, it's getting there.

74
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,234
Yeah, it's great.

75
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:24,806
It's so not getting there.

76
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,736
Mmm.

77
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,546
It was probably just a possum.

78
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,176
I caught one under my
grill the other night.

79
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:34,711
Almost shat myself.

80
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:36,114
It sounded like a person to me.

81
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,815
Then it was kids
drinking forties

82
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,096
in the woods like we used to do.

83
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:42,956
It sounded like one person.

84
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,819
Got a gun in the house?

85
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,398
Are you nuts?

86
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,328
All Dad ever needed
was his Henry Aaron.

87
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,505
Different era, my friend.

88
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:59,242
Hey, check this out.

89
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,650
Finally got the mechanics
working perfect.

90
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,460
My loan agent might be willing
to give me an extension.

91
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,994
But only if I cut
production costs by half.

92
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,230
I, uh...

93
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,165
You know, I thought we agreed
you were gonna let that go.

94
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,004
That you were gonna get
those loans paid off.

95
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:42,819
Whatever you say, boss.

96
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,590
<i>So how's Pat doing with the
move back to New Jersey?</i>

97
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,190
Stressed.

98
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,890
- Mmm.
- Barely sleeping.

99
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,688
It killed him to come back here

100
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:51,923
and take the job with Liam,

101
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,294
but the reality is he
couldn't find anyone

102
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:56,026
to fund his designs.

103
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:58,466
Our medical benefits
are about to expire.

104
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,831
If his mom hadn't
moved to Arizona,

105
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,798
we would be at the
YMCA right now.

106
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,204
Ahh!

107
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,003
Hey, honey.

108
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,744
Please, please don't
play Fute so loud. Okay?

109
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:45,908
Screw this.

110
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,154
Hey, listen.

111
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,358
It's fine with me if you
guys are partying out here.

112
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,473
But don't blame me if I
bash someone's face in

113
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:18,794
'cause you don't
wanna get caught.

114
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:34,586
Shit.

115
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,390
Oh, my God.

116
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:16,466
Listen, Patty.

117
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,532
I know you're still down
about how things played out,

118
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,006
but you should be proud that
you had the balls to go for it.

119
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,239
Be careful what you wish for.

120
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,111
Remember when I took over
the yard after Dad died?

121
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,417
Had nightmares
every goddamn night

122
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:36,683
about them repossessing our car

123
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:37,987
or foreclosing on the house.

124
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,024
Those are my good dreams, Liam.

125
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,297
Ever since we moved back home,

126
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,938
I've been having these white-knucklers
about Jake getting snatched.

127
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,131
We're in the backyard.

128
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:58,135
Or maybe it's a park
or a playground.

129
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,273
I just get this bad
feeling, you know?

130
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,309
You know who I
blame for that shit?

131
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:13,792
Yeah, I could really
use him right now.

132
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,754
Yeah.

133
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,290
You and me both, brother.

134
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:22,295
Meet me over at the kiln in 20.

135
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,201
Yeah.

136
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:33,009
<i>Can you please stop doing
that for three seconds?</i>

137
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,274
This is Irish Walnut.

138
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,913
If I leave it for too
long, it'll get chalky.

139
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,481
I don't care if it's
Scottish scrotum.

140
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:40,911
We're on a mission here.

141
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,184
Dad always says to
never come down here.

142
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:46,284
"Dad always said never
to come down here."

143
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,487
You're just scared of what
might be inside there.

144
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:53,828
Liam, have you ever thought...

145
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,328
What if the things
they say are true?

146
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,965
Don't be a moron.

147
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,333
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

148
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,338
Bingo!

149
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,884
Okay, we saw it.
Can we go home now?

150
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
I dare you to go over there.

151
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,919
I double dare you.

152
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
Or I'll tell everybody
what a pussy you were.

153
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,118
I triple dare you to do it.

154
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,418
I already did it,
like, 10 times.

155
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:23,721
Then you shouldn't be
afraid to do it again.

156
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:24,722
Should you?

157
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,045
I wanna go home.

158
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,981
Yeah.

159
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,115
Yeah, me too.

160
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:48,781
Holy crap.

161
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,353
- That's a wild plum tree.
- Who cares?

162
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:55,752
Grandpa said it's the softest
wood in the entire world.

163
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:56,753
Patty.

164
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,097
Pat.

165
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,100
Pat!

166
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,562
Get away from there, Patty.

167
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,098
Help me pull this
tree down first.

168
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,500
No frickin' way.

169
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,972
I'm not leaving
until I get a piece!

170
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,335
If you don't let go right now,

171
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,677
I'm totally telling
Dad we came here.

172
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,877
- Dude. You're the pussy.
- Screw you.

173
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:17,347
I'm leaving if you
don't get away...

174
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,354
Sweet.

175
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:25,553
You're too close.

176
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,991
Seriously, Patty.

177
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,435
Almost got it.

178
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,868
- Are you holding on?
- Yes, I am.

179
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,435
Okay, good.

180
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,509
How many more times
you wanna do it?

181
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,645
One thousand.

182
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,473
- I gotta stop, okay?
- Again.

183
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,516
No. I know you want
to go again, baby,

184
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,517
but I have to work, okay?

185
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:29,112
Stop.

186
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,821
All right. I know.

187
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,585
Come on, then.
Let's go over here.

188
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,787
So maybe we can go when Daddy
gets back from work, okay?

189
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:36,788
Okay.

190
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:49,502
Jakie.

191
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,344
Jakie, stop.

192
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,093
I said stop!

193
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,352
I'm sorry.

194
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:08,317
Mommy just needs some
quiet for a bit. Okay?

195
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,558
Can you do that for me, please?

196
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,228
Okay.

197
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,296
Thank you.

198
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,099
Jake?

199
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:51,931
Jake?

200
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,566
Jakie, where are you?

201
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,770
Jake?

202
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,079
Jakie?

203
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,009
If you don't come
out in three seconds,

204
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,413
no dessert tonight, okay?

205
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:10,982
Jakie?

206
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,487
Jakie?

207
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:15,787
Jakie!

208
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:17,121
Jake?

209
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:19,130
Jakie! Where are you?

210
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,111
I'll take the one.
That's the one.

211
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:41,614
Jakie! Come to Mommy, okay?

212
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,174
Hello. We're here.

213
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,311
Ooh! Look at this!

214
00:19:09,308 --> 00:19:10,379
Jakie! Come out!

215
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:15,384
Jakie!

216
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,785
Jakie!

217
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,690
Jakie?

218
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,988
Jakie? Jakie!

219
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,856
Jakie! Jakie!

220
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,222
Jake.

221
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,792
Oh, my God.

222
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,459
Don't you ever run away from
me like that again, okay?

223
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,930
Let's go home. Okay, baby?

224
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,197
Okay?

225
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:44,988
Let's go home, baby, okay?

226
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,580
We go home.

227
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:17,611
Hey, buddy.

228
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:23,879
How's your day been?

229
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,257
Good, good. "Good,
good," good?

230
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,659
Okay. All right.

231
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,980
- That's enough Fute now, okay?
- Slow down, buddy.

232
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:37,985
Jakie!

233
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,734
Oh, poor Daddy.

234
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,105
Oh, my God.

235
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:49,478
Put him down.

236
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,981
<i>♪ Ding, ding, dong ♪</i>

237
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:12,695
<i>Wanna watch that show</i>

238
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,329
<i>your sister was
telling us about?</i>

239
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,636
It's too heavy.

240
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:17,770
Anything on the queue?

241
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,537
Mm-hmm.

242
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,445
250 movies we'll
never actually watch.

243
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:32,455
What's wrong?

244
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,667
I almost lost him today.

245
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:51,973
Lost him how?

246
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,671
I... I was trying to work,

247
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:56,242
and he was just playing
the stupid recorder

248
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:58,745
and I just lost it. I snapped.

249
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,447
I took my eye off
him for one second,

250
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:03,947
and he wandered
into the woods...

251
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,819
and I... I panicked, and all
I could think about was...

252
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:17,869
Are we gonna be okay?

253
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:21,285
Again.

254
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:28,328
Again, again.

255
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:33,330
Hey, who you talking to, buddy?

256
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,637
Dolly.

257
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,672
To Dolly?

258
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:38,206
Dolly.

259
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:42,040
Dolly.

260
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,252
Is there a moth in here?

261
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,519
Mmm-mmm. Just Dolly.

262
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,990
Come on. Lie down, kiddo.

263
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:00,196
Let's get you tucked in.

264
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:04,997
Where did you go?
Where'd you go?

265
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:11,704
Okay, buddy, go into the light.

266
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,775
There's peace and
tranquility in the light.

267
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,174
All are welcome.

268
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,544
All are welcome.

269
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:27,591
All are not welcome.

270
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,935
Pat?

271
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,470
Pat?

272
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm here.

273
00:26:58,744 --> 00:26:59,947
What are you doing?

274
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,176
I think there's
somebody out there.

275
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,118
Oh. What?

276
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,094
Don't bother.

277
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,124
The power's out again.

278
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:14,830
Just come here and listen.

279
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:17,063
You're freaking me out, Pat.

280
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,801
Just...

281
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,666
Just listen.

282
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,766
What am I listening for?

283
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,072
This weird zipping sound.

284
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:29,647
I couldn't, for the life of
me, place it until just now.

285
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,810
Like a rucksack or duffel bag.

286
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,513
Somebody's opening
and closing it

287
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:35,884
just to mess with my head.

288
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,919
Come on, Pat. Seriously?

289
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:42,789
As soon as I figure out
where this asshole is hiding,

290
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,356
I'm gonna kick his goddamn...

291
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,489
Oh, shit, Jake.

292
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:48,024
Hello. Hi. Yeah.

293
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,130
Yeah, someone's
breaking into our house.

294
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:50,092
Jake?

295
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,600
Yeah, it's 109 Walter Ave.

296
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,930
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Daddy's here, all right?

297
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,451
- Yes. Yeah, please hurry.
- I got you.

298
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,898
Thank you. Please.

299
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,108
Go ahead, take him.

300
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,073
Where're you going?

301
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,710
- I'm going downstairs.
- Pat, no.

302
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:09,282
Just stay inside, okay?

303
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:10,283
Close the door.

304
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,755
You wanna mess with me, man?

305
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:19,922
Yeah, I'm right here.

306
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:22,589
I'm right here!

307
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:50,946
Pat.

308
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,583
I said stay upstairs!

309
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:55,976
What the hell is going on?

310
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Are you okay?

311
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:01,997
Are you okay, babe?

312
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,329
Come on. Go for it.

313
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:19,542
Hey.

314
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,108
Hey.

315
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,916
I'd say welcome home, Pat,

316
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:25,449
but somebody obviously
beat me to the punch.

317
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,020
- You must be Karina. Hey.
- Hi.

318
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,856
As far as the perp
gettin' inside...

319
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:34,323
there's not a lot to go on.

320
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:36,993
Well, I know for a fact
the doors were locked.

321
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:38,462
You guys have a hide-a-key?

322
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:40,467
Oh, yeah.

323
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:41,564
Yes. Yeah, we do.

324
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:50,840
Right here.

325
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:52,480
Ah. Okay.

326
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,542
Most likely scenario is,

327
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:57,949
somebody saw the length
of the grass in your yard,

328
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,281
thought you might be outta town

329
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,349
and decided to make
an impulse buy.

330
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,793
So, why didn't they
steal anything?

331
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:06,434
You're positive
nothing's missing?

332
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,899
Yeah, not as far as we can tell.

333
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,330
Do me a favor. Go
through the house again.

334
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,868
Make a list of anything
that's not where it should be.

335
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:16,901
No matter how small
or insignificant.

336
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:19,336
Yeah. I'll start
in the kitchen.

337
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,576
Yeah, it felt more like
he was trying to scare us.

338
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,375
Yeah, he did a good job too.

339
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,511
Hey, Chief, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

340
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,979
Pat...

341
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,317
Can you come upstairs?

342
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:34,653
Sure.

343
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,321
A lot of these break-ins
where it looks like

344
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,763
there was an ulterior
motive to robbery,

345
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:43,164
turns out somebody
is sendin' a message.

346
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:48,936
You sure you didn't
know this guy?

347
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:50,497
Well, I mean, I never
got a look at him.

348
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:56,309
You let me know if you
remember anything else.

349
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:58,347
Okay?

350
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,082
Okay.

351
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,753
What do we got, Rawls?

352
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,413
Well, I'm not
entirely sure, sir.

353
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,353
Don't suppose you made these?

354
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,958
Yeah.

355
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,656
Uh, yeah, all the
time when I was a kid.

356
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,927
There're boxes of
'em in the garage.

357
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:19,461
You know, it seems to me like someone was
squatting here like this, and, you know,

358
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,902
tossing them. Like so.

359
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:23,303
Maybe drawin' your
son's attention?

360
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:25,041
Look...

361
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:27,106
Tell 'em I sent you.

362
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,073
They'll rig your whole
house for a song.

363
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,114
And mow your lawn,
for chrissake.

364
00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:57,672
Jakie.

365
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,433
Holy shit.

366
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,004
Daddy, look at this.

367
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:36,507
Very cool, buddy.

368
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:39,510
Hey, so, pile on the right
goes back on the shelves.

369
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:42,344
Everything on the left, we
can bag and toss outside.

370
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:44,213
This asshole really did rob us,

371
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,334
he needs a new line of work.

372
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:47,533
Where the hell
did you find this?

373
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,655
Uh, I've never seen
that before in my life.

374
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,693
So, what's it doing in the
bottom of the wastebasket

375
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:55,694
in my office?

376
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,466
No idea.

377
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,034
It's, uh...

378
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,715
It's one of the first
things I ever carved.

379
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:05,807
Lost it years ago.

380
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:10,608
Speaking of things
carved out of wood...

381
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:14,716
Can you...

382
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,119
ditch this for me somewhere?

383
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,184
What for?

384
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,947
It's literally his favorite
thing in the world.

385
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:21,918
Yeah, and you need to find him
a new favorite thing, my love.

386
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,521
A quieter thing,

387
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,355
'cause if he blows this shit
in my ear one more time,

388
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,395
you are never
getting laid again.

389
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,531
Okay.

390
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:29,491
I'll hide it out here

391
00:34:29,492 --> 00:34:31,431
until he drives you
nuts asking for it.

392
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:33,494
Thank you.

393
00:34:33,495 --> 00:34:35,468
Uh, garbage goes
out front tonight.

394
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,843
<i>The score is now two-zero
in favor of Texas.</i>

395
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,015
Fute.

396
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,917
<i>- Anderson is trying...</i>
- Later, Jakie.

397
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,881
- You can play Fute later.
- Fute.

398
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,453
Fute.

399
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,889
Fute!

400
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,720
Okay. Okay, fine, I'll get it.

401
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,823
But you better play quietly,
or Mommy'll kill me.

402
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,765
Hey, what do you say when I say,

403
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:04,886
"if you're okay in the tub?"

404
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:06,835
Fute.

405
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:08,832
No, no. What do you say?

406
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,032
"Okay."

407
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,868
Okay. All right.

408
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:14,370
Mommy and Auntie Anna are
across the hall if you need 'em.

409
00:35:14,371 --> 00:35:16,104
I'm going downstairs for a sec.

410
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,840
Okay.

411
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:21,211
Sis, I'm, like, juggling
four different campaigns.

412
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,215
You know, you promised me rose

413
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:24,980
- and <i>Real Housewives.</i>
- Are you okay?

414
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:26,123
Okay!

415
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,793
Is that Dolly?

416
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,094
You okay up there?

417
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,401
Okay!

418
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,004
Huh.

419
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,642
Dolly!

420
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,547
You okay, Jake?

421
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:05,726
Jake?

422
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:09,664
Jake?

423
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:16,133
What are you supposed
to say, Jake?

424
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:20,342
Daddy asked you a
question, Jakie.

425
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:24,342
Okay.

426
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:25,976
Did you turn the lights off?

427
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,080
Nope.

428
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:28,361
Who are you playing with?

429
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:31,982
Oh. There he is.

430
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:33,384
Dolly.

431
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,023
Where'd I put it?

432
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,184
Who are you playing with?

433
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:37,524
Dolly.

434
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:02,780
The hell are you?

435
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,207
Have you been able to stop
thinking about what happened?

436
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:14,993
No.

437
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,730
Have you?

438
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:21,065
No.

00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,030
Need to ask you a question.

442
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,248
Harvey says he spotted you

443
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:10,751
playing by the
old service steps.

444
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:12,280
Yeah, because...

445
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:15,001
I was just looking for softer wood
to carve than all this stupid oak.

446
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,695
All right. Let's you
and me take a walk.

447
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:24,799
Come on.

448
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:41,867
You gotta be shitting me.

449
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:57,363
<i>Your Promethian</i>

450
00:38:57,364 --> 00:38:59,061

456

Karina!

457
00:43:20,493 --> 00:43:22,093
Karina, wake up!

458
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:24,726
Pat!

459
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,761
Pat! What's going on?

460
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:27,930
Did you see him?

461
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:29,371
- Did you see him?
- See who?

462
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,099
What?

463
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,902
- Just go back inside, okay?
- No, but what...

464
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,409
Just go back inside.
Lock the door.

465
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,010
- Pat, what... No! Pat!
- Just stay here.

466
00:43:39,512 --> 00:43:40,980
Where are you?

467
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,147
Are you in here?

468
00:43:44,616 --> 00:43:45,853
Where are you?

469
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:51,356
Come on.

00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:54,631

- Yeah.

473
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:03,934
And nobody's here.

474
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:05,735
I swear I saw something...

475
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:07,537
Alarm.

476
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:08,810
One sec.

477
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:12,974
No fingerprints

478
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:14,779
or any of the doors or windows,

479
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,578
and none of the
molds in the backyard

480
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:18,852
came up a match.

481
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:23,052
Power company did confirm
13 separate interruptions,

482
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:25,655
but insist the problem
is not on their end.

483
00:44:25,656 --> 00:44:26,729
Meaning what?

484
00:44:29,095 --> 00:44:32,467
You haven't had a new
face show up, have you?

485
00:44:32,468 --> 00:44:34,368
Different guy checkin'
the gas meter,

486
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:37,065
- or fixin' a cable?
- No.

487
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:38,675
And nothing missing
from the house?

488
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,914
Uh, Jake has this...

489
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:50,814
musical instrument, um...

490
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,118
a recorder that
he loves to play,

491
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:58,057
which I might have
thrown out by mistake.

492
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:01,662
But even if I did,
it would still be

493
00:45:01,663 --> 00:45:03,425
in one of the garbage
cans, which it's not.

494
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:09,269
And I...

495
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,041
I could have sworn I
heard it being played.

496
00:45:16,544 --> 00:45:17,912
You know, last night.

497
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,001
Hey.

498
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:46,809
Thought I said,
"Take some time off."

499
00:45:49,645 --> 00:45:51,077
I need to show you something.

500
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,920
So, what?

501
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,953
There's a thousand more
like it back at the house.

502
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:05,256
That's the only owl I ever made.

503
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:10,261
Do you remember where I lost it?

504
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:17,807
Don't tell me you
went back there?

505
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:22,270
No.

506
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:25,276
I found it in a trash
bin at home yesterday.

507
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:28,115
How is that possible?

508
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,214
It's not.

509
00:46:31,018 --> 00:46:32,987
Look what else I
found in Mom's garage.

510
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:48,233
What are you saying, Patty?

511
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:51,808
You explain it. I...

512
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:55,977
Mom always had a knack
for finding lost stuff.

513
00:46:56,644 --> 00:46:57,814
You know she did.

514
00:46:59,078 --> 00:47:00,442
Keep digging through that house

515
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,885
and I guarantee you'll find
all kinds'a crazy shit.

516
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:09,386
Maybe, in the meantime,

517
00:47:11,993 --> 00:47:13,954
I think you should give
that shrink a call.

518
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:15,326
What was her name?

519
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:18,332
Mary?

520
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:21,102
Barbara.

521
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:24,299
Yeah, something's been bubbling
up in you for a long time now,

522
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,337
and she always seemed
to help back in the day.

523
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,362
Yeah, let your brother
have a go, all right?

524
00:47:52,897 --> 00:47:53,936
Not too high.

525
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:56,538
Are you serious?

526
00:48:00,642 --> 00:48:01,742
Gotta go.

527
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:03,110
Push it back. Push it back.

528
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:05,546
Push it back.

529
00:48:10,114 --> 00:48:11,586
- Present.
- Jeez.

530
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,384
- Jakie, you scared me.
- Present.

531
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:15,520
It's from Dolly.

532
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,521
What is this?

533
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:18,493
It's a present.

534
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:20,625
Okay?

535
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:22,327
Okay.

536
00:48:38,844 --> 00:48:39,844
What the hell?

537
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,925
Shit. Jakie.

538
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:56,999
Jakie, come out of there!

539
00:48:57,663 --> 00:48:58,663
Jakie!

540
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:04,136
Jakie.

541
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:08,373
Get away from him!

542
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:10,409
Get the hell away from my son!

543
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,442
Jakie!

544
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:13,213
Jakie!

545
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:16,912
Jakie. Come here.

546
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,614
Come here. Jakie.

547
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:20,720
Jakie!

548
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,650
What's happening to you
both is very normal.

549
00:49:55,651 --> 00:50:00,289
To have your home invaded
is a traumatic experience,

550
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,628
one that brings up
all kinds of issues.

551
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:04,629
Such as?

552
00:50:05,228 --> 00:50:06,628
Such as,

553
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:10,204
"How will I ever let my
son out of my sight again?"

554
00:50:10,868 --> 00:50:12,467
Or...

555
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,671
"Did I fulfill my
obligation as a husband

556
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:20,044
"and a father, and a man,

557
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:21,677
"to protect my
wife and child?"

558
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:25,953
Karina, Pat's description.

559
00:50:25,954 --> 00:50:28,988
It's quite evocative
of a persistent phobia

560
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,027
your husband struggled
with as a child.

561
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:34,158
Which, of course,

562
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,462
is how Pat and I came
to know each other.

563
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,537
What phobia was that?

564
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:44,538
<i>Patrick.</i>

565
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:46,772
<i>Patrick.</i>

566
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:49,540
<i>Let's you and me take a walk.</i>

567
00:50:50,644 --> 00:50:51,644
Come on.

568
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,652
You know, long before
we built this yard,

569
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,414
this whole forest

570
00:50:59,415 --> 00:51:01,387
was basically one
big copper mine.

571
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,674
Kicked out half the product
for the entire state,

572
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:08,724
before they finally
dug the sucker dry.

573
00:51:11,763 --> 00:51:13,803
This was how you got down
to the main entry shaft...

574
00:51:15,268 --> 00:51:17,304
back when it was owned
by the mining company.

575
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:19,635
Who owns it now?

576
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:21,806
Us?

577
00:51:29,415 --> 00:51:31,351
Now it belongs to Bagman.

578
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,719
- Who's Bagman?
- Shh!

579
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:42,590
You never know who
might be listenin'.

580
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:44,594
I told your brother
this story last summer,

581
00:51:44,595 --> 00:51:47,034
just like your granddad
did me when I was your age

582
00:51:47,035 --> 00:51:49,133
and his granddad's
granddad before that.

583
00:51:49,134 --> 00:51:51,437
And all of them
swore it was true.

584
00:51:53,273 --> 00:51:54,605
Just like I'm
swearing to you now.

585
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:57,608
They say...

586
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:00,545
he wanders the world each night,

587
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:02,410
searching for children

588
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,615
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

589
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:07,719
- Not just any children...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,557
Let me guess.

591
00:52:09,558 --> 00:52:11,659
He wants the naughty children that
don't listen to their parents or...

592
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,558
Wrong, Patty.

593
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,297
It's the good kids he wants.

594
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,630
The shiny ones and the dreamers.

595
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,568
Once they catch his
eye, or grab his fancy,

596
00:52:24,502 --> 00:52:26,334
he won't rest until he has them

597
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,076
slung over his bony shoulder.

598
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:31,477
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

599
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,546
No, you're just
trying to scare me...

600
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:38,984
Damn right, I'm trying
to scare you, boy.

601
00:52:38,985 --> 00:52:40,219
<i>And scared you better be!</i>

602
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,484
<i>Wander too close,
he'll drag you in</i>

603
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:43,253
<i>and make pencils
out of your fingers,</i>

604
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:44,688
and gobble the rest of you down!

605
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,659
Are you with me, boy?

606
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,503
<i>Good.</i>

607
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:55,171
Bagman?

608
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:22,693
You drew these?

609
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:26,766
Yep.

610
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:40,751
That's what I meant by
a persistent phobia.

611
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,615
Pat's was so intense,

612
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:46,183
I felt it was
crucial to give him

613
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:48,584
as much context as possible

614
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:50,952
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

615
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:02,268
As you can see, the
so-called Bag or Sackman,

616
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:05,307
is a figure common to
almost every culture.

617
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,210
Curiously, his methodology,

618
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:11,742
even the phenomena that
accompany his presence,

619
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:15,410
are remarkably consistent.

620
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:17,677
He has the power to paralyze

621
00:54:17,678 --> 00:54:20,516
and incapacitate
parents and adults

622
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,223
leaving their young
ones vulnerable.

623
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:26,421
And he feeds off the
child's fear and anxiety.

624
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:30,727
It sustains him, nourishes him.

625
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:34,928
He can lure children to his
lair with toys or candy...

626
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:38,403
And when the child is
at their most terrified,

627
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:41,772
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

628
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:44,238
Are you trying to
make us feel stupid?

629
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,741
On the contrary.

630
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:49,910
I never told Karina about
the Bagman, Barbara,

631
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,582
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

632
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,155
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

633
00:54:56,156 --> 00:54:58,726
you're projecting
the supernatural

634
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:00,422
onto something...

635
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:03,592
all too painfully real.

636
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,998
And until you deal
with the real stuff

637
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:08,370
bubbling up for you,

638
00:55:09,233 --> 00:55:10,666
the anger,

639
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:14,569
the feelings of
vulnerability, and violation,

640
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,008
your panic attacks
and nightmares

641
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:18,644
will only get worse.

642
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:20,514
Okay, so,

643
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:22,813
what do you suggest we do?

644
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,482
I see her.

645
00:55:28,483 --> 00:55:31,426
I'm the zombie.

646
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,787
- Whoa! Hey, guys.
- Okay.

647
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,625
So, he goes down
7:30 at the latest.

648
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,424
- We read two stories...
- Two stories, yeah.

649
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,965
And then we sing <i>Frere Jacques</i>
when he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

650
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,667
Guys, check your phone.

651
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,963
I just texted you the confirmation
number for a room at the Hyatt.

652
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,332
Two blocks from here,
three from the restaurant.

653
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,934
Already paid for.

654
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,706
Dinner's one thing, but
there's no chance in hell

655
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:49,604
we're sleeping in a different
place than Jakie right now.

656
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:51,339
Who said anything
about sleeping?

657
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,613
Who said sleeping?

658
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:56,113
Will you just get
her out of here, Pat?

659
00:55:56,114 --> 00:55:57,713
Who said...

660
00:55:57,714 --> 00:56:00,019
Jakie, listen to
Auntie Anna, okay?

661
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,188
Call any time!

662
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:03,620
We can be back, five
minutes tops, okay?

663
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:05,341
Gonna play zombie.

664
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,863
I'm not sure I'm up for this.

665
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:16,438
Yeah, me neither.

666
00:56:19,103 --> 00:56:23,610
Worst case, we get dinner to
go and eat on Anna's couch.

667
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:26,710
Yep.

668
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:28,916
Let's at least try to
make it as far as dessert,

669
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:29,957
so she can put Jakie down.

670
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,059
So, what's the verdict?

671
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:42,965
Is your husband nuts?

672
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:47,898
Completely fricking crackers.

673
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:57,413
So, what actually happened
with you and Liam at the mine?

674
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:03,078
Well, I thought I felt someone
cut off a lock of my hair.

675
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:06,084
I, uh...

676
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:08,682
I lost my shit

677
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:11,386
and then we ran home screaming.

678
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:13,557
A lock of your hair?

679
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:16,362
Yeah. Bagman
supposedly always snips

680
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:18,093
one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

681
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,161
That's how it starts.

682
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,301
What the hell for?

683
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:25,899
So he always knows
where to find you.

684
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,103
No matter where you
try to run or hide.

685
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:35,110
Your father was something else.

686
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:38,284
I think in his own way he was
just trying to protect me.

687
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:39,950
A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

688
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:46,457
All I remember was
Mom was furious

689
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,293
'cause every night
I was convinced

690
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:49,564
he was tapping on my window.

691
00:57:50,528 --> 00:57:52,595
And then one night,

692
00:57:52,596 --> 00:57:54,965
the old man came in and he said,

693
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,806
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing as Bagman."

694
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:04,975
But I'm afraid I can't do that.

695
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:10,211
What I can do...

696
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:14,754
is tell you a secret he
don't want you to know.

697
00:58:16,992 --> 00:58:18,887
Truth is,

698
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:22,524
no matter how big, or
fast, or sneaky he is,

699
00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:23,994
he has weaknesses as well.

700
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:28,504
Escape his grasp long
enough, he'll rot away.

701
00:58:30,068 --> 00:58:33,234
And he cannot lay a single,
skinny finger on you.

702
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:35,544
Not as long...

703
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,410
as you have this.

704
00:58:43,716 --> 00:58:45,279
You see, every
kid's got something

705
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,018
that means more to them than
anything else in the world.

706
00:58:49,852 --> 00:58:51,087
Something they love so much,

707
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,597
it literally becomes a
piece of who they are.

708
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:57,896
And believe you me,

709
00:58:58,695 --> 00:59:00,030
a child's love...

710
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,568
can be a magical thing.

711
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:05,805
It can turn even the
humblest object...

712
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:08,742
into a totem...

713
00:59:09,507 --> 00:59:10,942
of great power.

714
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:17,348
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

715
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,280
and he cannot touch you.

716
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:25,687
But lose it,

717
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:28,058
or even worse, throw it away...

718
00:59:38,835 --> 00:59:39,839
So, you keep ahold of it.

719
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:42,275
No matter what.

720
00:59:47,943 --> 00:59:50,212
And now you're concerned...

721
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,367
that Fute has gone missing.

722
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:56,625
If the one thing that can
supposedly protect Jake...

723
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,128
from you-know-who...

724
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:02,061
is the thing that
he loves the most?

725
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,930
Honestly?

726
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:11,700
Well, what I wanna do
right now is go back home

727
01:00:11,701 --> 01:00:13,103
and dig through the trash again.

728
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:16,907
But if we go down
that thought track,

729
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,908
I'm not sure we'll make it
to the other side, so...

730
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:26,853
Did Barbara help
when you were eight?

731
01:00:28,185 --> 01:00:29,955
Wouldn't have made it
to nine without her.

732
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:32,892
So, we have to trust her now.

733
01:00:51,878 --> 01:00:54,481
No, I do not miss you at all.

734
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:56,349
<i>What?</i> ANNA: Mmm-mmm.

735
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,780
I have a real hot date tonight.

736
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:00,916
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
- Three feet tall,

737
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:03,585
talks gibberish and
craps his own pants.

738
01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:05,820
It is so, so sexy.

739
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:07,190
<i>Stop it.</i>

740
01:01:08,363 --> 01:01:10,164
Okay, babe, um...

741
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:11,426
We'll see you tomorrow.

742
01:01:11,427 --> 01:01:12,493
<i>Yeah.</i>

743
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,535
Yeah.

744
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:19,000
And why don't you make
me something sweet?

745
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:21,535
<i>Something sweet?
What do you mean?</i>

746
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:24,005
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

747
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:26,341
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

748
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:30,984
Okay. Okay, babe.

749
01:01:30,985 --> 01:01:32,083
Yeah. Bye.

750
01:02:52,763 --> 01:02:53,827
<i>Hey.</i>

751
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,361
- Angelo.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

752
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:58,570
Is there something weird
happening on this floor?

753
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:00,701
<i>Uh, what do you mean, "weird"?</i>

754
01:03:00,702 --> 01:03:02,037
I don't know.

755
01:03:02,038 --> 01:03:04,271
I'm hearing a voice
on a baby monitor.

756
01:03:04,272 --> 01:03:06,709
<i>Everything's clear
on my security cams.</i>

757
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:07,774
<i>You want me to come up?</i>

758
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,147
No, no. Um...

759
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,384
I'm sure it's nothing.

760
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:13,416
<i>Okay. Take it easy.</i>

761
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:14,449
Yeah.

762
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,869
Angelo, has there
been a power surge?

763
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:31,499
Angelo, are you there?

764
01:03:36,544 --> 01:03:37,544
Come on.

765
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:40,816
Shit.

766
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:23,050
I don't know what
you want from me.

767
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:25,289
But the cops are on their way!

768
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,032
Did I mention I have a gun?

769
01:04:37,234 --> 01:04:39,402
Don't play with
me, motherfucker!

770
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,160
Sarah!

771
01:04:59,022 --> 01:05:00,995
Sarah, call the police!

772
01:06:28,716 --> 01:06:29,716
Stay back.

773
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:31,849
Karina.

774
01:06:33,051 --> 01:06:35,080
Anna? Anna, are you okay?

775
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:36,486
Are you okay?

776
01:06:37,988 --> 01:06:38,820
What happened?

777
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:40,424
Where's Jakie?

778
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:43,860
We got him. He's okay.

779
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:45,693
Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

780
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,700
There you go.

781
01:06:49,033 --> 01:06:50,564
It's okay. Thank you.

782
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:53,533
We've got nothing
on the CCTV camera.

783
01:06:53,534 --> 01:06:56,077
It was knocked out when
the power went down.

784
01:06:57,108 --> 01:06:58,673
Thank God for the doorman.

785
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:03,011
Once the camera on
Anna's floor went dark,

786
01:07:03,012 --> 01:07:04,514
he headed straight up.

787
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:08,019
He must have scared the guy off.

788
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,585
- Did Angelo get a look at him?
- No.

789
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:12,385
But, Pat,

790
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:14,188
apparently there
are similarities

791
01:07:14,189 --> 01:07:16,295
to a case from four years ago.

792
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:21,066
A girl named Emily
Greenberg went missing.

793
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:24,168
Her dad suffered similar
symptoms to Anna's,

794
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:28,601
temporary paralysis
and loss of speech.

795
01:07:28,602 --> 01:07:32,744
And these strange
abrasions on his face.

796
01:07:32,745 --> 01:07:34,082
He said he couldn't move.

797
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:36,081
He had to lie there

798
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:37,445
and watch this lunatic
stuff his daughter

799
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:40,319
into a duffel bag
and run off with her.

800
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:49,394
Look, we're gonna get
you somewhere safe.

801
01:07:50,227 --> 01:07:51,359
I'll post officers outside

802
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,068
who'll keep watch
around the clock.

803
01:07:55,132 --> 01:07:56,496
Don't worry, Pat.

804
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:58,304
We're gonna catch
this sick bastard.

805
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,041
Thanks.

806
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:08,314
No problem.

807
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:10,845
This way. Right here.

808
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:12,619
Come on.

809
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Watch your step, okay?

810
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:31,301
They're trying to figure
out what paralyzed Anna,

811
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:32,982
and the doctors don't
have a frickin' clue.

812
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,770
Who cares, as long
as Anna's okay.

813
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,638
She's far from okay.

814
01:08:38,639 --> 01:08:40,576
All right, she refused
to stay in the hospital.

815
01:08:40,577 --> 01:08:43,410
She wouldn't even let us
turn the lights off upstairs.

816
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,818
Karina had to give
her a sedative

817
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:46,481
and get in bed
with her, you know?

818
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:48,783
Well, she can stay here
as long as she needs to.

819
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:52,887
Thank you.

820
01:08:52,888 --> 01:08:54,324
Please.

821
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:56,626
We'd be insulted if
you went anywhere else.

822
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:00,399
Come here.

823
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:11,476
I'm sorry.

824
01:09:13,142 --> 01:09:14,380
For what?

825
01:09:16,213 --> 01:09:17,251
Protecting my son?

826
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:24,922
Get some sleep.

827
01:09:24,923 --> 01:09:26,326
I'm not going anywhere.

828
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:50,218
'Bout time.

829
01:09:54,386 --> 01:09:55,706
What are you doing awake?

830
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:30,423
We'll get through this.

831
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,990
I promise.

832
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:52,511
I can't believe
this is happening.

833
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:55,811
What do we do if he
really does exist...

834
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,750
and we have lost the one
thing in the whole world...

835
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:04,292
that could keep our son safe?

836
01:11:08,457 --> 01:11:09,759
I'll make him a new one.

837
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,763
No, that won't be the same.

838
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:18,999
Hey, get some sleep, honey.

839
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:21,005
All right?

840
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:01,946
Jake!

841
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,278
- Pat?
- Jake!

842
01:12:11,688 --> 01:12:14,693
Daddy. Daddy,
help me. Help me.

843
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:15,759
Jake.

844
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,159
Jake!

845
01:12:18,263 --> 01:12:19,263
He's got the boy!

846
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:26,704
Pat? Pat?

847
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:34,046
Help!

848
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,080
Help!

849
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,387
Somebody stop him!

850
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:11,610
Stop right there!

851
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:14,081
Daddy, help me.

852
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:45,949
Daddy! Help me!

853
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:46,982
Jake!

854
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:11,479
Jake!

855
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:15,615
Daddy!

856
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,948
Help.

857
01:14:20,516 --> 01:14:22,721
Daddy! Help me!

858
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:27,462
Daddy, help me.

859
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:39,969
Jake?

860
01:14:41,205 --> 01:14:42,205
Jake?

861
01:15:24,284 --> 01:15:26,686
Jake? Are you in here?

862
01:15:27,383 --> 01:15:28,523
Jake?

863
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,960
Jake?

864
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:40,927
God, please. God.

865
01:16:40,928 --> 01:16:42,091
No, no, no.

866
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,193
What the heck?

867
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:36,178
<i>Daddy.</i>

868
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:42,657
<i>Daddy.</i>

869
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,026
<i>Daddy, help me!</i>

870
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:02,836
Mommy!

871
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:04,107
Jakie?

872
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:07,278
Oh, my God, Jake.

873
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,642
Oh, my gosh. Jake!

874
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,643
Karina!

875
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,785
Karina, what's happening?

876
01:18:17,786 --> 01:18:19,320
It's not Jake that he came for.

877
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,864
Show yourself, you sick bastard!

878
01:18:27,631 --> 01:18:29,132
Show yourself!

879
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:38,099
<i>First, he steals a
lock of your hair,</i>

880
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,269
<i>so he always knows
where to find you.</i>

881
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,109
<i>And then he taunts you
and feeds off your fear.</i>

882
01:19:46,944 --> 01:19:48,581
<i>It's the good kids he wants.</i>

883
01:19:48,582 --> 01:19:51,411
<i>The shiny ones and the dreamers.</i>

884
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,081
<i>And once they catch his
eye, or grab his fancy,</i>

885
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:56,015
<i>he won't rest until he has them</i>

886
01:19:56,016 --> 01:19:58,119
<i>slung over his bony shoulder,</i>

887
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,125
screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

888
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:06,130
Why come for me now, huh?

889
01:20:06,995 --> 01:20:08,528
After all this time?

890
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:19,077
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

891
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:21,475
and he cannot touch you.

892
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:25,044
<i>But lose it,</i>

893
01:20:25,045 --> 01:20:27,888
or even worse, throw it away...

894
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,439
The cold hard
truth of it, Patty,

895
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,378
is that there are
monsters in this world.

896
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,084
There is evil.

897
01:21:00,316 --> 01:21:02,351
And bad things do
happen to good people.

898
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:06,355
Even little children.

899
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:44,162
<i>The only thing that gives
me comfort at night...</i>

900
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:49,428
is a belief that there's
something good out there,

901
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:51,565
much more powerful
than all the bad stuff.

902
01:21:53,469 --> 01:21:55,404
<i>Something that loves
and watches over us.</i>

903
01:21:56,675 --> 01:21:57,675
<i>No matter what.</i>

904
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,626
And you really believe that?

905
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,598
I'm lookin' at the proof.

906
01:23:44,276 --> 01:23:47,417
Come on! It's me you want!

907
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:49,356
Come on.

908
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,185
Yeah, this way.

909
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,555
Down here! On me! Keep going.

910
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:29,523
<i>I don't know who's on foot.</i>

911
01:24:29,524 --> 01:24:31,356
Down by the yard,
keep a guard here.

912
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,193
What is it? What is it?

913
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:34,761
This is as far as she goes.

914
01:24:36,499 --> 01:24:38,402
Pat must have taken
a different route.

915
01:24:42,337 --> 01:24:43,572
Yo, boss, we got something.

916
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:46,777
It's got blood on it.

917
01:24:46,778 --> 01:24:47,807
Let's fan out!

918
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:49,682
What is that?

919
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:50,803
That's Jake's flute.

920
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,258
Pat. Pat!

921
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:00,424
Pat!

922
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:03,331
Pat!

923
01:25:03,992 --> 01:25:05,297
Pat!

924
01:25:05,961 --> 01:25:07,900
Pat!

925
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:09,031
You need to step away from...

926
01:25:09,032 --> 01:25:10,434
Pat! Can you hear me?

927
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,667
Pat!

928
01:25:14,937 --> 01:25:15,937
Pat!

929
01:25:16,972 --> 01:25:18,310
Pat!

930
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:20,279
Pat!

931
01:25:41,598 --> 01:25:43,936
Mom said we could stay
as long as we need to.

932
01:25:43,937 --> 01:25:45,603
I just can't be in
this house anymore.

933
01:25:45,604 --> 01:25:46,635
Not without Pat.

934
01:25:47,336 --> 01:25:49,668
There's still hope, 'Rina.

935
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:51,640
I mean, they haven't
even found anything yet.

936
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,714
They're not going to.

937
01:25:56,181 --> 01:25:57,547
And it's not over yet, either.

938
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:00,688
What do you mean?

939
01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:04,851
He's gonna come back for
Jake. I can just feel it.

940
01:26:08,356 --> 01:26:09,658
What are you gonna do?

941
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:14,900
Whatever it takes.

942
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:20,273
Okay. Come here.

943
01:26:29,546 --> 01:26:33,111
Just call me when
you get there. Okay?

944
01:26:33,112 --> 01:26:34,683
Yep. Yep.

945
01:26:35,589 --> 01:26:36,619
Yep.

946
01:26:39,593 --> 01:26:40,689
Yeah.

947
01:27:12,754 --> 01:27:14,723
Hey, so I got some
good news for you, pal.

948
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:17,330
Look what Daddy found.

949
01:27:17,994 --> 01:27:18,994
Fute.

950
01:27:23,897 --> 01:27:26,768
You know, he gave everything
to get that back for you.

951
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,742
And, um... And Daddy...

952
01:27:34,277 --> 01:27:35,576
He also told me a secret

953
01:27:35,577 --> 01:27:37,177
that he really, really
wants you to know.

954
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:42,289
Okay, so how much do
you love Fute, Jakie?

955
01:27:43,687 --> 01:27:46,260
Yeah. So a child's love
is a magical thing.

956
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:50,479
Keep it close to your heart.

957
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,440
And it will always protect you.

958
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:57,601
- Okay?
- Okay.

959
01:27:58,166 --> 01:27:59,166
Okay.

960
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:01,539
Always.

961
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:03,277
Always.
