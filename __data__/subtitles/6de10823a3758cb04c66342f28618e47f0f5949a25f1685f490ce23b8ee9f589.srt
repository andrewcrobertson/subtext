1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,022
Do you think we're close?

2
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,233
They're almost
impossible to find.

3
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,028
No one's ever
captured one alive.

4
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,949
I agreed
to provide security for you...

5
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,660
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

6
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,288
Well, it's worth the wait.

7
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,915
Dead specimens show that

8
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,167
the peptides
in the spider's venom, they...

9
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,255
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,593
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

11
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,970
like <i>Las Arañas.</i>

12
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>Las Arañas?</i>

13
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,601
The mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

14
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,810
and punish evil men

15
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,979
with their black,
poisoned touch?

16
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,232
I like to base my research
in science,

17
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,983
not legends, Mr Sims.

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,777
Those powers are wasted here.

19
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,279
These little spiders

20
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,573
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

21
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,658
It could...

22
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,994
- Are you okay?
- No.

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,789
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

24
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,000
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

25
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,294
Not when I'm this close.

26
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,590
Perhaps you should rest.

27
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,718
I don't have time.

28
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,013
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,099
For the umbrella.

30
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
I found it.

31
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,854
I found the spider.

32
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,985
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

33
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,778
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

34
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,072
Something so small
yet have so much power.

35
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,033
Okay.

36
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,743
Okay.

37
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,787
What are you doing?

38
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,998
I don't...

39
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,166
I don't understand.

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,585
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

41
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,004
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

42
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,506
I'm not interested
in helping people.

43
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,634
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

44
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,511
My road was
not as clear as yours.

45
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,095
We didn't have the same choices.

46
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,472
You're making
the wrong decision.

47
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,556
- Give me the spider!
- No.

48
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,807
You're making
the wrong decision.

49
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
- Give it to me.
- No.

50
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,603
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

51
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,938
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

52
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,115
No.

53
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,570
Her journey will not be easy...

54
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,197
but she is strong.

55
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,490
She will come back
when she needs answers.

56
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,117
And when she does...

57
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,287
I will be here for her.

58
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,306
Come on!

59
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,731
Move!

60
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,024
All right! All right!

61
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,071
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

62
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,531
Code three.

63
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,824
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

64
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,244
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

65
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,120
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

66
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,914
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

67
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,551
Come on.

68
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
How you doing back there?

69
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,482
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

70
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,608
I was being shot at.

71
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,902
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

72
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,196
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

73
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,865
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

74
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,919
Shouldn't you be in school?

75
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,882
Who flips off an ambulance?

76
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,216
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

77
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,718
Jesus.

78
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,345
Kids.

79
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,687
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

80
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,607
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

81
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,817
I know how
these things work, Ben.

82
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,235
Oh, do you? How do you know?

83
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,528
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

84
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,823
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

85
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,825
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

86
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,410
She's gonna be okay.

87
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,622
Who?

88
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,582
Your patient.

89
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,126
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

90
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,547
You know what,

91
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,174
Mr Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

92
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,343
Just take it.

93
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,969
Take it.

94
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,346
Just take it.

95
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,349
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

96
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,808
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,770
I'll take you in to see her.

98
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,480
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

99
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,856
I'm her stepdaughter.

100
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,525
I think she might prefer...

101
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,152
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

102
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,655
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

103
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,573
Okay.

104
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,658
Come on, buddy.

105
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:54,535
Let's go see Mommy.

106
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,412
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

107
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,248
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

108
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,585
What am I supposed
to do with this?

109
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,379
Just put it in your pocket

110
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,589
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

111
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,593
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

112
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,597
Come on.

113
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,892
We both hate family stuff.

114
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,104
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

115
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,689
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

116
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,607
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

117
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,526
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

118
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,777
You know, I might sleep in.

119
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,113
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

120
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,239
You don't have a dog.

121
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,824
I might adopt one.

122
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:34,992
Return the favour.

123
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,953
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

124
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,621
I don't know
what you're talking about.

125
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,999
I was a model foster kid.

126
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,625
I peed outside and everything.

127
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,795
So...

128
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,466
I kinda met someone.

129
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,218
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,636
What's this one's name?

131
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,145
Serious.

132
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,445
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

133
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,031
Thank you.

134
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,785
"You have
a winning personality."

135
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,078
I guess I got yours by mistake.

136
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,289
You're an asshole.

137
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,373
Here.

138
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,752
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

139
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,464
What if I don't wanna know?

140
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,757
Well, it's just a cookie.

141
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,055
"You will."

142
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,098
You will what?

143
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,810
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

144
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,396
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

145
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,275
It means that
their printer is broken.

146
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,568
We can't eat here any more.

147
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,787
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

148
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,125
You think
I can manage both of these?

149
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,210
I think so, yeah.

150
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,545
<i>We'll have it for you tomorrow.</i>

151
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,421
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheque.

152
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,257
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

153
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,341
I haven't seen him in a while.

154
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,592
Maybe we can work something out.

155
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,928
He's not
home right now, actually.

156
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,429
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.

157
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,223
But no more excuses.

158
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,724
I swear. We'll have it.

159
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,685
All right.

160
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,058
Us strays
need to stick together.

161
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,728
{\an8}Somebody's hungry.

162
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,104
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

163
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,027
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

164
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,449
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

165
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,202
MVA, three vehicles.

166
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,955
<i>One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.</i>

167
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,748
<i>Copy that. Sending backup
to your location.</i>

168
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,916
It won't open.

169
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,211
All right, sir. We're gonna
get you out of there, okay?

170
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,046
Just don't move.

171
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,131
Hi, sir.

172
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,258
Can you tell me your name?

173
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,718
Robert.

174
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,887
Robert, I'm Cassie.

175
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,930
I'm gonna help you out
today, okay?

176
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,265
You're gonna be all right.

177
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,433
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seat belt.

178
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,601
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

179
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,227
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

180
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,395
on that side, okay?

181
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,814
Three, two, one.

182
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,026
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

183
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,110
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

184
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,612
One, two, three.

185
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,032
Okay. You're gonna be okay, sir.

186
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,700
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

187
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,328
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

188
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,246
- Cassie!
- Ben!

189
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,148
<i>79 over 55.</i>

190
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,650
<i>Dial it back, I'm fine.</i>

191
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,568
<i>You need a real workup
at a real hospital.</i>

192
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.</i>

193
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,113
<i>Games!</i>

194
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,782
<i>You guys are ice-cold.</i>

195
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>Cassie!</i>

196
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,246
<i>This place has always
been a death trap.</i>

197
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,753
<i>You can't save all three!</i>

198
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,838
<i>...you can use the web</i>

199
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,799
<i>to be in more than one place
at the same time.</i>

200
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,718
<i>You are the only one
who can change the future.</i>

201
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,970
<i>No!</i>

202
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,054
<i>Cassie!</i>

203
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,514
<i>That's it, Cassie, breathe!</i>

204
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,723
Come on!

205
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,811
You're okay. You're okay.

206
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,022
Did I die?

207
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,148
Yeah.

208
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,651
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

209
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,570
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,073
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

211
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,585
You're not goin' anywhere.

212
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,170
79 over 55.

213
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,381
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

214
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,091
with a real doctor.

215
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,259
I don't need a doctor.

216
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,303
I trust you.

217
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,472
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

218
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,600
Slightly above that
of a dead fish.

219
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,772
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

220
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,984
Jump back in the water anytime.

221
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,325
You're not goin' anywhere.

222
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,035
79 over 55.

223
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,079
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

224
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,998
with a real doctor.

225
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,751
Seriously, Ben, dial it back.

226
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,919
I'm fine.

227
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,839
Wait, wait, wait. I need
to get your oxygen levels.

228
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,049
Again?

229
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,634
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,135
My O2 is 89.

231
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,263
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

232
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,642
Oh, you're right.

233
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,563
Are you okay?

234
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,940
What the hell
happened down there?

235
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,023
I'm fine.

236
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,653
I just wanna go home
and watch <i>Idol.</i>

237
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,488
Please stay where you are.

238
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,616
Wow.

239
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,493
Great apartment.

240
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,856
<i>Where's my spider?
They took my spider.</i>

241
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,867
<i>Who are you?</i>

242
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,191
No!

243
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,413
Bad dream?

244
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,622
It's not a dream.

245
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,625
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

246
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,795
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

247
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,342
The same three faces.

248
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,305
Every night, the same vision.

249
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,932
It's a curse.

250
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,976
But we all die someday.

251
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,145
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

252
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,522
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

253
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,525
you'd try to stop them.

254
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,236
Okay...

255
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:40,574
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

256
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,452
of dying over and over again.

257
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,870
And I can't escape it.

258
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,956
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

259
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,379
I will find them
and kill them first.

260
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,591
So you know who did it...

261
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,053
I mean, will do it?

262
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,265
It's always those three faces.

263
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,561
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

264
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,066
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

265
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,487
But as the years pass...

266
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,490
there have been
technological advances.

267
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,577
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

268
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,790
The kind of technology
I've heard...

269
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,709
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

270
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,310
What are you doing?

271
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,939
How are you poisoning me?

272
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,440
What's your password?

273
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,235
I can't tell you. Oh, please!

274
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,446
Is "please" your password?

275
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,868
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

276
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,327
and I'll stop the poison.

277
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:21,425
Q-9-2-0...

278
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,262
B-3-7-5.

279
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,560
Oh, God.

280
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,984
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

281
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,361
today was the day
you were going to die.

282
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,210
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

283
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,086
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

284
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,171
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

285
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,255
You know what you're doing.

286
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,798
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

287
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:02,883
Cassie!

288
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,010
- Hey!
- Hi.

289
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,887
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

290
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,680
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

291
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,475
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

292
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,019
Are you pressing the burgers?

293
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,395
I'm releasin' the fat.

294
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,730
That's called flavour, man.

295
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,398
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

296
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,775
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

297
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,611
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

298
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,737
I could use a beer?

299
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,740
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

300
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,160
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

301
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,412
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

302
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,539
That's boring.

303
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,374
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

304
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,458
No, there's...

305
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,335
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

306
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,419
It was cardiac arrest.

307
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,130
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

308
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,049
Really?

309
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,051
Dead, huh?

310
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,720
Did you see a white light or...

311
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,725
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

312
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:56,019
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

313
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,772
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

315
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,107
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

316
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,441
Yeah, they're ruined now.

317
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,860
Take that. For you, sir.

318
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,654
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

319
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,656
- We're ready to start.
- What?

320
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,991
What?

321
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,201
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

322
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,287
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

323
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,038
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

324
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,123
Have fun.

325
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,878
- ...for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

326
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,088
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

327
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,506
Okay. This is crazy.

328
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,799
Well, I couldn't decide,
so I got two.

329
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,050
Yeah, that's like...

330
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,261
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,096
Cassie Webb.

332
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,806
Thanks for having me.

333
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,101
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

334
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,728
Nice to meet you.

335
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:40,397
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

336
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,024
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

337
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:44,109
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

338
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,111
Where is it this time?

339
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,696
He's in Mumbai...

340
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,907
Shanghai... I can't keep track.

341
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,537
Never stops
leaping around in there.

342
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,622
And always hungry.

343
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,875
Does it have a name? The...

344
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:03,795
We're saving that
for one of the games.

345
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,715
- Games?
- Games!

346
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,637
Games!

347
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,806
Okay.

348
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,436
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

349
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,648
Chloe, is that you?

350
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,732
Yes.

351
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,570
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

352
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,364
It was years
before I figured that one out.

353
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,369
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

354
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:37,871
Whose is this?

355
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,542
Oh, it's mine.

356
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,628
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

357
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,590
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

358
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,761
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

359
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,597
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

360
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,849
She died.

361
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,770
But, I grew up totally healthy.

362
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,690
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

363
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,278
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

364
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,405
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

365
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:14,408
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

366
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,410
Okay, so let's...

367
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,661
let's move on to the next game.

368
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,915
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

369
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,417
Oh, yes!

370
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,294
Okay, I'll kick things off.

371
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,589
- Sam.
- Nope.

372
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,882
Steven.

373
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,884
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

374
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,594
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

375
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,057
Baby sausage?

376
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,059
Richard Junior?

377
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,436
Richard wishes.

378
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,230
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

379
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,232
Cassie... what's your guess?

380
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,823
Do that thing
where you throw it up

381
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:55,908
and catch it on the...

382
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:58,535
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

383
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,870
- Look at that.
- The name is...

384
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,336
Baby sausage?

385
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,964
Richard Junior?

386
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,257
Richard wishes.

387
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:15,636
Come on, get your hamburger.
Get your...

388
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,262
Cassie... what's your guess?

389
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,597
Put five dollars down, let's go.

390
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,349
Wait. We just did this.

391
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,059
Do that thing
where you throw it up

392
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,143
and catch it on the...

393
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,940
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

394
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,944
Sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

395
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,529
Fire down at the docks.

396
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,613
So...

397
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,492
You okay?

398
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:42,538
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

399
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,665
I got you, man.

400
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:46,500
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

401
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,210
The ones who got out, come on.
This way.

402
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,336
Get her out. Come on.

403
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,838
Grabbin' a woman on A-side here.

404
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,632
Go. Go. Go.

405
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,925
We need more pressure
in the line.

406
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,426
Keep pressure on the leg
here, okay?

407
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,638
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

408
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:00,722
Otherwise stable.

409
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,852
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

410
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,524
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

411
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,733
Let's go. Come on.

412
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,740
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

413
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,325
No, it's not safe.
The structure's unstable.

414
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,535
Hey, the people are trapped.

415
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,453
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

416
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,789
The place is
packed with explosives.

417
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,624
Industrial grade fireworks.

418
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,543
It could blow up any minute.

419
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,673
It could blow up any minute.

420
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:36,466
<i>- Cassie!</i>
- It could blow up any minute.

421
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,219
<i>Cassie!</i>

422
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,768
This place has
always been a death trap.

423
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,604
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

424
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,688
Otherwise stable.

425
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,857
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.</i>

426
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,652
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

427
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,737
Let's go. Come on.

428
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,160
I gotta get my guys in there.

429
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,328
The structure's unstable.

430
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:05,537
Hey, the people are trapped.

431
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,748
The place is
packed with explosives.

432
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,166
Industrial grade fireworks.

433
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,584
This place has
always been a death trap.

434
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,961
Cassie! Cassie.

435
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,713
I need you at the triage.

436
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,340
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

437
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,258
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

438
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,177
He's stable. Ready to transport.

439
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,970
Yeah, copy that. We need
every able body down here.

440
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,055
You're gonna be okay.

441
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,765
Stabilise the head while
I get the longboard set up.

442
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,850
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

443
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,101
Copy that.

444
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,353
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

445
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,979
Will you let me drive?

446
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,147
What are you talking about?

447
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,108
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

448
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,443
Cassie, I need you over here.

449
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,071
Will you just let me drive?

450
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,240
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

451
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,951
I don't think
that's what's happening.

452
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,788
Don't let it
mess with your head.

453
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,915
Cassie, come on!

454
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,093
<i>This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.</i>

455
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,177
<i>Headed back...</i>

456
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,328
O'Neil, come on.

457
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,917
Come on. O'Neil.

458
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:35,419
Come on!

459
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,505
Let's get it! Come on, let's go!

460
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,757
Wake up!

461
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,135
O'Neil, come on.

462
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,928
<i>Did you see a white light or...</i>

463
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,305
<i>O'Neil, come on.</i>

464
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,932
<i>Cassie! Cassie!</i>

465
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,145
Come on. Come back.

466
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,939
Come on, come on.

467
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,650
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

468
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,777
It's all right. It's okay.

469
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,655
It's okay. Okay?

470
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,074
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

471
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,697
So, was it worth the trouble?

472
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,241
The scale
of the NSA surveillance

473
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,700
is unprecedented.

474
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,494
They can access everything.

475
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,288
There's nowhere to hide.

476
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,623
That's the idea.

477
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,875
The potential is infinite.

478
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,086
It's intoxicating.

479
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,506
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

480
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,133
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

481
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,927
It's gonna change everything.

482
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,056
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

483
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,141
before they get their powers.

484
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,018
This is what
they look like in your visions

485
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,436
as well as you can recollect.

486
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,940
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

487
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,234
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

488
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:25,612
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

489
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,615
Here's what
they should look like now.

490
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,122
They're younger than I thought.

491
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,667
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

492
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,503
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

493
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,256
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

494
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,675
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

495
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,344
I will not give up
everything I've built...

496
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,054
and have my life cut short.

497
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:55,893
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

498
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,352
go to a museum...

499
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,979
get money from an ATM...

500
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,064
wherever they are
in the world...

501
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,358
Find them.

502
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,569
I pay you a fortune.

503
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,279
Yeah, I'll find them.

504
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,117
Still no blurriness.

505
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,785
No double vision.

506
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:14,995
No discolouration at all.

507
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,290
Your eyesight is good,

508
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,125
and all your other vitals
check out.

509
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,795
But what about the visions?

510
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,798
How am I seeing that stuff?

511
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,468
Sometimes when
we experience trauma,

512
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,011
it can have a lasting effect.

513
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,930
This isn't trauma.

514
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,723
I knew he was gonna die.

515
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,184
I saw it.

516
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,977
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

517
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,521
from your other consultations.

518
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,399
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

519
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,943
The scan showed
no abnormalities.

520
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,778
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

521
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,738
but I don't understand
what's happening.

522
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,990
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

523
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,450
Get some rest.

524
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,618
Watch old movies.

525
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,328
If you still have concerns,

526
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:58,539
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

527
00:33:58,914 --> 00:33:59,915
But I'm sure

528
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,792
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

529
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:07,089
<i>I am in the presence</i>

530
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,841
<i>of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.</i>

531
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,553
<i>And you're going to show me
shadows of things</i>

532
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,847
<i>that have not yet happened
but will happen.</i>

533
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,766
<i>Spirit of the Future,</i>

534
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,060
<i>I fear you more than
any other spectre I've seen.</i>

535
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,022
<i>But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.</i>

536
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,482
<i>I cannot change.</i>

537
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,275
<i>Whose funeral
were they talking about?</i>

538
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:34,366
<i>Hey, Cass, it's me again. Ben.</i>

539
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,743
<i>I know you're there.
Just pick up.</i>

540
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,495
<i>I ought to be there
this time of day.</i>

541
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:43,083
<i>Okay, well, O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.</i>

542
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,376
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

543
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,588
<i>I know it's the last place
you wanna be...</i>

544
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:50,716
<i>but it would help Susan
if you came.</i>

545
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,676
<i>It might help you too.</i>

546
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,678
<i>Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

547
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:56,889
<i>Cassie?</i>

548
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,183
<i>Cass?</i>

549
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,774
<i>Before I draw
nearer to that stone,</i>

550
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,109
<i>answer me one question.</i>

551
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,987
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be...</i>

552
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,616
<i>or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

553
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,409
Hate to break it to you,
Scrooge...

554
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,996
but you can't change anything.

555
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,868
<i>Are these the shadows of things
that must be?</i>

556
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,163
<i>Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

557
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,881
This isn't gonna
change anything.

558
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,489
Guess you didn't die after all.

559
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:07,728
<i>Please keep all
personal belongings with you</i>

560
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:08,854

Come on, guys. This way.

562
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,986
Come on. Let's go down the ramp.

563
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,154
Yeah, awesome.

564
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,380
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

565
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:39,051
<i>...New Haven now ready.

onto the platform.

569

She's on her own.

570
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:51,939
Julia Cornwall is
on the concourse, also alone.

<i>...find a member
of the MTA staff.</i>

572
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,361
And Martha Franklin.

573
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:00,781
Shit.

574
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,865
What are the odds of them

575
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,492
all being in the same place
at the same time?

576
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:04,952
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

577
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,746
<i>There must be something
that connects them.</i>

578
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:08,956
Or...

579
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,625
something that will.

588
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,561

Oh, my God.

Get off the train.
Come on.

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,506
My mom told me
never to talk to strangers.

- Hey, give me that back!

Hey, give me that back!

- Well...

This woman's
trying to abduct us!

00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,260
What?
No, that's not... That's...

Shh. That's...

That's your emergency. That.

631
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,859
Is anybody else seeing this?

- That man is trying to kill you.
- And how do you...

633
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:49,862
- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

634
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,241
We don't have
tickets for this train.

635
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:55,659
That's your biggest concern?

636
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,161
<i>Please stand clear

Okay.

<i>No! Help!</i>

00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:33,864
Holy shit.

Run!

There's an emergency exit
to the street that way.

652
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:00,641
Go.

653
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,142
Hey, help. Over here.

654
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,435
I've never been so happy
to see cops.

655
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:04,645
You guys
need to call for backup.

656
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:06,730
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

657
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,814
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

658
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:08,899
No. You don't understand.

659
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,567
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

660
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,818
You're safe.

661
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,321
Run! Go!

662
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:15,822
Run!

663
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,329
Run! Run!

664
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,747
Go! Go! Go!

665
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,439
Come on.

666
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:54,570
- Get in.
- What?

667
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,654
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

668
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:56,738
Thank you so much.
This is for you.

669
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:57,948
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move. Slide over.

670
00:44:57,948 --> 00:44:59,658
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

671
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,494
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

672
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,788
That guy was nuts. Do you guys
think he killed those cops?

673
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,582
He could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

674
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,417
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

675
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:09,751
There's not enough
frictional force

676
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,253
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

677
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:12,337
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

678
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,381
- What the hell is going on?
- ...much less the ceiling.

679
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,841
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

680
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,925
so what good is it?

681
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,094
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

682
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,721
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

683
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,723
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

684
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:23,849
Your voices are, like,

685
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:25,559
drilling in the centre
of my skull...

686
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,643
and I need to think.

687
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,194
I'm Cassie. Okay?

688
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:36,320
What are your names?

689
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:38,238
What are your names?

690
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,364
I'm Julia Cornwall.

691
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,867
My dad lives here in New York,

692
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,202
and my mom lives
back in LA, but...

693
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:44,828
We don't need
your whole life story.

694
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,916
I'm Anya Corazón.

695
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,584
Mattie Franklin.

696
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,920
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

697
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,004
I'm not... That's not...

698
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,547
That's not
what's happening here.

699
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:58,342
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

700
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,385
Your parents can handle this.

701
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,137
My parents
are on a business trip.

702
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,931
Yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

703
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,266
- My dad is busy working, so...
- Oh, my God.

704
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,518
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

705
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:08,977
Well, where do
your friends live?

706
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,062
- I'll drop you off first.
<i>- ...are asking</i>

707
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,231
<i>for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest</i>

708
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:15,359
<i>seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...</i>

709
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,944
<i>at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.</i>

710
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,946
That's great. Good.

711
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:22,658
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

712
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,785
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

713
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,161
<i>She is also the same person</i>

714
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,287
<i>police are
seeking to question...</i>

715
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:28,372
<i>in the possible abduction...</i>

716
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:30,457
- She?
<i>- ...of the three teenage girls.</i>

717
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:33,293
<i>Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.</i>

718
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,753
<i>The public has been asked
for any information...</i>

719
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:35,838
What?

720
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,047
<i>...and to keep an eye out
for these girls.</i>

721
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,967
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

722
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,093
And he was
crawling on the ceiling.

723
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:42,177
What about that guy?

724
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:43,762
I mean, you saw. I...

725
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:44,972
No one saw ceiling guy.

726
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,515
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

727
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:48,016
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

728
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,560
I didn't know
what was happening.

729
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,769
Okay, guys.

730
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,188
My uncle, Jonah, can totally
help us. I'm gonna call him.

731
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,690
You have a phone?

732
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,483
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

733
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,026
No, you can't...

734
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,487
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

735
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,780
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

736
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,031
What is your problem?

737
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,116
- What do you mean?
- Please.

738
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:05,701
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay.

739
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,287
Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

740
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,788
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

741
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,290
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

742
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,126
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

743
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,170
because you guys
are the only ones

744
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,713
that know
what actually happened.

745
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,635
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

746
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:26,096
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

747
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,307
And...

748
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:30,726
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

749
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:35,522
You know...

750
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,276
This is still not a kidnapping.

751
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:40,819
Okay?

752
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,488
Feels like a kidnapping.

753
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:47,659
How did they get away?

754
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,870
It's like
they knew I was coming.

755
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,456
<i>No hits at the train station,
bus depot,</i>

756
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,665
<i>or any of the bridges.</i>

757
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,126
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

758
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,378
<i>The police don't have
this technology.</i>

759
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,590
<i>You have access
to every camera in the city.</i>

760
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,674
<i>We should be ahead of them.</i>

761
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:06,303
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

762
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,263
Use them better.

763
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,766
I've always
wanted to be a Girl Scout.

764
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:11,850
Of course you did.

765
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:14,686
Anybody else starving?

766
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,271
All I have is gum.

767
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:20,484
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

768
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,861
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

769
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,112
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

770
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:27,074
Okay, I hope you're
good at catching squirrels.

771
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,577
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

772
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,663
I told you, I don't know.

773
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:34,039
I've never seen him before.

774
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:35,123
Then how did you know
he was coming?

775
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:36,208
Oh, my God.

776
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,002
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

777
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:41,296
I don't know.

778
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,924
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

779
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,968
Stop asking me. Okay?

780
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,053
Wait. You're the paramedic.

781
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:50,848
You saved my stepmother,

782
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:52,850
then you were
super awkward about it.

783
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:57,521
That does sound like me.

784
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,731
Wait. I recognise you too.

785
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,024
What?

786
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:03,193
Yeah. You live in my building.

787
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,946
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

788
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,990
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

789
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,617
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

790
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,411
You don't think this is weird?

791
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,663
That we both know you?

792
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:15,747
It's honestly, like,

793
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,958
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

794
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:22,588
What?

795
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,091
Total stranger.

796
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:28,719
No.

797
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:30,971
You flipped me off.

798
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,140
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

799
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,933
You guys, this is so freaky.

800
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:37,186
Who are you? What is going on?

801
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,648
I can see the future.

802
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,109
Kind of.

803
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,116
I mean...

804
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:53,785
What the hell?

805
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,871
See? She didn't see that coming.

806
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:57,956
It doesn't work like that.

807
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,209
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

808
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,377
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

809
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:04,379
did you see us...

810
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,924
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

811
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:10,093
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

812
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,679
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

813
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,932
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

814
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:18,477
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

815
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,230
So, you're welcome.

816
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:24,608
How does it work?

817
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:28,529
It just happens.

818
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,489
Can you do it now?

819
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:33,200
I can't control it.

820
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,245
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

821
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:37,788
No, he can't.

822
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:40,707
He was using his hands.

823
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,626
Why are you like this?

824
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:45,045
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

825
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,005
It was like a spider...

826
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:49,633
person.

827
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,436
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

828
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,731
Where are you going?

829
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,734
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

830
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,529
You can't just leave us here.

831
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:12,781
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

832
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:14,741
Yeah, sure. Just three teenagers
alone in the woods.

833
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,910
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

834
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,121
You are way safer out here.

835
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:23,834
Just, you know,
be like a Girl Scout girl.

836
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,878
Be that. Just be that.

837
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,046
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

838
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,131
Cassie.

839
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,218
Can we trust you?

840
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,597
Three hours. Okay?

841
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:39,850
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

842
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,482
Seriously. Don't do dumb things.

843
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,112
She was talking to you.

844
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,281
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

845
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,706
I know tae kwon do.

846
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:04,374
You?

847
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,544
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

848
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:08,921
when my parents were divorcing.

849
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:12,299
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

850
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:18,931
That's what I thought.

851
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:33,755
One second, cat.

852
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,260
Come on.

853
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,766
Research on Amazonian spiders...

854
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,729
peptides, more peptides.

855
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,189
Come on. Where is it?

856
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:53,984
Spider people.

857
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,195
<i>Las Arañas.</i>

858
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,573
Have you ever heard
of <i>Las Arañas?</i>

859
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:02,284
Me neither.

860
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:07,164
"According to local folklore...

861
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:12,002
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

862
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:16,924
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

863
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,219
"and they can
climb like spiders."

864
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:23,889
Just like ceiling guy.

865
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,855
How would you know...

866
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:35,817
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

867
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,170
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

868
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,307
<i>"Las Arañas</i> are said to possess
a sixth sense...

869
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,519
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

870
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,701
Oh, my God.

871
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,846
Hey, who's got the jerky?

872
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:46,930
You ate it all.

873
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,266
I had, like, three pieces.

874
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,476
- Out of five.
- You counted?

875
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,520
You also ate all mine.

876
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,566
- What's this?
- Stop.

877
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:58,817
Stop. Just...

878
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:00,944
Jeez.

879
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:04,615
Okay, forget jerky.

880
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:07,993
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

881
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:09,453
Let's just go there
and get real food.

882
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,955
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

883
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:13,165
She bailed on us.

884
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,375
We don't have any money, genius.

885
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,211
Well, I have money, so...

886
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,546
You have money
so we should do what you want?

887
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,256
You got something to say?

888
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:24,760
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

889
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,428
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

890
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:28,722
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

891
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,724
So sad about Martha Stewart.

892
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:35,521
My parents are in Beijing...

893
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:36,855
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

894
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,857
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

895
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:41,068
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

896
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:42,528
So...

897
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:43,904
I talk to them on Mondays.

898
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,113
So who do you live with?

899
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,199
The housekeeper.

900
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:51,036
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

901
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,622
I bet you have
your own room at least.

902
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,417
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

903
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,753
- What about your mom?
- She's...

904
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:02,506
not really around.

905
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,882
She bailed on you?

906
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,052
Right. So, diner?

907
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,180
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

908
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,265
Yay.

909
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:13,433
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

910
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,437
Julia, you in?

911
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,399
Hey.

912
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:22,067
We have
to take care of ourselves.

913
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:30,576
Yeah.

914
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:33,912
You're right.

915
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:36,748
Let's go do this.

916
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:40,419
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

917
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,670
I heard that.

918
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,799
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

919
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,593
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

920
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,012
Who says we like you now?

921
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:52,931
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

922
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:58,687
Shit.

923
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,105
Do you think there's ticks?

924
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:02,983
Can we walk

925
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:04,693
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

926
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,612
You said this was a shortcut.

927
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:08,822
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

928
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,200
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah. Actually, I do.

929
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:15,287
Ow! Shit!

930
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,543
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

931
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:23,128
We're in the middle of nowhere.

932
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:24,546
No one's gonna
track us down here.

933
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,340
Just don't make eye contact.

934
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,592
I hope they have cherry pie.

935
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,854
Let's sit at the bar.

936
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:48,946
There you go.

937
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,448
Here.

938
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,117
Should we make a game plan?

939
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,328
Eat first, strategise later.

940
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,124
Okay. Here you go.

941
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:05,045
Keep it coming.

942
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,882
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

943
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,425
Absolutely, great idea.

944
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,510
Right after cherry pie.

945
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:15,097
No. No cherry pie.

946
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,768
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

947
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:23,522
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

948
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:26,316
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

949
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,193
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

950
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,611
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

951
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:37,369
We should go over there
and talk to them.

952
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:39,037
Really?

953
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,915
No. We...

954
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,500
Should we? We can't.

955
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,377
Come on. You know you want to.

956
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,461
No.

957
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,131
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

958
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,424
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

959
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:51,800
Just hold on a second.

960
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,926
What is this?

961
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,011
Do you want the Reuben?

962
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:57,472
{\an8}It's just
a little confidence boost.

963
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:59,183
This isn't really my style.

964
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:02,436
So what? You look cute. Come on.

965
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,938
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

966
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:06,648
Okay.

967
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:08,150
Hi. Hey, guys.

968
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,943
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

969
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:11,320
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

970
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,821
We've been
saving these seats for you.

971
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,031
Awesome.

972
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,408
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

973
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,492
Nice to meet you too.

974
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:18,577
<i>...for your information.</i>

975
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:20,370
<i>Can you just
confirm your location?</i>

976
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,831
<i>4 Star Diner.
Daves Road, Route 206.</i>

977
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:23,957
- Hey.
<i>- Church Hill, New Jersey.</i>

978
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,168
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

979
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:28,253
<i>Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.</i>

980
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:30,172
Yeah. Patching you in now.

981
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:42,851
2-2-3 dispatch.
On scene at 4 Star Diner.

982
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,478
Route 206 at Daves Road.

983
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:45,854
<i>Go ahead, 2-2-3.</i>

984
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,356
No need to send backup.

985
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:51,485
These aren't
our missing persons.

986
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,780
Code four. Repeat.

987
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,241
These are not
our missing persons.

988
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:08,794
Girls!

989
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,388
Girls!

990
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:25,269
Oh, God damn it.

991
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,288
Girls!

992
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:54,631
Let's go. Let's go!

993
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:56,842
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

994
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:57,926
I know you know the words.

995
01:01:57,926 --> 01:01:59,928
- Come on, get up here.
- You should get up there.

996
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:01,847
So much
for not attracting attention.

997
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,650
No. Please. Please, stop.

998
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,235
Don't touch me, okay?

999
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,570
Can you...

1000
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,739
What are you doing?

1001
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:19,948
- What are you...
- What is that?

1002
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:21,366
We have to go.

1003
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:26,163
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:30,000
Get down!

1005
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:32,961
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

1006
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:34,087
You left us.

1007
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:36,757
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,845
Julia!

1009
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:43,972
Julia, get back!

1010
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:56,235
Come on!

1011
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:57,444
No! Mattie!

1012
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,571
No.

1013
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,453
<i>This track is going to be huge.</i>

1014
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:50,747
<i>Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.</i>

1015
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:55,627
Let's try that again.

1016
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,849
I love this song.

1017
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:13,353
Guys.

1018
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:16,148
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

1019
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,654
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

1020
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,157
Right. Okay.

1021
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,250
Oh, my God. Come on.

1022
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:40,589
Seriously, dude.

1023
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:52,893
Come on. Let's go.

1024
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:54,811
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1025
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:55,938
I know you know the words.

1026
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:57,814
Come on, get up here.

1027
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,192
Hey!

1028
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:01,527
You should totally
get up there, dog.

1029
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,320
Come on.

1030
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:14,414
Hey!

1031
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,462
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

1032
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:30,889
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

1033
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:32,432
Leave everything. Run!

1034
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,935
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

1035
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:36,645
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

1036
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,373
God!

1037
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:00,961
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

1038
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:03,297
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

1039
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:05,424
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

1040
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:06,508
and you don't listen!

1041
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:07,885
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

1042
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,052
Don't even say anything!

1043
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:10,888
God!

1044
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,182
Your futures were almost...

1045
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:15,100
so different.

1046
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,687
You're lucky I saw them.

1047
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:19,897
I'm so sorry.

1048
01:06:19,897 --> 01:06:20,981
Yes.

1049
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:25,068
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

1050
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:28,405
God!

1051
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,847
Amaria, where did they go?

1052
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,724
<i>I'm running checks now.</i>

1053
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:58,727
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

1054
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,521
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

1055
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,314
I'm not interested in her.

1056
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,650
Focus on finding those girls.

1057
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,984
Cassandra Webb.

1058
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:08,904
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

1059
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:10,656
Did you say, "Webb"?

1060
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:13,450
Yeah. Do you know her?

1061
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,952
That's not possible.

1062
01:07:17,538 --> 01:07:18,539
Come on.

1063
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:25,295
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

1064
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:29,258
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

1065
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,053
But you can see the future.

1066
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,473
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

1067
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,392
I don't know
how to control them.

1068
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:40,477
It's useless.

1069
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:42,354
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

1070
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:43,814
Is your hand okay?

1071
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:46,567
It's fine.

1072
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:53,699
First thing in the morning,
I'm taking you all home.

1073
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,492
Your parents can deal with this.

1074
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:57,995
No, they can't.

1075
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:03,292
My mom's in a psych ward.

1076
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,421
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

1077
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:10,215
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

1078
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,009
and I don't think
that they want me there.

1079
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:17,221
I wondered if they missed me...

1080
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:20,142
if I ran away.

1081
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:22,895
So you did.

1082
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:24,938
My parents aren't around either.

1083
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:28,233
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

1084
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:29,818
I don't think they're gonna

1085
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:31,236
fly back from China
to deal with this.

1086
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:33,322
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

1087
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,032
I'm on my own.

1088
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,912
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

1089
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:42,915
- go to the police.
- No.

1090
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,129
My dad got deported
six months ago.

1091
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,424
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

1092
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:53,966
What about your mom?

1093
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:55,844
My mom died when I was five.

1094
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:57,513
It's just me and my dad.

1095
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,390
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

1096
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,392
So, I've just been
living by myself

1097
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:03,644
at our apartment since then.

1098
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:04,728
You're on your own?

1099
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:08,439
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

1100
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:11,859
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

1101
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,198
So, I can't go to the police.

1102
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,283
Okay?

1103
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:21,161
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

1104
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:24,790
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

1105
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:27,209
Or going into the foster system.

1106
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,087
Well...

1107
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:34,966
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

1108
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:40,471
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

1109
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,015
Right.

1110
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,812
Cassie, please help us.

1111
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:11,582
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

1112
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,542
You won't be so lucky next time.

1113
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,878
Why are you doing this?

1114
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,672
I need to stop them
from killing me.

1115
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:22,301
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

1116
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,553
In the future,
they become much more.

1117
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:28,849
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

1118
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,060
Those girls cannot exist.

1119
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,563
How come you get to decide?

1120
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:37,024
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

1121
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,448
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

1122
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:47,492
Would I?

1123
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:50,787
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

1124
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,539
The only thing I know is that,

1125
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,833
in the future,
they also have powers.

1126
01:12:56,877 --> 01:13:00,214
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

1127
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:02,549
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

1128
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,469
Your mother underestimated me.

1129
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:08,680
The power of the spider.

1130
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,558
Don't make the same mistake.

1131
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,143
Tell me where they are!

1132
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,062
They don't mean anything to you.

1133
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,148
You could just walk away.

1134
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:15,622
What is this?

1135
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,211
Rise and shine.

1136
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:24,256
Okay, so this guy's hands

1137
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:26,925
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

1138
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,553
and it is painful. I was lucky.

1139
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,180
The longer he holds on to you,

1140
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,348
the more poison
gets into your system.

1141
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:34,433
Then what happens?

1142
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:37,186
Then your heart stops.

1143
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,815
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

1144
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:45,527
So you interlock your hands
like this.

1145
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:47,571
You lock your elbows...

1146
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,240
and then you place
the heel of your hand

1147
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,576
right on the sternum. Okay?

1148
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:53,660
And then you pump.

1149
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,996
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

1150
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:59,208
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

1151
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,918
You ready?

1152
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:03,128
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

1153
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,507
Okay. And when do I stop?

1154
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,342
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

1155
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:10,636
And if you get tired,

1156
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:12,346
then you need
somebody to take over.

1157
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,431
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

1158
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,600
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mmm-hmm.

1159
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,561
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1160
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:20,646
- Yeah.
- Ready?

1161
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:21,980
- Yep.
- And go.

1162
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:27,402
Great. Nice, Mattie.

1163
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:28,487
Not cool.

1164
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,075
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

1165
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:35,285
Get ready.

1166
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:40,541
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

1167
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,917
Nice job, Anya.

1168
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:46,630
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

1169
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:48,715
but you're a good teacher.

1170
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:54,847
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

1171
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:58,350
About my mom.

1172
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:06,441
Wait, so you do know this guy.

1173
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,652
My mom did. I think.

1174
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:09,987
That's her.

1175
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:11,363
She's really pretty.

1176
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,494
So this is because of you?

1177
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:22,791
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

1178
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,627
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

1179
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:30,465
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

1180
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,259
What kind of crazy stuff?

1181
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,637
Climb like spiders.

1182
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:39,975
So is he one of them?

1183
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,394
I need more information.

1184
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:47,191
You're leaving.

1185
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:53,405
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

1186
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:54,907
How?

1187
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,286
You have to go to Peru.

1188
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:03,749
I'll be gone a week.

1189
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:04,833
I don't wanna leave them,

1190
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,251
but he's out there
looking for them...

1191
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,336
and they're relying on me,

1192
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:08,712
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

1193
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:11,089
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

1194
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,299
while Richard's out of town.

1195
01:17:12,299 --> 01:17:14,510
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

1196
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:18,430
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

1197
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,891
Just be careful, okay?

1198
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:22,226
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1199
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,311
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

1200
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,230
Okay, well, neither did you.

1201
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:55,838
You have come back
looking for answers.

1202
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:00,884
Back?

1203
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:03,053
I promised your mother
I would be here.

1204
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,017
My mom thought
<i>Las Arañas</i> were a myth.

1205
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:10,310
What do you think?

1206
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,021
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

1207
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,523
She came here

1208
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:17,401
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

1209
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:19,528
She thought
she was being protected.

1210
01:20:19,528 --> 01:20:20,821
By Ezekiel Sims?

1211
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:22,823
His motives were selfish.

1212
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,700
He used your mom to find us.

1213
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,410
But, because
he stole the spider...

1214
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:27,619
he was cursed.

1215
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:31,331
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1216
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:39,840
This is where my mom died?

1217
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:42,342
And where you were born.

1218
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:51,101
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

1219
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,229
To see the future clearly...

1220
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,523
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

1221
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:57,649
That sounds like literally

1222
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,068
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

1223
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:02,613
You have to go
back to your beginning

1224
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:03,989
and keep going past that.

1225
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,115
There are powers

1226
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,367
you don't even know
you're capable of.

1227
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:11,663
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1228
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,543
Do you trust me?

1229
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:20,923
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

1230
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:30,807
<i>You could just walk away.</i>

1231
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:33,393
<i>Your thread did not start
when you were born.</i>

1232
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:36,563
<i>They're almost
impossible to find.</i>

1233
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,900
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1234
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,193
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

1235
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:42,694
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

1236
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,863
Why did you hate me so much?

1237
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:45,948
Thank you.

1238
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,282
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1239
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:49,701
<i>- Give it to me.
- No.</i>

1240
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,453
I found it.

1241
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:52,538
I found the spider.

1242
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,831
Incredible, isn't it?

1243
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,836
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

1244
01:21:58,836 --> 01:21:59,920
Give it to me.

1245
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,004
<i>You're making
the wrong decision.</i>

1246
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,756
- You could just walk away.
<i>- No, you're making the wrong...</i>

1247
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:18,021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

1248
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:21,483
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1249
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:25,445
Las Arañas <i>could not stand by.</i>

1250
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:28,156
<i>We tried to save you both.</i>

1251
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:48,010
Her journey will not be easy...

1252
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:50,554
but she is strong.

1253
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:01,773
Your test results came back.

1254
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:02,941
I'm sorry to tell you

1255
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:05,611
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

1256
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:08,697
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

1257
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,490
<i>But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.</i>

1258
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:13,285
Life expectancy varies.

1259
01:23:13,285 --> 01:23:15,120
Do you need a tissue?

1260
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,914
No. No. I need a cure.

1261
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:19,499
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1262
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:22,169
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

1263
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,087
<i>It's experimental...</i>

1264
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,590
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

1265
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,300
That's why you went there?

1266
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,801
For me?

1267
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:32,304
I have to advise you against
travelling in your condition.

1268
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:35,390
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

1269
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,309
I know this is hard to accept.

1270
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:38,894
No, no, I am...

1271
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:42,981
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

1272
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:46,318
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

1273
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:56,954
You did it.

1274
01:23:58,830 --> 01:23:59,915
You did it.

1275
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,293
I never knew I was sick.

1276
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:06,505
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

1277
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:11,927
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1278
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:58,849
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

1279
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,187
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1280
01:25:07,191 --> 01:25:09,484
I was there.
I was in the room...

1281
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:12,529
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

1282
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:13,989
<i>You</i> did that.

1283
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:17,034
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

1284
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:20,120
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

1285
01:25:20,913 --> 01:25:23,248
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

1286
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,836
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1287
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,923
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1288
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:32,633
But I can't do what he can do.

1289
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:37,179
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

1290
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,224
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

1291
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,643
or the ability
to release poison...

1292
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:47,439
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

1293
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,234
Your mind
has infinite potential.

1294
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:53,654
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

1295
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:56,823
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

1296
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,619
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1297
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,289
And when you take on
the responsibility...

1298
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:07,668
great power will come.

1299
01:26:24,935 --> 01:26:26,186
Every day that goes by,

1300
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:28,605
my appointment with death
gets closer.

1301
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,650
And you still
have found nothing?

1302
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:33,235
How can she have kept

1303
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,445
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1304
01:26:35,445 --> 01:26:37,364
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

1305
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:39,241
scanning CCTV camera.

1306
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:40,325
I have hacked

1307
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,160
police and emergency services
frequencies.

1308
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,162
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

1309
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:46,123
including friends and family.

1310
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,084
Still nothing.

1311
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,170
Do you understand?

1312
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:53,547
Huh?

1313
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,757
Those girls cannot exist.

1314
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,551
They will try to destroy me,

1315
01:26:57,551 --> 01:27:00,345
as I will you
if you don't find them.

1316
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:03,557
She can't hide them forever.

1317
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,189
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there.

1318
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:12,774
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

1319
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:14,610
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

1320
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:15,694
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

1321
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:16,904
- after ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

1322
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:18,071
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

1323
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:19,198
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

1324
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:20,574
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

1325
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,201
- is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

1326
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:24,077
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

1327
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:26,038
or my water broke.

1328
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:29,499
Ew!

1329
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,126
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

1330
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:32,961
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

1331
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,046
Richard's not here,

1332
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:36,840
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

1333
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,301
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

1334
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:40,594
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1335
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:43,931
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for...

1336
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,141
the ambulance.

1337
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,227
The baby is not waiting.

1338
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:50,521
He's coming now.

1339
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:51,605
Now.

1340
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:54,441
Like, here? In the dining room?

1341
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:57,236
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1342
01:27:57,236 --> 01:27:58,320
Okay.

1343
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:01,657
Get in the car.

1344
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:06,328
Keep your head down.

1345
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:11,750
It's gonna be okay.

1346
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:14,044
Okay. Come on.

1347
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:15,128
Okay, okay.

1348
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:19,091
Everyone okay?

1349
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,051
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

1350
01:28:21,635 --> 01:28:22,636
Seriously?

1351
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,471
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1352
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:25,681
Never mind.

1353
01:28:29,643 --> 01:28:31,562
All right, let's step on it.

1354
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:51,331
<i>10-58 in progress. 30-relo-5.</i>

1355
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:52,416
I might have something.

1356
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:53,667
<i>Woman in labour.</i>

1357
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:56,420
<i>20-Edward copy. En route.</i>

1358
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,671
<i>- 13-Edward, go ahead.
- 10-4.</i>

1359
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:58,797
<i>Possible D&D in progress.</i>

1360
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:02,342
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

1361
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:03,427
St Timothy's.

1362
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:04,678
Track the route.

1363
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:05,762
Tracking.

1364
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,801
<i>The baby is not waiting.</i>

1365
01:29:44,801 --> 01:29:46,470
<i>...doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...</i>

1366
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,554
<i>Get out, get out, get out!</i>

1367
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:48,931
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!</i>

1368
01:29:49,306 --> 01:29:50,307
<i>What? What?</i>

1369
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,100
<i>Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!</i>

1370
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,185
Shit!

1371
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:06,365
Sorry, guys.

1372
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,577
Hey!

1373
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:16,208
Thank you.

1374
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:23,173
So the last one was

1375
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,884
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

1376
01:30:26,844 --> 01:30:27,845
So that means

1377
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:30,848
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

1378
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:33,559
21.6 seconds.

1379
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,603
That's pretty fast.

1380
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,981
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

1381
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:40,065
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

1382
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,609
<i>He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.</i>

1383
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:45,195
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

1384
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:46,905
Drive faster.

1385
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,366
Let's go. Let's go, please.

1386
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,501
Hack into traffic control.

1387
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:01,712
<i>Turn the lights green.</i>

1388
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:04,923
<i>Amaria, now.</i>

1389
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:06,717
Turning all traffic lights
to green.

1390
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:11,513
Why is no one stopping? Hey!

1391
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:12,848
Ben, watch out!

1392
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:15,726
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

1393
01:31:16,018 --> 01:31:17,144
Whoa, whoa.

1394
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:18,937
Ben!

1395
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:22,816
Everyone okay?

1396
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:23,901
Yeah.

1397
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:25,277
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1398
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:26,361
I'm fine.

1399
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,784
What is that?

1400
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,415
Oh, my God, it's him.

1401
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,167
Guys.

1402
01:31:52,846 --> 01:31:54,139
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

1403
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:55,349
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

1404
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:27,798
Cassie!

1405
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:29,883
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

1406
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:31,426
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

1407
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:34,721
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

1408
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:37,099
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

1409
01:32:37,099 --> 01:32:38,475
Well, what about you?

1410
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:41,228
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

1411
01:33:04,376 --> 01:33:05,502
You're showing off.

1412
01:33:06,628 --> 01:33:07,629
Not yet.

1413
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:09,923
I think we lost him.

1414
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,222
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

1415
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:19,016
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

1416
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,145
Okay, press "charge."

1417
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:24,855
Am I having a heart attack?

1418
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:26,940
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

1419
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,483
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

1420
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:29,735
Hey, man!

1421
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,445
Okay, get ready.

1422
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:34,740
Get it close to the ceiling.

1423
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,742
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

1424
01:33:38,202 --> 01:33:39,536
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

1425
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,249
Wait. Wait.

1426
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,376
Now.

1427
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,968
Sorry.

1428
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:56,178
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1429
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:57,554
- You okay?
- You okay?

1430
01:34:00,182 --> 01:34:01,183
Okay.

1431
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:03,519
Now you're showing off.

1432
01:34:04,394 --> 01:34:05,395
Maybe a little.

1433
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,301
Now what?

1434
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:38,637
<i>Those girls cannot exist.</i>

1435
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:40,222
<i>- ...doesn't look safe.
- It's a death trap.</i>

1436
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:41,515
<i>...infinite potential.</i>

1437
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:43,934
<i>This place has
always been a death trap.</i>

1438
01:34:43,934 --> 01:34:45,310
<i>...packed with explosives.</i>

1439
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:46,603
<i>Get down!</i>

1440
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:49,731
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1441
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:52,734
<i>Jump! Come on!</i>

1442
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:53,944
<i>Get in the helicopter.</i>

1443
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:04,663
I have a code 30. PD-36-307.

1444
01:35:04,663 --> 01:35:07,666
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

1445
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:09,668
<i>Copy that.</i>

1446
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:11,128
Okay.

1447
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:16,717
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1448
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:18,218
It's already crazy.

1449
01:35:18,677 --> 01:35:19,887
You didn't bail on us.

1450
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:21,763
Whatever happens,

1451
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:23,432
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1452
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,517
We'll protect each other.

1453
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:26,643
Yeah, we're in this together.

1454
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:28,353
Right?

1455
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:29,813
Yeah.

1456
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:32,566
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

1457
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:35,611
I know. It's not cool.

1458
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:37,070
Let's go. Out the back.

1459
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:38,280
- What?
- Go, go, go.

1460
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:50,792
This doesn't look safe.

1461
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:53,795
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1462
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:55,714
That doesn't <i>sound</i> safe.

1463
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:57,341
It's a death trap.

1464
01:35:58,175 --> 01:35:59,718
And that's a good thing?

1465
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:01,637
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

1466
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:04,598
No matter what happens...

1467
01:36:04,598 --> 01:36:07,100
we need to work together, okay?

1468
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:10,729
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

1469
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:12,606
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1470
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,441
Are we ready?

1471
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:22,741
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

1472
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:25,077
Here. Take these.

1473
01:36:25,077 --> 01:36:27,412
Put them in
as many crates as you can.

1474
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:33,418
Okay?

1475
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:35,796
You two, go that way.

1476
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:37,589
We need to slow him down.

1477
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:39,925
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

1478
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:46,723
I got this one.

1479
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:48,642
Come on, Julia. Let's go.

1480
01:37:01,363 --> 01:37:02,447
Anya, go.

1481
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,202
Go.

1482
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:21,175
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

1483
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:28,056
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

1484
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:31,727
Now!

1485
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,607
Whoa!

1486
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:37,691
Go! Run!

1487
01:37:38,984 --> 01:37:40,402
Now you're really showing off.

1488
01:37:40,903 --> 01:37:42,112
Come on, upstairs.

1489
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,042
I knew. I knew she had a plan.

1490
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,126
- Hey!
- Hey!

1491
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:57,628
- Hey!
- We're here!

1492
01:37:58,086 --> 01:37:59,463
Down here!

1493
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:03,425
<i>Make your way to the south side.</i>

1494
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:06,929
Come on.

1495
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,058
Wait. Get down!

1496
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:16,188
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

1497
01:38:17,147 --> 01:38:18,398
Anya, stop!

1498
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:29,743
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

1499
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:39,253
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

1500
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:40,754
Get down!

1501
01:38:42,506 --> 01:38:44,341
Go to the ladder. Go!

1502
01:38:46,385 --> 01:38:47,386
Come on, come on!

1503
01:38:52,015 --> 01:38:53,350
<i>Use the web.</i>

1504
01:39:06,947 --> 01:39:07,990
Get to the helicopter.

1505
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:10,742
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

1506
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:16,081
<i>It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.</i>

1507
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,457
Guys, this way.

1508
01:39:17,457 --> 01:39:19,543
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

1509
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:25,424
Anya, jump.

1510
01:39:26,925 --> 01:39:28,719
Jump now! Julia, get back!

1511
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:37,102
Julia, get down!

1512
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:51,033
Oh, God!

1513
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:53,619
You should have walked away.

1514
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:56,997
You can't protect them.

1515
01:39:56,997 --> 01:39:58,081
Cassie!

1516
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:04,755
Over here, asshole.

1517
01:40:07,257 --> 01:40:08,800
Mattie!

1518
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:20,896
Don't hurt her!

1519
01:40:28,362 --> 01:40:29,488
Anya!

1520
01:40:32,324 --> 01:40:33,659
Cassie!

1521
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,719
You can't save all three.

1522
01:40:55,597 --> 01:40:57,850
<i>And when you take on
the responsibility...</i>

1523
01:40:58,475 --> 01:41:00,269
<i>great power will come.</i>

1524
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:09,111
Julia, I got you.

1525
01:41:09,111 --> 01:41:10,195
Come on.

1526
01:41:11,613 --> 01:41:13,824
Mattie. You're gonna be okay.

1527
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:15,826
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

1528
01:41:47,482 --> 01:41:49,526
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

1529
01:41:53,113 --> 01:41:54,615
What makes you so sure?

1530
01:42:01,955 --> 01:42:03,957
Come on. Come on, come on.

1531
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:05,417
You're just like your mother.

1532
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,252
Yes, I am.

1533
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:31,985
You've been trying
to change your future.

1534
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,989
But the girls
were never your future.

1535
01:42:37,658 --> 01:42:38,700
I was.

1536
01:42:52,756 --> 01:42:54,633
No!

1537
01:43:17,573 --> 01:43:19,533
No. Cassie!

1538
01:44:13,295 --> 01:44:14,588
She's not breathing.

1539
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:16,256
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

1540
01:44:17,049 --> 01:44:18,050
Beginning compressions.

1541
01:44:19,176 --> 01:44:21,595
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

1542
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:22,971
Come on, guys. Come on!

1543
01:44:24,556 --> 01:44:26,099
Keep going. We don't stop.

1544
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:28,018
Come on, Cassie.

1545
01:44:29,102 --> 01:44:30,312
I'm getting a little tired.

1546
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:31,730
Okay. I'm right here.

1547
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:34,233
Cassie, wake up! Please.

1548
01:44:34,233 --> 01:44:35,984
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

1549
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:39,613
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

1550
01:44:40,322 --> 01:44:42,241
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

1551
01:44:44,576 --> 01:44:45,786
Oh, my God!

1552
01:44:46,495 --> 01:44:47,496
Cassie.

1553
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:50,415
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1554
01:44:50,415 --> 01:44:51,500
Oh, my God. We did it.

1555
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:57,756
We did it.

1556
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:19,862
Hi.

1557
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:23,574
Hello.

1558
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:24,658
Hi.

1559
01:45:26,952 --> 01:45:28,662
Oh, he's perfect.

1560
01:45:29,538 --> 01:45:30,539
He is.

1561
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:32,666
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

1562
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:41,675
We're still here, Cassie.

1563
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:43,969
Yeah. We're not leaving you.

1564
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:45,971
I wouldn't be here

1565
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:47,472
if it weren't
for the three of you.

1566
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:49,474
Right back at ya.

1567
01:45:49,975 --> 01:45:50,976
Ben said to tell you

1568
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:52,477
that the baby
is doing really well.

1569
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,855
And he's loving being an uncle.

1570
01:45:55,981 --> 01:45:58,984
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1571
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:01,570
That's what he thinks.

1572
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:07,117
Are you all immediate family?

1573
01:46:07,576 --> 01:46:08,785
Yes.

1574
01:46:09,995 --> 01:46:11,413
They're all mine.

1575
01:46:18,504 --> 01:46:20,005
Can we get you anything?

1576
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:21,089
No.

1577
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:24,092
I have everything I need
right here.

1578
01:46:53,747 --> 01:46:54,748
No.

1579
01:46:58,335 --> 01:47:01,547
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

1580
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:04,800
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

1581
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,510
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

1582
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,886
How'd you know?

1583
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:09,721
Bless you, Anya.

1584
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:10,806
What?

1585
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:14,351
Thank you.

1586
01:47:18,188 --> 01:47:19,189
Mattie!

1587
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:21,692
What? I told you I'm starving.

1588
01:47:21,692 --> 01:47:23,443
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

1589
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:25,279
...wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

1590
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:27,155
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1591
01:47:28,448 --> 01:47:29,449
How's your eyesight?

1592
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:31,660
I can see better
than I ever have.

1593
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,744
Oh, yeah?

1594
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:35,664
Can you see us in the future?

1595
01:47:36,582 --> 01:47:37,708
Yes.

1596
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:40,169
I can see you.

1597
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:44,047
<i>Standing up
for what you believe.</i>

1598
01:47:49,678 --> 01:47:50,888
<i>Never giving up.</i>

1599
01:47:56,435 --> 01:47:59,354
<i>Discovering you were always
more powerful than you thought.</i>

1600
01:48:01,106 --> 01:48:02,900
Nothing I didn't already know.

1601
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:07,029
I don't know about you two...

1602
01:48:07,613 --> 01:48:09,823
but that totally
makes sense to me.

1603
01:48:10,407 --> 01:48:12,326
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

1604
01:48:14,912 --> 01:48:16,413
What? I'm being serious.

1605
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,669
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

1606
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:33,514
<i>Whatever the future holds...</i>

1607
01:48:39,561 --> 01:48:40,771
<i>we'll be ready.</i>

1608
01:48:43,065 --> 01:48:44,942
<i>And you know the best thing
about the future?</i>

1609
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:48,987
<i>It hasn't happened yet.</i>
