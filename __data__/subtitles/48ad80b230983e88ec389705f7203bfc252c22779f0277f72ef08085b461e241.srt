1
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,871
<i>Fuck.</i>

2
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,043
<i>What is an adult?</i>

3
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,313
<i>Becomin' one</i>
<i>didn't suddenly transform me</i>

4
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,715
<i>into anything outstanding</i>
<i>or significant.</i>

5
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:42,518
<i>I am 18 and</i>
<i>entirely unremarkable.</i>

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,956
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

7
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,656
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

8
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,292
<i>In this tomb of a house</i>
<i>left to me</i>

9
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,660
<i>by my brilliant</i>
<i>and selfish parents.</i>

10
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>They're not dead...</i>

11
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:55,832
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

12
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,534
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

13
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,939
<i>Literature is my solace</i>
<i>in the solitude.</i>

14
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,441
<i>And writing is my only means</i>
<i>of escape.</i>

15
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,477
<i>Because, you see...</i>

16
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,781
<i>I've never left the edges</i>
<i>of this town.</i>

17
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,851
<i>It's positively gothic,</i>
<i>really.</i>

18
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,954
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

19
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:20,457
<i>the interminable boredom</i>
<i>of her small village.</i>

20
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,760
<i>Lonely girl longs</i>
<i>to be meaningful.</i>

21
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:26,630
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

22
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,666
<i>Books make longing</i>
<i>seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

23
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:31,601
<i>It's greedy.</i>

24
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,238
<i>And I wear longing</i>
<i>like a fucking veil.</i>

25
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>But today?</i>

26
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,659
<i>Today comes with</i>
<i>something new.</i>

27
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>Something surprising.</i>

28
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,599
<i>Today I meet a writer,</i>
<i>like me.</i>

29
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,635
<i>A teacher.</i>

30
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,305
<i>One who somehow</i>
<i>found inspiration</i>

31
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,940
<i>in a place like this.</i>

32
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,175
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

33
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,683
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,485
<i>I suppose even graveyards</i>
<i>grow flowers.</i>

35
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:53,119
Good morning.

36
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,554
Morning.

37
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,059
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

38
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,228
I know. I don't like crowds.

39
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:03,528
Uh-uh...

40
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,966
-Do you live far?
-Close enough to walk.

41
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,068
-Oh, where's that?
-Lovell Hill?

42
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:10,770
You live in Lovell Hill?

43
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,671
-You know it?
-I just didn't think it was

44
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:15,208
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

45
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:16,575
Who says it is?

46
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,412
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

47
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:20,712
Wow.

48
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:23,416
It's enormous.

49
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:24,817
My parents are lawyers.

50
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,651
-Hmm, what kind?
-The expensive kind.

51
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,054
And you wanna be a lawyer?

52
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,223
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

53
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,457
What's your name?

54
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,792
Cairo Sweet.

55
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,927
-I'm Mr. Miller.
-I know.

56
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:37,263
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

57
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,331
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:39,932
Uh...

59
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,735
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

60
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,371
the holidays.

61
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:45,906
Got a chance to look it over?

62
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:46,840
I read it.

63
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,475
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

64
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,642
but I promise you
we'll get through it

65
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,278
as quickly as we can.

66
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:52,612
I read the whole list.

67
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:54,680
Wait, you read these?

68
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,352
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

69
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,453
I party hard.

70
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:03,656
-Winnie.
-Mm. Hmm, hmm.

71
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:05,426
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

72
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:06,559
Did you miss me?

73
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,062
I did not.

74
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,630
Well, that's too bad.

75
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,502
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

76
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,938
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

77
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,512
How boring.

78
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:26,814
Censorship is dead.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,515
It can't exist
with the Internet.

80
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:29,649
And yet it does.

81
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:30,918
Do you know why?

82
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,220
Yeah.

83
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,122
Do you?

84
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,124
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

85
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,692
Not limitation.

86
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,261
Oh.
Excuse me,

87
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:41,662
but what's that you say?

88
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,934
You want
a chicken biscuit

89
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,403
and a Coke?

90
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,005
Mm. Well, you heard the boss.

91
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:54,409
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

92
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,177
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

93
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:58,546
No, thank you, Cairo.

94
00:05:58,612 --> 00:05:59,713
Sweet of you to ask.

95
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,616
I see
what you did there.

96
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,552
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

97
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,854
Not.

98
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,422
Good one.

99
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:09,824
Like we've never heard
that before.

100
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,172
Jesus.

101
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,814
My God.

102
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:41,891
What you reading?

103
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:45,127
-Uh, nothing.
-Doesn't look like nothin'.

104
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:46,195
It's a student's.

105
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,296
Oh, yeah? What's her name?

106
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:48,464
How do you know it's a girl?

107
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,199
Oh, boys are too lazy
to read porn.

108
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,333
How do you know it's porn?

109
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,703
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

110
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:56,839
"She leaps off the couch

111
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:57,907
-"and pushes herself..."
-Boris.

112
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,441
"...between the girl and me.

113
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,578
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

114
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:03,913
-"that I can't move."
-Give me that.

115
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,347
-"Marcelle stretches..."
-Okay.

116
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:07,416
-"...her tiny split fig."
-That's quite enough...

117
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:08,716
-All right.
-...of your elocution...

118
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,452
-And test tomorrow, kids.
-I think.

119
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,921
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

120
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,456
-This coffee for me?
-Biscuit, too.

121
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:16,126
One of yours?

122
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,561
Oh, yeah,
that's one of yours.

123
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:18,628
One of mine. Exactly.

124
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:19,728
Christ!

125
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:21,064
I don't know what
you're doing,

126
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,332
-but it's some...
-Oh, you know. Come on, now.

127
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,934
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,001
-Man, that's good.
-"Oh, I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

129
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,102
-"I'm so smart."
-Can you not?

130
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,837
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

131
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:28,905
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>
<i>-</i> Boris. Boris. Come on.

132
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,040
"I'm better than most people."

133
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:30,974
-Stop, please.
-Is this her diary?

134
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,375
Oh, what do we have here?

135
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,177
Well, well, well.

136
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:37,380
<i>"Apostrophes</i>
<i>and Ampersands..."</i>

137
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,851
six abysmally
romantic short stories

138
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,720
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

139
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,124
-She has my book?
-Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,659
It would appear so.
It would also appear

141
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,961
she's the only one
who checked it out.

142
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:53,430
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

143
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,664
Well, you know,

144
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,865
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

145
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:58,068
No, you really can't.

146
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,103
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

147
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,905
They cut
the theater program.

148
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,507
But they kept you?

149
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:05,309
Along with
the other props, yeah.

150
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:08,145
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,271
-Hello, wife.
-Hello, husband.

152
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,176
Beatrice.

153
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,178
-What?
-Look at me.

154
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,685
Huh.

155
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:49,186
Red-Letter Day.

156
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,722
What, your school
finally get computers?

157
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,823
Better.

158
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,259
Indoor bathrooms?

159
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,627
A writer.

160
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:56,895
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

161
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,263
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

162
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,998
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

163
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:02,134
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,336
And, uh, guess what else?

165
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:05,437
<i>-Naked Lunch.</i>
-Mm-mm.

166
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,706
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

167
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:08,807
She...

168
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:11,043
She checked it out
of the library.

169
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:13,278
They carry your book
at the library?

170
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,114
Aw. Fuck.

171
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,786
<i>-A Confederacy of Dunces.</i>
<i>-</i> Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,687
Well, deep breaths.

173
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:22,954
Happy place.

174
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,424
My happy place
has all their heads

175
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,794
impaled on Montblanc pens.

176
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,328
Share your riches.

177
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,700
Hello, Amy.

178
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,601
What? Are you fucking joking?

179
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:38,070
I've been back and forth
all day

180
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:40,272
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

181
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,273
what it is they want

182
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,208
and somehow think
they can articulate

183
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,111
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

184
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:46,212
considering how they think

185
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,816
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

186
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,617
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

187
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:53,119
my teeth with a baby spoon.

188
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,654
-Mm.
-They can go

189
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,657
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

190
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:59,559
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

191
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,650
Here now.

192
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:27,587
Cheers.

193
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,655
Cheers.

194
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,926
Oh, that's so good.

195
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:38,198
Hey, you ever read, uh,

196
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,401
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

197
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,903
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

198
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,938
I had to throw it away.

199
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:46,974
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,675
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-...and the cum money?

201
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,210
That is choice.

202
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,747
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

203
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,583
"and wipe my cock on it."

204
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:01,255
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

205
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:03,190
"weighted with a coin."

206
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,726
-I love when you do magic.
-Mm.

207
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,027
You care to reenact?

208
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:09,163
I can papier-mache you...

209
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,299
with cum and money.

210
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,802
Oh, so you're expecting

211
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,036
-a heavy load, then, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,873
A full body of work.

213
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:20,374
Come here.

214
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,709
Dance with me.

215
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:43,431
You're so beautiful.

216
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,166
Shut up.

217
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,384
Oh, for fuck's sake.

218
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,320
Okay.

219
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,089
Will you take care
of those dishes?

220
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,157
Uh-huh.

221
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,292
I'll give you a handy later.

222
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,065
It's Pushkin, Amy.

223
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:17,700
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

224
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,170
What
a terrible weekend.

225
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:23,072
-Mm.
-Come on,

226
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,474
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

227
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,810
'Cause you're a puritan.

228
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,010
I feel like it's my duty

229
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:29,779
to punish the goodness
out of you.

230
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,080
God, you're a sadist.

231
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,414
I'm a public school teacher.

232
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,283
-Amen to that.
-Cheers.

233
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,753
Ooh, mama.

234
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,492
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

235
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,429
Why don't you go see?

236
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,900
Mm-mm.
I don't go in the kudzu.

237
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,968
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

238
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,435
That's why it grows so fast.

239
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,900
Good morning.

240
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,100
You always walk through
the woods alone?

241
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,235
That's a peculiar question

242
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:27,404
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

243
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,072
What, what are you,
uh, listening to?

244
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,975
-Celine Dion.
-Really?

245
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,576
Really.

246
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:33,677
But why?

247
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,245
-I'm sorry.
-Because she's great.

248
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:36,713
-Oh. Hmm.
-Ignore him. Ignore him.

249
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,548
-He wept aloud openly...
-Hmm.

250
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:40,283
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

251
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,418
-Hmm.
-...at my bachelor party.

252
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,253
-Remember that?
-I was drunk.

253
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,387
You were disconsolate.

254
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:45,689
You are a fucking traitor.

255
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,991
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

256
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,158
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

257
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,726
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:50,995
Uh, want a biscuit?

259
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,629
-Yeah, sure.
-There you go.

260
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,973
-It's good.
-Yeah?

261
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,074
-Do you make these?
-Yeah.

262
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,474
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

263
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,343
-Why not? I don't.
-Oh, you know.

264
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,711
-You'll figure it out.
-I won't.

265
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,279
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

266
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,181
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

267
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,085
On that...
Take my leave.

268
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,286
I shall bid you goodbye.

269
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:16,454
-Okay.
-Uh, you, bad bye.

270
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,622
-Well, goodbye.
-A bad bye?

271
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,024
Mm-hmm.
-But I love you though.

272
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,324
No, you don't.

273
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,729
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

274
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,701
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

275
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:47,887
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

276
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,355
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

277
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,859
I dressed up just for you.

278
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,962
What you want?

279
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,030
I wanna get into

280
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,098
-your physics class.
-Why?

281
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,165
You'd be really behind.

282
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,733
Don't you tutor?

283
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,368
You don't need lessons.

284
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,570
Then what do I need?

285
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,373
Um...

286
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,879
See what I can do.

287
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,179
'Preciate ya!

288
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,580
Hope so.

289
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,450
You are insane.

290
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,622
Here.

291
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,291
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

292
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,162
But you're a lesbian.

293
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:31,496
I'm an equal opportunist.

294
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,999
Mm.

295
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,466
Are you jealous?

296
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,334
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

297
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,771
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

298
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,607
Okay, chickybikky?

299
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,277
Okay.

300
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,955
So, you're a smoker now?

301
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,623
I'm smoking now.

302
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,194
No plans for it
to define me yet.

303
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,795
Where are your parents
this time?

304
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,629
Mumbai.

305
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,799
For how long?

306
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,700
Who knows?

307
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:08,969
Let me dress you up.

308
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,971
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

309
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,472
I give a fuck
about being smart.

310
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,474
You can be both.

311
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,744
What are you doin'?

312
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,881
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

313
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,348
into my Yale essay.

314
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,884
You dry?

315
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,319
Unqualified.

316
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,722
What's the subject?

317
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,825
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

318
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,928
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

319
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,596
Surviving the crippling ennui

320
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,931
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

321
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,032
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,433
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

323
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,502
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

324
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,937
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

325
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,139
I've had no achievement.

326
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

327
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,407
Boring.

328
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,011
-You have a 4.6 GPA.
-Boring.

329
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,246
And you've successfully...

330
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,312
-What?
-Well...

331
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,282
You've successfully, um...

332
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,018
Well...

333
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,719
Shit.

334
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:01,022
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

335
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:02,422
generationally wealthy gal

336
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,725
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

337
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:05,827
Fuck.

338
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,395
So...

339
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,665
Experience something.

340
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:12,599
Like what?

341
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,334
Something worth writing about.

342
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:19,141
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

343
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:22,544
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

344
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,478
Easy.

345
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,446
It becomes a conversation

346
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,549
about achieving emancipation

347
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:31,319
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

348
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,155
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

349
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,523
Haven't decided yet.

350
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,126
What's it to you?

351
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:38,260
Like, he's, like,

352
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,495
-twenty years older than you.
-So?

353
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:42,363
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

354
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,033
since the dawn of time.

355
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,704
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

356
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,240
What?

357
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,674
Your virginity.

358
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,576
Does it mean something to you?

359
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,413
I haven't decided yet.

360
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:00,983
Come to Winnie.

361
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,392
We're, like,

362
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,495
the fucking
American wet dream.

363
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,599
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

364
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:20,303
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

365
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,605
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

366
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,406
whose sexual standards
are mandated

367
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:26,843
by the shit porn he downloads.

368
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,978
That's deli meat.

369
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:31,747
I want a dry-aged

370
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:34,450
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

371
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,385
to take me to pleasure town.

372
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:39,521
Like...

373
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:41,091
Wagyu beef.

374
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:45,795
Hungee.

375
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,596
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

376
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:49,933
Why not?

377
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:52,836
He's fine.

378
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,072
He's like,
really fucking smart.

379
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,374
And he's kind.

380
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,844
Which means, as my first time,

381
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,479
he'd take his time

382
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,648
to get me all good and juiced.

383
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,784
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

384
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:11,255
You know,
the first time you have sex,

385
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,857
it's not supposed to hurt.

386
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,724
Right?

387
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:18,561
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

388
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:21,832
You likely won't even bleed.

389
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,802
Didn't know that.

390
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:26,703
That's because a woman's pain

391
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,772
is valued more
than her pleasure.

392
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,008
But that's a conversation
for another day.

393
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:32,109
My point...

394
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:36,814
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

395
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:39,817
I know what I'm looking for.

396
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:45,089
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

397
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,190
What do you mean?

398
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:48,592
I've never seen him look
at a student

399
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,028
the way he looks at you.

400
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,965
He sees you

401
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,732
even though
you hide in plain sight.

402
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,835
-Shut up.
-What?

403
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:57,803
-Stop!
-No.

404
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,305
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

405
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:01,873
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

406
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,775
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

407
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:07,478
No, you're being... Shut up.

408
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:14,219
I'd fuck you.

409
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:16,254
I know.

410
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,731
<i>"I was nothing</i>

411
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:28,566
<i>"but a bleached bone monument</i>
<i>beneath her.</i>

412
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,904
<i>"Human ruins</i>
<i>of a madman's love."</i>

413
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,042
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

414
00:20:39,711 --> 00:20:42,048
<i>God, I'd give anything</i>
<i>to feel that.</i>

415
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:48,653
<i>What muse could inspire</i>
<i>this deranged yearning?</i>

416
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,864
<i>To inspire.</i>

417
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,665
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

418
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:06,605
<i>Could we be that</i>
<i>to each other?</i>

419
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,777
<i>What was I saying?</i>

420
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,248
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

421
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,084
<i>Feels good.</i>

422
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:20,486
<i>It feels pink.</i>

423
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:21,821
Never forget.

424
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:24,589
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

425
00:21:24,656 --> 00:21:26,926
It's very big, it's very bold.

426
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,030
To us,
it might seem a little...

427
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,564
much.

428
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,202
If we don't stick
to the brief,

429
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:37,137
it gets a little bit woolly.

430
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:40,740
Uh, can you see me
after school, please?

431
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,344
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

432
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,180
<i>It's like a sugar cube</i>
<i>under the tongue.</i>

433
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,247
...a little better.

434
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,950
But worth persevering.

435
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,485
Colby, what?

436
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:53,087
<i>I want your attention.</i>

437
00:21:56,457 --> 00:21:58,325
Uh, how's Bea?

438
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:00,593
She's, uh, she's Bea.

439
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,062
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

440
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:03,530
It's not.

441
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:05,199
You mean you're not.

442
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,867
No, she's, uh, she's occupied.

443
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:08,235
All right,
what time is dinner?

444
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:09,403
Seven o'clock.

445
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,938
And please take a shower.

446
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:12,072
Are you worried?

447
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:15,342
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

448
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:16,709
Top three worst nightmares.

449
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:19,480
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

450
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,483
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

451
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,818
Aw, cutie.

452
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:25,854
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,355
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

454
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:28,689
Check it out now.

455
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,700
-It's close, right?
-To?

456
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:40,902
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

457
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,270
-All right, man.
-Bye, Professor.

458
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,571
Love you.

459
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,354
Ooh!

460
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:01,956
F... Hi. Uh...

461
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:06,727
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

462
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:08,830
-I won't tell.
-That's generous, thank you.

463
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:11,600
Uh, hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

464
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,936
I'm waiting for Winnie.

465
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:16,005
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

466
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,240
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

467
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:20,609
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

468
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:23,479
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

469
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,780
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

470
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,150
What's Winnie doing?

471
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:29,385
She's applying to Vandy.

472
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,120
You would be pleased to know.

473
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:32,655
And are you?

474
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,157
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

475
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:38,327
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

476
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:39,428
Maybe.

477
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,463
From afar.

478
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:43,365
As it burns.

479
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,168
Like Nero.

480
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:49,771
Well, that's...

481
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:52,274
So, uh,
how far are we talkin'?

482
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,509
Yale far.

483
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:54,977
Yale far? My God!

484
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,979
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

485
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:58,814
and read Joan Didion or what?

486
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,850
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

487
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:06,056
You ever been to

488
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,791
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

489
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,526
No. What's that?

490
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:12,362
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

491
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:13,530
Victorian Village.

492
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:15,365
-What is that?
-What's...

493
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:16,933
What's that? It's blank.

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,535
Ca... How can you disdain

495
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,470
of what Tennessee has to offer

496
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:24,641
without conducting a thorough,
uh, cultural investigation?

497
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,142
Educated judgment.

498
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,745
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

499
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:31,514
Because they're bad?

500
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:34,750
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

501
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,953
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

502
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:38,822
Yeah.

503
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,558
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

504
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,059
I think you might
be surprised.

505
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,464
You wanted to see me?

506
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,965
This week's story,

507
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:53,770
uh, you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

508
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:55,106
I enjoyed this one.

509
00:24:56,707 --> 00:25:00,144
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

510
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:02,913
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

511
00:25:04,282 --> 00:25:08,119
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

512
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:13,291
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

513
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,960
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

514
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,928
"like a hypergiant star

515
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:19,563
"burning to ash.

516
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:25,002
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

517
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,371
"We are what we are.

518
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,975
"And all creatures must eat."

519
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:37,448
-Um...
-Damn. That, I mean...

520
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:39,150
I was not expecting that.

521
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:41,252
Um...

522
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:44,256
She's not reluctant.

523
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:46,525
She's resigned.

524
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:47,726
-To her death?
-No.

525
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:49,094
To the order of things.

526
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,963
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

527
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,433
-Phew. It's dark.
-It's nature.

528
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:55,901
That's true.

529
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,073
You memorized it.

530
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:02,407
Uh...

531
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,576
Well, I'm eidetic.

532
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,445
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

533
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,916
You are...

534
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:15,454
You're exceptionally talented.

535
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,790
-Do I get an A?
-Well, how about a jumpstart

536
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,191
on the midterm?

537
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:21,360
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

538
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:23,895
I want you to write
a short story

539
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:26,131
in the style
of your favorite author.

540
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:28,867
I think it could be
the highlight

541
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,635
of your portfolio submission

542
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:32,004
-to Vanderbilt.
-Yale.

543
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,506
-Vanderbilt.
-Yale.

544
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,241
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

545
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:37,944
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

546
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,245
Thought you would.

547
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:40,980
Good.

548
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,916
I read your book.

549
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:46,619
Oh, God. Well, uh...

550
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:52,925
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

551
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:54,961
found it, uh,

552
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,498
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

553
00:26:58,564 --> 00:26:59,665
I would call it...

554
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,368
grand and tragic.

555
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:05,171
Okay.

556
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:08,007
Romantic horror.

557
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,245
That's, uh...

558
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,548
"She was an electric white

559
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,151
"noon-shadow moon

560
00:27:19,118 --> 00:27:21,354
"casting cold light like water

561
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,357
"over the flat earth
of my face.

562
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,427
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

563
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,295
"But the moon,

564
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:30,531
"the moon...

565
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,167
"I stared until I was nothing

566
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,502
"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.

567
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,007
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

568
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:46,780
Well, you memorized that,
right?

569
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,891
That was too much.
That was weird.

570
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:58,058
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

571
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,561
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

572
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,496
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

573
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:06,300
which felt tangible.

574
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:09,036
Like I'd touched somethin'.

575
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,242
You know,
I haven't written anything

576
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,678
-in a very long time.
-Why not?

577
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:17,979
I don't know.

578
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,714
Do I know?

579
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,484
Mm?

580
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,752
Uh...

581
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,454
I guess I got married.

582
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,756
Started teaching.

583
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,095
I don't have anything else
to say.

584
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,998
You're uninspired.

585
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:39,267
-You judging me?
-I am challenging you.

586
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,135
That's my job.

587
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:51,079
-Hi, Winnie.
-Oh, no.

588
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,118
-Hungee.
-I think she's hungry.

589
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,553
She just doesn't use
real words

590
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,687
because she's a child.

591
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:05,194
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

592
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:06,595
-I knew it.
-Please don't start.

593
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,197
-Don't.
-Your hair looks good.

594
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:09,198
-I will not go...
-I'm more concerned...

595
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,666
...gently into the good night.

596
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,034
-No, I know. You look fine.
-Like you have.

597
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,269
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

598
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,136
that you got two damn phones
on the table

599
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,237
like you're a rapper.

600
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:16,639
This one
is my professional phone.

601
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:18,307
And the other one...

602
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:19,642
-The other one...
-...is for selling drugs.

603
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,110
-The other one is personal.
-Oh, yeah?

604
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,111
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

605
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,882
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

606
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,583
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

607
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,219
I'm getting angry now.

608
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:32,022
-Well...
-Well, hi.

609
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,990
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

610
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:35,558
So, what is the holdup?

611
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,126
-A fuck-up...
-Bea. Come on.

612
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,094
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

613
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,965
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

614
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,133
-On me.
-Another Maker's.

615
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,869
Okay, you got it.

616
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:47,670
-Coach?
-Blue Moon.

617
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:49,405
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

618
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,473
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

619
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,878
Oh, you think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

620
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:55,478
Gets me
a better grade.

621
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,314
Doesn't it?

622
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,282
-That might be true, yeah.
-Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

623
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:00,885
I'm good, Winnie.

624
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:01,986
Designated driver.

625
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:03,386
-Oh.
-Oh, really?

626
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:04,588
-Unless you wanna do it.
-First I'm hearing of this.

627
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:07,892
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

628
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,594
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

629
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,796
Boring?

630
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,064
What? And let
my students make their grades

631
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,364
with scholastic merit?

632
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:15,699
Do you really think
I'm boring?

633
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:17,100
In a good way.

634
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,336
Like a nice pastoral.

635
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,237
I'll get those drinks for you.

636
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,940
Yeah. "Pastoral."

637
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,274
She just called you a field.

638
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,475
At best.

639
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,577
-She's cute.
-Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

640
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:28,778
And she can paint.

641
00:30:28,846 --> 00:30:30,246
She's in my morning class.

642
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:32,883
Oh, is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

643
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,651
That's Cairo.

644
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:35,685
-Cairo?
-Yeah.

645
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,187
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

646
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,090
He sure did.

647
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:42,059
-Is she pretty?
-Is she pretty?

648
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,895
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

649
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:45,296
Damn. Even worse.

650
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:47,198
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

651
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:50,002
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

652
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,637
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

653
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,205
And it's rare as well

654
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,740
-to be so engaged and so...
-Hmm. I bet is is. Yes.

655
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,341
-So worshipped.
-So worthy.

656
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:59,210
-Wanna be like me.
-She, in earnest

657
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,947
uses words
like "vituperation."

658
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:03,081
Please.

659
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:04,615
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

660
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:07,318
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

661
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,553
Bea, she's extraordinary.

662
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,422
-Okay?
-But enjoy it while you can.

663
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,257
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

664
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:15,127
Rural education
not as romantic

665
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:16,360
as you thought it'd be, huh?

666
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:17,695
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

667
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:19,463
<i>Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

668
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,033
-That's on you, man.
-Just cool stories

669
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:22,433
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

670
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,236
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

671
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,671
-Oh, he's judging you.
-Yes, he is. I feel it.

672
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:28,140
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

673
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:29,440
Are too.

674
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,143
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

675
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,576
"without inspiring the pupil

676
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,714
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

677
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,649
-Horace Mann.
-Ten points to Slytherin.

678
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:38,717
That's so rich.

679
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:40,252
I wanted to be a teacher.

680
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:41,319
You fell back on it.

681
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:43,156
And by the way,
I love teaching.

682
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:45,124
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

683
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,758
-Hey, than what?
-Writing.

684
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,995
-Goddamn, Beatrice.
-What does that mean?

685
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:50,395
You don't have kids.

686
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:51,263
-You don't have kids.
-You don't have

687
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:52,865
brain damage, right?

688
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:54,666
So, um, you stopped writing

689
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,668
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

690
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,805
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

691
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:00,539
I'm a writer.

692
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:02,141
You haven't put pen to page

693
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:03,976
since your stories got panned.

694
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:05,812
You're not a writer.

695
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:06,913
Hmm.

696
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:09,514
Well, okay.

697
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,216
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

698
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:12,852
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

699
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:13,986
It's that you don't.

700
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:17,123
You chose to be a teacher.

701
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,291
Why would I see you
as anything else?

702
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:22,862
'Cause you married a writer.

703
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,329
I did.

704
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:25,732
Didn't I?

705
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:39,847
<i>Why am I here?</i>

706
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:44,550
<i>It's not for the poetry,</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

707
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,490
<i>It's for the thrill</i>
<i>of something</i>

708
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,993
<i>that I've managed to go</i>
<i>my whole life without knowing.</i>

709
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,398
<i>An ache of anticipation</i>
<i>that you'll be here.</i>

710
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,906
<i>And it will mean something</i>
<i>that you are.</i>

711
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,777
<i>Be here.</i>

712
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,512
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

713
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,317
"Stay, illusion.

714
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:19,954
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

715
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:24,192
-Hi.
-Hi.

716
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:25,894
-Can I sit?
-Of course.

717
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:31,199
What's that you got there?

718
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:34,169
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

719
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:35,970
Said the barrister's daughter.

720
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:38,006
Do you know
all these people?

721
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:39,306
Uh, most of them.

722
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:41,508
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

723
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:43,912
Like group therapy?

724
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:46,848
Yeah, exactly that.

725
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:49,884
-Who's that fellow?
-That's Elliot.

726
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,618
Three-time Ostrander winner.

727
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:53,487
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

728
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,290
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

729
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,590
Hmm.

730
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:59,459
"It is my intention
to escape you

731
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:02,429
"and leave you far behind...

732
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,534
"...bereft of me and aching.

733
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:09,805
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

734
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:12,975
"Not quite heartache.

735
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:15,577
"Not quite homesick.

736
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:18,047
"Me-shaped and filled

737
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:20,082
"with the remnants of stars.

738
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,552
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

739
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,056
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

740
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:31,060
"The hideous pulse,

741
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:33,494
"the shouting blood,

742
00:34:34,562 --> 00:34:37,032
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

743
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,167
"with wanting

744
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:42,537
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

745
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,542
"And yet
some part of me stays.

746
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:49,477
"Some bit,

747
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:51,479
"some parcel,

748
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:54,884
"some ash left behind.

749
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:59,688
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

750
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:03,827
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

751
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:09,531
"But they are not me.

752
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:13,702
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

753
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:20,110
"I will never fit there
again."

754
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,786
What?

755
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:33,756
I can see.

756
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:35,825
It was really something.

757
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,427
Hot dog.

758
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:40,629
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

759
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:42,698
Yes, I did.

760
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,767
Have more faith.

761
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:54,145
<i>What is the word?</i>

762
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,481
<i>It's not falling.</i>
<i>That's too stale.</i>

763
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,752
<i>It's more deliberate</i>
<i>than that.</i>

764
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:07,691
<i>It's recognition</i>
<i>of what we really are.</i>

765
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,963
<i>Ghosts.</i>

766
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:15,967
<i>You do see me.</i>

767
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:19,804
<i>And I see you.</i>

768
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:31,614
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

769
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,616
-Go inside.
-And miss Godot?

770
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:35,219
Gifts for the wallflowers.

771
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:36,787
-Oh. Okay.
-Mm. Hmm.

772
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,622
-Thank you.
-What's this?

773
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,959
-Coffee.
-No, no.

774
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:43,527
What's this? What is...
What's with the, uh, new look?

775
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:46,098
Thank you for this. It's,
uh... It's very generous.

776
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,033
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

777
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,835
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

778
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,870
-What flavor?
-Split fig.

779
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:54,006
Mm.

780
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:55,273
Excuse me.

781
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,707
-It's good.
-Come on, man.

782
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,043
You got
a little split fig in you?

783
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,345
-Not right now. Really?
-Caught in your throat?

784
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:02,447
-You know what you should do?
-What should I do?

785
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:03,781
You should make a logo
and sell these

786
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,516
to raise money for the team.

787
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,419
Don't laugh.

788
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,487
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

789
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:09,720
-Oh, yeah.
-He doesn't count.

790
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:11,490
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

791
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:13,524
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

792
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,625
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

793
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:15,927
She's really good
at that stuff.

794
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:17,863
-Really?
-Coach.

795
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:20,531
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

796
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:22,134
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

797
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,601
What's in it for you?

798
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,536
-What's in it for me?
-Mm-hmm.

799
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:28,408
Oh, well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

800
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:30,243
Connection. 5%.

801
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:34,746
-I'm the Biscuit Batter.
-No. Once more with pride.

802
00:37:34,814 --> 00:37:38,051
-I'm the Biscuit Batter!
-Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

803
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,085
I'm the...

804
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,619
I'm gonna work on that.

805
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:42,088
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

806
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,390
-Y'all coming inside?
-You go ahead.

807
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:46,159
All right, suit yourself.

808
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,194
I'll suit myself. See you now.

809
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:49,628
Mm.

810
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,171
Hi.

811
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:00,840
Hi.

812
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,644
You're sweet.

813
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,747
When it suits.

814
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:13,685
Please.

815
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,189
-Thank you.
-Mm.

816
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:40,380
What did he say
about the outfit?

817
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,216
He didn't have
to say anything.

818
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,119
Oh.

819
00:38:45,185 --> 00:38:46,386
You ready? Can we go?

820
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:48,255
No. I need to stop
by his class.

821
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:50,723
Can I watch?

822
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,226
Oh, hi.

823
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,327
Hey.

824
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:54,627
How are you, kid?

825
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:58,398
Are you in a hurry?

826
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,134
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little, uh,

827
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:03,203
weekend vacation with my wife.

828
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,441
What do writers
do on vacation?

829
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:08,543
Uh, excuse me.

830
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,579
Um, well,
they pretend to write

831
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:13,214
someplace else, I guess.

832
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:16,618
Uh, can we talk about
the midterm?

833
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:17,986
Uh, sure, what's on your mind?

834
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:20,088
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

835
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:21,456
Okay. Who is it?

836
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:22,957
Henry Miller.

837
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:25,659
Provocative and,
uh...

838
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:28,129
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

839
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:30,764
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

840
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,033
You know, his decadence,

841
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,869
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

842
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:36,905
his, um,
destruction of convention.

843
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:39,240
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

844
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:44,846
-Do you not think I can do it?
-Look,

845
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,714
Miller is public enemy
number one

846
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:48,883
with the censors.

847
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,985
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

848
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,787
So?

849
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,427
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

850
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:04,133
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

851
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:07,136
Okay.

852
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:08,871
Okay, yes?

853
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,906
Okay, I trust you.

854
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,375
Write what you know,
little ghost.

855
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,349
Damn, I gotta go. Uh...

856
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,851
Do me a favor.

857
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:25,287
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

858
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,989
Take a recess.

859
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:29,558
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

860
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,594
Uh, listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

861
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,895
Bye, Winnie.

862
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:37,233
Don't do that.

863
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:39,969
Don't look at me like that.

864
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,873
Hmm...

865
00:40:45,908 --> 00:40:47,009
"Oh..."

866
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:49,179
No, I never did that.

867
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,947
Stop.

868
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:54,217
Wait, Winnie, don't...

869
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,785
"Oh, Mr. Miller,

870
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:01,358
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

871
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,994
"and breakin' all the rules!"

872
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,295
Okay, enough, enough.

873
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,997
You need to get off his desk.

874
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,698
I did not say it like that.

875
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:10,133
Oh, but you meant it
like that.

876
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,269
-No, I didn't.
-You're seducin' him,

877
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,170
you floozy.

878
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:16,306
We make a good double team.

879
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,375
Hi.

880
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:19,843
Am I interruptin'?

881
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,878
-We were just leavin'.
-Where's Jon?

882
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,647
Uh, where's Mr. Miller?

883
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:24,780
He left.

884
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:27,217
Shoot.
Oh, while I have you. Cairo.

885
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,252
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

886
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,186
And, uh, Winnie...

887
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:32,389
-I'd like your help too.
-With what?

888
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:33,590
Well, can you keep the secret?

889
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,658
Sure can.

890
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:35,759
I bake biscuits.

891
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,993
He's gonna have
the baseball team

892
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,261

893
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,531
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

894
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,033
I think that's really cool.

895
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,268
-Really?
-I'd love to help.

896
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,770
Cool. All right.

897
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,038
I'll call you guys out
on your lunch period.

898
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,306
We can go over the specs.

899
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,207
Hey, um...

900
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,276
I think it'd be easier

901
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,612
if you just gave me
your phone.

902
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,281
I could text you the specs.

903
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,849
It'd be faster that way.

904
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,118
Okay.

905
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,486
Great.

906
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,990
Hey, can you call me?

907
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,726
Mm. Mm-hmm.

908
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,228
And now
you'll have Cairo's number.

909
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,863
Oh, good.

910
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,366
There is no reception
in here.

911
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,734
-Shit.
-Cairo, it's probably

912
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,302
just at the bottom
of your bag.

913
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,404
No, I just had it
a minute ago.

914
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,139
Well, it's Friday,

915
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,408
and we're still here.

916
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,043

917
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,316

918
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,218

-My phone.
-My phone.

920
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,524
-Your phone.
-Your phone?

921
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,561
Your phone!

922
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:45,697
-Right. Sorry. Okay.
-Oh, okay. Okay.

923
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,699
-Well, that was my...
-Ah.

924
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,972
Baby, I'm gonna need
a few more minutes, all right?

925
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,142
Okay. Well, we were supposed
to leave 40 minutes ago.

926
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:58,577
I know.

927
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,113
If Amy did her fucking job...

928
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,647
...we could've left yesterday.

929
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,722
It's just not enough, Amy.

930
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,023
What the f...?

931
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,627
Yes, I'll hold.

-Hello?
<i>-Hi.</i>

933
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:18,597
You have my phone.

934
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,434
<i>And whose phone</i>
<i>do I have?</i>

935
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:22,535
Cairo Sweet's.

936
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:24,670
Cairo. It's, uh...

937
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:27,607
It's Jon... It's Mr. Miller.

938
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,645
-Sticky fingers, Miller.
<i>-Uh...</i>

939
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:34,547
Uh, how are you?

940
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:35,915
I'm tethered to a landline.

941
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,683
<i>-Are you already gone?</i>
-Uh, well, should be.

942
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,719
I don't give
a flying backwards fuck, Amy.

943
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:40,821
Just give 'em the first draft.

944
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,422
-Hang on.
-They'll think it's new.

945
00:43:42,488 --> 00:43:44,090
Honey. Honey,
I've, I've gotta drop

946

947
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:46,692
All right, take care of it.

948
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:48,094
Oh, get me some tampons

949
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,328
-Yeah.
-Organic ones,

950
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:50,596
-if you can find 'em.
-Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:52,432
Not you obviously, Amy. Fuck.

952
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:53,299
Get me a better deal,

953
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,634

you can plug my pussy.

I'm still here.

957
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:05,813
You at Lovell Hill right now?

958
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,146
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Okay.

959
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,315
Well, I'll drop it off
before we leave,

960
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:10,617

1076
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:05,695
Good morning.

1077
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:13,270
Are you okay?

1078
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,009
What's wrong?

1079
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,981
Your story.

1080
00:53:24,383 --> 00:53:26,051
Oh.

1081
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:28,020
You didn't like it?

1082
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:32,757
You have to choose
another author.

1083
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:36,161
Why?

1084
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:38,796
This is inappropriate.

1085
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,565
"Inappropriate."

1086
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:42,868
What does that mean?

1087
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:45,569
Why did you write this?

1088
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,072
-You asked me to.
-Uh-huh.

1089
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:49,875
Okay.

1090
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:51,510
Why did you choose
that material?

1091
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,412
You said,
"Write what you know."

1092
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:55,313
And this is what you know?

1093
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:56,948
This is...

1094
00:53:58,816 --> 00:53:59,851
us.

1095
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:01,386
No.

1096
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:03,188
This is... This is you.

1097
00:54:03,255 --> 00:54:04,688
I don't...

1098
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:06,391
I don't understand this.

1099
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,160
Are you being serious?

1100
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,228
Okay. It's...

1101
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:13,231
It's about two like people
abnegating social convention.

1102
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:16,469
You know, it's commentary

1103
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:17,870
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

1104
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:20,139
that's super saturated
with pornography.

1105
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:23,342
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

1106
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:25,244
on young people's
expectations.

1107
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,747
It's about
inexorable attraction.

1108
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,285
It's layered.

1109
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:33,920
-This is pornography.
-Yes.

1110
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:36,788
So put it in your diary,
not on my fuckin' desk.

1111
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:39,926
Write a new story
with a new author.

1112
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:44,897
I'm not gonna indulge this.

1113
00:54:44,964 --> 00:54:46,966
Are you talking about
the story or us?

1114
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:48,600
Both.

1115
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:54,073
You already have.
You inspired it.

1116
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:57,376
I can't accept it.

1117
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:00,980
But you can't or you won't?

1118
00:55:04,517 --> 00:55:06,353
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

1119
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,454
-Hey. Hey.
-...and it looks like

1120
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:08,889
you're measurin'.

1121
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:12,426
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

1122
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:14,194
-and say what you mean.
-Rewrite it.

1123
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:15,262
Why?

1124
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,663
-You know why.
-Tell me.

1125
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,133
-Say it.
-If you don't rewrite this,

1126
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,567
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

1127
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:22,102
-Tell me why.
-I don't have to tell you

1128
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:23,203
a goddamn thing.

1129
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,276
It made you feel something
that scared you.

1130
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:31,711
-Don't put words in my mouth.
-Then say them yourself.

1131
00:55:32,513 --> 00:55:34,081
Tell me what it made you feel.

1132
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:36,782
Incredibly foolish

1133
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,953
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

1134
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,224
What was I before you read it?

1135
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,104
A student.

1136
00:55:58,573 --> 00:55:59,841
You built the world.

1137
00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:04,412
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

1138
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:06,014
but in real life.

1139
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:09,984
You can't blur the lines

1140
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:11,386
and then expect me to see
a boundary

1141
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,453
when I suddenly cross it.

1142
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:18,426
Let me be very, very clear...

1143
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:21,728
...with you.

1144
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:25,799
You're my student.

1145
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:28,136
And I'm your teacher.

1146
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:31,239
That's all.

1147
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,109
Any misconception of that
is something,

1148
00:56:35,176 --> 00:56:37,744
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

1149
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,114
alone.

1150
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:15,750
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

1151
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:19,388
Yeah, I know what I said.

1152
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:21,190
You don't know anything
you say.

1153
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,764
-This is good.
-Mm-hmm.

1154
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:32,201
And you know it is.

1155
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:38,008
So, let's examine
the real issue.

1156
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:42,345
It's not my writing.

1157
00:57:44,914 --> 00:57:46,449
It's yours.

1158
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,253
Good try.

1159
00:57:51,488 --> 00:57:53,757
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

1160
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:55,025
What?

1161
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,327
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

1162
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:00,130
Right?

1163
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,269
"Overreaching
without ambition."

1164
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:13,410
Do you know what that means?

1165
00:58:17,881 --> 00:58:20,150
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

1166
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:25,221
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

1167
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:31,929
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

1168
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:35,466
are mediocre.

1169
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:41,872
You wanna fail me?

1170
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,343
I fucking dare you.

1171
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:50,214
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

1172
00:58:52,316 --> 00:58:53,984
And you better know
what it means.

1173
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:58,356
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

1174
00:59:00,691 --> 00:59:03,627
And if you're not very,
very careful

1175
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:09,367
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

1176
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:13,804
it will devour you
until you are as small

1177
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:15,172
as you pretend to be.

1178
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:20,445
And you will disappear.

1179
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:26,218
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

1180
00:59:26,284 --> 00:59:28,253
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

1181
00:59:38,997 --> 00:59:41,032
How disappointin' you must be

1182
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:43,001
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

1183
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:52,577
No wonder you're here.

1184
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:11,697
<i>Heartbreak is</i>
<i>a slow-motion car crash</i>

1185
01:00:11,764 --> 01:00:13,566
<i>set to Mozart.</i>

1186
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:16,369
<i>You know the one.</i> The Requiem.

1187
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:23,476
<i>It tastes like graveyard dirt.</i>

1188
01:00:28,414 --> 01:00:30,616
<i>It smells</i>
<i>like burnin' flowers.</i>

1189
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:37,523
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

1190
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,193
How you doin', Professor?

1191
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,496
Had a bad day.

1192
01:01:27,374 --> 01:01:30,143
-Oh, you want a drink?
-Thank you.

1193
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:38,151
What?
So, he was offended?

1194
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:40,454
He was affected.

1195
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:43,790
Are you still into him?

1196
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:51,232
He's a pretender.

1197
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,304
You know, at least what

1198
01:01:56,371 --> 01:01:57,472
you see with Boris
is what you get.

1199
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:00,308
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

1200
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:05,079
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

1201
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:06,614
and gas station sushi.

1202
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:11,586
Aren't you in love with him?

1203
01:02:15,123 --> 01:02:16,357
Mm.

1204
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:22,063
What happened?

1205
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:29,437
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

1206
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,439
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

1207
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:33,575
Was it with her?

1208
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:35,643
Your acolyte?

1209
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,616
She drafted something

1210
01:02:40,683 --> 01:02:44,219
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

1211
01:02:44,286 --> 01:02:46,355
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

1212
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:48,123
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

1213
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,894
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

1214
01:02:50,961 --> 01:02:52,494
not his subject matter.

1215
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,596
Oh.

1216
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:56,432
What's the subject matter?

1217
01:02:56,498 --> 01:02:58,133
An English teacher
and a student

1218
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,072
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

1219
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,372
-and "cherry popping."
-Oh.

1220
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:05,240
Those words exactly.

1221
01:03:05,307 --> 01:03:07,142
Show me right now.

1222
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:09,278
Don't...

1223
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:13,115
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

1224
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:17,720
You fuck Fillmore yet?

1225
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:22,324
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

1226
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:24,193
I tell you everything.

1227
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:32,535
<i>"For Jonathan.</i>

1228
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,404
"Love, Cairo."

1229
01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:39,809
Baby, it's a love letter.

1230
01:03:39,877 --> 01:03:41,511
She's got it bad.

1231
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:43,380
Tell me how she describes you.

1232
01:03:43,446 --> 01:03:45,116
-You can read it right there.
-No.

1233
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:47,183
You tell me.

1234
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,787
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

1235
01:03:52,188 --> 01:03:53,823
And I want you
to do the thing.

1236
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:54,925
No. No.

1237
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,595
Tell me.

1238
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:04,200
Uh...

1239
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,169
-"Mr. Murphy...
-Oh.

1240
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,740
"...clever
and carelessly attractive...

"kept his thoughts to himself,
and his eyes at half-mast."

1242
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:18,214
Distract me.

1243
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,452
What would the lady have?

1244
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:23,889
<i>"One might assume</i>

<i>"vague institutional ennui."</i>

1247

Are they?

1257

Are all cunts equal?

1258
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:09,333
Or are some cunts...

1259
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:13,572
remarkable?

1260
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:16,241
Come on, you're, you're,
you're drunk.

1261
01:05:16,308 --> 01:05:18,343
I'm indecent.

1262
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:25,852
Yeah, tell him

1263
01:05:25,918 --> 01:05:26,953
you're drunk textin' him.

1264
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:29,488
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

1265
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:31,456
and what
you might be doin' drunkenly.

1266
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:32,992
Serious?

1267
01:05:33,993 --> 01:05:35,360
Ask him what he's up to.

1268
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,601
Oh, we've got company.

1269
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,436
-They what?
-Hey, seriously.

1270
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:46,538
Stop leaving
this door unlocked.

1271
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,208
For your own safety, okay?

1272
01:05:49,274 --> 01:05:50,475
-Mm-hmm.
-Hello.

1273
01:05:54,312 --> 01:05:56,048
Get a room!

1274
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:57,382
What up, player?

1275
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:59,317
-Slang? Get out.
-Fuck.

1276
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,320
Do you think he likes me?

1277
01:06:02,755 --> 01:06:05,491
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

1278
01:06:09,263 --> 01:06:11,297
'Cause those are very
different things

1279
01:06:11,364 --> 01:06:12,665
for girls who look like you.

1280
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:15,869
I want both.

1281
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,314
You should tell him
you're with me.

1282
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:33,053
And that we're doing
what all girls do

1283
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,154
when they're alone at night.

1284
01:06:35,488 --> 01:06:36,957
Who is she?

1285
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:38,091
Not telling.

1286
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:47,400
"We are measuring
the depths of our sexuality

1287
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:50,704
"within the safe confines
of our friendship."

1288
01:06:51,672 --> 01:06:53,407
Why are you so mean?

1289
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:54,608
-Goddamn.
-Can I help it

1290
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:56,177
if every girl
you've ever dated

1291
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:58,079
owned a pair
of five-inch Lucite heels

1292
01:06:58,146 --> 01:06:59,314
and was named after
a character

1293
01:06:59,379 --> 01:07:00,647
in <i>The Baby-Sitters Club?</i>

1294
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:01,883
-No, I can't.
-No. You can't.

1295
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,085
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

1296
01:07:04,152 --> 01:07:05,485
Yeah, you bein' a snob.

1297
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:07,521
You and I know
Kristy was great.

1298
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,324
He hasn't said anything?

1299
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:17,298
Oh, well, he said,
"Go to bed."

1300
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:18,765
So...

1301
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,674
Take off your shirt.

1302
01:07:31,778 --> 01:07:33,081
What?

1303
01:07:33,147 --> 01:07:35,449
-Why?
-We are gonna make out.

1304
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,751
For him, not for you.

1305
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,824
Well, it can be
a little for me.

1306
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:54,402
How is this?

1307
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,173
Yeah, good.

1308
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,079
Your turn.

1309
01:08:14,522 --> 01:08:15,757
Here ya go.

1310
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,830
Be a little closer
when I take this photo.

1311
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,068
Not like that. What, are you
a fucking Dutch clock?

1312
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,169
I meant like this.

1313
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,505
Close.

1314
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,921
Ready?

1315
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,191
Send it.

1316
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:39,010
Are you gonna text Mr. Miller?

1317
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:42,013
<i>"All warfare is based</i>

1318

1321
01:10:18,016 --> 01:10:19,617
Mm-mm.

1322
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:25,656
You got a title yet?

01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:27,959
<i>Lesser Expectations</i>

1324
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:34,765
I mean, I don't know.

1325
01:10:34,832 --> 01:10:37,235
Hi, Joyce.

1326
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:38,537
-Another beer?
-Mm.

1327
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,072
No, I should go.

1328
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:41,339
-I should get outta here.
-Oh, come on.

1329
01:10:41,406 --> 01:10:42,673
-Don't be boring.
-No. No.

1330
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,311
I got 45 pop quizzes

1331
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:48,013
to fail.

1332
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,881
And we haven't even gotten
to fractals yet.

1333
01:10:49,948 --> 01:10:51,550
Goddamn hopeless youth
of America.

1334
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,285
Well, you're the one
who wanted

1335
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:54,685
to make a difference,
remember?

1336
01:10:54,752 --> 01:10:56,587
Hey, fools rush in.

1337
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,256
-Where's Jonathan?
-Tithing.

1338
01:10:58,323 --> 01:10:59,991
All right, well, look,
tell him I had to run.

1339
01:11:00,058 --> 01:11:01,226
Bye, kiddo.

1340
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:02,328
Bye.

1341
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:10,002
Joyce got the story.

1342
01:11:12,438 --> 01:11:13,672
What?

1343
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:17,642
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."

1344
01:11:18,743 --> 01:11:21,347
...written at
the top, so, you know...

1345
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:23,416
there's no mistakin'.

1346
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,251
And she'd like to speak
to me formally

1347
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:27,719
about the necessary paperwork.

1348
01:11:28,387 --> 01:11:30,622
Paperwork for what?

1349
01:11:31,623 --> 01:11:33,159
An incident report.

1350
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:34,260
Uh...

1351
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:36,362
I think she did it.

1352
01:11:37,696 --> 01:11:39,731
Who did what, huh?

1353
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,902
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

1354
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:48,407
It's a short story, Jonathan.

1355
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:53,080
It's not
<i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>

1356
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:54,348
Mm-hmm. I know.

1357
01:11:58,585 --> 01:12:00,187
But, yeah, but,
it's the, uh...

1358
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:02,489
it's the implication.

1359
01:12:02,556 --> 01:12:05,592
Why if she can convince them

1360
01:12:05,658 --> 01:12:07,861
that somethin' happened
between us, then, uh...

1361
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:11,431
Well, I could lose my job.

1362
01:12:15,735 --> 01:12:17,770
That's not all you could lose.

1363
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:32,152
Did somethin' happen
between you?

1364
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:35,422
Nothin' I invited.

1365
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:41,195
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

1366
01:12:42,129 --> 01:12:44,399
They're full
of emotional violence

1367
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:47,001
-and vituperation.
-Mm-hmm.

1368
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,172
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1369
01:13:39,588 --> 01:13:41,023
Have you seen Cairo?

1370
01:13:43,025 --> 01:13:45,294
-I haven't.
-I haven't seen her.

1371
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:46,828
And I just thought...

1372
01:13:48,697 --> 01:13:50,966
-maybe you had.
-I haven't. No.

1373
01:13:55,704 --> 01:13:58,007
-You don't text?
-She tell you we do?

1374
01:13:58,674 --> 01:14:00,976
Well, you know...

1375
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:06,882
Cairo says everything...

1376
01:14:10,286 --> 01:14:11,320
And nothing.

1377
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,362
I don't understand
what's happening.

1378
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:25,935
Don't you, Winnie?

1379
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:52,862
How did it start?
In your own words.

1380
01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:54,764
We recognized each other.

1381
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,233
She's exceptionally talented.

1382
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,704
Uh, she's singular in that
at this school.

1383
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,305
Did you exhibit favoritism?

1384
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,708
-Give special mentorship?
-Of course.

1385
01:15:04,774 --> 01:15:05,841
He was excited to give me

1386
01:15:05,909 --> 01:15:07,410
the midterm assignment
in advance.

1387
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:09,713
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

1388
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:10,914
It's 25%.

1389
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,116
Enough to destroy my GPA.

1390
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:14,618
<i>You do know</i>
<i>that Henry Miller</i>

1391
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:15,720
<i>is not an approved author</i>

1392
01:15:15,786 --> 01:15:16,954
<i>for public school study,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1393
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:19,423
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.

1394
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:20,591
You know that.

1395
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:22,193
I wanted to help her
stand out.

1396
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:24,962
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

1397
01:15:26,597 --> 01:15:28,132
Have you read his work?

1398
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:29,767
How often have you
been together

1399
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:31,836
beyond the classroom?

1400
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,337
We would see each other
before school,

1401
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:37,308
uh, in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

1402
01:15:38,509 --> 01:15:39,777
And what would you do?

1403
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:41,245
We would talk about literature

1404
01:15:41,312 --> 01:15:43,914
and things that
we cared about.

1405
01:15:45,182 --> 01:15:46,650
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

1406
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:50,755
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

1407
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:51,822
And that, well, that...

1408
01:15:51,889 --> 01:15:53,524
That's how it started,
I guess.

1409
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:54,892
Not...

1410
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:57,795
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

1411
01:15:59,296 --> 01:16:01,532
Do you see each other
socially?

1412
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:02,933
Absolutely not.

1413
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,270
We went to
a poetry reading together.

1414
01:16:05,337 --> 01:16:07,038
Would you consider
yourself friends?

1415
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:08,440
Without question.

1416
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:11,343
We are as close,

1417
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:15,313
uh, as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

1418
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,883
Have you ever been
alone together

1419
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:18,150
outside of school?

1420
01:16:18,216 --> 01:16:19,886
Only a couple of times.

1421
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,953
Y... Yes, sort of.

1422
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,624
Uh, I mistakenly left
with her phone

1423
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:28,861
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her, uh,

1424
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:33,365
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

1425
01:16:33,432 --> 01:16:34,466
to Nashville.

1426
01:16:34,533 --> 01:16:35,868
We didn't actually go,

1427
01:16:35,934 --> 01:16:39,371
but, you know,
we were going to go.

1428
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:42,307
He came to my house.

1429
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:44,342
Were you alone?

1430
01:16:47,746 --> 01:16:48,980
Yes.

1431
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:51,316
My parents were out of town.

1432
01:16:51,383 --> 01:16:52,684
What happened?

1433
01:16:54,786 --> 01:16:56,155
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

1434
01:17:00,026 --> 01:17:01,961
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

1435
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:04,831
I returned her phone.

1436
01:17:04,898 --> 01:17:06,499
Did you go inside the house?

1437
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:12,371
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

1438
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:14,540
When she sent the story,

1439
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:17,076
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

1440
01:17:25,785 --> 01:17:28,154
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

1441
01:17:28,889 --> 01:17:30,122
uh,

1442
01:17:30,723 --> 01:17:32,692
to defend my position here.

1443
01:17:34,928 --> 01:17:36,362
'Cause there isn't.

1444
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:47,608
Jonathan...

1445
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:51,044
are you in love with her?

1446
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,583
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

1447
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:58,685
It's not about my feelings.

1448
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,556
It's what she implies.

1449
01:18:02,623 --> 01:18:04,358
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

1450
01:18:04,424 --> 01:18:06,793
-Oh, fuck me.
-...while you're sittin' there

1451
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:08,195
swiping through pictures

1452
01:18:08,262 --> 01:18:09,763
-of naked students.
-Oh, he's so smart, everybody.

1453
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,899
That's why I deleted it.

1454
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:11,966
You deleted it.

1455
01:18:12,032 --> 01:18:13,400
-Oh, good.
-No. No.

1456
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:15,168
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

1457
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:17,304
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

1458
01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:19,007
-Come on. Jesus.
-Oh, I'm shakin'

1459
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:20,307
in my fuckin' boots.

1460
01:18:20,374 --> 01:18:21,742
You know the difference
between you and me?

1461
01:18:22,877 --> 01:18:25,512
You cannot identify the line.

1462
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,781
So, you cross it.

1463
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:29,483
Right.

1464
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,451
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

1465
01:18:32,586 --> 01:18:34,054
defensive.

1466
01:18:34,121 --> 01:18:36,190
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

1467
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:37,258
You can't be serious.

1468
01:18:37,325 --> 01:18:39,160
-Like you?
-Yes.

1469
01:18:39,227 --> 01:18:40,996
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

1470
01:18:41,062 --> 01:18:42,497
-Mm.
-I don't cross it.

1471
01:18:42,564 --> 01:18:44,699
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

1472
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,370
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

1473
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:50,906
You don't know... Oh, man,

1474
01:18:50,973 --> 01:18:52,674
you think
you're my collateral damage?

1475
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:57,512
-All right, man. Just go, man.
-All right. No, no.

1476
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,681
-Yeah, all right. I will.
-All right, yeah.

1477
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:01,716
-Cool, bro. Mm-hmm.
-Thanks for your help.

1478
01:19:02,183 --> 01:19:03,184
Appreciate that.

1479
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,133
I've been suspended.

1480
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:25,007
Did you fuck her?

1481
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,977
No.

1482
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:28,878
Then what happened?

1483
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:32,348
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

1484
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:35,250
She handed in the story,

1485
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,252
which I obviously
could not accept.

1486
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:39,254
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

1487
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,156
-That's how I understand it.
-Hm.

1488
01:19:41,223 --> 01:19:42,424
So you flirted with her,

1489
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:43,626
-and then, you rejected her.
-No,

1490
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:44,894
-it wasn't flirting.
-What was it then?

1491
01:19:44,961 --> 01:19:46,462
It was affection!

1492
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:50,599
Well, are you
attracted to her?

1493
01:19:55,038 --> 01:19:56,271
I'll tell you.

1494
01:19:57,373 --> 01:20:00,944
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

1495
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:02,478
who read your little book,

1496
01:20:02,544 --> 01:20:04,981
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

1497
01:20:05,048 --> 01:20:07,750
You fucking fell for it.

1498
01:20:07,816 --> 01:20:09,785
Finally. Finally!

1499
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:13,155
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

1500
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:15,058
And you can't help
but get hard for it

1501
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,392
because, what, now suddenly

1502
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,095
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

1503
01:20:18,161 --> 01:20:19,195
Yes!

1504
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:22,332
She made me feel
worth something.

1505
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:23,700
What does that tell you?

1506
01:20:25,402 --> 01:20:29,372
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

1507
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:31,909
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

1508
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:33,743
-Fuck you.
-Oh, be my guest.

1509
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,946
Stop.

1510
01:20:36,013 --> 01:20:37,781
-Did you?
-No, I didn't fuck her.

1511
01:20:37,847 --> 01:20:38,949
Why do you look so guilty?

1512
01:20:39,016 --> 01:20:40,084
I haven't done anything wrong.

1513
01:20:40,151 --> 01:20:43,453
Oh, didn't you?

1514
01:20:47,323 --> 01:20:49,459
God, I'm in hell.

1515
01:20:49,526 --> 01:20:52,129
Well, make yourself at home.

1516
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,931
Why are you so punishing?

1517
01:20:53,998 --> 01:20:55,532
You wanted her.

1518
01:20:55,598 --> 01:20:57,500
I can read it all
in your face.

1519
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,003
How can you see anything
in this state,

1520
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,704
you fuckin' alcoholic?

1521
01:21:02,372 --> 01:21:04,909
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

1522
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:07,845
You are a cunt.

1523
01:21:07,913 --> 01:21:09,513
And you're a liar.

1524
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,415
Liar!

1525
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:15,386
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

1526
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,989
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

1527
01:21:18,056 --> 01:21:21,159
like some middling
American hero.

1528
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:23,494
But, Jon, baby...

1529
01:21:24,495 --> 01:21:26,664
you're the villain.

1530
01:21:31,268 --> 01:21:33,671
But you can't even see that,
can you?

1531
01:21:48,519 --> 01:21:50,321
Don't you worry for me at all?

1532
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:53,524
What would I possibly
worry about

1533
01:21:53,591 --> 01:21:54,893
other than dying of boredom

1534
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,662
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

1535
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:01,500
You...

1536
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:03,468
are...

1537
01:22:04,937 --> 01:22:05,972
vile.

1538
01:22:12,377 --> 01:22:14,379
Why don't you write about it?

1539
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,741
Spit it out, Winnie.

1540
01:22:44,177 --> 01:22:45,544
What are you doing?

1541
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,916
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

1542
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:52,451
Is that all?

1543
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:53,987
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

1544
01:22:55,354 --> 01:22:57,390
if you wish to be
very literal.

1545
01:22:57,456 --> 01:22:59,725
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

1546
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:12,572
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

1547
01:23:12,638 --> 01:23:14,942
-Why?
-He underestimated me.

1548
01:23:15,943 --> 01:23:17,476
I overestimated him.

1549
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:19,445
Are you okay?

1550
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:20,847
I'm inspired.

1551
01:23:22,983 --> 01:23:24,750
-That's not funny.
-It is.

1552
01:23:25,384 --> 01:23:26,719
A little.

1553
01:23:26,786 --> 01:23:29,789
-Please don't do this.
-Why?

1554
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:33,726
You're gonna ruin his life.

1555
01:23:34,261 --> 01:23:35,528
And for what?

1556
01:23:39,366 --> 01:23:41,401
To avenge your rejection?

1557
01:23:43,905 --> 01:23:45,106
To punish him?

1558
01:23:47,374 --> 01:23:49,443
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

1559
01:23:49,509 --> 01:23:51,411
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

1560
01:23:51,478 --> 01:23:53,447
Yes.

1561
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:58,452
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

1562
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,724
I'll testify against you.

1563
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:04,825
No, you won't.

1564
01:24:06,393 --> 01:24:07,862
Excuse me?

1565
01:24:07,929 --> 01:24:10,597
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

1566
01:24:11,866 --> 01:24:13,834
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

1567
01:24:13,902 --> 01:24:15,669
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

1568
01:24:17,838 --> 01:24:20,807
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.

1569
01:24:24,444 --> 01:24:26,446
Oh, hey,
maybe we can double team.

1570
01:24:27,215 --> 01:24:28,716
You played me.

1571
01:24:28,783 --> 01:24:30,518
You knew what we were doing.

1572
01:24:31,086 --> 01:24:32,254
This is not what I meant.

1573
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:33,588
Isn't it, though?

1574
01:24:38,928 --> 01:24:41,596
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?

1575
01:24:41,663 --> 01:24:44,199
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.

1576
01:24:46,035 --> 01:24:47,069
You're right.

1577
01:24:51,106 --> 01:24:53,775
This is, to date,

1578
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:57,812
my greatest achievement.

1579
01:25:14,129 --> 01:25:15,164
"In the end,

1580
01:25:17,232 --> 01:25:19,668
