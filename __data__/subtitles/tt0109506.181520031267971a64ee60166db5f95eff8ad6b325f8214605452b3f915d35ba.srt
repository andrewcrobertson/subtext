1
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,920
People once believed
that when someone dies...

2
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,260
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,753
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

4
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:13,011
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.

5
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,235
Then, sometimes...
just sometimes...

6
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:21,240
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

7
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,582
Hey, Sarge!

8
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,873
Yeah?

9
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:20,362
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

10
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:24,677
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

11
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:28,131
Nobody.

12
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:31,824
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

13
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,979
- All right, guys, let's do it.
- Devil's fuckin' Night.

14
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:38,391
- What's the count so far?
- 143 fires.

15
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,288
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.

16
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:46,168
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!

17
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:52,530
Yeah, I remember.
But you guys just can't come in here
and take her away like this.

18
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:57,032
There are procedures to stick by.
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

19
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,767
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

20
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,722
- We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.

21
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,080
I didn't give the order
to move her.

22
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:07,984
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see why they
took away your gold shield.

23
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:11,973
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

24
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:15,779
All right, clear out of here.

25
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:18,017
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

26
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:25,192
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.

27
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:27,564
Tell him to take care
of Sarah.

28
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:30,738
Look, I will. You just, uh,
lie back. Come on, come on.

29
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,288
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:47,622
Yeah, look. Your sister...
she's gonna be okay.

31
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:51,803
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

32
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,734
She's my friend.
Her and Eric.

33
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:01,855
- You lied to her about Eric.
- Look, I had to.

34
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:05,469
And you're lying
to me about Shelly.

35
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,611
She's gonna die, isn't she?

36
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:13,303
Hey, uh...

37
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:22,190
Now, come on.
Come on, it's okay.

38
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,543
She's gonna be fine.

39
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:49,099
A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.

40
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,836
I used to think
that was true about everything...

41
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,235
families, friends, feelings.

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,254
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...

43
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:04,622
two people who are meant to be
together... nothing can keep them apart.

44
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,605
Later.

45
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,165
What are you,
like the night watchman?

46
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,768
You know, what
this place needs...

47
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:12,825
is a good natural catastrophe.

48
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,991
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.

49
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,794
Mickey, come on, man. You... You got
to put the mustard underneath first.

50
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,236
Maybe a flood
like in the Bible.

51
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,330
Hey, hey, hey, let me do it.

52
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:30,425
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

53
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,951
Come on. Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me. Lots of onions.

54
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:37,410
- All right, here you go.
- Hey, all right.

55
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,154
Now we're talkin'.

56
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:44,630
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

57
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:48,572
- How do you steer that thing
on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.

58
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:52,208
See, now, Sarah, she's a genuine
hot dogger. You hungry?

59
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,517
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.

60
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,214
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?

61
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:01,525
They make you fart big time.

62
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,392
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...

63
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,308
from all the crap
floating around in it.

64
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,551
I wish I could have seen that.

65
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,731
Fire it up! Yeah!

66
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,994
- Fire it up! We busted their machines!
- Shit!

67
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:32,373
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T-Bird, cop car, cop car.

68
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,269
Bad people out
on the street tonight.

69
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:50,720
- Damn it!
- Oh, my God!
- What was that?

70
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:52,824
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

71
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,309
Mickey, call it in for me!

72
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,077
Gabriel!

73
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:33,814
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!

74
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:37,890
Code violations?
Safety hazards?

75
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,214
Place looks fine to me.

76
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:43,069
Let's redecorate.

77
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:48,771
"Abashed, the devil stood...

78
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:52,460
and felt how awful goodness is.

79
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:57,090
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."
It's pornography.

80
00:11:58,581 --> 00:12:00,696
Virtue?

81
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,254
Shelly?

82
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,251
- No! Eric!
- See ya!

83
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:13,061
No, no, no, no, me first.

84
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,371
Please.

85
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,535
- Shelly.
- Eric!

86
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,773
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.

87
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:11,504
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

88
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,530
Look at that.
Look at that.

89
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:18,890
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favourite holiday.

90
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,469
To Devil's Night.

91
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,980
You just go over there
and tell your pals...

92
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,563
You sick fuck.

93
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,504
Are you out of
your motherfuckin' mind, man?

94
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:40,600
Look at that!

95
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:44,037
Pussies drink last, man.

96
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:47,065
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.

97
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,119
That shit ain't even loaded, man.

98
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,386
This one is.

99
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:56,002
Which of you Motor City
motherfuckers...

100
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:58,869
wants to bet me
this one isn't?

101
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:04,659
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!

102
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,871
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!

103
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,755
Fire it up! Fire it up!

104
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:15,237
Here's your shooters.
Put your guns away, huh, guys?

105
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:18,297
- How ya doin'?
- Pussycat.

106
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,322
Boo.

107
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,810
- I love you.
- Say that again.

108
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:57,195
I love you.

109
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:00,453
Oh, boy.

110
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:03,951
Restaurant.

111
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:11,797
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!

112
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,657
Yeah.

113
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,419
- Come here!
- No, no, no, stop!

114
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:01,925
<i>Just paint your face</i>
<i>the shadows smile</i>

115
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:06,634

116

<i>It doesn't matter how you hide</i>

117
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,172
<i>We find you</i>
<i>if we're wanting to</i>

118
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:21,312
<i>So slide back down</i>
<i>and close your eyes</i>

119
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:26,104
<i>Sleep a while</i>
<i>You must be tired</i>

120
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,579
<i>But every night I burn</i>

121
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:31,674
<i>Screaming the animal scream</i>

122
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,002
<i>Every night I burn</i>

123
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:42,180
<i>Dreaming the crow-black dream</i>

124
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:51,558
<i>Dreaming the crow-black dream</i>

125
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,333
- Couple more rings. That's 24K.
- 24K, huh?

126
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:06,139
- Mm-hmm.
- It's 18K. It's crap.
It's probably fake.

127
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,612
Leather purse. Leather.

128
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:12,763
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?

129
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:15,122
A blood stain that's on here?

130
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:20,517
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

131
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:24,278
Now, you,
take it or leave it.

132
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:27,641
Right there for ya.

133
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,694
Decisions, decisions, yes.

134
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:35,444
You cheap ass, chrome dome...

135
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,778
child molestin',
saprophyte motherfucker.

136
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:41,876
- Close the gate when you go out!
- Oh, I closes up for you...

137
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,313
real good, massa.

138
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:47,176
Fuck you.

139
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:49,815
Yeah, sit on it and twirl,
you dirty scum.

140
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:58,915
Lucky I don't stab
your fat ass.

141
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:19,716

What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead, huh?

150
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,932
Halloween ain't till <i>ma�ana.</i>

151
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,900
Come on.

152
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,003
I'll cut you!

153
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:39,363
Fuck you, murderer!

154
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:42,151
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

155
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:46,256
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.

156
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:49,745
A man and a woman
in a loft a year ago.

157
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,411
- You're out of your motherfucking mind...
- Listen!

158
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:57,234
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them on Halloween.

159
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:02,235
Yeah, yeah, right, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.

160
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,885
Her name was Shelly.

161
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,953
You cut her.
You raped her.

162
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:13,713
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked
her pink ass and she loved it!

163
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:27,893
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you
about murder. It's fun!

164
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:32,617
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.

165
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:39,957
I'd like you to meet
two buddies of mine.

166
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,730
We never miss.

167
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:55,385
Try harder. Try again!

168
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:05,183
Victims. Aren't we all?

169
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:21,991
<i>Sometimes it rains</i>
<i>inside my head</i>

170
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:25,752
<i>When the words run dry</i>

171
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:29,900
<i>And the walls are breathing</i>
<i>Hands are...</i>

172
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:34,275
- Look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?
- Yeah, it's a mess.

173
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:41,658
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you</i>

174
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,475
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

175
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:49,062
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you away</i>

176
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:53,780
- Get out of my way, you worms!
- <i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

177
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:57,731
Give me some of that
over there!

178
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:01,253
Why don't you ladies
come by later? Check me out.

179
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:06,270
Hey, guess what.
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.

180
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:10,846
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

181
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:15,028
Gather your soldiers. You're on
for tomorrow night. No sweat.

182
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:18,641
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

183
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,187
You're thinking
about the past.

184
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,311
Dad gave me this.

185
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:01,486
Fifth birthday.

186
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:06,218
He said childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.

187
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,643
Is she asleep?

188
00:24:28,983 --> 00:24:31,133
I think we broke her.

189
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:38,226
I love her eyes.

190
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,320
Pretty.

191
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:50,075
<i>No, they don't</i>
<i>have to take you away</i>

192
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:59,004
Hey, kid, get the hell
outta the road!

193
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:07,752
<i>I don't hate them</i>

194
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:10,213
<i>But I know them</i>

195
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,108
<i>I don't want them</i>
<i>hangin' 'round</i>

196
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:17,359
<i>I won't roll my bones</i>

197
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,998
Don't fuck with me.

198
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,140
I told you to stay out of here.

199
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,843
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

200
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:31,916
She's busy. Go play with
your dolls or something, okay?

201
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,479
I don't have any dolls.

202
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:40,830
- Get some food, huh?
- Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

203
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:50,233
"Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."

204
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:05,116
Thirty, I go 40 dollars.
And 20 from 60...

205
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:07,719
Who the fuck is this now?

206
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:11,906
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!

207
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:18,553
Go sleep it off
somewhere else, dusthead,
unless you want to get mutilated.

208
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:26,446
Always got to dick off.

209
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,427
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

210
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,950
Hey! Hey!

211
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:42,451
"Suddenly I heard a tapping,
as if someone...

212
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:45,495
gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door."

213
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,600
What are you talking about?

214
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,541
You heard me rapping, right?

215
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,709
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!

216
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:03,608
- I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.
- Yeah?

217
00:27:03,843 --> 00:27:06,993
- Gold.
- You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

218
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:12,860
Oh, shit.

219
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,374
Oh, shit on me!

220
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,039
Shit on me.
Shit on me!

221
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,390
Mr Gideon.
You're not paying attention.

222
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:36,250
No! My hand!

223
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:41,293
I repeat,
a gold engagement ring, yes?

224
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:45,263
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

225
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,693
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

226
00:27:56,812 --> 00:28:01,931
- Who's this sack of shit?
- That's Tin Tin, one of
T-Bird's little helpers.

227
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:05,145
I think you can rule out
accidental death.

228
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:08,034
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

229
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:12,118
This could be a turf hit, but it
doesn't look like your usual gang crap.

230
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:16,998
Oh, come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

231
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,565
I'm supposed to thank you
for that, right?

232
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:22,901
Word to the wise:
Watch your fuckin' mouth.

233
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:26,530
What the hell
do you call that?

234
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:33,913
I call it blood, Detective. I suppose
you'll write it up as graffiti.

235
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:36,862
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

236
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,733
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?
- Don't you know this game?

237
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:52,143
What game are you talking about?
Okay, the rings.
I'll tell you about the rings!

238
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:56,958
They're in that-that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

239
00:28:57,246 --> 00:29:02,194
Take... Take the fucking rings out! You
can choke on them, you son of a bitch!

240
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:08,473
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.

241
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,677
No, no.

242
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,809
No, no, no.

243
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,479
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.

244
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:35,848
Shelly.

245
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,434
I love you.

246
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:56,349
- You have one chance to live.
- Look, man, take anything you want.

247
00:29:56,554 --> 00:30:00,513
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

248
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:04,520
Now you're going to tell me
where to find the rest
of Tin Tin's little party pals.

249
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,681
The Pit. They all
hang out at the Pit.

250
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:12,487
All of T-Birds's little potato-heads
hang out there. And Funboy,
he lives there upstairs, all right?

251
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,574
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.

252
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:19,132
- Shit!
- A whole jolly club...

253
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:21,965
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- With jolly pirate nicknames!

254
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:25,234
- Stop! Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still.

255
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:30,315
Each one of these is a life...

256
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,934
a life you helped destroy.

257
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,599
Look, I'm begging you, all right?
Don't kill me.

258
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,418
I'm not gonna kill you.

259
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:43,555
Your job will be to tell the rest of
them that death is coming for them...

260
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:46,004
tonight.

261
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:56,385
Tell them Eric Draven
sends his regards.

262
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:02,369
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

263
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:06,452
You're nothing but street grease,
ya hear that... street grease,
you motherfucker!

264
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:11,301
- Is that gasoline I smell?
- No, man, no. No!

265
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,896
No! No!

266
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,039
It's on the house, kiddo,
you know that.

267
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:36,424
One root beer.

268
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:41,164
I can't do anything.

269
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:45,643
Your mom, technically,
she's off right now.

270
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:47,947
Yeah, way off.

271
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:56,501
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"

272
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:00,535
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze."

273
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,471
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.

274
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:10,174
And I say
I'm dead and I move.

275
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:13,154
Not one more step.
I'm serious.

276
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:17,507
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.

277
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:22,485
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun? You high?

278
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:25,500
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

279
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:30,330
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

280
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:32,692
Shelly Webster's dead,
my friend.

281
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:37,264
I want you to move over
to the kurb there. Go on,
real nice and easy. Come on. Move it!

282
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,197
Okay, we're gonna
wait here for backup.

283
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:46,703
- It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.

284
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,280
Do you know someone
named T-Bird?

285
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:53,864
He had a friend who shouldn't
have played with knives. Like the coat?

286
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:56,295
You're the guy
that murdered Tin Tin.

287
00:32:56,481 --> 00:33:00,871
- Hey, check it out.
- He was already dead.

288
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:03,871
He died a year ago,
the moment he touched her.

289
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:09,353
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

290
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,379
Get away from there!

291
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:15,973
Cops! Come on!
Get outta here!

292
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:18,563
Leave it, leave it! Run!

293
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,802
Oh, great, great.

294
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:33,207
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell and you
lose him right out in the open.

295
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:39,113
Well, at least he didn't do that walking
against the wind shit. I hate that.

296
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:43,192
- Little early for Devil's Night.
- What the hell is going on, man?

297
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:47,458
You are very restless.

298
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:50,534
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

299
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:55,054
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, you may get it, I know.

300
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:09,621
There are energies
aligning against you.

301
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:12,199
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?

302
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:26,004
Mmm, yummy.

303
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,244
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.

304
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:37,724
Nobody cleared this
little event with me.

305
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,790
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

306
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:42,312
Well, sure.
You must be awful disappointed.

307
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:46,539
I got trouble. One of
my crew got himself perished.

308
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:48,992
- Yeah, and who might that be?
- Tin Tin.

309
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:53,530
Somebody stuck his blades in all
his major organs in alphabetical order.

310
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:59,355
Gentlemen, by all means, I think we
ought to have an introspective moment
of silence for poor old Tin Tin.

311
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:04,746
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

312
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,615
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good. That's very reassuring.

313
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:14,498
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

314
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:19,572
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

315
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:22,942
Call it my need to know.

316
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,248
Let go, you creep!

317
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,374
Nah.

318
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,689
You need to slow down,
you dickhead!

319
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,718
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a buttface.
I could have made it.

320
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:18,951
- What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?
- Sometimes.

321
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:25,807
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

322
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,535
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?

323
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:52,056
Don't thank me. Are we
fighting the good fight?

324
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:56,488
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

325
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:00,876
Annie, look at that.

326
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:05,130
"We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 Caulderon Court Apartments..."

327
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,666
- What is this, a petition?
- A big "kick me" sign...

328
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,763
for a very nice girl who found herself
a cause and the cause got her killed.

329
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,619
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighbourhood?

330
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:18,935
Miss Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

331
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:23,151
You know, the last time
you went snooping around on a case is
when you got put back on the beat.

332
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:27,242
- Yeah, I know.
Torres keeps reminding me.
- Oh, I bet he does.

333
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:39,049
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.

334
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:45,249
- I'm cool.
- You didn't get that file from me,
okay? And don't tell me you owe me one.

335
00:37:45,598 --> 00:37:47,633
Ah, I owe you one!

336
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,718
Yeah, right.

337
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,963
Damn.

338
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,178
Tomorrow night, we can...
we can get high...

339
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,973
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

340
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,956
<i>I am the park</i>

341
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,653
<i>I am glow</i>

342
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,774
<i>In the motherfuckin'dark</i>

343
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,060
<i>I am shocked</i>

344
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,827
<i>And I see</i>

345
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:47,139
<i>I don't want to believe</i>

346
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,160
<i>No more</i>

347
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,519
- There's a big fuckin' bird over there.
- <i>No more</i>

348
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,582
Huh?

349
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:59,666
- <i>No more</i>
- It's a squab.

350
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,434
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

351
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,903
Bird. B-B-Birdie.

352
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,561
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.

353
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:11,594
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie,
birdie, birdie, birdie.

354
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,423
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

355
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,113
Here, Funboy.

356
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,414
What the fuck?

357
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:35,262
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly
gave me a fucking heart attack!

358
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:37,608
Look at him.

359
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,510
Don't sweat it.

360
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:45,218
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

361
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:57,927
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

362
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:05,458
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

363
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:08,529
You need professional help.

364
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:15,566
Bingo!
He shoots. He scores.

365
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,350
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?

366
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:35,184
Stop me if you heard this one.
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

367
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:40,617
Ow.

368
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:44,485
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

369
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:47,086
Don't you ever fuckin' die?

370
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,392
"Can you put me up
for the night?"

371
00:40:55,033 --> 00:41:00,060
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Yes, it fuckin' hurts.

372
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,327
Oh, God.

373
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,774
Look what you've done
to my sheets.

374
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,028
I've got a gun
in my pocket.

375
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:37,749
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?

376
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:59,342
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

377
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:11,024
Look.

378
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:15,552
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

379
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,371
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

380
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:35,632
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

381
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:11,417
If I wanted ice, I would have
asked for ice! Now fill it up!

382
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,929
Fill it up yourself,
macho man.

383
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:18,723
I really need this.

384
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:29,045
All right.

385
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:32,304
- You burn yourself playing with matches?
- Fuck off.

386
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:35,558
- You have an appointment.
- Well, shit on me.

387
00:43:35,774 --> 00:43:40,130
- Drink up.
- This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

388
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:43,395
Get my friend here
a glass of blood.

389
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:47,289
- Hey, hey, hon!
- Hey, good night, Darla.

390
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,868
You stay put right there.

391
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:06,463
Get away, steamhead.

392
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:27,658
Shh.

393
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:42,415
<i>Well, as you can see,</i>
<i>I'm here on the corner of 27th Street</i>
<i>and East Washington Place...</i>

394
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:45,949
<i>the site of last year's biggest</i>
<i>Devil's Night conflagration.</i>

395
00:44:46,177 --> 00:44:49,532
<i>It was exactly one year ago</i>
<i>that the building you see</i>
<i>across the street from me...</i>

396
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:51,879
<i>was totally demolished by fire.</i>

397
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:56,527
<i>The fire that was fought</i>
<i>by seven fire companies, but cost</i>
<i>the lives of two fire fighters.</i>

398
00:44:56,812 --> 00:45:01,521
<i>In fact, if it weren't</i>
<i>for the constant surveillance</i>
<i>by the local police precincts...</i>

399
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:04,455
Freeze!

400
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:08,885
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

401
00:45:09,157 --> 00:45:12,627
Fuck.

402
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:15,224
- Good likeness.
- I saw your body, man.

403
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:18,962
You... You died. You got buried.

404
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,597
You still have your hat on.

405
00:45:24,005 --> 00:45:26,359
I gotta sit down.

406
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:32,032
Holy shit.

407
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,111
Say...

408
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:40,426
are you some kind of... of ghost?

409
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:42,565
Boo!

410
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,596
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.

411
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,708
Well, you took a six-story
swan dive out of a window.

412
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,915
She, ah, was beaten and raped.

413
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:08,518
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

414
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,073
I mean, come on.
Read the file.

415
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:15,013
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.

416
00:46:15,264 --> 00:46:18,778
And her body finally
just gave it up.

417
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:22,293
I saw it, man.
I-I couldn't do jack for her.

418
00:46:32,947 --> 00:46:34,778
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

419
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:40,194
Hey.

420
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:45,195
- You okay?
- I saw her.

421
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:52,406
I saw her through your eyes.
You stayed with her the whole time.

422
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:58,268
Yeah, well, you got
to understand something, all right?

423
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:02,273
I was... I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.

424
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,227
Uh, give me something
I could work with.

425
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,996
Yeah. Look, I...

426
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,665
Why didn't you do
something about it?

427
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:17,014
You think any of those people
in that building... even the ones
who signed the petition...

428
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:20,550
would talk after
what happened to you?

429
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,858
I kept asking questions and...

430
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:26,640
finally got busted for sticking my nose
where it wasn't wanted.

431
00:47:30,754 --> 00:47:32,631
This your wife?

432
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:37,109
Yeah, we, uh... Well, not any more.
We're getting a divorce.

433
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:41,970
It's funny.

434
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:45,618
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

435
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:48,083
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

436
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:51,581
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.

437
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:06,721
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

438
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,672
You gonna vanish
into thin air again?

439
00:48:18,635 --> 00:48:21,023
I thought I'd use
your front door.

440
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:29,774
Look, man, um, I'm sorry
as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

441
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:33,794
Yeah.

442
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:40,967
Yeah.

443
00:48:41,991 --> 00:48:44,504
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

444
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:47,216
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

445
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:50,802
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

446
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,113
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

447
00:48:54,336 --> 00:48:56,770
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.

448
00:48:56,964 --> 00:49:01,195
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

449
00:49:01,468 --> 00:49:03,663
He winked at ya?

450
00:49:03,846 --> 00:49:07,633
Musicians.
What else did you see?

451
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:10,724
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're going to do about all this crap!

452
00:49:10,936 --> 00:49:15,804
I mean, what do I get? My livelihood,
it got flushed away and went swirling.

453
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,782
- You ain't lost everything.
- Yeah?

454
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:25,742
And maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!

455
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:28,752
Fair enough. Catch.

456
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:34,759
- Jesus.
- Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

457
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:36,912
What are you tellin' me, this...
You tellin' me this thing is real?

458
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:40,442
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

459
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:44,551
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

460
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:48,795
You know, you're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!

461
00:49:50,725 --> 00:49:53,761
Yeah. Eyes see.

462
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:56,811
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.

463
00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:59,820
Sister? She's supposed
to be your sister?

464
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:03,495
My father's daughter.
That's right.

465
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:07,047
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

466
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:09,955
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.

467
00:50:10,161 --> 00:50:12,675
And a lot of detail.
What do you say?

468
00:50:12,872 --> 00:50:16,181
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

469
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:19,773
He-He told me to tell T-Bird
that death was on its way.

470
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:24,201
Whatever the fuck that means.
And... Draven.

471
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:26,900
He said his name was Eric Draven.

472
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,130
Want to relax that thing now?

473
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:33,775
And this bird man,
he just happened to let you live, huh?

474
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:37,971
You sure you ain't making all of this up
just to save your own ass?

475
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:40,902
I ain't makin' all this up.

476
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:45,578
I ain't twisted
like you two fucks.

477
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:49,608
All right.

478
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:59,152
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.

479
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,369
Yeah.

480
00:51:09,635 --> 00:51:12,468
Oh, for fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

481
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:24,032
- Thanks.
- Funboy said he saw a black bird too.

482
00:51:24,316 --> 00:51:26,511
A big one.

483
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:30,447
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

484
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:34,053
I'll have the janitor, uh,
come on up.

485
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:42,120
You again.
You lost or hungry?

486
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:43,951
Hi.

487
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:51,038
<i>It can't rain all the time...</i>
<i>Can't rain all the time...</i>

488
00:52:51,277 --> 00:52:56,748
<i>Can't rain all the time... Can't rain</i>
<i>all the time... Can't rain all the time...</i>

489
00:53:02,788 --> 00:53:05,222
I don't know how many times I gotta
tell you. We're in this together.

490
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:09,091
We ain't and one part falls
and it all falls.

491
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:11,486
- Do you know how long it took us
to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.

492
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:14,744
That piece of rat shit made Tin Tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll.

493
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:17,196
Tin Tin was a dick.

494
00:53:17,385 --> 00:53:20,138
Tin Tin.

495
00:53:20,347 --> 00:53:24,306
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

496
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,868
Fire it up!

497
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:34,983
- No Funboy.
- Probably still bangin' away on Darla.

498
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:44,454
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.

499
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:46,899
I'm on it.

500
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:19,844
What the fuck are you
supposed to be, man?

501
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:24,133
I'm your passenger.

502
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:33,661
Drive.

503
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:42,674
What's all this happy horseshit?
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!

504
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:51,383
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

505
00:54:51,603 --> 00:54:55,391
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!

506
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:06,804
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

507
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,372
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.

508
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:14,539
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

509
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:19,380
You got that cream stuff?

510
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,192
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

511
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:27,736
What in the crap...

512
00:55:32,352 --> 00:55:34,945
Oh, look.
You're makin' us popular.

513
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:37,819
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

514
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:46,407
<i>This is vehicle 38.</i>
<i>We got us a big ol'red hot rod.</i>

515
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:51,104
Hey!

516
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:57,565
You got somethin' personal, amigo,
we can work it out, right? Huh?

517
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:05,900
Damn! Dead end!

518
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:11,534
Look out!

519
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:17,085
Oh, man, get out of the way!

520
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:32,354
Holy shit!
Goddam foreign cars!

521
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:38,594
Shit! Fuckin'...

522
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:49,347
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.

523
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:53,237
T-Bird, I got you, man!
I'm coming!

524
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:56,749
Shit!

525
00:57:10,364 --> 00:57:12,673
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything.
But I don't know...

526
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:16,939
What? What? Huh? What?
What are you talkin' about?

527
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,833
No, no, no, no, no.
You mean that place downtown?

528
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,961
Yeah, I remember her. We needed to
put some fear into that little lady.

529
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:27,081
She wasn't going along with
our tenant relocation programme.

530
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:32,974
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear
into a total cluster fuck.

531
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:36,261
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history.

532
00:57:36,473 --> 00:57:39,590
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?

533
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,802
Speak to me. Speak!

534
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:47,878
Did you send us these complaints?

535
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,261
Come here.
"Abashed the devil stood."

536
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:54,320
Does it get you sweaty?

537
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:58,764
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

538
00:57:59,036 --> 00:58:01,391
I knew I knew you.

539
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:03,856
But you ain't you.
You can't be you.

540
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:07,477
We put you through the window.
There ain't no comin' back.

541
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:10,749
This is the really real world.
There ain't no comin' back.

542
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:13,240
We killed you dead.
There ain't no comin' back.

543
00:58:16,304 --> 00:58:17,817
T-Bird...

544
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:20,805
There ain't no comin' back!
There ain't no comin' back!

545
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,711
T-Bird.

546
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:33,909
"Abashed the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is."

547
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:36,957
He felt how awful goodness is.

548
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:41,632
He felt...

549
00:58:52,422 --> 00:58:55,732
T-Bird. T-Bird!

Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

558
01:00:17,005 --> 01:00:19,678
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

559
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:22,795
Wait. You loved eggs.

560
01:00:23,012 --> 01:00:25,081
Yeah, when I was five.

561
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:28,778
So what do you want now,
black coffee and cigarettes?

562
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:32,851
So what did you take
to become Mother of the Year?

563
01:00:33,104 --> 01:00:37,336
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

564
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:43,126
- Who?
- Oh, it was nuts.

565
01:00:43,448 --> 01:00:48,441
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

566
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:56,037
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

567
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:59,533
Over easy.

568
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:03,794
I like 'em over easy, Mom.

569
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,538
Hey, Albrecht.

570
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:23,044
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

571
01:01:23,237 --> 01:01:26,273
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.

572
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:30,529
- We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.
- His name is T-Bird.

573
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:34,415
Arson was his specialty. Looks like
he zigged when he should have zagged.

574
01:01:34,665 --> 01:01:39,056
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.

575
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:41,645
Come here.

576
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,322
You're holding out on me.

577
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:51,981
I got a goddam vigilante killer
knockin' off scumbags left and right,
and you're covering up for somebody.

578
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:56,603
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

579
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,881
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?

580
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:02,101
Okay. Gideon's blows all to hell,
and you're having a chitchat
with some weirdo...

581
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,229
who winds up in T-Bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

582
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:07,834
Then you steal one of
my case files from homicide...

583
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:10,306
and you're saying this is just
a fuckin' automobile accident?

584
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,925
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

585
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,714
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good. You know,
you gotta write that shit down.

586
01:02:16,957 --> 01:02:21,825
All right, smart-ass. The captain's got
a little love note waiting for you.

587
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:24,562
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.

588
01:02:24,756 --> 01:02:27,315
Suspension? For what?

589
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:29,738
Misconduct.

590
01:02:31,972 --> 01:02:33,882
Yeah, give me the lab.

591
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:27,165
- One for sorrow, two for joy...
- Come here.

592
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:30,077
And three for a girl
and four for a boy.

593
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:36,879
- Dancing...
- Here I am.

594
01:04:10,276 --> 01:04:12,584
Eric?

595
01:04:15,072 --> 01:04:18,826
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

596
01:04:19,077 --> 01:04:22,148
Gabriel.

597
01:04:22,371 --> 01:04:24,965
I thought you were dead.

598
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,475
You're not dead, are you?

599
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,669
I knew it was you.

600
01:04:58,115 --> 01:05:00,423
Even with the make-up.

601
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:08,135
I remembered your song.

602
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,928
You said, "Can't rain all the time."

603
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,478
That is from your song, right?

604
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:28,361
Come on, Eric, I know you're here.

605
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,813
I miss you and Shelly.

606
01:05:38,237 --> 01:05:40,705
Gets so lonely all by myself.

607
01:05:44,243 --> 01:05:48,521
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

608
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:51,586
Sarah, I do care.

609
01:06:02,302 --> 01:06:05,658
That's him. That's him!
But he looked different.

610
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,005
He was all painted up white
like some kind of dead whore.

611
01:06:08,183 --> 01:06:11,095
I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me in
for some road beers, right?

612
01:06:11,311 --> 01:06:13,779
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

613
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:16,733
And he flash-fried T-Bird
to his fuckin' car!

614
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:20,218
Oh, T-Bird!
Here's to you, buddy.

615
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:24,232
Maybe we oughta just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.

616
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:30,576
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

617
01:06:30,872 --> 01:06:35,468
- Empty.
- Fire it... Grave? What grave?

618
01:06:35,752 --> 01:06:38,982
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.
- Oh, man!

619
01:06:39,213 --> 01:06:41,886
He's working his way
back to this speed freak right here.

620
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:44,606
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.

621
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:48,920
That boy was out of control. T-Bird,
he came in, he says, "Waste 'em both."

622
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:52,413
And now this ghost
gonna kill my ass next!

623
01:06:55,563 --> 01:06:59,272
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

624
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:02,198
- This ghost gonna kill m...
- Hey.

625
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:04,280
It ain't no ghost.

626
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:09,751
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.

627
01:07:09,994 --> 01:07:12,633
We might need him.

628
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,139
Ghost gonna kill my ass.

629
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:32,459
He like his plain or with onions?

630
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:35,716
Fine. Don't talk to me.

631
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:40,213
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

632
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,632
That's what I thought.

633
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:45,127
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

634
01:07:45,321 --> 01:07:47,550
You'll just think I'm nuts.

635
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:51,414
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

636
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,889
You see him too?

637
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:57,309
I saw somebody.

638
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,850
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

639
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:03,394
Eric didn't come back for me.

640
01:08:03,588 --> 01:08:08,742
He can't be my friend any more
because I'm... I'm alive.

641
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:12,327
You want a friend to walk you home?

642
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,795
<i>I am the wicked</i>
<i>I am the wave of the future</i>

643
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,863
<i>Being crucified</i>

644
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:04,136
<i>You things, things</i>
<i>things of the flesh</i>

645
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:06,957
<i>Do it slow</i>

646
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:11,222
<i>Down avenues</i>
<i>"Cut me"</i>

647
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:15,037
<i>Lust my eyes</i>

648
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:21,882
<i>Licking lips encouraging</i>
<i>Mr Careworn</i>

649
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:27,527
<i>To gaze upon the screen</i>
<i>Bask on</i>

650
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:29,793
<i>After the flesh</i>

651
01:09:45,563 --> 01:09:48,679
Boys.

652
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:51,936
It seems our friend T-Bird
won't be joining us this evening...

653
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:54,872
on account of a slight case of death.

654
01:09:55,073 --> 01:09:57,302
You wanna sit down?

655
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:04,479
Well, well, well.
Devil's Night is upon us again.

656
01:10:04,748 --> 01:10:09,697
I thought we'd throw a little party,
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

657
01:10:10,004 --> 01:10:12,278
I like the pretty lights.

658
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:19,061
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm sayin'?

659
01:10:19,346 --> 01:10:23,134
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong.

660
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:27,907
Best reason to quit.
Only reason to quit.

661
01:10:28,188 --> 01:10:32,500
A man has an idea.

662
01:10:32,776 --> 01:10:35,050
The idea attracts others...

663
01:10:35,236 --> 01:10:37,431
like-minded.

664
01:10:37,614 --> 01:10:42,767
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.

665
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:46,923
What was the idea?

666
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:49,478
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

667
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:52,056
And I tell ya, when I used to think
about the idea itself...

668
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:56,212
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

669
01:10:56,466 --> 01:11:02,938
You see, gentlemen,
greed is for amateurs.

670
01:11:03,306 --> 01:11:09,653
Disorder, chaos, anarchy...
now, that's fun!

671
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:13,137
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?

672
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:16,474
I started the first fires
in this goddam city.

673
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:19,765
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shitheel was imitating me.

674
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:23,663
Do you know what they got now?

675
01:11:23,909 --> 01:11:27,787
Devil's Night greeting cards.

676
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,393
Isn't that precious?

677
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,858
Yeah.

678
01:11:33,044 --> 01:11:39,562
The idea has become the institution,
boys. Time to move along.

679
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,233
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?

680
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:44,736
No.

681
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,969
No, I want you to set a fire so goddam
big, the gods'll notice us again.

682
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:50,977
- That's what I'm sayin'.
- Right.

683
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:54,773
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye
one more time and say...

684
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,855
"Are we havin' fun or what?"

685
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,706
- Hey, you! What's your name? Skank!
- Huh? What?

686
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:03,941
- You don't feel that?
- I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.

687
01:12:05,575 --> 01:12:07,884
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook."

688
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:12,230
Well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you.

689
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,451
How the hell'd that thing
get in here?

690
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:21,352
Gentlemen.

691
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,031
Let me go! Let me go! I gotta go!

692
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:37,318
So you're him, huh?
The avenger. The killer of killers.

693
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:42,605
Nice outfit.
Not sure about the face though.

694
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:45,417
I just want him.

695
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:48,048
Well, you can't have him.

696
01:12:48,242 --> 01:12:50,551
- Well...
- Let me go.

697
01:12:52,955 --> 01:12:56,391
I see you have made your decision.

698
01:12:56,626 --> 01:13:00,220
- Now let's see you enforce it.
- Aw, this is already
boring the shit out of me.

699
01:13:00,462 --> 01:13:03,101
Kill him!

700
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,859
Ooh, that had to hurt.

701
01:13:13,642 --> 01:13:15,791
Well, that's that.

702
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:18,172
That guy was crazy.

703
01:13:24,903 --> 01:13:27,417
He's gone.

704
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:32,334
Oh, no!

705
01:13:34,746 --> 01:13:36,384
Get him!

706
01:13:53,556 --> 01:13:56,389
Right here! H-Here, help me!
Help me! He's tryin' to kill me!

707
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:02,944
Jesus Christ!

708
01:14:18,998 --> 01:14:21,148
Hey!

709
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,587
You're all going to die.

710
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,517
Get the fuck outta here!

711
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,218
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?

712
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:58,452
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there. Skank's dead.

713
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,364
That's right.

714
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:13,515
- What in the crap...
- Don't move! Hold it!

715
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,094
That's all she wrote.
Move and we shoot!

716
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:29,034
<i>You are surrounded by police units.</i>
<i>Do not attempt to escape.</i>

717
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:35,628
<i>- Stop running immediately.</i>
- Holy shit!

718
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,400
<i>... spread your arms and legs...</i>

719
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:48,652
<i>Stop immediately.</i>
<i>Lie down, spread your arms and legs...</i>

720
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,999
Come on! Move it!

721
01:17:39,069 --> 01:17:41,536
My advice: Next time duck.

722
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:45,928
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.

723
01:17:49,537 --> 01:17:51,255
Shit!

724
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:59,429
I knew you were going to do that.

725
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:04,545
Look at that out there. The whole
city oughta be in flames by now.

726
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:07,119
The sky oughta be red.

727
01:18:07,305 --> 01:18:11,456
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

728
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:17,163
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

729
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:19,199
I like him already.

730
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:22,350
The crow is his link...

731
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:27,199
between the land of the living
and the realm of the dead.

732
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:31,848
So kill the crow
and destroy the man.

733
01:18:57,979 --> 01:19:00,334
I'm coming home, Shelly.

734
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:52,658
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery
in the middle of the night. Right?

735
01:19:52,908 --> 01:19:57,504
- The safest place in the world to be.
- That's 'cause everybody's dead.

736
01:19:57,788 --> 01:20:00,700
I knew you'd come here.

737
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,191
It's really late, Sarah.

738
01:20:03,377 --> 01:20:06,413
You didn't say goodbye.

739
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:10,509
You're just gonna have to
forgive me for that.

740
01:20:10,759 --> 01:20:13,067
And you're never coming back.

741
01:20:21,353 --> 01:20:24,425
I gave this to Shelly once.

742
01:20:28,276 --> 01:20:31,109
I think she'd like you to have it.

743
01:20:35,284 --> 01:20:38,036
This way you'll always remember her.

744
01:20:38,244 --> 01:20:41,361
I'll never take it off.

745
01:20:58,764 --> 01:21:02,040
I'd better go sneak back in the house.

746
01:21:09,233 --> 01:21:11,986
Bye.

747
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:32,984
Shh. Shh.

748
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:37,272
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.

749
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:46,706
Come on. Come on.

750
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:04,059
What is that, some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

751
01:22:06,248 --> 01:22:08,807
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say? Hmm?

752
01:22:15,298 --> 01:22:18,529
Her eyes are so innocent.

753
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:33,343
Eric! Eric, help! Eric!

754
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,594
Quick impression for you.

755
01:23:18,777 --> 01:23:22,247
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

756
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:25,685
Give me the girl,
and I'll let you walk out of here.

757
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:32,028
Well, well. Why don't you just give me
a minute to think about that, huh?

758
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:43,752
Nah. Fuck it.

759
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:55,028
Aw, fuck.

760
01:24:01,111 --> 01:24:04,182
Well, well, well, it does seem to me
that our little life...

761
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:07,283
has undergone a rather significant
change in the past few minutes.

762
01:24:07,492 --> 01:24:10,483
Now wouldn't you agree?

763
01:24:13,664 --> 01:24:16,939
Well, for a ghost
you bleed just fine.

764
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:22,779
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it.

765
01:24:24,966 --> 01:24:27,241
Bye-bye, birdie.

766
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,677
Aw, shit.

767
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:17,999
Well, I just came by
to pay my respects, and here you are
gettin' all shot up again.

768
01:25:18,269 --> 01:25:20,737
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

769
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:23,247
Two more.

770
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:26,238
- I can handle it. Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

771
01:25:26,443 --> 01:25:30,197
Look, here's the plan. You stay in
front, and when they run out of ammo,
I'll arrest 'em.

772
01:25:30,448 --> 01:25:34,076
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

773
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:39,696
Oh, shit.
You're bleedin' all over the place.

774
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:42,429
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

775
01:25:42,626 --> 01:25:45,936
I was. I'm not any more.

776
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:51,298
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you? Come on.

777
01:25:56,222 --> 01:25:58,019
You take that.

778
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:31,481
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.

779
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:01,496
This is all the power you ever had.
Now it is mine.

780
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:05,537
Pity there is not more time...

781
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,543
for us.

782
01:27:25,728 --> 01:27:28,480
Help me!
Eric, I'm scared!

783
01:27:31,316 --> 01:27:33,625
Let me go!

784
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:45,747
Let her go!

785
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:50,448
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

786
01:27:51,878 --> 01:27:53,994
- All right.
- No!

787
01:28:40,676 --> 01:28:42,553
Eric!

788
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,449
- Sarah?
- Look out!

789
01:29:10,497 --> 01:29:12,806
Eric!

790
01:29:19,714 --> 01:29:24,070
You know, my daddy used to say,
"Every man's got a devil...

791
01:29:24,344 --> 01:29:26,539
and you can't rest till you find him."

792
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:32,238
Whatever happened back there
with you and your girlfriend,
I cleared that building.

793
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,836
Hell, nothin' in this town
happens without my say-so.

794
01:29:36,064 --> 01:29:39,180
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans there, friend.

795
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,278
But if it's any consolation to you...

796
01:29:42,487 --> 01:29:45,558
you have put a smile on my face.

797
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:50,809
You got a lot of spirit, son.
I am gonna miss you.

798
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,397
I have something to give you.
I don't want it any more.

799
01:30:00,045 --> 01:30:02,957
Thirty hours of pain.

800
01:30:05,426 --> 01:30:07,985
All at once!

801
01:30:10,013 --> 01:30:11,890
All for you.

802
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:38,662
Yeah.

803
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,514
Go help him.

804
01:30:53,597 --> 01:30:57,033
Are you alive?

805
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:01,453
God, I need a cigarette.

806
01:31:07,237 --> 01:31:10,273
- Everybody else dead?
- You helped me.

807
01:31:11,741 --> 01:31:14,050
What you kept in here saved me.

808
01:31:14,243 --> 01:31:17,200
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

809
01:31:17,413 --> 01:31:20,564
I've been meaning to
come to church anyway.

810
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,969
Oh, yuck.

811
01:31:29,216 --> 01:31:33,128
I'm quitting as of now, if I live.

812
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:45,084
Stay with him until help comes.

813
01:31:45,274 --> 01:31:49,186
He'll be okay, right?

814
01:31:49,444 --> 01:31:52,277
Eric?

815
01:31:53,824 --> 01:31:56,132
He does that a lot.

816
01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:14,567
Shelly.

817
01:32:32,778 --> 01:32:35,656
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.

818
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:39,904
No, I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

819
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,072
- Look, you go on home. I'm okay.
- Okay.

820
01:32:43,289 --> 01:32:46,679
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

821
01:32:48,835 --> 01:32:52,874
- You missed it.
- Get him out of here.

822
01:33:57,361 --> 01:33:59,670
Thanks.

823
01:34:04,618 --> 01:34:07,769
If the people we love
are stolen from us...

824
01:34:07,997 --> 01:34:12,387
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

825
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:15,580
Buildings burn, people die...

826
01:34:15,796 --> 01:34:18,105
but real love is forever.

827
01:34:36,691 --> 01:34:39,728
<i>We walk the narrow path</i>

828
01:34:42,363 --> 01:34:45,116
<i>Beneath the smoking skies</i>

829
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:51,039
<i>Sometimes barely</i>
<i>tell the difference</i>

830
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:57,294
<i>Between darkness and light</i>

831
01:35:00,882 --> 01:35:02,952
<i>Do we have faith</i>

832
01:35:07,013 --> 01:35:09,083
<i>In what we believe</i>

833
01:35:13,102 --> 01:35:15,662
<i>The truest test</i>

834
01:35:15,855 --> 01:35:18,494
<i>Is when we cannot</i>

835
01:35:18,691 --> 01:35:21,648
<i>When we cannot see</i>

836
01:35:23,696 --> 01:35:26,813
<i>I hear pounding feet in the</i>

837
01:35:27,033 --> 01:35:29,830
<i>In the streets below and the</i>

838
01:35:30,035 --> 01:35:32,993
<i>And the women cried and the</i>

839
01:35:33,206 --> 01:35:36,003
<i>And the children know that there's</i>

840
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,517
<i>There's something wrong</i>

841
01:35:38,711 --> 01:35:42,147
<i>It's hard to believe that love</i>

842
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:45,816
<i>Will prevail</i>

843
01:35:46,051 --> 01:35:51,249
<i>Oh, it won't rain all the time</i>

844
01:35:52,891 --> 01:35:58,567
<i>The sky won't fall forever</i>

845
01:35:58,897 --> 01:36:04,415
<i>And though the night seems long</i>

846
01:36:04,737 --> 01:36:09,366
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

847
01:36:09,658 --> 01:36:14,367
<i>Forever</i>

848
01:36:16,498 --> 01:36:18,011
<i>Oh</i>

849
01:36:20,002 --> 01:36:23,198
<i>When I'm lonely</i>

850
01:36:25,674 --> 01:36:28,393
<i>I lie awake at night</i>

851
01:36:32,305 --> 01:36:37,697
<i>And I wish you were here</i>

852
01:36:40,021 --> 01:36:42,819
<i>I miss you</i>

853
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:47,403
<i>Can you tell me</i>

854
01:36:49,489 --> 01:36:54,004
<i>Is there something more to believe in</i>

855
01:36:56,454 --> 01:37:03,006
<i>Or is this all there is</i>

856
01:37:07,255 --> 01:37:10,053
<i>And the pounding feet in the</i>

857
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:13,057
<i>In the streets below and a</i>

858
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:16,059
<i>And a window breaks and a</i>

859
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:19,461
<i>And a woman falls and there's</i>

860
01:37:19,685 --> 01:37:22,482
<i>There's something wrong</i>
<i>It's</i>

861
01:37:22,687 --> 01:37:25,645
<i>It's hard to believe that love</i>

862
01:37:25,857 --> 01:37:30,088
<i>Will prevail</i>

863
01:37:30,361 --> 01:37:36,197
<i>It won't rain all the time</i>

864
01:37:36,535 --> 01:37:42,211
<i>The sky won't fall forever</i>

865
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:48,058
<i>And though the night seems long</i>

866
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:51,212
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

867
01:37:51,425 --> 01:37:54,336
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

868
01:37:54,552 --> 01:38:00,581
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

869
01:38:00,933 --> 01:38:03,367
<i>Forever</i>

870
01:38:03,561 --> 01:38:06,598
<i>Last night I had a dream</i>

871
01:38:06,815 --> 01:38:10,250
<i>You came into my room</i>

872
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:15,841
<i>You took me into your arms</i>

873
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:19,114
<i>Whispering and kissing me</i>

874
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:24,002
<i>And telling me to still believe</i>

875
01:38:25,749 --> 01:38:28,422
<i>Within the emptiness</i>
<i>of the burning cities</i>

876
01:38:28,628 --> 01:38:31,460
<i>Against which we save</i>
<i>our darkest selves</i>

877
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:34,140
<i>Until I felt safe</i>

878
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,332
<i>And warm</i>

879
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:39,148
<i>I fell asleep in your arms</i>

880
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:41,541
<i>And when I awoke</i>

881
01:38:41,723 --> 01:38:43,839
<i>I cried again</i>

882
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,815
<i>For you were gone</i>

883
01:38:45,977 --> 01:38:49,128
<i>Oh, can you hear me</i>

884
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:53,746
<i>It won't rain all the time</i>

885
01:38:55,362 --> 01:39:01,357
<i>The sky won't fall forever</i>

886
01:39:01,701 --> 01:39:07,537
<i>And though the night seems long</i>

887
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,752
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

888
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,758
<i>Forever</i>

889
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:19,640
<i>It won't rain all the time</i>

01:39:19,969 --> 01:39:25,565
<i>The sky won't fall forever</i>

01:39:25,892 --> 01:39:31,648
<i>And though the night seems long</i>

892
01:39:31,981 --> 01:39:34,779
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

893
01:39:34,984 --> 01:39:37,896
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

894
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:44,380
<i>Your tears won't fall</i>

895
01:39:44,744 --> 01:39:52,297
<i>Forever</i>

896
01:40:11,478 --> 01:40:16,347
<i>Drivin'faster in my car</i>

897
01:40:19,653 --> 01:40:25,170
<i>Falling farther from just what we are</i>

898
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:31,881
<i>Smoke a cigarette and lie some more</i>

899
01:40:32,166 --> 01:40:35,760
<i>These conversations kill</i>

900
01:40:36,002 --> 01:40:40,472
<i>Falling faster in my car</i>

901
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:45,887
<i>Time to take her home</i>

902
01:40:46,096 --> 01:40:50,566
<i>Her dizzy head is conscience laden</i>

903
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:53,523
<i>Time to take a ride</i>

904
01:40:53,728 --> 01:40:58,198
<i>It leaves today</i>
<i>No conversation</i>

905
01:40:58,482 --> 01:41:01,280
<i>Time to take her home</i>

906
01:41:01,486 --> 01:41:06,036
<i>Her dizzy head is conscience laden</i>

907
01:41:06,324 --> 01:41:10,999
<i>Time to wait too long</i>
<i>to wait too long</i>

908
01:41:11,286 --> 01:41:15,359
<i>To wait too long</i>
