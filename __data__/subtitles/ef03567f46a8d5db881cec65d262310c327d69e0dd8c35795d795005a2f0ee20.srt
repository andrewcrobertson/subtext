They were so terrible that I

916

convinced myself
that they were real.

917
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:42,821
But I learned
that those thoughts,

918

It's only a matter of time

we've got these.

And when they do,
they will come for us.

1246

We have to help her.

1247
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,301
The only path forward

1248
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,553
is to prove what they've done.

1249
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,346
Otherwise, no one will believe

they'd gone to such lengths.

1255

I don't understand.

1256
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,207
They need a male.

1257
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,169
They've only birthed females.

1258
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,254
They've all died
except for Carlita.

01:50:18,486 --> 01:50:19,863
I came to warn you.

1622
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:22,699
They know you're alive.

1623
01:50:23,825 --> 01:50:25,285
You weren't supposed
to survive.

1624
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:26,786
None of you were.

1625
01:50:26,828 --> 01:50:28,288
Especially the girl.

1626
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,416
[girl laughing]

1627
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,001
[Brennan] She'll be important,
Margaret.

1628
01:50:35,795 --> 01:50:37,380
I just want to be left alone.

1629
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:40,216
I know.

1630
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:43,887
-But they will come for you.
-[gun cocks]

1631
01:51:01,988 --> 01:51:03,615
They've even
given it a name.

1632
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:06,910
Your son.

1633
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:08,536
[wind whistling]

1634
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:10,413
[Brennan] Damien.

1635
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,874
[♪ dramatic sinister
music playing]

1636
01:54:29,612 --> 01:54:31,906
[♪ eerie music playing]
