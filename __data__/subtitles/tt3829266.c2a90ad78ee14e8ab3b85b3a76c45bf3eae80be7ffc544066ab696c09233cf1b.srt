1
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,341
<i>Picket One, copy.</i>

2
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,000
<i>Do you got eyes on the hostages?</i>

3
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:35,422
Still negative.

4
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,725
<i>20 bucks says they don't show.</i>

5
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:39,791
You two morons really making bets

6
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:42,542
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

7
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,698
<i>Abso-fucking-lutely.
I believe that was implied. Yeah.</i>

8
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:46,950
Just checking. I am in for 20.

9
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,271
I got two hostages.

10
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,386
No crosswind.

11
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,518
I am not waiting.

12
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,047
10-50 out.

13
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,569
Bluebill Two, are you out there?

14
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:07,178
Over.

15
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:15,738
Goddamn it!

16
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:19,077
Dupree, Jesus!

17
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,118
Where is Haines?

18
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:23,746
Don't know.
Comm's not fucking working.

19
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,024
Give me the pack.

20
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:32,532
It's evidence.

21
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:34,858
Aingt nobody gonna believe this one.

22
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,666
The fuck is that, Cap?

23
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,127
It's above our pay grade.

24
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,269
Haines!

25
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,563
Come in. Over.

26
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,640
Haines, goddamn it, come in.
Over!

27
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:54,469
<i>Over!</i>

28
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,547
Sir?

29
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,635
<i>The fuck is that, Cap?</i>

30
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,994
<i>Comm's not fucking working.</i>

31
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:15,633
Haines?

32
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:19,765
Light it up!

33
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,690
Gentlemen, remember.

34
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,584
They are large, they are fast,

35
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,321
and fucking you up,
is their idea of tourism!

36
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,255
Go!

37
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,279
Eyes up! Move!

38
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,423
I want the passenger.
I want the pod.

39
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:24,347
If it's not from here...

40
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,371
You want it.
I want it.

41
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,263
Hola.

42
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:52,663
I need help.

43
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:54,789
And I have money.

44
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,742
I need you to mail this,

45
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,767
for me.

46
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,451
You send it to this address.

47
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:24,465
Mail what's in the pack,

48
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,846
not the backpack.

49
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:27,390
Ahora. Go!

50
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,052
Ok.

51
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,338
Yo. Do it, man.

52
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:23,846
No, you do it.
Ok.

53
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:26,314
Do it.

54
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:44,867
Oh, shit.

55
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:47,802
Looky, looky, loo.

56
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,604
Hey EJ, you hungry?

57
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,206
I am hungry for an ass-burger.

58
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,050
Sounds delicious.

59
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:56,498
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

60
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,592
Oh, yeah.

61
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,651
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,688
He is a goner.
Alright.

63
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,917
Hi, there.

64
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,570
Does, Quinn McKenna live here?

65
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,463
His post office box payments
are past due.

66
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:33,643
Department of Defense.

67
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,213
He works for the government,
does he?

68
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:39,308
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

69
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:42,018
Military designation.

70
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,720
He kills people...

71
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,557
so you can be a mailman.

72
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,239
Dr. Brackett?

73
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,887
I understand you enjoy...

74
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,420
stargazing?

75
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,369
My men will take care of your dog.
Will you come with me, please?

76
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,700
What am I looking at?

77
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,050
It's exactly what you think it is. Yeah.

78
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,073
They ave been here before.

79
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:40,770
'87. '97.

80
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:46,317
Lately, the visits are increasing
in frequency.

81
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,494
Rory, I am home!

82
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,320
Hey, I got you something.

83
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,441
Hey.

84
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,892
Did you do one of these after school?

85
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:09,773
I did all of them.

86
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,179
Ok.

87
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:13,414
Well,

88
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:16,216
I got you two options.

89
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,435
We have...

90
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:20,249
pirate...

91
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:21,374
or...

92
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,754
Frankenstein.

93
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,859
Frankenstein, you know, green skin?

94
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,394
Threw a girl to see if she would float?

95
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:35,924
No. Ok. Well, let's go with pirate.

96
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:36,824
Yeah?

97
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,534
This is dumb.

98
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,542
The guys will...

99
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,140
They will still be able to see.

100
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,476
See what?

101
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:48,478
That it's me.

102
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:52,915
You were once quoted as saying,

103
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,284
I dropped from my mother's womb,

104
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,987
I hit the floor,

105
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,782
and I started crawling through hostile

106
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,467
<i>territory toward my grave.</i>

107
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:04,592
<i>About right, yeah.</i>

108
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:05,896
That's badass.

109
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,115
It's pretty morbid.
It's pretty dark.

110
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,319
What's with the..

111
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,934
Polygraph?
I thought this was a psych eval.

112
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,237
We need to know if you pose a threat.

113
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,472
I am a sniper.

114
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,509
Isn't posing a threat kind
of the fucking point?

115
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:23,313
You spend most of your time
now in country...

116
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,716
estranged from your wife and son?

117
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,989
Look, I get it.

118
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,968
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

119
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:37,927
Excuse me?

120
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,835
You are not here to find out if I am crazy.

121
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:43,367
You wanna make sure the label sticks.

122
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:45,599
So, you feel you are being railroaded?

123
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,504
I can see the tracks on the floor!

124
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,160
I don't see tracks on the floor,
for the record.

125
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,387
You feel like you are a stranger
on your own planet,

126
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,473
don't you, Captain?

127
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,148
Like an alien, you mean?

128
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,987
That's what you wanted.

129
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:06,823
<i>Do I get a cookie now?</i>

130
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:08,890
He saw something.

131
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,059
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,030
You shove me again,
I am gonna break your neck.

133
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,156
Did I say that out loud?

134
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,029
Look... McKenna.

135
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:55,964
Last one.

136
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,668
Thanks for your kindness.
Thank you.

137
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,419
Yeah?

138
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:24,992
You alright over there?

139
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,050
No, don't worry about him.
He is just got Tourettes.

140
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:27,881
He can't control it.

141
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,952
Fuck you Coyle.

142
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,467
You get used to it, bro.

143
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,371
Welcome to Group Two.

144
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:38,640
Yeah? What's that?

145
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:39,974
Like a unit?

146
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,778
No, group. Group Two.

147
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,913
Group therapy, room two.

148
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,882
McKenna.
Nebraska Williams.

149
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,016
That's your real name?

150
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:50,218
Gaylord.

151
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,054
That's a good call, then.
Yeah, I thought so.

152
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:54,988
Where did you serve?

153
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,497
Operation Enduring Freedom, '03.

154
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,418
Went for the Taliban,

155
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,009
stayed for the opium.

156
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:05,681
That's Coyle.

157
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:07,291
Friendly fire incident.

158
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,306
Got turned around,
fired at one of his own vehicles.

159
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,127
Now, he tells jokes.

160
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:15,746
That's Lynch.

161
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,582
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

162
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,084
Entropy.

163
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,318
That's my game.

164
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,653
Things like to fall apart,

165
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:25,503
and I...

166
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:26,966
make it happen.

167
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,823
Just... Just like that.

168
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,779
Hey.
Hey. Don't.

169
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,245
Don't.

170
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,435
That's Nettles.

171
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,772
Ok, I am Nettles.

172
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,805
Did three tours flying Hueys.

173
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,139
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?

174
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,811
Is it end times yet?

175
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:49,303
Yeah, laugh all you want.

176
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,312
But when you are standing at
attention before your Maker.

177
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,270
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

178
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:57,031
God makes shitty people.

179
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,296
Yeah.

180
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:00,671
I mean, why do you think
people make war?

181
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,529
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?

182
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,491
Come on, Baxley!
Because fuck-cock-cock!

183
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,615
Because we fuck cock-cock?
Yes, we fuck cocks.

184
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,483
That's it, because we fuck cocks,
that's why.

185
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,373
We get upset.

186
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:12,034
How did you snag a ticket
on this shit mobile?

187
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,170
Put a bullet in a CO.

188
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:16,772
Any particular reason?

189
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:19,742
He was an asshole.

190
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:44,100
Keep your head down.

191
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,833
Here, throw this on.

192
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,720
Is it just your imagination?

193
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,524
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

194
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,159
Every fucking time?

195
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,395
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

196
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:18,525
<i>The GRC meeting has been moved
to section 3, room A.</i>

197
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,769
There you are!

198
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,469
Welcome.

199
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:24,164
I am Sean Keyes.

200
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:28,342
I heard you basically wrote the book
on evolutionary biology.

201
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:30,078
I am. I am sorry, can I just...

202
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:31,313
Is that?

203
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:35,686
Oh, my God!

204
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,021
Holy shit.

205
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:41,908
That's alien technology.

206
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,828
This is what you brought me here to see?

207
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:47,931
Well, yeah.

208
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,658
Can I...

209
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,625
Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

210
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:52,703
Doc.

211
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:54,800
Let's go.

212
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:09,452
<i>Everything good?
Yes, sir.</i>

213
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,788
<i>What is it?</i>

214
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,756
<i>Dr. Brackett.</i>

215
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,326
<i>Would you like to meet a Predator?</i>

216
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:19,429
<i>Come on.</i>

217
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,840
<i>Please observe decontamination protocol.</i>

218
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:33,442
So, how did they rope you into this?

219
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,098
I wrote a letter to the president
when I was six.

220
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,988
Told him how much I loved animals and,

221
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:40,515
that if NASA ever found a space animal,
they should call me.

222
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:42,301
Couple years ago,

223
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:43,939
I was put on a short list for a...

224
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,525
paper I wrote on hybrid strains.

225
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,033
Computer cross-referenced
the letter and...

226
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:49,683
here I am.

227
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,101
Dr. Brackett.

228
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:00,467
Thanks for coming.

229
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:02,104
I am sure you have questions.

230
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,875
Just two, actually.
Ok.

231
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:07,042
Why do you call it the Predator?

232
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,144
It's a nickname.

233
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:12,548
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.

234
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,117
Exploits weakness.

235
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:15,886
Seems to...

236
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,999
well enjoy it.

237
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,253
Like a game.

238
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,387
That's not a predator, that's a sports hunter.

239
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:22,319
Sorry?

240
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:25,016
A predator kills its prey to survive.
I mean...

241
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:26,852
what you are describing...

242
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,605
is more like a bass fisherman.

243
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,630
Well, we took a vote.
Predator is cooler, right?

244
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:32,234
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

245
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:34,602
Found his escape pod in Mexico.

246
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,420
Still looking for the ship he came in.

247
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,675
He is heavily sedated.

248
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,849
You are one beautiful motherfucker.

249
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,761
I am gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?

250
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,756
Our test results yielded
something a little...

251
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:55,983
odd.

252
00:23:58,426 --> 00:23:59,461
Is this a joke?

253
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:02,133
We ran the genome sequence ten times.

254
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:04,305
This specimen has...

255
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,499
Human DNA?
Yeah.

256
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:06,402
Yeah.

257
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,579
Look, we know about spontaneous speciation.

258
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,398
Mostly plants and insects, but...

259
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:12,754
But some mammals,

260
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:14,734
sheep, goats...
Yeah.

261
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,686
The red wolf is known to be a hybrid

262
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:18,031
between the coyote and the Grey wolf...

263
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,480
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

264
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,918
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

265
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,489
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?

266
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,260
Yeah.

267
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,561
Ok, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,

268
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:34,877
bio helmet and...

269
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:36,049
What are these?

270
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:37,463
Like, some kind of wrist gauntlets?

271
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:38,488
Exactly.

272
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,844
So, where is the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

273
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,203
We have looked, believe me.

274
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,675
Who is this?

275
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,762
He made first contact with the Predator.

276
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:50,812
Great.
I would like to talk to him.

277
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:51,955
Well, he is...

278
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,683
he is being evaluated, so...

279
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:59,402
Ok. Well, before you lobotomize him,

280
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,174
I would like to ask him a few questions.

281
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,169
<i>We have a request to reroute.</i>

282
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,735
Read you five-by-five. Destination?

283
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:09,896
<i>Starkweather Dam.
Proceed at once.</i>

284
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,867
<i>You will be met by military personnel.
Over.</i>

285
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:14,805
Hey, Baxley!

286
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:16,569
Question for you.

287
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:17,727
Alright, here we go.

288
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,207
How do you circumcise
a homeless man?

289
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:21,404
Here it comes.

290
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,643
Kick your mom in the chin.

291
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:24,778
Fuck your mother.
Fuck your mother.

292
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,673
Shut the fuck up!
Alright.

293
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,883
You shut the fuck up.

294
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,395
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

295
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,701
You all going too fucking much.

296
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:36,739
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

297
00:25:36,998 --> 00:25:38,066
Why are you here?

298
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:41,987
Come on man this...

299
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:43,074
is the loony bus.

300
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,833
Look at this motherfucker.
Loonies! Yeah.

301
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:45,876
Loonies.

302
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,935
I had a run-in with a space alien.

303
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:52,405
Shit!

304
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:55,742
No, let him...
Ok, that guy wins.

305
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,077
That's the best story I have ever heard.

306
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:57,969
Classic story...

307
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,055
That's the winner right there.
Fucking hell.

308
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,751
Would you shut the fuck up?

309
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,457
They want to put a lid on it,

310
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:09,833
so here I am.

311
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,326
Stuck in Group Two.

312
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:13,562
The sequel to Group One,
only stupider.

313
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,334
Give this man a fucking cigar.

314
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:21,401
Shut the fuck up.

315
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,036
Would you shut the fuck up?

316
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:27,975
It's a conspiracy.

317
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:30,113
The goddamn space aliens?

318
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:15,225
What are yo doing down there, Rory?

319
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:17,723
Just...

320
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:19,093
playing games.

321
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:20,730
Well, dinner is getting cold.

322
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,634
Major?

323
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,670
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

324
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:31,271
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

325
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,107
Damn it.

326
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,143
We need something in the air.

327
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,567
Get me NORAD.

328
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,522
I feel like I am missing
something in the research.

329
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:40,915
There is something I am just not seeing.

330
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:43,003
Look, if this is the blood.

331
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,176
Ok, I think...

332
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,730
can you just tell me what that is?

333
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,886
Because I was trying to get into this
earlier, but somebody stopped me.

334
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,528
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

335
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,261
That guy actually.
Hold that thought.

336
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,272
NORAD is reporting a 202 anomaly,

337
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:56,566
possibly heading our direction.

338
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:58,275
Is it coming here?

339
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,269
God, I hope not.

340
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:09,642
Holy shit!

341
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:15,994
How far away are we talking about?

342
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,470
<i>Unknown.
But it's definitely heading your way.</i>

343
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,430
<i>Level two alert.</i>

344
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:21,722
<i>Level two alert.</i>
Shit!

345
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,477
Hey, what's happening?
Proximity alert.

346
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,084
Bogey is inbound.
Range 200 miles.

347
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,623
Lock it down.
He is awake!

348
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:28,661
He is awake! He is awake!

349
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:29,463
Hey!

350
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:33,982
Hey, hold him down!
Keep him down!

351
00:28:34,436 --> 00:28:35,503
Hold him down!

352
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,104
Oh, shit!

353
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,936
Doc, on me, now!

354
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,314
Move! Move!

355
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:46,082
Church, Thomas, J.

356
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:09,038
Move!

357
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:18,314
<i>Please observe decontamination protocol.</i>

358
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,790
<i>Chamber secure.</i>

359
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:23,489
<i>Remove outer garments.</i>

<i>This is not a drill.</i>

366
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:20,429
Sit tight.
There is been a breach.

367
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:22,371
Do you have an estimate?

368
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,524
Not right now.

369
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:25,640
I will give you cover fire.

370
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,052
Get him out!

371
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,034
Movement, twelve o'clock!

372
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,425
Hey. Hey.

373
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:53,669
Don't let him get away.

374
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,093
Not my space animal.

375
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:13,088
What the fuck?

376
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:19,128
Alien.

377
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:20,677
Your green boy?

378
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:22,030
Yep.

379
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:24,311
Goddamn space aliens.

380
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:25,480
What? What?

381
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,171
Did you not just fucking see that, man?

382
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:28,836
Am I going fucking mad?

383
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:29,505
Hey.
Shut up.

384
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,639
Take it easy, man.
I didn't fucking see it.

385
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:32,605
Nettles, be quiet.

386
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:34,507
Where the fuck is it?
I wanna see it.

387
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:40,248
That's the thing that killed my men.

388
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:41,916
Yeah, they will do that.

389
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,286
We got to get off this thing.
We got to move.

390
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,821
Brother, it's a bus.

391
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:48,658
It moves.

392
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:54,538
Hey, Baxley!

393
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:56,999
If your mom's vagina were a video game,

394
00:32:57,024 --> 00:32:59,018
it would be rated E for Everyone.

395
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:01,391
Hey!

396
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:03,371
Knock it off.

397
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:07,209
What's the difference between
five big black guys and a joke?

398
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,979
Baxley's mom can't take a joke.

399
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:12,549
What, motherfucker!

400
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:16,741
Come on, bitch!

401
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,673
Everyone on the floor, face down!

402
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:24,936
Face down! Now!
Come on!

403
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,459
Keys!

404
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:37,631
Gun!

405
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:43,642
Hey! Nettles! Nettles!
Wait, hey! Hey!

406
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:45,581
You got him, alright?
You got him, brother.

407
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:06,232
Hey Nebraska, you mind making a detour?

408
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:07,735
What, for your green boy?

409
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:10,345
I am a sniper, just get me close, baby.

410
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,506
You wanna kill him?
Oh, yeah!

411
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:14,907
Why didn't you just say so, man?

412
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,618
You are gonna kill a fucking alien?
Hold on.

413
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:21,649
Fuck!

414
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:16,037
Yo, what the fuck is that?

415
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:58,681
Easy, easy. Hey! Hey!

416
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:06,442
Hey.
Take cover!

417
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
Behind the fucking bus!

418
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,186
Hey! Come on. Come on, I got you.

419
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:12,561
I got you, lady.
Ok.

420
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:14,120
Let's go! Hey.
Come on, come on.

421
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,065
Come on. Goddamn it.

422
00:36:16,428 --> 00:36:17,573
Sorry.
Move!

423
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:18,498
Damn.

424
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,004
Get to the choppers!

425
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:48,661
Stargazer, I got eyes on the woman.

426
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:49,763
Instructions?

427
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:51,663
<i>Eliminate her.</i>
Hey.

428
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,832
<i>Retrieve any contraband.</i>

429
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,136
Roger that Stargazer.

430
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:06,449
That's it, that's it, girl.

431
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,166
Hey Nebraska!

432
00:37:08,282 --> 00:37:09,585
Got it.

433
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:28,131
Everything ok back there?

434
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:33,942
You fucking guys.

435
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:11,247
We found the one place to hide out
where we don't look crazy.

436
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:18,939
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

437
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:20,722
What's it feel like?

438
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,305
Like a gun.

439
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,970
Hey, you think she is safe
in there with them?

440
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:28,897
The girl?

441
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,099
They are soldiers, man.

442
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,616
Sleeping ladies? No, bro.

443
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,731
Sit down.

444
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:42,945
Here.

445
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:46,014
It's the end of times?

446
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,439
Worst thing about the end times...

447
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:53,085
they never fucking are.

448
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:57,009
So...

449
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,095
did he live?

450
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:01,665
Say again?

451
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:03,976
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

452
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:06,374
Yeah.

453
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:07,393
He did.

454
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:08,938
Yeah, and where is he at now?

455
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,566
You are shitting me.
I missed.

456
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,488
Why did you do that?

457
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:21,519
Miss?
No, shoot yourself.

458
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,818
Doctors asked me the same thing.

459
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:28,197
Walked to the hospital
with a bullet in my skull.

460
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,493
Good times.
Hey.

461
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:33,761
Should I be worried?

462
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:41,871
Probably.

463
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,270
There we go.
Did you get that?

464
00:39:45,372 --> 00:39:46,906
That's too close to her hand.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

465
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,673
But then she's gonna drop that there.

466
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:49,975
Guys!

467
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:52,077
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

468
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:54,111
We are trying to make her
feel comfortable.

469
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:55,283
Come on.

470
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,800
She is gonna wake up and see a
bunch of motherfuckers. Come on.

471
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,186
What are you doing?

472
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,588
Nettles! Nettles!

473
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:02,856
Move!

474
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:04,058
Move!

475
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,061
Get out of there!

476
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,043
Morning, sunshine.

477
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,550
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

478
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,327
Chill, hey!

479
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:33,940
I told you she would grab it. Ten bucks!

480
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,010
Pay up.

481
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,600
Fuck it, fuck it.

482
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,359
Where is my phone?

483
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,022
You are not gonna need that.

484
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,893
That's not cool.

485
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,199
It's ok.

486
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:45,935
I said it's ok.

487
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:48,467
Give me the gun.

488
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,503
Give me the gun.
No. No.

489
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:57,510
She pulled.

490
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,646
Shit, I told you she would pull the trigger!

491
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,597
I should have bet you that time!

492
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,360
I like her. I like her.
I should have bet you that time!

493
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:05,651
I like her.
I like her.

494
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:06,987
I like her. I like her a lot.

495
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:08,137
Give me that, ding-dong.

496
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:09,926
Shit! Attagirl.

497
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:13,278
What? You are a scientist?

498
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:15,246
What they got you working on?

499
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,483
You are not gonna last a day out there!

500
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:21,537
What you think, you are special?

501
00:41:22,195 --> 00:41:24,537
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

502
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:26,473
They were gonna shoot her?

503
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:27,410
Yes.

504
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:29,410
I am sorry.

505
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:31,679
Get out of the way.
See you around.

506
00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:35,751
Eat your pussy.

507
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:37,540
Wait, what?

508
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:38,824
How you doing?

509
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,218
No, you just said, Eat your pussy.

510
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,056
Hey...

511
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:42,921
How you doing?
No, you said, Eat my pussy.

512
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,203
What the fuck is wrong with him?

513
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:45,891
I said you are pushy.
He said you are pushy.

514
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:46,958
No, you said, Eat your pussy.

515
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,728
No. I said, Sheesh! You are pushy!

516
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,315
No, you said, Eat my pussy.
No, that's what he said, I heard it.

517
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,173
He said... pushy.
What the fuck?

518
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:54,910
Which is also fucking rude.

519
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:56,611
He doesn't mean your pussy
in particular.

520
00:41:56,636 --> 00:41:58,026
You are insane, right?

521
00:41:58,138 --> 00:41:59,423
Are you fucking insane?
Probably.

522
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:00,549
Well, what's it gonna be?
Maybe.

523
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:02,277
He is fucking crazy.
Fuck you, Baxley.

524
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,336
I feel fine.

525
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,047
They were gonna shoot me?

526
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:06,548
Why?

527
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,010
Maybe because of...

528
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:10,977
this?

529
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,125
Well, I guess I am in.

530
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:20,061
Stay the fuck away from me.

531
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:24,784
What the fuck is this?

532
00:42:26,008 --> 00:42:27,136
What is this?

533
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,417
What is that? Like a unicorn?
A unicorn.

534
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:31,005
It's a unicorn.
A unicorn.

535
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:32,868
I made a unicorn.
I, hey, its...

536
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
I am sorry, it's a piece of shit.
So...

537
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,409
what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?

538
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,124
Maybe staying alive?

539
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,512
We are soldiers.

540
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,048
We are the good guys, ok?

541
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,283
Well, that's debatable.

542
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:45,373
I read your file. The...

543
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:47,354
The guys in Mexico it killed?

544
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,490
They yours?

545
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:50,423
They are gonna need a patsy for that.

546
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,835
You are looking at him.

547
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,131
Yeah, I figured.

548
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,928
Ex-sniper with PTSD?
That's actually kind of perfect.

549
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,340
How about you telling us,

550
00:42:57,365 --> 00:42:58,898
what you were doing in a secret base.

551
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,025
Surrounded by trained soldiers.

552
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:02,093
Mercs.

553
00:43:03,237 --> 00:43:04,685
I am a biologist,

554
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:07,065
and they have me on call in case there is...

555
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,179
contact.

556
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:12,845
What did I tell you?

557
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,725
End days. End days.

558
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,282
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

559
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:17,447
I am gonna set you on fire.

560
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:18,872
Guys, if we wanna keep breathing,

561
00:43:19,257 --> 00:43:20,820
we need to find this thing.

562
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:21,990
Expose it.

563
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:24,126
It's called the Predator.

564
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,303
It hunts people for sport.

565
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:28,761
Technically, that's not a predator.
That's like...

566
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:29,663
Thank you.

567
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:31,398
It's a hunter.
I said the same thing.

568
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:32,898
I said the same thing, a sportsman.
A hunter or a fisherman.

569
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,802
Well, look at you...

570
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:36,005
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

571
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:38,681
Equipment. Weapons.

572
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,602
I took its gear.

573
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:45,811
What?
You took something from the thing?

574
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:46,522
What?

575
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:47,673
So, I would have evidence.

576
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:51,039
I think I know where it's going.

577
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:25,554
What?

578
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,162
Hi, honey, you are home.

579
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:54,046
I am looking for a package.
A package?

580
00:44:54,148 --> 00:44:54,949
Rory!
Hey!

581
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,016
This is not your house anymore!

582
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:57,816
Rory!

583
00:44:58,486 --> 00:44:59,486
Hey, buddy.

584
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:01,041
Where are you?

585
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:02,456
He is not here.

586
00:45:03,187 --> 00:45:04,656
What do you mean, he is not here?

587
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,960
Shit!

588
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,061
What? So we ordered some video games.

589
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:10,963
No! No! No! No! No!

590
00:45:11,065 --> 00:45:13,299
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

591
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:14,869
was so I didn't put you in danger.

592
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:16,702
Goddamn it, we need to find him.

593
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:18,293
Wait Quinn, you are scaring me now.

594
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,327
I specifically said no first-person
shooter. No combat games.

595
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:34,019
Did you ever think that maybe he plays
them to connect with his father?

596
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,447
Oh, my God.
We are doing this again.

597
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,175
Hey! Can you stop taking all my...

598
00:45:39,094 --> 00:45:40,659
Who are these people in my house?

599
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,073
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

600
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:44,077
Good evening.

601
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:47,674
The brushstrokes on this are really
dynamic. It's a wonderful piece.

602
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:49,181
Ok, you need to put that down.

603
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,128
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

604
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:52,386
They are my unit.
They are soldiers.

605
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:53,946
Marines. There is his unit.

606
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,776
Hi. You seem like a really nice...

607
00:45:56,777 --> 00:45:58,309
No, don't touch me. No.

608
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:00,580
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

609
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:02,259
What happened to Haines and Dupree?

610
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:04,818
They are dead.

611
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,936
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

612
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:08,436
What are you talking about?

613
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:09,694
There is something out there.

614
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:11,727
It tore my friends apart.

615
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:13,358
What is it?
Is is like...

616
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,007
it's like a creature.

617
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:16,851
Seriously, it's not a person.
Like from the Bible.

618
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,475
Revelations.
From the Bible?

619
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,399
That's the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

620
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,507
It's a space alien.

621
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:23,337
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

622
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,544
It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

623
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,142
Oh shit!

624
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:28,744
Shit.

625
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:30,185
I want a grid search.

626
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,277
Three teams.

627
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:34,272
Hey!

628
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:36,953
No.
No, no, I am coming with you.

629
00:46:36,978 --> 00:46:38,343
No nix that.

630
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:43,958
Is there a problem?

631
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:47,213
Thing is, we are kind of moving targets.

632
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,604
Yeah, in case you have not
noticed, we are fugitives.

633
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,364
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?

634
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:52,899
I get it. Fine, stay here and watch TV.

635
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,790
You know what?
If you try to split?

636
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:58,004
Or draw the Feds?
Or if you jeopardize my son

637
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:01,340
by your half-assed yardbird bullshit
I will come back here, and I will happily

638
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:03,311
kill every single fucking one of you.

639
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:10,919
Come on brothers. Let's go.

640
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:15,123
Seriously?

641
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,059
It's not our fight.

642
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:23,799
Is your husband the man I think he is?

643
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:25,924
Excuse me?

644
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,158
Tell me about your husband, please?

645
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:32,131
He is a security counter-sniper.

646
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:33,507
Army Rangers.

647
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,786
He supervised,

648
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,777
23 close precision engagements
across five continents,

649
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,770
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

650
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,391
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,

651
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:47,422
to ever receive a Distinguished
Service Medal and the Silver Star.

652
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,692
So, he might be a lousy husband
but he is a good soldier.

653
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,844
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.

654
00:47:56,869 --> 00:47:58,204
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

655
00:47:58,229 --> 00:47:59,531
That's what I thought.

656
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:01,579
Fucking pussies.

657
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:06,474
Where you going Nettles?

658
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,844
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

659
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,368
But...

660
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,292
he called me a pussy
and nobody calls me a pussy, so...

661
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:17,898
Ok.
Fuck off, pussy.

662
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:24,170
Come on Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

663
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,795
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.

664
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:32,815
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move. Hey!

665
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:34,323
You too, lucky charms.

666
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:35,670
Coyle, you wanker.

667
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,112
I would like to watch TV

668
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,456
with you sometime.
Ok.

669
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,464
I liked your speech.
I liked the couch.

670
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:46,609
What's happening? What?

671
00:48:47,403 --> 00:48:49,371
Well, we are finding my son, that's what.

672
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:52,018
Alright, when all this is over...

673
00:48:52,043 --> 00:48:53,802
Fuck me in the face with an aardvark.

674
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,258
I just want to be famous.

675
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,267
Ostensibly,

676
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,930
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

677
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:02,494
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.

678
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,392
You are using ostensibly incorrectly.

679
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:06,931
Is this for me?
This is like the reverse of a clown car.

680
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:09,059
Alright Nebraska, let's find some wheels,

681
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,325
nothing flashy.
Copy.

682
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,775
Alright.

683
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:13,465
Find my son.

684
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:15,254
Casey, you are with me.

685
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:16,872
Let's go.

686
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,413
Hey, ass-burger.

687
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:24,340
What are you supposed to be?

688
00:49:24,365 --> 00:49:25,434
Leave me alone.

689
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:28,294
Or what? You will wash our
hands five hundred times?

690
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:33,533
Trick or treat?

691
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,012
What's the matter, dude?

692
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:43,237
Here is a treat, you little shit.

693
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:24,208
<i>I got a male juvenile.
10 to 12 years old.</i>

694
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:26,464
<i>Metal cast on his arm.</i>
Yo McKenna,

695
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,191
do you hear that?
<i>Ran right in front of my car.</i>

696
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,136
<i>Moving east on Woodruff.</i>

697
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,205
<i>Repeat, moving east on Woodruff.</i>

698
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:42,709
Nebraska, you got wheels?

699
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,968
<i>Yeah, I got wheels.
Something flashy.</i>

700
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:48,601
Listen, the kid's spooked, he is rabbiting.

701
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:51,372
Where is he headed?
Where is some place he knows?

702
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:47,795
There he is.

703
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,003
Dad!

704
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,273
How you doing, buddy?

705
00:52:00,696 --> 00:52:01,730
I am good.

706
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:14,257
Move! Move!

707
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:17,626
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

708
00:52:23,664 --> 00:52:25,101
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

709
00:52:26,612 --> 00:52:27,343
Shit!

710
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:38,110
McKenna!

711
00:52:41,148 --> 00:52:42,824
Take cover!
Take cover!

712
00:53:02,237 --> 00:53:03,936
Williams!
Get the fuck out of there!

713
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:07,417
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

714
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:09,129
Shit! Oh shit!

715
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:14,903
Ok.

716
00:53:24,354 --> 00:53:26,853
Doc, the dreads.
What's that all about?

717
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,323
I don't know.
Maybe like, like sensor receptors.

718
00:53:29,463 --> 00:53:30,798
Kind of like cat whiskers.

719
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:33,913
What the...
I am getting a sample.

720
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,389
It's a fucking space dog.

721
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:37,506
You ok?

722
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,041
What, is your mom cutting your hair now?

723
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:42,833
You kidding me?

724
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,577
This is a once in a lifetime moment.
Shut up. Please shut up.

725
00:53:44,602 --> 00:53:46,221
All I wanted was a little sample.
Please shut up.

726
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:48,214
All I wanted was
a goddamn fucking sample.

727
00:53:48,382 --> 00:53:49,383
Come here.

728
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,967
Sample.

729
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,840
There you go.
Thank you. You are welcome.

730
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:56,930
Fucking space dog, man. It's a fucking...

731
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:58,556
My man, you need to...
I can't. I can't. I can't.

732
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:00,077
Get it together.
I can't do this.

733
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:02,027
Oh, my God!

734
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:03,963
Fucking hell!

735
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:09,337
Fuck!

736
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,386
Go now!

737
00:54:12,321 --> 00:54:13,130
Please!

738
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:14,273
Rory!

739
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:16,116
Shoot him!

740
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:17,445
Shoot him!

741
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:20,355
Hey! No! No! No! No! No!

742
00:54:21,149 --> 00:54:22,817
No! No! No! No! No!

743
00:54:25,085 --> 00:54:27,921
Oh, fuck, fuck. No, no, no! No!

744
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:31,060
Cock! Cock! Fuck! Dick!

745
00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:33,385
Suck! Suck my cock!
Fuck! Goddamn it!

746
00:54:34,996 --> 00:54:36,131
Go! Go! Go!

747
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,009
I got him! I got him!
Go, go, go!

748
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,492
On Williams! On Williams!

749
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:42,424
Hurry!

750
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,550
Take cover!
Move! Move!

751
00:54:51,813 --> 00:54:52,813
Go! Go!

752
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:54,100
Come on!

753
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:55,283
Come on!

754
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,483
FYI, back at Stargazer,

755
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:00,885
I was naked and unarmed,
it walked right past me.

756
00:55:00,887 --> 00:55:03,325
Can you tell your kid to tone
down the psychosis, please?

757
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,626
Let's do this. Let's do this.
Wait and do what?

758
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:14,399
You know, we could keep running,
or we give him back what he wants.

759
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:20,942
What, this is it?

760
00:55:24,149 --> 00:55:25,380
Oh, my God. Shit.

761
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:31,917
Shit.

762
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,730
No, no, no! Move! Move! Move!

763
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,922
Hey, come on.

764
00:55:35,188 --> 00:55:36,253
You good?

765
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:37,157
Fucked!

766
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,510
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Netty, get the vehicle.

767
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:40,801
The rest of you on me.
Copy.

768
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:42,364
Move back.

769
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:59,077
No! No! No!

770
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,081
No!

771
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:17,398
Incoming!

772
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:22,310
What the fuck?

773
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:52,397
Come here!

774
00:56:52,944 --> 00:56:54,518
Roll out! Roll out, let's go!

775
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:56,003
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

776
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:57,973
Move!
Move out, move out!

777
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:01,976
Move! Move out!

778
00:57:02,577 --> 00:57:04,279
Let's go!
Let's move!

779
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:05,683
Come on. Let's go!

780
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:07,738
Go, go, go! Let's go!

781
00:57:07,775 --> 00:57:08,775
Let's go! Let's go!

782
00:57:09,282 --> 00:57:10,105
Move!

783
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:10,874
Move!

784
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,463
Move! Move!
Come on, get in! Come on!

785
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,324
Good! Good! Good!
Good! Good! Good!

786
00:57:20,325 --> 00:57:21,393
Go! Last man!

787
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:23,965
Go! Go! Go!

788
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:42,847
What's the big one?

789
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:44,951
What's the big one, Doc?
Is that like the male?

790
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:46,712
He didn't even give a shit about us.

791
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:47,955
Just wanted to kill that thing.

792
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,824
Quinn, you saw that, right?

793
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:54,993
Guys! Did you see that? He...

794
00:57:55,195 --> 00:57:57,966
He grew an exoskeleton
under his fucking skin.

795
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:02,170
What, are they hunting each other now?

796
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:37,371
We are still sorting through it right now.

797
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:47,880
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
Tell me he is ok.

798
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:49,764
He is fine.
I am going to bring him back.

799
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,312
It's ok, don't say anything, just be safe.
Hey!

800
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:52,587
No! Don't do that!

801
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:53,810
What?

802
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,446
Hello?

803
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:01,128
Damn it.

804
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:03,264
You guys fucked with the wrong family.

805
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,466
How tall?
Witnesses say 11 feet.

806
00:59:08,568 --> 00:59:09,859
That's pretty fucking tall.

807
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:11,371
Ok.

808
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:16,628
Fucked that nigga up.
Sir?

809
00:59:17,543 --> 00:59:18,543
Nothing.

810
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,949
I would be careful with that, sir.

811
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,050
You know what I think?

812
00:59:25,252 --> 00:59:27,403
I think this one went rogue.
A runner.

813
00:59:28,353 --> 00:59:29,354
And the big one?

814
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:30,302
He is a tracker.

815
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:31,759
Sent to take that one out.

816
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:34,752
Some kind of interstellar cops and robbers.

817
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:37,530
Now he is going after that missing ship.

818
00:59:37,831 --> 00:59:39,236
And whatever is on board.

819
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:42,158
I want that fucking ship.

820
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:43,564
We are in the ballpark.

821
00:59:43,836 --> 00:59:45,373
Captain McKenna's son

822
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:46,867
Mother confirms.

823
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:48,688
He has the operating system.

824
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:50,875
Get the fuck out of here.
Thought it was a video game.

825
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:52,445
So, we find the kid, we find the ship.

826
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,115
What the fuck we still standing here for?

827
00:59:55,048 --> 00:59:56,175
You don't want to know what that one is?

828
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,175
I know what it is.
Our big boy is a hunter.

829
00:59:58,252 --> 00:59:59,487
He brought his dogs with him.

830
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:07,850
No, it had to be like a government
experiment or some shit like...

831
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,456
Like a robot or whatever.

832
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,028
Nettles, are you fucking retarded, man?

833
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,865
Use another word, would you?

834
01:00:12,867 --> 01:00:15,017
Yeah, man.
Show a little sensitivity.

835
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:16,469
His son is retarded.

836
01:00:16,804 --> 01:00:17,904
Here you go.

837
01:00:18,306 --> 01:00:19,306
Here you go.

838
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:21,442
He does this from time to time.

839
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:23,211
Just give him a minute.

840
01:00:23,677 --> 01:00:25,246
Hey, Lynch.

841
01:00:26,537 --> 01:00:27,945
What's the deal with these two?

842
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:29,759
Coyle lit up one of his own vehicles?

843
01:00:29,784 --> 01:00:31,157
Back in '09, yeah.

844
01:00:31,181 --> 01:00:32,586
It was bad business. Six dead.

845
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:33,866
What, no survivors?

846
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:35,856
Yeah, there was one.

847
01:00:40,628 --> 01:00:41,896
It's fucking romantic.

848
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,429
Are you kidding me, they are friends?

849
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:46,110
Picture it.
Military inquiries,

850
01:00:46,149 --> 01:00:48,132
sitting outside courtroom,
waiting to go in,

851
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:49,068
side by side,

852
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,838
day after fucking day.
After fucking day.

853
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:52,354
Unbelievable.

854
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:53,707
It's the loonies.

855
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,217
Alright, kid.

856
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:06,219
I have talked to your mother.

857
01:01:06,753 --> 01:01:07,955
She is doing fine.

858
01:01:08,722 --> 01:01:10,157
Mom says you are a killer.

859
01:01:11,657 --> 01:01:13,080
Well, I am a soldier.

860
01:01:14,494 --> 01:01:15,749
What's the difference?

861
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,568
Well, when you like it,

862
01:01:21,142 --> 01:01:22,452
that's when you are a killer.

863
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:26,262
Are you good?

864
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:30,478
Sorry I never grew up.

865
01:01:31,846 --> 01:01:32,844
You know,

866
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:34,544
the way you wanted.

867
01:01:40,487 --> 01:01:41,521
Tell you a secret.

868
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,259
Truth is kid,

869
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,162
I never grew up the way I wanted.

870
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,133
Are we gonna get killed?

871
01:01:58,271 --> 01:01:59,173
Nope.

872
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:01,343
Come on.

873
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:05,071
I am single.
I don't know if you knew that.

874
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,005
No, I could tell that you are single.

875
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:10,115
We got so much
stuff in common, you know like...

876
01:02:10,802 --> 01:02:13,334
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

877
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:14,218
Shit.

878
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:15,521
What?

879
01:02:16,522 --> 01:02:19,100
This is more than spinal fluid.
What does that mean?

880
01:02:19,355 --> 01:02:20,537
If I am right,

881
01:02:21,709 --> 01:02:23,524
they are trying to upgrade themselves.

882
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,287
McKenna, I got something.

883
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:28,235
I think I know what they are up
to on Predator World these days.

884
01:02:28,434 --> 01:02:29,235
You see this?

885
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,561
They found this in the Predator's plexus.

886
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:34,541
So, remember how I told you how
they take people's spines, right?

887
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:36,613
Yeah, for trophies.

888
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:39,043
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,

889
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:42,046
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

890
01:02:42,248 --> 01:02:45,034
Collecting survival traits
from the most high-end specimens.

891
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:47,377
I think they are attempting hybridization.

892
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:50,655
You are just pulling this out of your ass.

893
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,440
Did you not see the new Predator?

894
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:55,536
It's evolving.

895
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,329
Or being upgraded.

896
01:03:04,637 --> 01:03:05,769
That little boy,

897
01:03:05,871 --> 01:03:08,174
managed to figure out alien technology.

898
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,108
You know, a lot of experts say that,

899
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,413
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.

900
01:03:14,147 --> 01:03:16,315
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

901
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,405
Hey, yo!
What the fuck are you...

902
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:19,683
Get the fuck away from me yo!

903
01:03:20,585 --> 01:03:21,358
Casey!

904
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,891
Casey, get inside.

905
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:25,726
Casey!

906
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:28,184
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

907
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:29,485
Casey! Look.

908
01:03:29,828 --> 01:03:31,230
I think this thing is been following us,

909
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:32,031
Alright?

910
01:03:32,332 --> 01:03:34,644
Move, Netty!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

911
01:03:34,669 --> 01:03:36,435
Space dog!
Move, Netty!

912
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:41,740
What the fuck.
Hey! Hey!

913
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:43,367
Hey! Hey! You had your fucking chance.

914
01:03:44,512 --> 01:03:47,144
Look, I am just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

915
01:03:47,646 --> 01:03:49,180
You know, maybe we can
use it or something?

916
01:03:49,182 --> 01:03:51,215
Ok, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

917
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:53,452
We are gonna study it.
That's what we are gonna do with it.

918
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,254
What's to learn? Except Williams
sucks at shooting shit in the head.

919
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:58,118
Williams, you lobotomized him.

920
01:03:58,358 --> 01:03:59,731
Ok, new rule.

921
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,616
No one shoots my fucking dog.

922
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:03,128
There it is.
It's official.

923
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,765
You were right, we can use this.

924
01:04:08,936 --> 01:04:09,937
Shit.

925
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:11,772
Netty, what is that?

926
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,276
Everybody, tighten up.

927
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,175
Little man, come here.
That's an EC-130.

928
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,368
That's not civilian.

929
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:19,516
Shit.
Hey, hey, hey!

930
01:04:19,612 --> 01:04:21,821
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

931
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:23,147
There you go.

932
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,274
Do you wanna help?

933
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:25,883
Go get a helicopter and some pyro.

934
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:27,848
Alright! On me!

935
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:29,086
Now go!

936
01:04:29,188 --> 01:04:31,555
Casey! I will be right back!
No, you won't.

937
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:33,325
Hold on. Hey. See this?

938
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,663
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

939
01:04:35,962 --> 01:04:36,762
Fetch!

940
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:02,256
Where is it?

941
01:05:02,456 --> 01:05:03,457
Where is what?

942
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,561
The device.

943
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:07,058
It goes,

944
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:08,637
right in here.

945
01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:16,290
Ok, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.

946
01:05:16,677 --> 01:05:18,579
Why did he come here? To Earth?

947
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:20,905
The Thing One,
as you called him,

948
01:05:20,907 --> 01:05:23,309
arrived in a hijacked spacecraft.

949
01:05:23,744 --> 01:05:25,211
We think there is something on it.

950
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,279
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

951
01:05:27,981 --> 01:05:29,083
Wait, enemies?

952
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:30,374
Other Predators.

953
01:05:30,841 --> 01:05:31,815
Like that big one.

954
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:34,318
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?

955
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,054
I will help you find it.
We can analyze it...

956
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:37,290
Shut the fuck up!

957
01:05:41,161 --> 01:05:42,596
Why are they here?

958
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,283
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

959
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,869
There was a run on Twinkies?

960
01:05:50,303 --> 01:05:51,937
Snapped up from coast to coast.

961
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:53,741
Get them while they still last.

962
01:05:54,608 --> 01:05:55,609
Remember?

963
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,114
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?

964
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:02,615
Two generations?

965
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:04,648
One?

966
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:06,666
That's why their visits are increasing?

967
01:06:06,885 --> 01:06:09,421
They are trying to snap up
all of our best DNA before we are gone.

968
01:06:09,756 --> 01:06:12,925
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.

969
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:16,141
We are an endangered species,
and they know it.

970
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,869
They thrive in a hothouse environment.

971
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:20,200
Maybe they want to move into ours.

972
01:06:21,034 --> 01:06:22,266
And that dead Predator

973
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:24,160
was bringing us a way to stop them.

974
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:29,006
You have hidden this thing
before, in the mail.

975
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:31,976
So, where is it this time?

976
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,513
Your mother's ass.

977
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,583
Wait, did I say that out loud?

978
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,700
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

979
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:42,420
No, no, no.
That is not for you.

980
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:45,000
That is my son's files and you are
violating his privacy reading that.

981
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:46,450
Madam!
You both need to leave right now.

982
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:48,499
Madam, I don't wanna restrain you.

983
01:06:48,727 --> 01:06:49,493
Really?

984
01:06:49,517 --> 01:06:50,863
Well, why don't you try?

985
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:44,625
<i>You have not found the spacecraft?</i>

986
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:46,351
<i>Why are we trying
to crack the entry code?</i>

987
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,999
Because when we do find it,
would not it be great

988
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,610
if we could get into the fucking thing?
What's that?

989
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:52,759
A map.

990
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:54,417
A map to what?

991
01:07:54,693 --> 01:07:56,461
<i>Give us a clue of where this place is,</i>

992
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:58,396
<i>maybe we can try to get into it.</i>

993
01:07:58,398 --> 01:08:00,534
<i>But if you don't give us
anything, we can't get in!</i>

994
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,824
Hey Rory,

995
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:16,531
I am Will.

996
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:17,425
How you doing?

997
01:08:18,132 --> 01:08:20,153
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

998
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,269
Golf tomorrow?

999
01:08:35,498 --> 01:08:36,566
Why not?

1000
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:39,405
You two never read my file, did you?

1001
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:41,181
What makes you say that?

1002
01:08:41,353 --> 01:08:43,889
Because you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

1003
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:46,287
The worst part is,

1004
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,790
you are making me lie to my son.

1005
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:51,719
What lie did you tell him?

1006
01:08:53,019 --> 01:08:54,555
That I won't enjoy this.

1007
01:09:03,262 --> 01:09:04,831
Hey please, don't.

1008
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:07,472
Look, I don't know what they told you...

1009
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:09,574
Can you just wait for a second?
Just wait!

1010
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,539
No, no, no, no, no!

1011
01:09:12,072 --> 01:09:13,072
No.

1012
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,144
Jeez!

1013
01:09:20,146 --> 01:09:21,414
Oh, my God.

1014
01:09:58,692 --> 01:09:59,735
Nebraska!

1015
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:01,662
Yeah?
You just kill somebody?

1016
01:10:01,687 --> 01:10:02,820
Well, he aingt well.

1017
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:04,055
Untie my friend.

1018
01:10:04,157 --> 01:10:05,658
They got Rory. We got to move.

1019
01:10:05,923 --> 01:10:07,359
Shit, they rough you up?

1020
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:09,493
Did worse on myself, back in the day.

1021
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,665
What do you want to do with this guy?

1022
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,268
Sorry, buddy,
that was a dumb question.

1023
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,505
Yeah, that was a dumb question.

1024
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:32,820
Casey!

1025
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:37,791
Can I interest you in getting
the fuck out of here?

1026
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:40,327
Getting the fuck out of here
is my middle name.

1027
01:10:41,194 --> 01:10:42,793
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1028
01:10:45,599 --> 01:10:47,368
What? What's wrong?

1029
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:52,573
Alright.

1030
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:53,612
Hey!

1031
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:55,037
Just let me unpack this.

1032
01:10:55,062 --> 01:10:56,641
You are saying my son is headed
towards a spaceship

1033
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:57,908
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1034
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,347
11, actually.

1035
01:10:59,412 --> 01:11:00,680
Used to be a contractor.

1036
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:02,613
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

1037
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:04,529
Meaning it's the Chinese menu of DNA.

1038
01:11:04,864 --> 01:11:06,750
Comprised of the deadliest
species in the entire...

1039
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:07,942
In the entire universe, yeah?

1040
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:08,919
Galaxy.

1041
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:09,763
What?

1042
01:11:09,788 --> 01:11:11,756
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1043
01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:13,126
Why go universe? Just saying.

1044
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,327
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1045
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,418
That's what you asked for?

1046
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:31,644
Yeah, that will do.

1047
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,348
Saddle up!

1048
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:39,473
It's the best we could do, man.

1049
01:11:42,588 --> 01:11:44,163
Go ahead. Go!
That's it?

1050
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:46,290
Another one.
The other one!

1051
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:47,860
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1052
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:53,634
Figured something out.
I think we are gonna die.

1053
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,642
We are gonna go hunt and fight
the what, the army?

1054
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:57,803
We are not gonna fight the army

1055
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,700
And some fucking people from space!

1056
01:11:59,725 --> 01:12:01,233
You wanna talk survival?

1057
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,470
Fine!

1058
01:12:02,976 --> 01:12:05,086
You yesterday, you were on a prison bus,

1059
01:12:05,111 --> 01:12:06,392
barking to yourself,

1060
01:12:06,512 --> 01:12:07,979
now you got a gun in your hand.

1061
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:09,449
Who is a survivor now?

1062
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:14,087
We put bullets in our head
and walk to the fucking hospital.

1063
01:12:14,555 --> 01:12:15,823
We are soldiers!

1064
01:12:17,323 --> 01:12:18,791
Nettles, what's our 20?

1065
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:20,872
I can follow your boy's chopper.

1066
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:22,218
I locked into its frequency.

1067
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:38,141
Fence is hot!

1068
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:59,099
What do you say, buddy?

1069
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:01,335
You think you can get us in there?

1070
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:04,203
Because I am not sure that you can.

1071
01:13:04,636 --> 01:13:06,325
Nice reverse psychology.

1072
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:07,907
I can do that too.

1073
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:09,576
Don't go fuck yourself.

1074
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:14,280
That's good. Come on.

1075
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,848
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1076
01:13:16,933 --> 01:13:17,798
Right on.

1077
01:13:18,104 --> 01:13:19,565
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1078
01:13:19,932 --> 01:13:22,135
Been trying to figure out
what these bird-chirping motherfuckers

1079
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,408
been saying since '87.

1080
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,457
Gave the Harvard School
of Linguist is a billion-dollar grant.

1081
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:27,474
Voila.

1082
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,234
Watch your step, come on.

1083
01:13:41,274 --> 01:13:43,976
Goddamn kid, I don't know
where you get it from.

1084
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:13,370
Put the translator into the mainframe.

1085
01:14:13,372 --> 01:14:14,835
Download everything.

1086
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:22,649
What the hell is inside there?

1087
01:14:23,267 --> 01:14:25,861
It's property of Project Stargazer.
That's what the fuck it is.

1088
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:30,153
<i>Code three. Code three.</i>

1089
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:31,959
<i>We have motion
at the south fence line.</i>

1090
01:14:32,224 --> 01:14:33,692
Send a fire team to check it out.

1091
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,063
That's my dad.
He is gonna come save me now.

1092
01:14:36,496 --> 01:14:37,530
Is he?

1093
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,266
Is that what he is gonna do?

1094
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:42,480
I will tell you what, buddy...

1095
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:44,636
if it is your daddy,

1096
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,806
and I truly hope that it is...

1097
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:52,179
he is got to be just about the dumbest
motherfucker I have ever met.

1098
01:14:54,747 --> 01:14:57,982
I mean, a ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1099
01:14:58,184 --> 01:14:59,386
He is got to be...

1100
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,419
creating a diversion.

1101
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:03,823
It's a fucking diversion.

1102
01:15:05,358 --> 01:15:06,624
Oh, shit!

1103
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,102
Howdy.

1104
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:10,444
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1105
01:15:10,862 --> 01:15:12,265
You took my boy, so yeah.

1106
01:15:13,226 --> 01:15:14,228
Told you.

1107
01:15:15,068 --> 01:15:15,869
Take this, son.

1108
01:15:16,502 --> 01:15:17,603
You out of your mind?

1109
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,136
We literally have you surrounded.

1110
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:20,303
That's why you are coming with me.

1111
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:21,773
I just want the boy.
Nobody is got to die.

1112
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:23,276
Dad?

1113
01:15:25,545 --> 01:15:26,743
From here forward.

1114
01:15:26,945 --> 01:15:28,415
Don't look at the dead guy.

1115
01:15:49,202 --> 01:15:50,268
That was pretty good.

1116
01:15:50,515 --> 01:15:52,374
You alright? Did I get you?
No, I am good.

1117
01:15:53,486 --> 01:15:54,550
Welcome back.

1118
01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:56,042
Fuck you. I never left.

1119
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:00,044
You open your mouth,

1120
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:01,879
I am gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1121
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:03,227
Come on, just get behind me.

1122
01:16:03,252 --> 01:16:05,204
<i>All units. They got Traeger.</i>

1123
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,345
<i>They got Traeger.</i>

1124
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,324
Let's go. Let's go.

1125
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,425
Just tell the to put the guns down.

1126
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:22,269
Tell them!

1127
01:16:24,317 --> 01:16:26,851
If Captain McKenna doesn't lower his
weapon in the next 10 seconds

1128
01:16:26,876 --> 01:16:28,532
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1129
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:29,925
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1130
01:16:30,262 --> 01:16:32,528
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1131
01:16:32,553 --> 01:16:34,592
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1132
01:16:34,713 --> 01:16:35,447
Ten.

1133
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:37,515
Nine.

1134
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:39,358
Eight.

1135
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,621
Seven.

1136
01:16:42,255 --> 01:16:44,622
Come on, you just give
the fucking word, man.

1137
01:16:44,623 --> 01:16:45,325
Five.

1138
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:02,242
Oh, shit!

1139
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:05,372
Come on, son!

1140
01:17:07,646 --> 01:17:08,733
Take them down!

1141
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:15,989
Get down, sir.

1142
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:17,200
Let's go, son. Go!

1143
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:18,317
Come on. Come on.

1144
01:17:24,663 --> 01:17:25,765
Ok, take this.

1145
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:28,766
You wanna vanish,

1146
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:30,303
you really vanish son, you understand?

1147
01:17:30,703 --> 01:17:33,139
Alright, we are going home.
I promise you.

1148
01:17:42,849 --> 01:17:44,050
It's here.

1149
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:52,224
No! No! No!

1150
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,145
Come on,
go around the end there!

1151
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,399
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1152
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:02,967
Move, move, move!

1153
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,471
You got him?
Yeah!

1154
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:17,415
Stay back.

1155
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:18,652
Get down! Get down!

1156
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:24,191
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1157
01:18:52,717 --> 01:18:53,613
Alright.

1158
01:18:53,786 --> 01:18:54,886
Hey, McKenna.

1159
01:18:55,227 --> 01:18:57,863
Be reasonable. There is six
of you, seven of us.

1160
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:01,058
Fuck!

1161
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:02,610
Who taught you math?

1162
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:04,965
You aingt the only
fucking sniper, white boy.

1163
01:19:06,832 --> 01:19:08,934
You can walk away from this, Captain.

1164
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:11,134
I just want the ship.

1165
01:19:11,136 --> 01:19:12,360
Dad, he is lying.

1166
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:13,513
Yeah.

1167
01:19:13,538 --> 01:19:14,404
McKenna!

1168
01:19:14,732 --> 01:19:15,774
I don't like this.

1169
01:19:16,141 --> 01:19:17,543
What's he doing in there?

1170
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:31,157
It's using the translator.

1171
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:36,696
<i>Hello. I have enjoyed
watching you kill each other.</i>

1172
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,731
<i>I came here to destroy this vessel.</i>

1173
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:41,555
<i>You cannot have it.</i>

1174
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,969
<i>What you can do is run.</i>

1175
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:47,639
<i>I detect one among you
who is a true warrior.</i>

1176
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:49,791
<i>The one called McKenna.</i>

1177
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:53,380
<i>He will be your leader.</i>

1178
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,080
<i>He will be my prize.</i>

1179
01:19:55,715 --> 01:19:57,583
<i>I offer time advantage.</i>

1180
01:19:58,551 --> 01:19:59,552
<i>Go.</i>

1181
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:01,552
What the fuck is time advantage?

1182
01:20:01,554 --> 01:20:02,622
Like a head start?

1183
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,694
I am gonna wake up on a bus.

1184
01:20:08,661 --> 01:20:10,096
I am gonna wake up on a bus.

1185
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:13,865
Hey!

1186
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:15,246
I am coming out!

1187
01:20:24,978 --> 01:20:25,979
We are in.

1188
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:28,380
Baxley!
Shit!

1189
01:20:29,002 --> 01:20:30,799
Watch where the fuck you are
throwing, dickhead.

1190
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:32,069
Will do.

1191
01:20:32,918 --> 01:20:35,252
Ok, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1192
01:20:35,277 --> 01:20:37,021
McKenna's the one he wants.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1193
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,290
We stay together,
or it will take us one by one.

1194
01:20:39,378 --> 01:20:40,810
He is right. It's their MO.

1195
01:20:40,926 --> 01:20:43,028
Grow a dick, will you?
Nothing is starting!

1196
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:45,097
Son of a bitch. He must have
hacked the vehicles.

1197
01:20:45,197 --> 01:20:47,598
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1198
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,733
Got you.
Hey?

1199
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:50,835
When this is over, you and me,
we are gonna dance.

1200
01:20:50,837 --> 01:20:52,306
I got my shoes all picked out.
Alright.

1201
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:02,548
Fuck.
No, no, no! Don't.

1202
01:21:03,783 --> 01:21:05,685
Here, boy. Fetch.

1203
01:21:06,853 --> 01:21:08,452
Here, boy.

1204
01:21:08,454 --> 01:21:09,456
Here you go.

1205
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:13,783
That was a valuable weapon.

1206
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:17,630
Let's go.
He will be coming for us.

1207
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:57,703
Give me the goody bag.

1208
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:02,042
Hey. On Halloween,
this blew up a whole house.

1209
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,507
How do you shoot it?
You don't.

1210
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:05,776
It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1211
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:07,347
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1212
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,854
I heard something.

1213
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:19,158
Hey, man.
That's Predator technology.

1214
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:24,890
That... It's gonna come back.
You got, a catcher on the wrist.

1215
01:22:25,765 --> 01:22:26,967
That's gonna come back.

1216
01:22:28,467 --> 01:22:29,295
No!

1217
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:32,404
Quiet. Quiet.

1218
01:22:33,204 --> 01:22:35,004
Let me see. Let me see.
My fucking hand.

1219
01:22:35,006 --> 01:22:36,509
Shit.
My fucking hand.

1220
01:22:38,811 --> 01:22:39,774
Gotta be quiet.

1221
01:22:58,764 --> 01:22:59,765
Moving!

1222
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,251
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1223
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,619
There is a clearing up ahead.

1224
01:23:20,987 --> 01:23:23,320
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1225
01:23:23,322 --> 01:23:25,121
Let's find it and trap the motherfucker.

1226
01:23:25,123 --> 01:23:26,156
You guys go set it up.

1227
01:23:26,388 --> 01:23:27,626
We will lure him in.

1228
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:29,443
Who?
You and me.

1229
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,628
Yeah? Alright.

1230
01:23:30,895 --> 01:23:32,298
Yeah.
Let's go.

1231
01:23:33,532 --> 01:23:34,334
Come on.

1232
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:37,838
Can I talk to you for a second?

1233
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:39,069
What's this we shit?

1234
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:41,086
What are you gonna live
forever Coyle, just calm down.

1235
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:41,955
Calm down?

1236
01:23:42,258 --> 01:23:43,340
Me, calm down?

1237
01:23:43,364 --> 01:23:45,052
Yeah, Ok, thanks, twitchy.

1238
01:23:45,077 --> 01:23:47,280
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1239
01:24:10,168 --> 01:24:11,004
Shit!

1240
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:15,207
Ok, fuck this.

1241
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:17,709
Hey! Asshole!

1242
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:19,344
What the fuck was that?

1243
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:21,114
It's a chance for you to survive.

1244
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:23,081
Go! I got this.

1245
01:24:23,282 --> 01:24:25,318
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I have ever heard.

1246
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,293
Come and get us, asshole!

1247
01:24:35,594 --> 01:24:36,594
Contact!

1248
01:24:36,695 --> 01:24:37,963
Alien!
Contact!

1249
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:41,565
Contact!
Alien!

1250
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:42,853
Contact!
He is coming!

1251
01:24:48,207 --> 01:24:50,173
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1252
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:49,936
Light him up!

1253
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:06,186
Coyle!

1254
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,521
Bax, no!

1255
01:26:15,159 --> 01:26:16,095
Traeger!

1256
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:24,369
Baxley!

1257
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:25,672
Die!

1258
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:46,425
Shit.

1259
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:47,860
Fuck.

1260
01:27:10,209 --> 01:27:11,124
Move, move!

1261
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:18,332
Nettles!
Let's go!

1262
01:27:25,063 --> 01:27:26,599
McKenna.

1263
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:30,566
Rory.

1264
01:27:31,336 --> 01:27:32,337
I love you.

1265
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:35,004
Hey! I am the one you want.

1266
01:27:35,006 --> 01:27:37,242
Right here! Come on! You ugly...

1267
01:27:38,344 --> 01:27:39,410
Dad!

1268
01:27:39,912 --> 01:27:40,913
No!

1269
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:45,985
Dad!

1270
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,029
No! No! No!
McKenna

1271
01:27:59,131 --> 01:28:00,463
No! No!

1272
01:28:00,465 --> 01:28:02,631
I hate you, you stupid fucking...

1273
01:28:02,656 --> 01:28:04,356
No! No!

1274
01:28:05,136 --> 01:28:06,371
He said he wanted me.

1275
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:08,238
He said he wanted me!

1276
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:10,597
No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1277
01:28:10,976 --> 01:28:13,279
The next step in the evolutionary chain.

1278
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:15,747
Not you. Your son.

1279
01:28:32,831 --> 01:28:34,326
Yo, he is taking off.

1280
01:28:41,073 --> 01:28:42,073
No!

1281
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:45,876
Come on, man.

1282
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:46,925
Come on.
Come on.

1283
01:28:58,323 --> 01:28:59,625
Let's take it down!

1284
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:00,993
Come on!

1285
01:29:19,078 --> 01:29:20,246
Hang on!

1286
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,885
Fuck! Nebraska!

1287
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:44,870
I got you!

1288
01:29:51,978 --> 01:29:55,280
Dad, there is a force field
coming online. Look out!

1289
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:01,587
Guys! Something is coming!

1290
01:30:03,956 --> 01:30:04,956
Go!

1291
01:30:12,463 --> 01:30:13,666
Netty!

1292
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:19,972
Fuck!

1293
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:21,541
Netty!

1294
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:32,316
Hey, hey, hey.

1295
01:30:32,318 --> 01:30:33,886
No, no, no! Bro!

1296
01:30:34,886 --> 01:30:35,887
Bro.

1297
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:45,230
No.

1298
01:30:54,806 --> 01:30:55,806
Fuck!

1299
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,693
Shit!

1300
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:01,667
Rory!

1301
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,992
Toss it!

1302
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,378
What are you?

1303
01:34:57,448 --> 01:34:58,416
Shut the fuck up.

1304
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:20,338
My unit.

1305
01:35:22,673 --> 01:35:23,975
Nettles.

1306
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:27,378
Coyle.

1307
01:35:29,907 --> 01:35:31,709
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1308
01:35:34,451 --> 01:35:36,221
Baxley had this the whole time.

1309
01:35:39,557 --> 01:35:40,925
Nebraska's bad habit.

1310
01:35:42,527 --> 01:35:43,527
Son...

1311
01:35:43,895 --> 01:35:46,031
these are the ones
that no one is gonna remember.

1312
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:48,600
Just us.

1313
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:51,070
What do you say we put them to rest?

1314
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:36,147
Captain McKenna.

1315
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,317
Hiroshi Yamada.

1316
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:42,323
Sir.
First things first.

1317
01:36:42,558 --> 01:36:44,683
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1318
01:36:44,822 --> 01:36:45,889
He loves it here.

1319
01:36:46,024 --> 01:36:48,074
Yeah, he is something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1320
01:36:48,099 --> 01:36:49,967
Well, I assume that you know by now,

1321
01:36:50,461 --> 01:36:53,030
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1322
01:36:53,164 --> 01:36:54,998
He brought something.
Exactly.

1323
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,635
Now, you want to hear the good news?

1324
01:36:57,869 --> 01:36:59,170
The cargo survived.

1325
01:37:00,076 --> 01:37:01,610
With some sort of fail-safe.

1326
01:37:01,635 --> 01:37:03,869
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1327
01:37:04,227 --> 01:37:05,275
a pod escaped.

1328
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:06,955
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.

1329
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:09,353
It seems that...

1330
01:37:09,517 --> 01:37:11,723
our boy
was not taking any chances.

1331
01:37:12,211 --> 01:37:13,412
He wanted us,

1332
01:37:13,568 --> 01:37:14,574
to have this.

1333
01:37:27,865 --> 01:37:29,868
What is it again you do here, exactly?

1334
01:37:30,435 --> 01:37:33,205
He is the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.

1335
01:37:35,506 --> 01:37:36,675
Hey, kiddo.

1336
01:37:39,206 --> 01:37:40,372
Pretty cool?

1337
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:41,844
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1338
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:43,271
I will make sure to tell Mom.

1339
01:37:44,315 --> 01:37:45,306
So,

1340
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:48,136
this is his gift to humankind?

1341
01:38:04,036 --> 01:38:05,858
Get back! Get back!
Look out!

1342
01:38:06,037 --> 01:38:07,469
Everyone, stand back!

1343
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:08,772
Stand back!
Clear the area!

1344
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,182
Dad, the pod sent me a message.

1345
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:20,915
Rory, what's in that pod?

1346
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:21,962
Don't know!

1347
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:24,721
Oh shit!

1348
01:38:24,722 --> 01:38:26,579
It's got a name!
Name? What name?

1349
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:28,825
I guess you would call it,

1350
01:38:28,827 --> 01:38:30,362
the Predator Killer.

1351
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:32,597
Get him out of here!
Come with me. Let's go.

1352
01:38:34,099 --> 01:38:35,932
Get back.
Clear the area.

1353
01:38:35,934 --> 01:38:37,168
Eyes on it.

1354
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,203
Whatever it is, it appears to be dormant.

1355
01:39:11,943 --> 01:39:13,334
I assume it needs to be...

1356
01:39:14,171 --> 01:39:16,741
Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.

1357
01:39:17,074 --> 01:39:19,577
Get it off!
Get it off me!

1358
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:54,080
What the hell is that?

1359
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:56,080
That's my new suit, bubba.

1360
01:39:58,317 --> 01:40:00,251
I hope they got it in a 42 long.
