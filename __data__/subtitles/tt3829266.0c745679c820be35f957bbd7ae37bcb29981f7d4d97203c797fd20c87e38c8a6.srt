1
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,341
Picket One, copy.

2
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you got eyes on the hostages?

3
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,444
Still negative.

4
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,725
20 bucks says they don't show.

5
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,791
You two morons really making bets

6
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,542
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

7
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:43,852
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I believe that was implied. Yeah.

8
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,950
Just checking. I am in for 20.

9
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,271
I got two hostages.

10
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,386
No crosswind.

11
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:15,518
I am not waiting.

12
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,047
10-50 out.

13
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,569
Bluebill Two, are you out there?

14
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,303
Over.

15
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:14,738
Goddamn it!

16
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,077
Dupree, Jesus!

17
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,118
Where is Haines?

18
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:22,746
Don't know.
Comm's not fucking working.

19
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,024
Give me the pack.

20
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,739
It's evidence.

21
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,858
Aingt nobody gonna believe this one.

22
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,666
The fuck is that, Cap?

23
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,127
It's above our pay grade.

24
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,436
Haines!

25
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:47,563
Come in. Over.

26
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,640
Haines, goddamn it, come in.
Over!

27
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:53,669
Over!

28
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:57,747
Sir?

29
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,635
The fuck is that, Cap?

30
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,994
Comm's not fucking working.

31
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:14,732
Haines?

32
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,901
Light it up!

33
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,690
Gentlemen, remember.

34
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,584
They are large, they are fast,

35
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,321
and fucking you up,
is their idea of tourism!

36
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,255
Go!

37
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,279
Eyes up! Move!

38
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,423
I want the passenger.
I want the pod.

39
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:23,347
If it's not from here...

40
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:24,371
You want it.
I want it.

41
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,363
Hola.

42
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:51,663
I need help.

43
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,789
And I have money.

44
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,742
I need you to mail this,

45
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,767
for me.

46
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,451
You send it to this address.

47
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:23,465
Mail what's in the pack,

48
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,846
not the backpack.

49
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:26,390
Ahora. Go!

50
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,199
Ok.

51
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,338
Yo. Do it, man.

52
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,846
No, you do it.
Ok.

53
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:25,314
Do it.

54
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:43,867
Oh, shit.

55
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:46,802
Looky, looky, loo.

56
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:48,604
Hey EJ, you hungry?

57
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,206
I am hungry for an ass-burger.

58
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,050
Sounds delicious.

59
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:55,498
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

60
00:10:55,523 --> 00:10:56,592
Oh, yeah.

61
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,651
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,688
He is a goner.
Alright.

63
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:23,917
Hi, there.

64
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,570
Does, Quinn McKenna live here?

65
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,463
His post office box payments
are past due.

66
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,643
Department of Defense.

67
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,213
He works for the government,
does he?

68
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:38,308
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

69
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,018
Military designation.

70
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,720
He kills people...

71
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,557
so you can be a mailman.

72
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:01,239
Dr. Brackett?

73
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,887
I understand you enjoy...

74
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:11,420
stargazing?

75
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,804
My men will take care of your dog.
Will you come with me, please?

76
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,700
What am I looking at?

77
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,050
It's exactly what you think it is. Yeah.

78
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,073
They ave been here before.

79
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:39,770
'87. '97.

80
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:45,317
Lately, the visits are increasing
in frequency.

81
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,494
Rory, I am home!

82
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,320
Hey, I got you something.

83
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
Hey.

84
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,892
Did you do one of these after school?

85
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,773
I did all of them.

86
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,379
Ok.

87
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,676
Well,

88
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,216
I got you two options.

89
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,435
We have...

90
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,249
pirate...

91
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:20,574
or...

92
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,754
Frankenstein.

93
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:27,859
Frankenstein, you know, green skin?

94
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,394
Threw a girl to see if she would float?

95
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,924
No. Ok. Well, let's go with pirate.

96
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,149
Yeah?

97
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,534
This is dumb.

98
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,542
The guys will...

99
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,140
They will still be able to see.

100
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:45,476
See what?

101
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:47,478
That it's me.

102
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,915
You were once quoted as saying,

103
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:54,284
I dropped from my mother's womb,

104
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,987
I hit the floor,

105
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,782
and I started crawling through hostile

106
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,467
territory toward my grave.

107
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,592
About right, yeah.

108
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:04,896
That's badass.

109
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:07,115
It's pretty morbid.
It's pretty dark.

110
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,319
What's with the..

111
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,934
Polygraph?
I thought this was a psych eval.

112
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,237
We need to know if you pose a threat.

113
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,472
I am a sniper.

114
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,509
Isn't posing a threat kind
of the fucking point?

115
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:22,313
You spend most of your time
now in country...

116
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,716
estranged from your wife and son?

117
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:31,989
Look, I get it.

118
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,968
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

119
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:36,993
Excuse me?

120
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:39,835
You are not here to find out if I am crazy.

121
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:42,367
You wanna make sure the label sticks.

122
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:44,576
So, you feel you are being railroaded?

123
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,504
I can see the tracks on the floor!

124
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,160
I don't see tracks on the floor,
for the record.

125
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,387
You feel like you are a stranger
on your own planet,

126
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,473
don't you, Captain?

127
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:57,148
Like an alien, you mean?

128
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,987
That's what you wanted.

129
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:05,823
Do I get a cookie now?

130
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:07,890
He saw something.

131
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,059
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,030
You shove me again,
I am gonna break your neck.

133
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,156
Did I say that out loud?

134
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,029
Look... McKenna.

135
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:54,964
Last one.

136
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,668
Thanks for your kindness.
Thank you.

137
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,519
Yeah?

138
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:23,970
You alright over there?

139
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:26,050
No, don't worry about him.
He is just got Tourettes.

140
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:26,881
He can't control it.

141
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:27,952
Fuck you Coyle.

142
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,467
You get used to it, bro.

143
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:36,349
Welcome to Group Two.

144
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:37,640
Yeah? What's that?

145
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:38,974
Like a unit?

146
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,778
No, group. Group Two.

147
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,913
Group therapy, room two.

148
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,860
McKenna.
Nebraska Williams.

149
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,016
That's your real name?

150
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:49,218
Gaylord.

151
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,054
That's a good call, then.
Yeah, I thought so.

152
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:53,988
Where did you serve?

153
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,497
Operation Enduring Freedom, '03.

154
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:58,418
Went for the Taliban,

155
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,009
stayed for the opium.

156
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:04,681
That's Coyle.

157
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,291
Friendly fire incident.

158
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,306
Got turned around,
fired at one of his own vehicles.

159
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,127
Now, he tells jokes.

160
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:14,746
That's Lynch.

161
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:17,582
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

162
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,084
Entropy.

163
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,318
That's my game.

164
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,653
Things like to fall apart,

165
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,777
and I...

166
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:25,966
make it happen.

167
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,823
Just... Just like that.

168
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:33,779
Hey.
Hey. Don't.

169
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,245
Don't.

170
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,435
That's Nettles.

171
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,772
Ok, I am Nettles.

172
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,805
Did three tours flying Hueys.

173
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,139
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?

174
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,811
Is it end times yet?

175
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,303
Yeah, laugh all you want.

176
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,313
But when you are standing at
attention before your Maker.

177
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:52,270
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

178
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,031
God makes shitty people.

179
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,296
Yeah.

180
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,671
I mean, why do you think
people make war?

181
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,529
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?

182
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:03,491
Come on, Baxley!
Because fuck-cock-cock!

183
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,615
Because we fuck cock-cock?
Yes, we fuck cocks.

184
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,483
That's it, because we fuck cocks,
that's why.

185
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:08,508
We get upset.

186
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,034
How did you snag a ticket
on this shit mobile?

187
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:13,170
Put a bullet in a CO.

188
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,772
Any particular reason?

189
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:18,742
He was an asshole.

190
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,100
Keep your head down.

191
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:52,833
Here, throw this on.

192
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:02,720
Is it just your imagination?

193
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,524
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

194
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,159
Every fucking time?

195
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,395
Your attention, please.

196
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:17,525
The GRC meeting has been moved
to section 3, room A.

197
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,769
There you are!

198
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:21,636
Welcome.

199
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,164
I am Sean Keyes.

200
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:27,320
I heard you basically wrote the book
on evolutionary biology.

201
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,078
I am. I am sorry, can I just...

202
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:30,313
Is that?

203
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,686
Oh, my God!

204
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:39,021
Holy shit.

205
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:40,908
That's alien technology.

206
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,828
This is what you brought me here to see?

207
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,931
Well, yeah.

208
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,765
Can I...

209
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,625
Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

210
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:51,901
Doc.

211
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,102
Let's go.

212
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:08,452
Everything good?
Yes, sir.

213
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,788
What is it?

214
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:13,756
Dr. Brackett.

215
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:16,326
Would you like to meet a Predator?

216
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:18,429
Come on.

217
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,840
Please observe decontamination protocol.

218
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:32,442
So, how did they rope you into this?

219
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,098
I wrote a letter to the president
when I was six.

220
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,988
Told him how much I loved animals and,

221
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:39,515
that if NASA ever found a space animal,
they should call me.

222
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,301
Couple years ago,

223
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,939
I was put on a short list for a...

224
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:44,525
paper I wrote on hybrid strains.

225
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:47,033
Computer cross-referenced
the letter and...

226
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,808
here I am.

227
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,101
Dr. Brackett.

228
00:22:58,268 --> 00:22:59,467
Thanks for coming.

229
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,104
I am sure you have questions.

230
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,875
Just two, actually.
Ok.

231
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,042
Why do you call it the Predator?

232
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:08,144
It's a nickname.

233
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,548
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.

234
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:13,117
Exploits weakness.

235
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:14,886
Seems to...

236
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:16,999
well enjoy it.

237
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,231
Like a game.

238
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:20,387
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.

239
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:21,319
Sorry?

240
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:24,016
A predator kills its prey to survive.
I mean...

241
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:25,852
what you are describing...

242
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,605
is more like a bass fisherman.

243
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,630
Well, we took a vote.
Predator is cooler, right?

244
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,234
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

245
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:33,602
Found his escape pod in Mexico.

246
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,420
Still looking for the ship he came in.

247
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,675
He is heavily sedated.

248
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,849
You are one beautiful motherfucker.

249
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,761
I am gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?

250
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:53,756
Our test results yielded
something a little...

251
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,167
odd.

252
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:58,461
Is this a joke?

253
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,133
We ran the genome sequence ten times.

254
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:03,305
This specimen has...

255
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,499
Human DNA?
Yeah.

256
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,701
Yeah.

257
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:08,579
Look, we know about spontaneous speciation.

258
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,398
Mostly plants and insects, but...

259
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,754
But some mammals,

260
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,734
sheep, goats...
Yeah.

261
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,686
The red wolf is known to be a hybrid

262
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,032
between the coyote and the Grey wolf...

263
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,458
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

264
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:21,918
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

265
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,489
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?

266
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Yeah.

267
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,561
Ok, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,

268
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:33,877
bio helmet and...

269
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:35,049
What are these?

270
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,464
Like, some kind of wrist gauntlets?

271
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:37,488
Exactly.

272
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,844
So, where is the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

273
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,203
We have looked, believe me.

274
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,675
Who is this?

275
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,762
He made first contact with the Predator.

276
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,812
Great.
I would like to talk to him.

277
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:50,955
Well, he is...

278
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,683
he is being evaluated, so...

279
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,402
Ok. Well, before you lobotomize him,

280
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:00,174
I would like to ask him a few questions.

281
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,169
We have a request to reroute.

282
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,735
Read you five-by-five. Destination?

283
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,874
Starkweather Dam.
Proceed at once.

284
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,867
You will be met by military personnel.
Over.

285
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:13,805
Hey, Baxley!

286
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:15,569
Question for you.

287
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:16,727
Alright, here we go.

288
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,207
How do you circumcise
a homeless man?

289
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:20,409
Here it comes.

290
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:21,643
Kick your mom in the chin.

291
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:23,778
Fuck your mother.
Fuck your mother.

292
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,673
Shut the fuck up!
Alright.

293
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,883
You shut the fuck up.

294
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,395
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

295
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:33,701
You all going too fucking much.

296
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,739
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

297
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:37,066
Why are you here?

298
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:40,987
Come on man this...

299
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:42,074
is the loony bus.

300
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,833
Look at this motherfucker.
Loonies! Yeah.

301
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:44,876
Loonies.

302
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,935
I had a run-in with a space alien.

303
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:51,405
Shit!

304
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,720
No, let him...
Ok, that guy wins.

305
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:56,055
That's the best story I have ever heard.

306
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:56,969
Classic story...

307
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,055
That's the winner right there.
Fucking hell.

308
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:00,751
Would you shut the fuck up?

309
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,457
They want to put a lid on it,

310
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:08,833
so here I am.

311
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,326
Stuck in Group Two.

312
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,562
The sequel to Group One,
only stupider.

313
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,312
Give this man a fucking cigar.

314
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,379
Shut the fuck up.

315
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:22,036
Would you shut the fuck up?

316
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:26,953
It's a conspiracy.

317
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:29,113
The goddamn space aliens?

318
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,225
What are yo doing down there, Rory?

319
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:16,923
Just...

320
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,093
playing games.

321
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,730
Well, dinner is getting cold.

322
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,634
Major?

323
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,670
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

324
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:30,271
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

325
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,107
Damn it.

326
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,143
We need something in the air.

327
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,567
Get me NORAD.

328
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:38,522
I feel like I am missing
something in the research.

329
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,147
There is something I am just not seeing.

330
00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:42,003
Look, if this is the blood.

331
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,176
Ok, I think...

332
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,730
can you just tell me what that is?

333
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:48,886
Because I was trying to get into this
earlier, but somebody stopped me.

334
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:50,528
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

335
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,261
That guy actually.
Hold that thought.

336
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,272
NORAD is reporting a 202 anomaly,

337
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,566
possibly heading our direction.

338
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,275
Is it coming here?

339
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,300
God, I hope not.

340
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:08,642
Holy shit!

341
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:14,995
How far away are we talking about?

342
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,471
Unknown.
But it's definitely heading your way.

343
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,430
Level two alert.

344
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,722
Level two alert.
Shit!

345
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,477
Hey, what's happening?
Proximity alert.

346
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,084
Bogey is inbound.
Range 200 miles.

347
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:25,623
Lock it down.
He is awake!

348
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:27,639
He is awake! He is awake!

349
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:28,663
Hey!

350
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:32,982
Hey, hold him down!
Keep him down!

351
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,503
Hold him down!

352
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,239
Oh, shit!

353
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,936
Doc, on me, now!

354
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,314
Move! Move!

355
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,082
Church, Thomas, J.

356
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:08,237
Move!

357
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,314
Please observe decontamination protocol.

358
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:20,790
Chamber secure.

359
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,489
Remove outer garments.

360
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,056
Church, Thomas, J.

361
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,582
Church, Thomas, J.

362
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,973
Please observe decontamination protocol.

363
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,938
All personnel, Code Orange.

364
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,072
Code Orange.

365
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,800
This is not a drill.

366
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:19,429
Sit tight.
There is been a breach.

367
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:21,371
Do you have an estimate?

368
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,524
Not right now.

369
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,640
I will give you cover fire.

370
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,052
Get him out!

371
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:28,034
Movement, twelve o'clock!

372
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,425
Hey. Hey.

373
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,669
Don't let him get away.

374
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,093
Not my space animal.

375
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,088
What the fuck?

376
00:32:17,127 --> 00:32:18,128
Alien.

377
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:19,677
Your green boy?

378
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:21,030
Yep.

379
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,311
Goddamn space aliens.

380
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:24,480
What? What?

381
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,171
Did you not just fucking see that, man?

382
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:27,813
Am I going fucking mad?

383
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:28,505
Hey.
Shut up.

384
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:30,617
Take it easy, man.
I didn't fucking see it.

385
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,641
Nettles, be quiet.

386
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,507
Where the fuck is it?
I wanna see it.

387
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:39,248
That's the thing that killed my men.

388
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:40,916
Yeah, they will do that.

389
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:43,286
We got to get off this thing.
We got to move.

390
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:45,821
Brother, it's a bus.

391
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:47,658
It moves.

392
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,538
Hey, Baxley!

393
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,999
If your mom's vagina were a video game,

394
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,018
it would be rated E for Everyone.

395
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,601
Hey!

396
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,371
Knock it off.

397
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:06,209
What's the difference between
five big black guys and a joke?

398
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,979
Baxley's mom can't take a joke.

399
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:11,549
What, motherfucker!

400
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:15,741
Come on, bitch!

401
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,673
Everyone on the floor, face down!

402
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:23,936
Face down! Now!
Come on!

403
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:32,601
Keys!

404
00:33:35,872 --> 00:33:36,872
Gun!

405
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,642
Hey! Nettles! Nettles!
Wait, hey! Hey!

406
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,824
You got him, alright?
You got him, brother.

407
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,232
Hey Nebraska, you mind making a detour?

408
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,735
What, for your green boy?

409
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:09,345
I am a sniper, just get me close, baby.

410
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,506
You wanna kill him?
Oh, yeah!

411
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,907
Why didn't you just say so, man?

412
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,651
You are gonna kill a fucking alien?
Hold on.

413
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:20,793
Fuck!

414
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:15,037
Yo, what the fuck is that?

415
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:57,681
Easy, easy. Hey! Hey!

416
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,442
Hey.
Take cover!

417
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,460
Behind the fucking bus!

418
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,186
Hey! Come on. Come on, I got you.

419
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:11,561
I got you, lady.
Ok.

420
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,120
Let's go! Hey.
Come on, come on.

421
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,065
Come on. Goddamn it.

422
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:16,573
Sorry.
Move!

423
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:17,598
Damn.

424
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:20,004
Get to the choppers!

425
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:47,661
Stargazer, I got eyes on the woman.

426
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:48,763
Instructions?

427
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,663
Eliminate her.
Hey.

428
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,832
Retrieve any contraband.

429
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,136
Roger that Stargazer.

430
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:05,449
That's it, that's it, girl.

431
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,166
Hey Nebraska!

432
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:08,585
Got it.

433
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:27,131
Everything ok back there?

434
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:32,942
You fucking guys.

435
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,309
We found the one place to hide out
where we don't look crazy.

436
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:17,939
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

437
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:19,722
What's it feel like?

438
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:22,305
Like a gun.

439
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:25,970
Hey, you think she is safe
in there with them?

440
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:28,062
The girl?

441
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:30,099
They are soldiers, man.

442
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,616
Sleeping ladies? No, bro.

443
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,731
Sit down.

444
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,945
Here.

445
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,014
It's the end of times?

446
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,439
Worst thing about the end times...

447
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:52,085
they never fucking are.

448
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,009
So...

449
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,095
did he live?

450
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:00,665
Say again?

451
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:02,976
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

452
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:05,374
Yeah.

453
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,393
He did.

454
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,938
Yeah, and where is he at now?

455
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,566
You are shitting me.
I missed.

456
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,488
Why did you do that?

457
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:20,519
Miss?
No, shoot yourself.

458
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,818
Doctors asked me the same thing.

459
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:27,197
Walked to the hospital
with a bullet in my skull.

460
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,493
Good times.
Hey.

461
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:32,761
Should I be worried?

462
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:40,903
Probably.

463
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:44,270
There we go.
Did you get that?

464
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,184
That's too close to her hand.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

465
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,688
But then she's gonna drop that there.

466
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:48,975
Guys!

467
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,155
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

468
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,111
We are trying to make her
feel comfortable.

469
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:54,383
Come on.

470
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:57,013
She is gonna wake up and see a
bunch of motherfuckers. Come on.

471
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,186
What are you doing?

472
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,588
Nettles! Nettles!

473
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:01,986
Move!

474
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,058
Move!

475
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,125
Get out of there!

476
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,043
Morning, sunshine.

477
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,550
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

478
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,327
Chill, hey!

479
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,940
I told you she would grab it. Ten bucks!

480
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:34,010
Pay up.

481
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,600
Fuck it, fuck it.

482
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,375
Where is my phone?

483
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:39,022
You are not gonna need that.

484
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,893
That's not cool.

485
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:43,199
It's ok.

486
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:44,935
I said it's ok.

487
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:47,467
Give me the gun.

488
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,503
Give me the gun.
No. No.

489
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:56,510
She pulled.

490
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,646
Shit, I told you she
would pull the trigger!

491
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,597
I should have bet you that time!

492
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:03,361
I like her. I like her.
I should have bet you that time!

493
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:04,629
I like her.
I like her.

494
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:05,965
I like her. I like her a lot.

495
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,137
Give me that, ding-dong.

496
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:08,926
Shit! Attagirl.

497
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,278
What? You are a scientist?

498
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,246
What they got you working on?

499
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:16,483
You are not gonna last a day out there!

500
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:20,542
What you think, you are special?

501
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:23,537
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

502
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:25,473
They were gonna shoot her?

503
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:26,507
Yes.

504
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:28,410
I am sorry.

505
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,679
Get out of the way.
See you around.

506
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:34,751
Eat your pussy.

507
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:36,540
Wait, what?

508
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:37,824
How you doing?

509
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:39,279
No, you just said, Eat your pussy.

510
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Hey...

511
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:41,899
How you doing?
No, you said, Eat my pussy.

512
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:43,203
What the fuck is wrong with him?

513
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:44,869
I said you are pushy.
He said you are pushy.

514
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:45,936
No, you said, Eat your pussy.

515
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,706
No. I said, Sheesh! You are pushy!

516
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,315
No, you said, Eat my pussy.
No, that's what he said, I heard it.

517
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,173
He said... pushy.
What the fuck?

518
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:53,910
Which is also fucking rude.

519
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:55,611
He doesn't mean your pussy
in particular.

520
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,026
You are insane, right?

521
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,423
Are you fucking insane?
Probably.

522
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,550
Well, what's it gonna be?
Maybe.

523
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:01,277
He is fucking crazy.
Fuck you, Baxley.

524
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,336
I feel fine.

525
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,047
They were gonna shoot me?

526
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:05,548
Why?

527
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:08,010
Maybe because of...

528
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,035
this?

529
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:16,125
Well, I guess I am in.

530
00:42:17,426 --> 00:42:19,061
Stay the fuck away from me.

531
00:42:22,364 --> 00:42:23,784
What the fuck is this?

532
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,136
What is this?

533
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:28,417
What is that? Like a unicorn?
A unicorn.

534
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:30,005
It's a unicorn.
A unicorn.

535
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:31,868
I made a unicorn.
I, hey, its...

536
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
I am sorry, it's a piece of shit.
So...

537
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,618
what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?

538
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,124
Maybe staying alive?

539
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:39,490
We are soldiers.

540
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:41,048
We are the good guys, ok?

541
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,283
Well, that's debatable.

542
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,373
I read your file. The...

543
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:46,332
The guys in Mexico it killed?

544
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,490
They yours?

545
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:49,423
They are gonna need a patsy for that.

546
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,835
You are looking at him.

547
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,131
Yeah, I figured.

548
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,928
Ex-sniper with PTSD?
That's actually kind of perfect.

549
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,340
How about you telling us,

550
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,898
what you were doing in a secret base.

551
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,025
Surrounded by trained soldiers.

552
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,327
Mercs.

553
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:03,685
I am a biologist,

554
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:06,065
and they have me on
call in case there is...

555
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,179
contact.

556
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:11,845
What did I tell you?

557
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,725
End days. End days.

558
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,290
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

559
00:43:15,314 --> 00:43:16,447
I am gonna set you on fire.

560
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:17,872
Guys, if we wanna keep breathing,

561
00:43:18,257 --> 00:43:19,798
we need to find this thing.

562
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:20,990
Expose it.

563
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,126
It's called the Predator.

564
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:25,303
It hunts people for sport.

565
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:27,761
Technically, that's not a predator.
That's like...

566
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:28,663
Thank you.

567
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:30,375
It's a hunter.
I said the same thing.

568
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,876
I said the same thing, a sportsman.
A hunter or a fisherman.

569
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,802
Well, look at you...

570
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:35,026
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

571
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:37,681
Equipment. Weapons.

572
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:41,602
I took its gear.

573
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:44,789
What?
You took something from the thing?

574
00:43:44,813 --> 00:43:45,522
What?

575
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:46,673
So, I would have evidence.

576
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:50,039
I think I know where it's going.

577
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,554
What?

578
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:50,162
Hi, honey, you are home.

579
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,046
I am looking for a package.
A package?

580
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,148
Rory!
Hey!

581
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,016
This is not your house anymore!

582
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,041
Rory!

583
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,486
Hey, buddy.

584
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:00,141
Where are you?

585
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:01,456
He is not here.

586
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:03,656
What do you mean, he is not here?

587
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
Shit!

588
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:08,061
What? So we ordered some video games.

589
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:09,963
No! No! No! No! No!

590
00:45:10,065 --> 00:45:12,299
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

591
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:13,869
was so I didn't put you in danger.

592
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,680
Goddamn it, we need to find him.

593
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:17,293
Wait Quinn, you are scaring me now.

594
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:30,327
I specifically said no first-person
shooter. No combat games.

595
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,996
Did you ever think that maybe he plays
them to connect with his father?

596
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,447
Oh, my God.
We are doing this again.

597
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:36,175
Hey! Can you stop taking all my...

598
00:45:38,094 --> 00:45:39,659
Who are these people in my house?

599
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,073
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

600
00:45:42,098 --> 00:45:43,098
Good evening.

601
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:46,674
The brushstrokes on this are really
dynamic. It's a wonderful piece.

602
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,181
Ok, you need to put that down.

603
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,128
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

604
00:45:50,153 --> 00:45:51,387
They are my unit.
They are soldiers.

605
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:52,946
Marines. There is his unit.

606
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,753
Hi. You seem like a really nice...

607
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:57,309
No, don't touch me. No.

608
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,580
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

609
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:01,259
What happened to Haines and Dupree?

610
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:03,818
They are dead.

611
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:06,263
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

612
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:07,436
What are you talking about?

613
00:46:07,461 --> 00:46:08,694
There is something out there.

614
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:10,727
It tore my friends apart.

615
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:12,358
What is it?
Is is like...

616
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,007
it's like a creature.

617
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:15,992
Seriously, it's not a person.
Like from the Bible.

618
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,475
Revelations.
From the Bible?

619
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,400
That's the most ridiculous
thing I have ever heard.

620
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:20,507
It's a space alien.

621
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:22,337
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

622
00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:24,544
It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

623
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,142
Oh shit!

624
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:27,744
Shit.

625
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:29,185
I want a grid search.

626
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,277
Three teams.

627
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:33,538
Hey!

628
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:35,953
No.
No, no, I am coming with you.

629
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:37,343
No nix that.

630
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:42,958
Is there a problem?

631
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:46,213
Thing is, we are kind of moving targets.

632
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:48,604
Yeah, in case you have not
noticed, we are fugitives.

633
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:50,341
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?

634
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:51,925
I get it. Fine, stay here and watch TV.

635
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,790
You know what?
If you try to split?

636
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:56,981
Or draw the Feds?
Or if you jeopardize my son

637
00:46:57,005 --> 00:47:00,318
by your half-assed yardbird bullshit
I will come back here, and I will happily

638
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,311
kill every single fucking one of you.

639
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:09,919
Come on brothers. Let's go.

640
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:14,334
Seriously?

641
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,059
It's not our fight.

642
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:22,799
Is your husband the man I think he is?

643
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,924
Excuse me?

644
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,160
Tell me about your husband, please?

645
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,131
He is a security counter-sniper.

646
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:32,507
Army Rangers.

647
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,786
He supervised,

648
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,777
23 close precision engagements
across five continents,

649
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:39,770
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

650
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,391
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,

651
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:46,422
to ever receive a Distinguished
Service Medal and the Silver Star.

652
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,692
So, he might be a lousy husband
but he is a good soldier.

653
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,844
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.

654
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,204
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

655
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:58,531
That's what I thought.

656
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:00,579
Fucking pussies.

657
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:05,474
Where you going Nettles?

658
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:09,844
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

659
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:11,558
But...

660
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,292
he called me a pussy
and nobody calls me a pussy, so...

661
00:48:15,465 --> 00:48:16,898
Ok.
Fuck off, pussy.

662
00:48:21,088 --> 00:48:23,170
Come on Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

663
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,795
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.

664
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:31,815
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move. Hey!

665
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:33,323
You too, lucky charms.

666
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:34,670
Coyle, you wanker.

667
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,112
I would like to watch TV

668
00:48:38,136 --> 00:48:39,456
with you sometime.
Ok.

669
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,464
I liked your speech.
I liked the couch.

670
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:45,609
What's happening? What?

671
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:48,371
Well, we are finding my son, that's what.

672
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:51,018
Alright, when all this is over...

673
00:48:51,043 --> 00:48:52,802
Fuck me in the face with an aardvark.

674
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,236
I just want to be famous.

675
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,267
Ostensibly,

676
00:48:58,292 --> 00:48:59,931
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

677
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:01,472
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.

678
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:03,392
You are using ostensibly incorrectly.

679
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:05,931
Is this for me?
This is like the reverse of a clown car.

680
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:08,059
Alright Nebraska, let's find some wheels,

681
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,325
nothing flashy.
Copy.

682
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:10,775
Alright.

683
00:49:11,372 --> 00:49:12,465
Find my son.

684
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,254
Casey, you are with me.

685
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:15,991
Let's go.

686
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:18,413
Hey, ass-burger.

687
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:23,340
What are you supposed to be?

688
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:24,434
Leave me alone.

689
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,294
Or what? You will wash our
hands five hundred times?

690
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:32,533
Trick or treat?

691
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:39,012
What's the matter, dude?

692
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:42,237
Here is a treat, you little shit.

693
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:23,208
I got a male juvenile.
10 to 12 years old.

694
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:25,464
Metal cast on his arm.
Yo McKenna,

695
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,329
do you hear that?
Ran right in front of my car.

696
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,136
Moving east on Woodruff.

697
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:31,205
Repeat, moving east on Woodruff.

698
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:41,709
Nebraska, you got wheels?

699
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,968
Yeah, I got wheels.
Something flashy.

700
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:47,601
Listen, the kid's spooked, he is rabbiting.

701
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:50,372
Where is he headed?
Where is some place he knows?

702
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:46,795
There he is.

703
00:51:52,934 --> 00:51:54,003
Dad!

704
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,273
How you doing, buddy?

705
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:00,730
I am good.

706
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:13,257
Move! Move!

707
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:16,626
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

708
00:52:22,664 --> 00:52:24,144
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

709
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:26,612
Shit!

710
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:37,110
McKenna!

711
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:41,824
Take cover!
Take cover!

712
00:53:01,237 --> 00:53:02,936
Williams!
Get the fuck out of there!

713
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,417
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

714
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:08,156
Shit! Oh shit!

715
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:13,947
Ok.

716
00:53:23,354 --> 00:53:25,853
Doc, the dreads.
What's that all about?

717
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:28,323
I don't know.
Maybe like, like sensor receptors.

718
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:29,798
Kind of like cat whiskers.

719
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:32,913
What the...
I am getting a sample.

720
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:34,389
It's a fucking space dog.

721
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:36,506
You ok?

722
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,041
What, is your mom cutting your hair now?

723
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:41,833
You kidding me?

724
00:53:41,857 --> 00:53:43,578
This is a once in a lifetime moment.
Shut up. Please shut up.

725
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:45,222
All I wanted was a little sample.
Please shut up.

726
00:53:45,246 --> 00:53:47,214
All I wanted was
a goddamn fucking sample.

727
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:48,383
Come here.

728
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:51,999
Sample.

729
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,840
There you go.
Thank you. You are welcome.

730
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:55,930
Fucking space dog, man. It's a fucking...

731
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,672
My man, you need to...
I can't. I can't. I can't.

732
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:59,077
Get it together.
I can't do this.

733
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:01,027
Oh, my God!

734
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:02,963
Fucking hell!

735
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:08,337
Fuck!

736
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:10,539
Go now!

737
00:54:11,321 --> 00:54:12,321
Please!

738
00:54:12,372 --> 00:54:13,372
Rory!

739
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:15,309
Shoot him!

740
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:16,644
Shoot him!

741
00:54:16,945 --> 00:54:19,355
Hey! No! No! No! No! No!

742
00:54:20,149 --> 00:54:21,817
No! No! No! No! No!

743
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:26,921
Oh, fuck, fuck. No, no, no! No!

744
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:30,060
Cock! Cock! Fuck! Dick!

745
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:32,385
Suck! Suck my cock!
Fuck! Goddamn it!

746
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:35,131
Go! Go! Go!

747
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,009
I got him! I got him!
Go, go, go!

748
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,492
On Williams! On Williams!

749
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,527
Hurry!

750
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,550
Take cover!
Move! Move!

751
00:54:50,813 --> 00:54:51,813
Go! Go!

752
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:53,100
Come on!

753
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,283
Come on!

754
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,483
FYI, back at Stargazer,

755
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,863
I was naked and unarmed,
it walked right past me.

756
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:02,325
Can you tell your kid to tone
down the psychosis, please?

757
00:55:08,595 --> 00:55:10,626
Let's do this. Let's do this.
Wait and do what?

758
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:13,771
You know, we could keep running,
or we give him back what he wants.

759
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:19,942
What, this is it?

760
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:24,380
Oh, my God. Shit.

761
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:31,052
Shit.

762
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,730
No, no, no! Move! Move! Move!

763
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,922
Hey, come on.

764
00:55:34,188 --> 00:55:35,231
You good?

765
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:36,255
Fucked!

766
00:55:36,823 --> 00:55:38,511
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Netty, get the vehicle.

767
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,801
The rest of you on me.
Copy.

768
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:41,364
Move back.

769
00:55:55,777 --> 00:55:58,055
No! No! No!

770
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,081
No!

771
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:16,398
Incoming!

772
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:21,310
What the fuck?

773
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:51,659
Come here!

774
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:53,518
Roll out! Roll out, let's go!

775
00:56:53,568 --> 00:56:55,003
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

776
00:56:55,369 --> 00:56:56,973
Move!
Move out, move out!

777
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:00,976
Move! Move out!

778
00:57:01,577 --> 00:57:03,279
Let's go!
Let's move!

779
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:04,683
Come on. Let's go!

780
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:06,738
Go, go, go! Let's go!

781
00:57:06,775 --> 00:57:07,775
Let's go! Let's go!

782
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,105
Move!

783
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:10,289
Move!

784
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:12,463
Move! Move!
Come on, get in! Come on!

785
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,324
Good! Good! Good!
Good! Good! Good!

786
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,393
Go! Last man!

787
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:22,965
Go! Go! Go!

788
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:41,825
What's the big one?

789
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:43,951
What's the big one, Doc?
Is that like the male?

790
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:45,712
He didn't even give a shit about us.

791
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:47,126
Just wanted to kill that thing.

792
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,824
Quinn, you saw that, right?

793
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,993
Guys! Did you see that? He...

794
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:56,966
He grew an exoskeleton
under his fucking skin.

795
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:01,170
What, are they hunting each other now?

796
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,371
We are still sorting through it right now.

797
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:46,858
Hey, it's me.
Tell me he is ok.

798
00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:48,764
He is fine.
I am going to bring him back.

799
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:50,313
It's ok, don't say anything, just be safe.
Hey!

800
00:58:50,337 --> 00:58:51,587
No! Don't do that!

801
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:53,089
What?

802
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,599
Hello?

803
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:00,228
Damn it.

804
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:02,264
You guys fucked with the wrong family.

805
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,466
How tall?
Witnesses say 11 feet.

806
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:08,859
That's pretty fucking tall.

807
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:10,371
Ok.

808
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,628
Fucked that nigga up.
Sir?

809
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:17,543
Nothing.

810
00:59:19,447 --> 00:59:20,949
I would be careful with that, sir.

811
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:24,050
You know what I think?

812
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:26,403
I think this one went rogue.
A runner.

813
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:28,332
And the big one?

814
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,356
He is a tracker.

815
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:30,759
Sent to take that one out.

816
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:33,752
Some kind of interstellar cops and robbers.

817
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:36,530
Now he is going after that missing ship.

818
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,236
And whatever is on board.

819
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:41,158
I want that fucking ship.

820
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:42,564
We are in the ballpark.

821
00:59:42,836 --> 00:59:44,373
Captain McKenna's son.

822
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:45,867
Mother confirms.

823
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:47,688
He has the operating system.

824
00:59:47,908 --> 00:59:49,953
Get the fuck out of here.
Thought it was a video game.

825
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,456
So, we find the kid, we find the ship.

826
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,120
What the fuck we still standing here for?

827
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,176
You don't want to know what that one is?

828
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,175
I know what it is.
Our big boy is a hunter.

829
00:59:57,252 --> 00:59:58,487
He brought his dogs with him.

830
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:06,850
No, it had to be like a government
experiment or some shit like...

831
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,456
Like a robot or whatever.

832
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,006
Nettles, are you fucking retarded, man?

833
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,843
Use another word, would you?

834
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:14,017
Yeah, man.
Show a little sensitivity.

835
01:00:14,102 --> 01:00:15,469
His son is retarded.

836
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:16,904
Here you go.

837
01:00:17,306 --> 01:00:18,306
Here you go.

838
01:00:18,773 --> 01:00:20,442
He does this from time to time.

839
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:22,267
Just give him a minute.

840
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:24,246
Hey, Lynch.

841
01:00:25,537 --> 01:00:26,945
What's the deal with these two?

842
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:28,759
Coyle lit up one of his own vehicles?

843
01:00:28,784 --> 01:00:30,157
Back in '09, yeah.

844
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:31,586
It was bad business. Six dead.

845
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,866
What, no survivors?

846
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,856
Yeah, there was one.

847
01:00:39,628 --> 01:00:40,896
It's fucking romantic.

848
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:43,407
Are you kidding me, they are friends?

849
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,110
Picture it.
Military inquiries,

850
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:47,132
sitting outside courtroom,
waiting to go in,

851
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:48,046
side by side,

852
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,838
day after fucking day.
After fucking day.

853
01:00:50,323 --> 01:00:51,354
Unbelievable.

854
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:52,707
It's the loonies.

855
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:03,217
Alright, kid.

856
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:05,219
I have talked to your mother.

857
01:01:05,753 --> 01:01:06,955
She is doing fine.

858
01:01:07,722 --> 01:01:09,157
Mom says you are a killer.

859
01:01:10,657 --> 01:01:12,080
Well, I am a soldier.

860
01:01:13,494 --> 01:01:14,749
What's the difference?

861
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,568
Well, when you like it,

862
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:21,452
that's when you are a killer.

863
01:01:24,005 --> 01:01:25,262
Are you good?

864
01:01:28,043 --> 01:01:29,478
Sorry I never grew up.

865
01:01:30,846 --> 01:01:31,846
You know,

866
01:01:32,328 --> 01:01:33,544
the way you wanted.

867
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,521
Tell you a secret.

868
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,259
Truth is kid,

869
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,162
I never grew up the way I wanted.

870
01:01:51,797 --> 01:01:53,133
Are we gonna get killed?

871
01:01:57,271 --> 01:01:58,271
Nope.

872
01:01:59,608 --> 01:02:00,608
Come on.

873
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:04,071
I am single.
I don't know if you knew that.

874
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,005
No, I could tell that you are single.

875
01:02:06,782 --> 01:02:09,115
We got so much
stuff in common, you know like...

876
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:12,334
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

877
01:02:12,387 --> 01:02:13,387
Shit.

878
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:14,687
What?

879
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:18,100
This is more than spinal fluid.
What does that mean?

880
01:02:18,355 --> 01:02:19,537
If I am right,

881
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:22,524
they are trying to upgrade themselves.

882
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,287
McKenna, I got something.

883
01:02:24,999 --> 01:02:27,410
I think I know what they are up
to on Predator World these days.

884
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:28,434
You see this?

885
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,561
They found this in the Predator's plexus.

886
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:33,541
So, remember how I told you how
they take people's spines, right?

887
01:02:34,076 --> 01:02:35,613
Yeah, for trophies.

888
01:02:35,638 --> 01:02:38,021
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,

889
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,046
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

890
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:44,034
Collecting survival traits
from the most high-end specimens.

891
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,377
I think they are attempting hybridization.

892
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:49,656
You are just pulling this out of your ass.

893
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,440
Did you not see the new Predator?

894
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,536
It's evolving.

895
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,329
Or being upgraded.

896
01:03:03,637 --> 01:03:04,769
That little boy,

897
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:07,174
managed to figure out alien technology.

898
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:10,108
You know, a lot of experts say that,

899
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,413
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.

900
01:03:13,147 --> 01:03:15,315
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

901
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,405
Hey, yo!
What the fuck are you...

902
01:03:17,485 --> 01:03:18,683
Get the fuck away from me yo!

903
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:20,585
Casey!

904
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,891
Casey, get inside.

905
01:03:23,724 --> 01:03:24,726
Casey!

906
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:27,184
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

907
01:03:27,355 --> 01:03:28,485
Casey! Look.

908
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:30,428
I think this thing is been following us,

909
01:03:30,455 --> 01:03:31,031
Alright?

910
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:33,644
Move, Netty!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

911
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:35,435
Space dog!
Move, Netty!

912
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:40,718
What the fuck.
Hey! Hey!

913
01:03:40,742 --> 01:03:42,367
Hey! Hey! You had your fucking chance.

914
01:03:43,512 --> 01:03:46,144
Look, I am just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

915
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:48,158
You know, maybe we can
use it or something?

916
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:50,193
Ok, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

917
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:52,430
We are gonna study it.
That's what we are gonna do with it.

918
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,254
What's to learn? Except Williams
sucks at shooting shit in the head.

919
01:03:55,518 --> 01:03:57,118
Williams, you lobotomized him.

920
01:03:57,358 --> 01:03:58,731
Ok, new rule.

921
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:00,616
No one shoots my fucking dog.

922
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,106
There it is.
It's official.

923
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,765
You were right, we can use this.

924
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:08,937
Shit.

925
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:10,772
Netty, what is that?

926
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:14,276
Everybody, tighten up.

927
01:04:14,509 --> 01:04:16,175
Little man, come here.
That's an EC-130.

928
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,368
That's not civilian.

929
01:04:17,512 --> 01:04:18,516
Shit.
Hey, hey, hey!

930
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:20,821
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

931
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:22,147
There you go.

932
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,317
Do you wanna help?

933
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:24,891
Go get a helicopter and some pyro.

934
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:26,848
Alright! On me!

935
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:28,086
Now go!

936
01:04:28,188 --> 01:04:30,555
Casey! I will be right back!
No, you won't.

937
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:32,303
Hold on. Hey. See this?

938
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,663
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

939
01:04:34,962 --> 01:04:35,962
Fetch!

940
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,256
Where is it?

941
01:05:01,456 --> 01:05:02,457
Where is what?

942
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:04,561
The device.

943
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:06,059
It goes,

944
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:07,637
right in here.

945
01:05:13,134 --> 01:05:15,290
Ok, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.

946
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:17,579
Why did he come here? To Earth?

947
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:19,883
The Thing One,
as you called him,

948
01:05:19,907 --> 01:05:22,309
arrived in a hijacked spacecraft.

949
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:24,211
We think there is something on it.

950
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:26,279
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

951
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:28,083
Wait, enemies?

952
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,382
Other Predators.

953
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:30,841
Like that big one.

954
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:33,318
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?

955
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,032
I will help you find it.
We can analyze it...

956
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,290
Shut the fuck up!

957
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:41,596
Why are they here?

958
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,283
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

959
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,869
There was a run on Twinkies?

960
01:05:49,303 --> 01:05:50,937
Snapped up from coast to coast.

961
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,741
Get them while they still last.

962
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:54,609
Remember?

963
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,114
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?

964
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:01,615
Two generations?

965
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:03,869
One?

966
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:05,666
That's why their visits are increasing?

967
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:08,485
They are trying to snap up
all of our best DNA before we are gone.

968
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,925
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.

969
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:15,141
We are an endangered species,
and they know it.

970
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:16,869
They thrive in a hothouse environment.

971
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:19,200
Maybe they want to move into ours.

972
01:06:20,034 --> 01:06:21,266
And that dead Predator

973
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,160
was bringing us a way to stop them.

974
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,006
You have hidden this thing
before, in the mail.

975
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:30,976
So, where is it this time?

976
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:32,513
Your mother's ass.

977
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,583
Wait, did I say that out loud?

978
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:39,700
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

979
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:41,420
No, no, no.
That is not for you.

980
01:06:41,445 --> 01:06:44,001
That is my son's files and you are
violating his privacy reading that.

981
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:45,451
Madam!
You both need to leave right now.

982
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:47,499
Madam, I don't wanna restrain you.

983
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:48,493
Really?

984
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:49,863
Well, why don't you try?

985
01:07:41,782 --> 01:07:43,625
You have not found the spacecraft?

986
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,329
Why are we trying
to crack the entry code?

987
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,999
Because when we do find it,
would not it be great

988
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:50,064
if we could get into the fucking thing?
What's that?

989
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:51,759
A map.

990
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:53,417
A map to what?

991
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:55,461
Give us a clue of where this place is,

992
01:07:55,663 --> 01:07:57,374
maybe we can try to get into it.

993
01:07:57,398 --> 01:07:59,534
But if you don't give us
anything, we can't get in!

994
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:13,824
Hey Rory,

995
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,531
I am Will.

996
01:08:15,556 --> 01:08:16,556
How you doing?

997
01:08:17,132 --> 01:08:19,153
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

998
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,269
Golf tomorrow?

999
01:08:34,498 --> 01:08:35,566
Why not?

1000
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:38,405
You two never read my file, did you?

1001
01:08:39,046 --> 01:08:40,181
What makes you say that?

1002
01:08:40,353 --> 01:08:42,889
Because you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

1003
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,287
The worst part is,

1004
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,790
you are making me lie to my son.

1005
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,719
What lie did you tell him?

1006
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:53,555
That I won't enjoy this.

1007
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:03,831
Hey please, don't.

1008
01:09:04,863 --> 01:09:06,472
Look, I don't know what they told you...

1009
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:08,574
Can you just wait for a second?
Just wait!

1010
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,539
No, no, no, no, no!

1011
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:12,072
No.

1012
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,122
Jeez!

1013
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:20,414
Oh, my God.

1014
01:09:57,692 --> 01:09:58,735
Nebraska!

1015
01:09:58,954 --> 01:10:00,662
Yeah?
You just kill somebody?

1016
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:01,820
Well, he aingt well.

1017
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,055
Untie my friend.

1018
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,658
They got Rory. We got to move.

1019
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:06,359
Shit, they rough you up?

1020
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:08,493
Did worse on myself, back in the day.

1021
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,665
What do you want to do with this guy?

1022
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,246
Sorry, buddy,
that was a dumb question.

1023
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,510
Yeah, that was a dumb question.

1024
01:10:30,819 --> 01:10:31,820
Casey!

1025
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,791
Can I interest you in getting
the fuck out of here?

1026
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:39,364
Getting the fuck out of here
is my middle name.

1027
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,793
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1028
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:46,368
What? What's wrong?

1029
01:10:50,796 --> 01:10:51,573
Alright.

1030
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:52,773
Hey!

1031
01:10:53,046 --> 01:10:54,037
Just let me unpack this.

1032
01:10:54,062 --> 01:10:55,619
You are saying my son is headed
towards a spaceship

1033
01:10:55,643 --> 01:10:56,908
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1034
01:10:57,047 --> 01:10:58,347
11, actually.

1035
01:10:58,412 --> 01:10:59,680
Used to be a contractor.

1036
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:01,633
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

1037
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,529
Meaning it's the Chinese menu of DNA.

1038
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:05,728
Comprised of the deadliest
species in the entire...

1039
01:11:05,752 --> 01:11:06,942
In the entire universe, yeah?

1040
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:07,919
Galaxy.

1041
01:11:07,943 --> 01:11:08,763
What?

1042
01:11:08,788 --> 01:11:10,756
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1043
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,126
Why go universe? Just saying.

1044
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,327
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1045
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:29,418
That's what you asked for?

1046
01:11:29,443 --> 01:11:30,644
Yeah, that will do.

1047
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,348
Saddle up!

1048
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:38,473
It's the best we could do, man.

1049
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,163
Go ahead. Go!
That's it?

1050
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:45,268
Another one.
The other one!

1051
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:46,860
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1052
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:52,634
Figured something out.
I think we are gonna die.

1053
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:55,642
We are gonna go hunt and fight
the what, the army?

1054
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:56,780
We are not gonna fight the army.

1055
01:11:56,804 --> 01:11:58,700
And some fucking people from space!

1056
01:11:58,725 --> 01:12:00,233
You wanna talk survival?

1057
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,570
Fine!

1058
01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:04,086
You yesterday, you were on a prison bus,

1059
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,392
barking to yourself,

1060
01:12:05,512 --> 01:12:06,979
now you got a gun in your hand.

1061
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,449
Who is a survivor now?

1062
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:13,087
We put bullets in our head
and walk to the fucking hospital.

1063
01:12:13,555 --> 01:12:14,823
We are soldiers!

1064
01:12:16,323 --> 01:12:17,791
Nettles, what's our 20?

1065
01:12:18,259 --> 01:12:19,872
I can follow your boy's chopper.

1066
01:12:19,897 --> 01:12:21,218
I locked into its frequency.

1067
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,141
Fence is hot!

1068
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,099
What do you say, buddy?

1069
01:12:58,865 --> 01:13:00,335
You think you can get us in there?

1070
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:03,203
Because I am not sure that you can.

1071
01:13:03,636 --> 01:13:05,325
Nice reverse psychology.

1072
01:13:05,573 --> 01:13:06,907
I can do that too.

1073
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:08,576
Don't go fuck yourself.

1074
01:13:11,712 --> 01:13:13,280
That's good. Come on.

1075
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,848
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1076
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:16,933
Right on.

1077
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:18,565
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1078
01:13:18,932 --> 01:13:21,136
Been trying to figure out
what these bird-chirping motherfuckers

1079
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,408
been saying since '87.

1080
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,457
Gave the Harvard School
of Linguist is a billion-dollar grant.

1081
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,759
Voila.

1082
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:28,234
Watch your step, come on.

1083
01:13:40,274 --> 01:13:42,976
Goddamn kid, I don't know
where you get it from.

1084
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:12,348
Put the translator into the mainframe.

1085
01:14:12,372 --> 01:14:13,835
Download everything.

1086
01:14:20,267 --> 01:14:21,649
What the hell is inside there?

1087
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,861
It's property of Project Stargazer.
That's what the fuck it is.

1088
01:14:27,654 --> 01:14:29,131
Code three. Code three.

1089
01:14:29,155 --> 01:14:30,959
We have motion
at the south fence line.

1090
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:32,692
Send a fire team to check it out.

1091
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,063
That's my dad.
He is gonna come save me now.

1092
01:14:35,496 --> 01:14:36,530
Is he?

1093
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,266
Is that what he is gonna do?

1094
01:14:40,044 --> 01:14:41,480
I will tell you what, buddy...

1095
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,636
if it is your daddy,

1096
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,806
and I truly hope that it is...

1097
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:51,179
he is got to be just about the dumbest
motherfucker I have ever met.

1098
01:14:53,747 --> 01:14:56,982
I mean, a ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1099
01:14:57,184 --> 01:14:58,386
He is got to be...

1100
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,419
creating a diversion.

1101
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:02,823
It's a fucking diversion.

1102
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:05,624
Oh, shit!

1103
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,102
Howdy.

1104
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,444
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1105
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,265
You took my boy, so yeah.

1106
01:15:12,226 --> 01:15:13,228
Told you.

1107
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:15,068
Take this, son.

1108
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:16,603
You out of your mind?

1109
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,136
We literally have you surrounded.

1110
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:19,303
That's why you are coming with me.

1111
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:20,967
I just want the boy.
Nobody is got to die.

1112
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,475
Dad?

1113
01:15:24,545 --> 01:15:25,743
From here forward.

1114
01:15:25,945 --> 01:15:27,415
Don't look at the dead guy.

1115
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:49,268
That was pretty good.

1116
01:15:49,515 --> 01:15:51,374
You alright? Did I get you?
No, I am good.

1117
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:53,550
Welcome back.

1118
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:55,042
Fuck you. I never left.

1119
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,022
You open your mouth,

1120
01:15:59,046 --> 01:16:00,857
I am gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1121
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:02,227
Come on, just get behind me.

1122
01:16:02,252 --> 01:16:04,204
All units. They got Traeger.

1123
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,345
They got Traeger.

1124
01:16:06,819 --> 01:16:08,324
Let's go. Let's go.

1125
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,425
Just tell the to put the guns down.

1126
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:21,269
Tell them!

1127
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:25,852
If Captain McKenna doesn't lower his
weapon in the next 10 seconds

1128
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:27,533
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1129
01:16:27,557 --> 01:16:28,925
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1130
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:31,528
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1131
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:33,592
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1132
01:16:33,713 --> 01:16:34,713
Ten.

1133
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:36,615
Nine.

1134
01:16:37,557 --> 01:16:38,557
Eight.

1135
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,720
Seven.

1136
01:16:41,255 --> 01:16:43,599
Come on, you just give
the fucking word, man.

1137
01:16:43,623 --> 01:16:44,623
Five.

1138
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:01,242
Oh, shit!

1139
01:17:03,104 --> 01:17:04,372
Come on, son!

1140
01:17:06,646 --> 01:17:07,733
Take them down!

1141
01:17:13,787 --> 01:17:14,989
Get down, sir.

1142
01:17:15,121 --> 01:17:16,200
Let's go, son. Go!

1143
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:17,317
Come on. Come on.

1144
01:17:23,663 --> 01:17:24,765
Ok, take this.

1145
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:27,744
You wanna vanish,

1146
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,303
you really vanish son, you understand?

1147
01:17:29,703 --> 01:17:32,139
Alright, we are going home.
I promise you.

1148
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:43,050
It's here.

1149
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:51,224
No! No! No!

1150
01:17:57,611 --> 01:17:59,145
Come on,
go around the end there!

1151
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:00,399
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1152
01:18:00,701 --> 01:18:01,945
Move, move, move!

1153
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,471
You got him?
Yeah!

1154
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:16,415
Stay back.

1155
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:17,652
Get down! Get down!

1156
01:18:20,186 --> 01:18:23,191
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1157
01:18:51,717 --> 01:18:52,717
Alright.

1158
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:53,886
Hey, McKenna.

1159
01:18:54,227 --> 01:18:56,863
Be reasonable. There is six
of you, seven of us.

1160
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:00,126
Fuck!

1161
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:01,610
Who taught you math?

1162
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,965
You aingt the only
fucking sniper, white boy.

1163
01:19:05,832 --> 01:19:07,934
You can walk away from this, Captain.

1164
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,112
I just want the ship.

1165
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:11,360
Dad, he is lying.

1166
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:12,513
Yeah.

1167
01:19:12,538 --> 01:19:13,538
McKenna!

1168
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:14,774
I don't like this.

1169
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,543
What's he doing in there?

1170
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:30,157
It's using the translator.

1171
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:35,696
Hello. I have enjoyed
watching you kill each other.

1172
01:19:36,296 --> 01:19:38,731
I came here to destroy this vessel.

1173
01:19:38,756 --> 01:19:40,555
You cannot have it.

1174
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,969
What you can do is run.

1175
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:46,639
I detect one among you
who is a true warrior.

1176
01:19:46,725 --> 01:19:48,791
The one called McKenna.

1177
01:19:50,944 --> 01:19:52,380
He will be your leader.

1178
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,080
He will be my prize.

1179
01:19:54,715 --> 01:19:56,583
I offer time advantage.

1180
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:58,552
Go.

1181
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:00,530
What the fuck is time advantage?

1182
01:20:00,554 --> 01:20:01,622
Like a head start?

1183
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,694
I am gonna wake up on a bus.

1184
01:20:07,661 --> 01:20:09,096
I am gonna wake up on a bus.

1185
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:12,865
Hey!

1186
01:20:13,211 --> 01:20:14,246
I am coming out!

1187
01:20:23,978 --> 01:20:24,979
We are in.

1188
01:20:25,912 --> 01:20:27,380
Baxley!
Shit!

1189
01:20:28,002 --> 01:20:29,882
Watch where the fuck you are
throwing, dickhead.

1190
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:31,069
Will do.

1191
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:34,252
Ok, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1192
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:36,099
McKenna's the one he wants.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1193
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,290
We stay together,
or it will take us one by one.

1194
01:20:38,378 --> 01:20:39,810
He is right. It's their MO.

1195
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:42,005
Grow a dick, will you?
Nothing is starting!

1196
01:20:42,029 --> 01:20:44,097
Son of a bitch. He must have
hacked the vehicles.

1197
01:20:44,197 --> 01:20:46,576
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1198
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,733
Got you.
Hey?

1199
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:49,813
When this is over, you and me,
we are gonna dance.

1200
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:51,357
I got my shoes all picked out.
Alright.

1201
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:01,548
Fuck.
No, no, no! Don't.

1202
01:21:02,783 --> 01:21:04,685
Here, boy. Fetch.

1203
01:21:05,853 --> 01:21:07,430
Here, boy.

1204
01:21:07,454 --> 01:21:08,456
Here you go.

1205
01:21:11,224 --> 01:21:12,783
That was a valuable weapon.

1206
01:21:14,862 --> 01:21:16,630
Let's go.
He will be coming for us.

1207
01:21:55,234 --> 01:21:56,703
Give me the goody bag.

1208
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,042
Hey. On Halloween,
this blew up a whole house.

1209
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:02,507
How do you shoot it?
You don't.

1210
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,754
It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1211
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:06,347
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1212
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,832
I heard something.

1213
01:22:15,856 --> 01:22:18,158
Hey, man.
That's Predator technology.

1214
01:22:20,387 --> 01:22:23,890
That... It's gonna come back.
You got, a catcher on the wrist.

1215
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:25,967
That's gonna come back.

1216
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:28,467
No!

1217
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:31,404
Quiet. Quiet.

1218
01:22:32,204 --> 01:22:33,982
Let me see. Let me see.
My fucking hand.

1219
01:22:34,006 --> 01:22:35,509
Shit.
My fucking hand.

1220
01:22:37,811 --> 01:22:38,811
Gotta be quiet.

1221
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:58,765
Moving!

1222
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,251
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1223
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,619
There is a clearing up ahead.

1224
01:23:19,987 --> 01:23:22,298
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1225
01:23:22,322 --> 01:23:24,099
Let's find it and trap the motherfucker.

1226
01:23:24,123 --> 01:23:25,156
You guys go set it up.

1227
01:23:25,388 --> 01:23:26,626
We will lure him in.

1228
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:28,443
Who?
You and me.

1229
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:29,628
Yeah? Alright.

1230
01:23:29,895 --> 01:23:31,298
Yeah.
Let's go.

1231
01:23:32,532 --> 01:23:33,532
Come on.

1232
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:36,838
Can I talk to you for a second?

1233
01:23:36,935 --> 01:23:38,047
What's this we shit?

1234
01:23:38,071 --> 01:23:40,087
What are you gonna live
forever Coyle, just calm down.

1235
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:41,111
Calm down?

1236
01:23:41,258 --> 01:23:42,340
Me, calm down?

1237
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,052
Yeah, Ok, thanks, twitchy.

1238
01:23:44,077 --> 01:23:46,280
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1239
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:10,168
Shit!

1240
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:14,207
Ok, fuck this.

1241
01:24:15,275 --> 01:24:16,709
Hey! Asshole!

1242
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,344
What the fuck was that?

1243
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:20,114
It's a chance for you to survive.

1244
01:24:20,914 --> 01:24:22,081
Go! I got this.

1245
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:24,362
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I have ever heard.

1246
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,293
Come and get us, asshole!

1247
01:24:34,594 --> 01:24:35,594
Contact!

1248
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,963
Alien!
Contact!

1249
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:40,543
Contact!
Alien!

1250
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:41,853
Contact!
He is coming!

1251
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:49,173
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1252
01:25:47,701 --> 01:25:48,936
Light him up!

1253
01:26:04,234 --> 01:26:05,234
Coyle!

1254
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,521
Bax, no!

1255
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,159
Traeger!

1256
01:26:22,234 --> 01:26:23,369
Baxley!

1257
01:26:23,671 --> 01:26:24,672
Die!

1258
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:45,489
Shit.

1259
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,020
Fuck.

1260
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:10,209
Move, move!

1261
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,332
Nettles!
Let's go!

1262
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:25,599
McKenna.

1263
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:29,635
Rory.

1264
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:31,337
I love you.

1265
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:33,982
Hey! I am the one you want.

1266
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:36,242
Right here! Come on! You ugly...

1267
01:27:37,344 --> 01:27:38,410
Dad!

1268
01:27:38,912 --> 01:27:39,913
No!

1269
01:27:43,984 --> 01:27:44,985
Dad!

1270
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,029
No! No! No!
McKenna.

1271
01:27:58,131 --> 01:27:59,441
No! No!

1272
01:27:59,465 --> 01:28:01,631
I hate you, you stupid fucking...

1273
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:03,356
No! No!

1274
01:28:04,136 --> 01:28:05,371
He said he wanted me.

1275
01:28:05,637 --> 01:28:07,238
He said he wanted me!

1276
01:28:07,263 --> 01:28:09,597
No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1277
01:28:09,976 --> 01:28:12,279
The next step in the evolutionary chain.

1278
01:28:12,613 --> 01:28:14,747
Not you. Your son.

1279
01:28:31,831 --> 01:28:33,326
Yo, he is taking off.

1280
01:28:40,073 --> 01:28:41,073
No!

1281
01:28:44,076 --> 01:28:44,876
Come on, man.

1282
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:45,945
Come on.
Come on.

1283
01:28:57,323 --> 01:28:58,625
Let's take it down!

1284
01:28:58,925 --> 01:28:59,993
Come on!

1285
01:29:18,078 --> 01:29:19,246
Hang on!

1286
01:29:22,614 --> 01:29:24,885
Fuck! Nebraska!

1287
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,870
I got you!

1288
01:29:50,978 --> 01:29:54,280
Dad, there is a force field
coming online. Look out!

1289
01:29:58,251 --> 01:30:00,587
Guys! Something is coming!

1290
01:30:02,956 --> 01:30:03,956
Go!

1291
01:30:11,463 --> 01:30:12,666
Netty!

1292
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:18,972
Fuck!

1293
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:20,541
Netty!

1294
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:31,294
Hey, hey, hey.

1295
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:32,886
No, no, no! Bro!

1296
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:34,887
Bro.

1297
01:30:42,929 --> 01:30:44,230
No.

1298
01:30:53,806 --> 01:30:54,806
Fuck!

1299
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,693
Shit!

1300
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:00,667
Rory!

1301
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:58,992
Toss it!

1302
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,378
What are you?

1303
01:34:56,448 --> 01:34:57,448
Shut the fuck up.

1304
01:35:18,136 --> 01:35:19,338
My unit.

1305
01:35:21,673 --> 01:35:22,975
Nettles.

1306
01:35:25,211 --> 01:35:26,378
Coyle.

1307
01:35:28,907 --> 01:35:30,709
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1308
01:35:33,451 --> 01:35:35,221
Baxley had this the whole time.

1309
01:35:38,557 --> 01:35:39,925
Nebraska's bad habit.

1310
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:42,527
Son...

1311
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:45,031
these are the ones
that no one is gonna remember.

1312
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:47,600
Just us.

1313
01:35:48,234 --> 01:35:50,070
What do you say we put them to rest?

1314
01:36:33,947 --> 01:36:35,147
Captain McKenna.

1315
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:39,350
Hiroshi Yamada.

1316
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:41,323
Sir.
First things first.

1317
01:36:41,558 --> 01:36:43,683
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1318
01:36:43,822 --> 01:36:44,889
He loves it here.

1319
01:36:45,024 --> 01:36:47,074
Yeah, he is something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1320
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:48,967
Well, I assume that you know by now,

1321
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:52,030
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1322
01:36:52,164 --> 01:36:53,998
He brought something.
Exactly.

1323
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,635
Now, you want to hear the good news?

1324
01:36:56,869 --> 01:36:58,170
The cargo survived.

1325
01:36:59,076 --> 01:37:00,610
With some sort of fail-safe.

1326
01:37:00,635 --> 01:37:02,869
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1327
01:37:03,227 --> 01:37:04,275
a pod escaped.

1328
01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:05,955
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.

1329
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,353
It seems that...

1330
01:37:08,517 --> 01:37:10,723
our boy
was not taking any chances.

1331
01:37:11,211 --> 01:37:12,412
He wanted us,

1332
01:37:12,568 --> 01:37:13,574
to have this.

1333
01:37:26,865 --> 01:37:28,868
What is it again you do here, exactly?

1334
01:37:29,435 --> 01:37:32,205
He is the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.

1335
01:37:34,506 --> 01:37:35,675
Hey, kiddo.

1336
01:37:38,206 --> 01:37:39,372
Pretty cool?

1337
01:37:39,397 --> 01:37:40,844
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1338
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:42,271
I will make sure to tell Mom.

1339
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:44,315
So,

1340
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:47,136
this is his gift to humankind?

1341
01:38:03,036 --> 01:38:04,858
Get back! Get back!
Look out!

1342
01:38:05,037 --> 01:38:06,447
Everyone, stand back!

1343
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,772
Stand back!
Clear the area!

1344
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,182
Dad, the pod sent me a message.

1345
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:19,915
Rory, what's in that pod?

1346
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:21,075
Don't know!

1347
01:38:22,721 --> 01:38:23,698
Oh shit!

1348
01:38:23,722 --> 01:38:25,579
It's got a name!
Name? What name?

1349
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,803
I guess you would call it,

1350
01:38:27,827 --> 01:38:29,362
the Predator Killer.

1351
01:38:29,494 --> 01:38:31,597
Get him out of here!
Come with me. Let's go.

1352
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:34,910
Get back.
Clear the area.

1353
01:38:34,934 --> 01:38:36,168
Eyes on it.

1354
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,203
Whatever it is, it appears to be dormant.

1355
01:39:10,943 --> 01:39:12,334
I assume it needs to be...

1356
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:15,741
Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.

1357
01:39:16,074 --> 01:39:18,577
Get it off!
Get it off me!

1358
01:39:51,644 --> 01:39:53,080
What the hell is that?

1359
01:39:53,411 --> 01:39:55,080
That's my new suit, bubba.

1360
01:39:57,317 --> 01:39:59,251
I hope they got it in a 42 long.
