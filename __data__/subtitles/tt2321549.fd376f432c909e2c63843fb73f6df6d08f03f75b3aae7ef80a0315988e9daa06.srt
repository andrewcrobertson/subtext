1
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,239
Mum!

2
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,160
Mum!

3
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,839
Mummy!

4
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,919
Mum!

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,959
Mum!

6
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,080
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

8
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,399
straight into the
huge black pot.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
And that was the end of
the big bad wolf."

10
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,919
Did they really kill the
wolf, Mum’?

11
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,320
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,679
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,279
It's very late.

16
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,160
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
"Along time ago--
just yesterday, in fact--

18
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:48,080
there were three little pigs
and one nasty, big wolf."

19
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
What have you done?

20
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,320
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,479
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Wait, wait, wait!
Watch this.

23
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,320
When the monster comes,
I'm gonna do this.

24
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,160
Please don't!

25
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,479
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

26
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,519
Stand still please.

27
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,640
Look at me, Mum.

28
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,640
- Come on, Samuel.
- Look at me.

29
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,959
Stand still please.

30
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

31
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,079
I don't want you making
weapons anymore.

32
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,559
It doesn't work if you
don't look at me!

33
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,559
This monster thing has
got to stop, all right?

34
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,320
Mm!

35
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
Mm!

36
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,559
Don't do that

37
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,160
Ready?

38
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,920
Come on.

39
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,359
Quick.
You're late already.

40
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,640
What have you got in there?

41
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,600
See you later, alligator!

42
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,519
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in if.

43
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

44
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,959
One with your milk in it.

45
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,880
I don't want milk.

46
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,440
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

47
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,799
Ah, just where a woman
should be: In the kitchen.

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
"Get to work, woman!"

49
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,279
- Do you want a cuppa?
- Nah.

50
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,279
I'm heading for the
dementia ward.

51
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,679
Ah.

52
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,359
It’s a few years before you end
up there, isn't it?

53
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,959
Right?

54
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,760
Amelia, your son's school
is on the phone.

55
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,079
Oh, my God.

56
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,399
Did he hurt anyone?

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,480
A dart could have gone into a
child's eye or even worse.

58
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,359
I'm gonna have a serious
talk with him.

59
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,519
Mrs. Vanek,
we've had the talks.

60
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,440
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

61
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,160
We're going to have to
employ cu monitor for him.

62
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,359
Monitor?

63
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,720
He'll be separated from
the other children.

64
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,279
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

65
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,559
Samuel won't cope with this.
He already feels so different.

66
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,239
I'll have a talk with him.

67
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,279
I'll have a serious--

68
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,839
Mrs. Vanek, the boy has
significant behavioural problems.

69
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,720
You know, Samuel doesn't
need a full-time monitor.

70
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,839
What he needs is some
understanding.

71
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,720
I have 24 other first-graders
in that class!

72
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,119
Do you want me to put them all
at risk because of your son?

73
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
I think I'll just find
another school.

74
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,279
Mrs. Vonek, you can’t just
take the boy out of school.

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,679
You look after your business,

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,160
and I'll go find a school that
sees my son as Cl human being

77
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,320
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

78
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,600
That's very unfair.

79
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,959
We're only trying
to help the boy.

80
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,679
Please stop calling him
"the boy."

81
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,119
His name is Samuel.

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,480
We can see Ruby and
Auntie Claire at the park today.

83
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,160
You can play on
that swing you like

84
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,920
for as long as you like,
okay?

85
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,320
Mrs. Bowen hates me.

86
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,160
No, she doesn't.

87
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,279
You just need a break.
That's all.

88
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,640
Don't tell Auntie Claire
what happened.

89
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,160
I'll tell her later.

90
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,640
Mum, come and look at this.

91
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,119
I can do it again.

92
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Sam, don't bother the lady.

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,359
Oh, no, no,
that's all right.

94
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,559
We have to go home and
see Daddy though, haven't we?

95
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,839
- My dad's in the cemetery.
- Oh, that's--

96
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,760
He got killed driving Mum to
the hospital to have me.

97
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,880
Samuel!

98
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
- I'm sorry, he just--
- No, that's all right.

99
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,079
I shouldn't have...

100
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,720
Well, your Mum's very lucky to
have you then, isn't she?

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,839
We have to go.

102
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,720
- Say "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

103
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,880
The artist was so drunk
he vomited,

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,119
right in front of his
own installation.

105
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:07,760
Lost all these sales.

106
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,559
You're not listening.

107
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,239
Oh, I am.
I am.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
So, you... You lost all these
sales and then what happened?

109
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,880
Ruby.
Don't play there, it's wet.

110
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,760
Mum! Mum!

111
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm gonna smash its head!

112
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Be careful.

113
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,399
Mum, Mum!
I'm gonna smash it!

114
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,400
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,919
I can get their birthday cakes.

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,359
That's easy.

117
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
I was hoping Ruby would
change her mind.

118
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,239
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

119
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,679
Oh.

120
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,080
Mum, Mum!

121
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
She wants to have
a princess party.

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,359
Mum! Mum!

123
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,840
That's okay.

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,760
We don't have to come.

125
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
You can still come.

126
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,599
Mum!

127
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,640
She just doesn't want to

128
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,919
share the day with Sam anymore.

129
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,919
I understand.

130
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,359
- Mum!
- I understand.

131
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,960
Mum, I can go really high!

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,159
Watch!

133
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,799
Maybe you want to
celebrate his birthday

134
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,960
properly this year
anyway, on the day.

135
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,719
Yeah, we'll see.

136
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,400
You know, Amelia, I just want

137
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,679
you to be happy, and then this

138
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
birthday thing rolls around,
and I end up feeling awful.

139
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,599
I don't want you to
feel awful, Claire.

140
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
We'll be fine.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,119
We'll be absolutely fine.

142
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,000
Mum!
Look at me!

143
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,239
Mummy!

144
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
Who do we have here?

145
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,400
Hello, Mrs. Roach.

146
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,960
You look fired, little one.

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,719
You been in the wars today?

148
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,239
A few wars.

149
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
He's had a big day,
that's all.

150
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,159
He's just exhausted.

151
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,719
Poor little sweetheart.

152
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,280
BUQSY!

153
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,320
Hello, darling.
Hello.

154
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,000
You look tired too, love.

155
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,200
You Okay?

156
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

157
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,559
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Gracie.

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,880
No, no, no.
You just got in, pet.

159
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,119
I'll do it now.

160
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:13,400
Then it's done.

161
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,000
You can choose one tonight.

162
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,880
Where'd you get this?

163
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,520
On the shelf.

164
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,799
''If it's in a word or
it's in a look,

165
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,919
you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,799
If you're ca really clever one,

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,679
and you know what it is to see,

168
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,159
then you can make friends
with a special one,

169
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,479
ca friend of you and me."

170
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,159
"His name is Mister Babadook.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,359
And this is his book.

172
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,359
A rumbling sound then
three sharp knocks.

173
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,599
Ba-ba-ba dook!
Dook! Dook!

174
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,119
That's when
you'll know he's around.

175
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,559
You'll see him if you look.

176
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,320
"Ba-ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!"

177
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,159
We might read another one
tonight, eh?

178
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,359
But you said I could choose.

179
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,599
"This is what
he wears on top.

180
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,679
He's funny, don't you think?

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,799
See him in your room
at night..."

182
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,320
Mum, does it hurt the boy?

183
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,679
Mum?

184
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,880
Does it live under the bed?!

185
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,200
Mum?

186
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,479
Mummy.

187
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,840
Mummy!

188
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,320
"How sweetly they sung,
telling of their happiness and

189
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Iovingness way at the bottom of

190
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:43,080
the ocean and enfreaﬁng the
sirens not to be afraid."

191
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,320
It's that time of the night
again, time--

192
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,799
If that's what
the doctor ordered, I--

193
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,239
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's...

194
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,400
what the doctor ordered.

195
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
Mum!

196
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,880
It's in my room!

197
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,280
- What is?
- The Babadook!

198
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,159
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

199
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,640
This is not going to happen.

200
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,119
The closet doors were closed,

201
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,440
and now they're wide open.

202
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,200
It's just a book.

203
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
It can't hurt you.

204
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,559
You've had a big day.

205
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
You're just exhausted.

206
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,119
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

207
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,159
Nothing bad's gonna happen,
Sam.

208
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm gonna protect you.

209
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,199
Mum, it's 9:00.

210
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,160
He's not running CI fever
anymore.

211
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,719
No, no, no, my sister's
going to take him.

212
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,280
Put it back.

213
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,560
Put it back,
or it goes in the bin.

214
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,000
Aw!

215
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,479
Sorry.
What was that?

216
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,119
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't get to the phone.

217
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,400
He was vomiting.

218
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

219
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,959
I'll see you soon.
Samuel.

220
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,479
No monster talk at
Auntie Claire's, okay?

221
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,959
Samuel?

222
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,160
No Babadook, no nothing.

223
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
All right?

224
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,479
88.
Number 88.

225
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,359
Two fat ladies?
Good, Elaine.

226
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,119
Another few days, and someone
could call out "bingo."

227
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,280
Number 11.
Who has number 11?

228
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,680
Less?
11?

229
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,479
Right.

230
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,119
Let's see what else we've got.

231
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:41,719
5 billion.
Anyone got 5 billion?

232
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,280
Beverly's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

233
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,319
Are you all right?

234
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm fine.

235
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,000
How are you?
How's G wing?

236
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,079
Fine, yeah.

237
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,000
Just a bunch of old people.

238
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,160
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

239
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,920
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

240
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,479
Why don": you go home?

241
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,439
Old cranky bitch,
she goes after lunch.

242
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,760
I can cover for you.

243
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,119
You'd do that?

244
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,400
Yeah.

245
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:29,439
I'll give you my pay.

246
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
Aw, don't...
Don't be ridiculous.

247
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,560
You've got a sick boy.

248
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,959
Life's too short.

249
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,319
You're so sweet, Robbie.

250
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,439
- You should go.
- Yeah.

251
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,239
Say hi to Sam for me.

252
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,880
I will.

253
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,119
Where have you been?!
You weren't at work.

254
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,000
- I rung you a million times.
- What happened?

255
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,359
He scored the crap
out of Ruby, that's all.

256
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,359
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing.

257
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,800
All day, just talking
to the air.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,319
- It even freaked me out
- I'm so sorry.

259
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,160
You need to get him to
see someone, Amelia.

260
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,280
It's not normal for a kid to
carry on with this rubbish.

261
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,280
It's not rubbish!
It's real!

262
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,400
Don't you talk to your
Auntie Claire like that!

263
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,640
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

264
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,239
You got them for me
on the internet.

265
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,560
Well, that's the
end of the internet.

266
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,479
If the Babadook was real,

267
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,160
we'd see it right now,
wouldn't we?

268
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,560
It wants to scare you first.

269
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
Then you'll see if.

270
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,560
Well, I'm not scared.

271
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,000
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

272
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,119
That's enough.

273
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,439
You will be when it
eats your insides!

274
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,719
I've decided you're not

275
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,280
having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

276
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

277
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:33,680
Samuel!

278
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,479
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,079
Mum and Dad!

280
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
Life is not always as it seems.

281
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,760
It can be a wondrous thing!

282
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,280
But if can also be
very treacherous.

283
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,280
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll save Mum.

284
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,439
I'm gonna trap the Babadook
like this!

285
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,800
When he's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it!

286
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,079
Samuel?

287
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,920
I was just putting
something back.

288
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,280
All your father's things
are down there.

289
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,479
He's my father!

290
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,119
You don't own him!

291
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,079
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

292
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,959
Can I come in?

293
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
Hi, matey.
This is for you.

294
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,359
My mum always got me a
model plane when I was sick.

295
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm not sick.

296
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,599
Oh. I...
I thought...

297
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,880
No, he's not, actually.

298
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,079
The truth is, he's so

299
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,680
disobedient he can't
go to school anymore.

300
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,119
You said that's not true!

301
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,400
How many six-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

302
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,599
who still believe in monsters?

303
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,079
I hate you!

304
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,800
She won't let me
have a birthday party,

305
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,920
and she won't let me
have a dad!

306
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,160
Ow.

307
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Don"r eat it.

308
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,560
The Babadook did it, Mum.

309
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,560
Go and watch a DVD, and
I'll make something else.

310
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,880
The Babadook did it!

311
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,920
Just go and watch a DVD,
Samuel.

312
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

313
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,280
welcome to The Great Martin's
DVD School of Magic.

314
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,520
Life is not always as it seems.

315
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,599
It can be ca wondrous thing.

316
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,719
But it can also be very
treacherous.

317
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:15,079
On this DVD, you will learn
magic tricks to surprise,

318
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,160
to delight and
perhaps even shock

319
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,880
your family and friends.

320
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,680
Do you think this is funny?

321
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,280
Oh, no.
No. No.

322
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,839
Give it to me!

323
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,359
Do you want to die?!

324
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,239
Don't let it in!

325
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,439
Don't let it in!

326
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Don't let it in!

327
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,880
Don't let it in!

328
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,119
Don't let it in!

329
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,760
Don't let it in!

330
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,640
Mum, do we have to go to
Ruby's party?

331
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,280
I've already got this doll, Mum.

332
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,359
Now she's got 0 twin.
They can go shopping together.

333
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
Come on.

334
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,959
Off you go.

335
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,880
He's just really tired.

336
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,160
Go and play right now.

337
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,479
Claire tells me
you're Cl writer.

338
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:18,760
Oh. no, not really.
Not anymore.

339
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
What kind of writing
did you do?

340
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,079
I wrote some articles for
some magazines

341
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,479
and did some
kids‘ stuff.

342
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,400
You just need to get
back into it, hat’s all.

343
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,959
It must be difficult.

344
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,640
I do volunteer work with some

345
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,719
disadvantaged women,

346
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,280
and a few of them have
lost their husbands,

347
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,560
and they find it very hard.

348
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,959
How's Richard's merger going?

349
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,319
Ah. Good.

350
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,000
I mean, his workload's
just ballooned.

351
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,560
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

352
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,479
- Tell me about if.
- I don't even have time to go

353
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,199
to the gym anymore.
It's ridiculous!

354
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
That's a real tragedy.

355
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,599
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore, how do you cope?

356
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,199
You must have
so much to talk about

357
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,959
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

358
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:15,239
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

359
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,880
I'm not hurting anybody.

360
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,520
Thank you.

361
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,839
Bye.

362
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,400
Thanks

363
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,880
Thanks

364
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,079
How would your mum
know if it's real or not?

365
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,959
She never comes to our house.

366
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,680
Mum told Dad
she didn't want

367
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,359
to go to your house
‘cause it's too depressing.

368
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,599
The Babadook would eat
your mum for breakfast.

369
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,520
- It’d rip her arms off!
- Shut up!

370
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:47,599
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

371
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,520
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can‘? cope.

372
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,280
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

373
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,560
Isn't it time you moved on?

374
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
I have moved on.

375
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,160
I don't mention him.

376
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't talk about him.

377
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,839
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

378
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,359
You're not even good enough
to have Cl dad.

379
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,680
Everyone else has one,
and you don't.

380
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,199
I do have CI dad!

381
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,359
I listen to your life,
day in, day out,

382
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,199
and you never stop
to ask me anything about mine.

383
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,479
I do.

384
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,599
I want to know how you are!

385
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,560
You don’t come around
to our house anymore.

386
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,199
Because I can‘? stand being
around your son.

387
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,920
I can't believe
you just said that.

388
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,119
You can't stand being
around him yourself.

389
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,640
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

390
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:29,800
That's not true!

391
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,800
And your mum
doesn't want you.

392
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,839
No one wants you.

393
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,079
What did you do?!

394
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,520
She said I didn't have a dad!

395
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,479
She kept saying if!

396
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,599
Is she all right?

397
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,560
Stay here and
look after the children!

398
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,479
Do you want another one
to get hurt?

399
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:58,959
Mummy!

400
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,239
She wouldn't believe me!

401
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,239
Mummy!

402
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,000
Mummy! MummY!

403
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,880
Mummy! MummY!

404
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,359
Why can‘? you
just be normal?!

405
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,079
There is no Babadook!

406
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,760
Get out!

407
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,119
- Get out!
- Samuel.

408
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,400
- Mummy!
- Stop this now.

409
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,680
Get out! Get out! Get out!

410
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,640
Please help me!

411
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,319
There's something
wrong with my son!

412
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,079
I think it may have been a
febrile convulsion.

413
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,560
That's when the brain overheats.

414
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,160
It always looks worse
than it is.

415
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,119
I've never seen
anything like this.

416
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,280
We'll have to wait until
the tests come back.

417
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,560
All his other results
are normal.

418
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,640
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety,

419
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,079
very committed
to the monster theory.

420
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,800
That's an understatement.

421
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,599
All children see monsters.

422
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,239
Not like this.

423
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,599
And it's getting worse.

424
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,199
He's becoming aggressive.

425
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,760
He could see a psychiatrist.

426
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,359
I can refer you.

427
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,959
Takes a few weeks to get in.

428
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,280
That’d be great.

429
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:45,760
But can you just give me
something for now,

430
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,719
just to make him sleep?

431
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,800
And just until...

432
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,280
Just until we can
get an appointment.

433
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,560
Please.

434
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,319
I haven": slept in weeks, and...

435
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,839
and neither has Samuel.

436
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,319
And when we go home tonight,

437
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,959
this whole nightmare will start

438
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,719
up again, and I'm really...

439
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,439
I'm really not coping.

440
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,600
I can give you a
short course of sedatives,

441
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,120
just until the tests come back.

442
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,879
Most mothers aren't too keen on
them unless it's really bad.

443
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,959
It's really bad.

444
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,199
These can make
children feel...

445
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,959
foggy, perhaps some
temporary nausea.

446
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,840
They'll certainly help him
sleep, though.

447
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,399
That's for one week.

448
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,560
Thank you.

449
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:51,520
Why don": people like me?

450
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,320
WhY do you say that?

451
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,919
Ruby said people don't like
me because I'm weird.

452
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,560
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

453
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,840
You just need to
take your medicine,

454
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,120
have a big sleep,
and not worry.

455
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't want you to die.

456
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,959
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

457
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,120
Did you think that about my
dad before he died?

458
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,159
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

459
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,199
I've got the day off tomorrow.

460
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,840
Maybe we can do something, hmm?

461
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,520
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

462
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,800
I think so, but you
have to promise me

463
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,320
not to mention it
again.

464
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:45,280
I promise to protect you if
you promise to protect me.

465
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,520
Then I won't mention it.

466
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:50,760
I promise to protect you.

467
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,679
Come on.

468
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,639
Come on.

469
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,399
Can you stay here with me?

470
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,879
Yes.

471
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,199
I love you, Mum.

472
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
Me too.

473
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,879
Her nose is broken
in two places.

474
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,080
She's gonna need surgery.

475
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
I'll pay for everything.

476
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,159
You can't even pay
your own bills.

477
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,479
Look, I really have to go.

478
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,840
Claire, I think someone is
stalking me and Samuel.

479
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,520
What?

480
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,600
A book turned up
at our place.

481
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,159
I threw it away,
but somebody

482
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,120
glued it back together
and put it on our doorstep.

483
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,479
Amelia.

484
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,639
I just can‘? help you right now.

485
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,600
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted--

486
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,439
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

487
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,479
I have to go.

488
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,000
Claire.

489
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,399
Hello?

490
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,879
Ba-ba dook!
Dook! Dook!

491
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,159
Hi.

492
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,919
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

493
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,080
Can you tell us what
happened?

494
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,399
Somebody sent me...
ca children's book.

495
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,360
And...?

496
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,120
And it contained violent and
graphic images of my child and

497
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,520
me being murdered.

498
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,320
Can we have a look
at the book, please?

499
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,399
I burnt if.

500
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,919
You burnt it.

501
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:03,159
Yes.

502
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,760
Well, unfortunately there's
nothing we can do about it.

503
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,919
He's been making phone calls
to me, as well.

504
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,280
What's he been saying?

505
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:16,159
Nothing.
Just making these... noises.

506
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,560
How do you know
it's the same person?

507
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,800
Because of what he
wrote in the book!

508
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,360
The book you burnt.

509
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,560
Yes.

510
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,439
Okay.

511
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,679
Don't worry about it.

512
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,959
Did you get your things done?

513
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,639
Mrs. Roach has Parkinson's.

514
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,159
That's why she shakes like this.

515
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,399
Samuel, you don": have to say

516
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,080
everything that goes
through your head.

517
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,879
Oh, it’s all right, love.

518
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,280
He wanted to know,
so we talked about it.

519
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:15,000
He sees things as they are,
that one.

520
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,280
Oskar was the same.

521
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,919
He always spoke his mind.

522
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,239
Do you have to keep on
bringing him up?

523
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,760
Hey, Bugsy.

524
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:31,879
Hey.

525
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Hey.

526
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:41,719
Don't come in here!

527
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,840
I don't want to buy anything.

528
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,479
Are you Amelia Vanek?

529
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,120
Yes.

530
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,719
I'm Warren Newton, and this
is Prue Flannery from the

531
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,399
Department of
Community Services.

532
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,199
My son's only been away
for two days.

533
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:09,760
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

534
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,760
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

535
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,080
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

536
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,760
I'm just in the middle of
cleaning up the house

537
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,320
at the moment.

538
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm sorry.
There's, um, stuff everywhere.

539
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,800
Hello, Samuel.

540
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,080
I'm Prue,
and this is Warren.

541
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,159
How are you?

542
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,959
I'm a bit tired from the
drugs Mum gave me.

543
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,399
Not drugs.
Tranquillizers.

544
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,360
From the doctor.

545
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,320
Oh, he had a fit yesterday.

546
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:49,080
I'm really tired actually.

547
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,479
That's no good.

548
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,280
May I have a
glass of water please?

549
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,000
Yes, of course.

550
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,120
I'll... get you one.

551
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,000
It's a real mess.

552
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,560
I just found this
cockroach infestation.

553
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,239
I normally have
the house sprayed.

554
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,399
I did actually already
have if sprayed,

555
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,919
but there's this hole in
the wall behind the fridge,

556
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:19,320
and that's why I...

557
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:27,840
I didn’t mean
cu hole in the wall.

558
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,679
Uh, there was a
hole in the wallpaper.

559
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:32,520
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

560
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,560
We've caught you
at a bad time.

561
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,360
I'll leave you with this.

562
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,879
We're required to
come back in a week

563
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:41,439
to talk through
your options.

564
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:43,679
Here's my card.

565
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:46,800
Mum.

566
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,560
I think I'm gonna vomit.

567
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,320
What was that noise I heard?

568
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,320
I didn't hear any noise.

569
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,800
Yeah, howling, doors
slamming.

570
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Why, I declare, Bonnie
thinks this house is haunted.

571
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,479
Mum.

572
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:24,560
I'm gonna go to bed.

573
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,120
Are you sick?

574
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,959
It's only 6:00.

575
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:34,000
Don't you want to stay up
with your Mum for a while?

576
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,520
No.

577
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,639
If you go to bed now the
pills won't work properly.

578
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,479
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

579
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,879
Where's its mother, Skip?

580
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,399
Koalas don"r leave
their babies about.

581
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,159
Hey, you're still there.

582
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,760
Yep, soon as I've fuelled up.

583
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,320
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio,

584
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,760
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

585
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,479
"And the prince and the
princess lived happily together

586
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,320
in a beautiful palace for the
rest of their days."

587
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:11,800
Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!

588
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,479
Where are we going?

589
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,639
We're going downstairs.

590
00:49:50,879 --> 00:49:52,800
- Why?
- Because we are.

591
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:14,399
Iris, Iris, Iris.

592
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,360
No.

593
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,399
Glass and mirror attachment.

594
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,520
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

595
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,000
for a streak-free shine.

596
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,679
As part of this
steaming special,

597
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:14,919
we'll even include the
garment and uphoIst--

598
00:51:15,879 --> 00:51:17,840
I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

599
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,560
All right, give
all my shifts away.

600
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,120
That's just what I need.

601
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,800
I can‘t help it if I'm sick.
What do you expect me to do?

602
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,159
You do that!

603
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,800
Mum.

604
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,959
I took the pills,
but I feel sick again.

605
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,120
I need to eat something.

606
00:52:00,439 --> 00:52:02,919
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

607
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:07,919
You said to have them
with food.

608
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,919
I'm really hungry, Mum.

609
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,320
Why do you have to keep
talk-talk-talking?

610
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,439
Don't you ever stop?

611
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,199
- I was just—
- I need to sleep!

612
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,199
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

613
00:52:25,399 --> 00:52:28,439
If you're that hungry, why
don't you go and eat shit?!

614
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,639
I'm so sorry.

615
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,159
I don't know why I said that

616
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:08,679
That was terrible.

617
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,639
I've had absolutely no sleep.

618
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,080
I didn't know what I was saying.

619
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,080
I'll cook you something, eh?

620
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:21,679
What would you like?

621
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,879
I'm not hungry anymore.

622
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,639
We really need to
get out of this house.

623
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:33,919
We've been cooped up
here too long.

624
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,679
That's the problem.

625
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,919
Do you want to go to WaIly's?

626
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,280
You can have anything you want,
all right?

627
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:49,000
Even ice cream for breakfast
if you like.

628
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:53,080
Give it back now.

629
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,800
- It's mine!
- Give it back.

630
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Stop it. Sit down.
Sit down now.

631
00:53:58,239 --> 00:53:59,159
- Now.

632
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,560
Give my drink back.

633
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,959
Go sit down, please.

634
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:09,879
Where are we going?

635
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,439
I just want to drive
for a little while.

636
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,120
Mummy!

637
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,560
Ba-ba dook! Dook! Dook!

638
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,879
You run straight into me!

639
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:47,919
I just bought this bloody car!

640
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:49,679
What were you thinking?

641
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh, driving on the
wrong side of the road,

642
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,800
with a kid in the
back!

643
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,639
You could've killed someone!

644
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,959
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

645
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,840
Hey!
Crazy bitch!

646
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,159
Hi, sweetheart.

647
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,919
Mum?

648
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,239
I can call Auntie Claire.

649
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,120
I can call and
she can come over.

650
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:35,199
Mum?

651
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,239
Auntie Claire doesn't want to
talk to us anymore.

652
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,439
Mum?

653
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,000
Mum, look at me.

654
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,280
It's nice and warm in here.

655
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,080
I don't want you to go away.

656
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,399
I'm not going anywhere.

657
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,199
Mum?

658
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,399
Mum.

659
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,120
I don't think we should
stay here tonight.

660
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,679
I can call Mrs. Roach.

661
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:55,760
I don't want you
to call anyone.

662
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:01,600
I just need to sleep.

663
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,919
- Mum.
- Leave it!

664
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,120
There's something in the house.

665
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,760
There's someone in the house!

666
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,800
Mrs. Roach.

667
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,879
Can we come
and stay the night?

668
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,320
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

669
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,239
Has someone broken
into the house?

670
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:13,719
- Sam said that—
- No, no, we're fine.

671
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:15,919
Samuel's just being very
disobedient again.

672
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,199
Oh.
I was so worried.

673
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,000
I told him
not to call anyone.

674
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,560
He asked if you could
stay the night.

675
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,760
No, no.
We're fine.

676
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,159
I just had a headache.
That's all.

677
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:26,919
I really have to go,
though, now, Gracie.

678
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,600
I'm so sorry for
troubling you.

679
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,879
Yes.
Talk soon?

680
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:32,679
No worries.
Talk soon.

681
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:37,560
I told you not to call anyone,

682
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,879
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

683
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,199
Do you want to
frighten Mrs. Roach,

684
00:59:43,439 --> 00:59:45,080
an old lady who
can hardly walk?

685
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,879
Do you want to make her sick?

686
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:50,919
Get that bloody thing off!

687
00:59:55,919 --> 00:59:58,719
Is this the only way
I can trust you

688
00:59:58,919 --> 01:00:01,959
not to embarrass me
in front of our neighbours?

689
01:00:06,959 --> 01:00:08,919
Is this what I have to do?

690
01:00:19,919 --> 01:00:20,800
I'm sorry, Mummy.

691
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,600
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then--

692
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,560
- What did you say?
- I said the BCIbCldOOk--

693
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,320
The Babadook isn't real,
Samuel.

694
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,080
It's just something you've made
up in your stupid little head.

695
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,719
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

696
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:40,120
I'll make sure nothing gets
in tonight, all right, Samuel?

697
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,159
Nothing is coming
in here tonight.

698
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:44,719
Nothing!

699
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:23,080
I feel sick.

700
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,639
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

701
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:29,800
Mum, I don't think I need--

702
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,639
I am the parent,
and you are the child,

703
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:33,320
so take the pill.

704
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,239
Good boy.

705
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,560
Mum!

706
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,360
Hey, Bugsy.

707
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:43,120
Hey, sweetie.

708
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,199
Come here, sweetie.
Hey.

709
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:50,360
Hey.

710
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:52,919
Hey.

711
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,560
Here we go.

712
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:23,199
There's more
where that came from.

713
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,959
Decide, or we all die.

714
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:43,439
What’s the secret—

715
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:47,919
...Ietter of Max's,
didn't you?

716
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,000
No, not for c: minute.

717
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:50,679
Don't lie.
You called me Cl Jezebel.

718
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:52,239
- Why?
- The north--

719
01:03:52,439 --> 01:03:53,560
Natural corset.

720
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,760
With fresh meat—

721
01:03:57,719 --> 01:03:58,760
Only five in--

722
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,879
You don't want to go in there
all by yourself, do you?

723
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:08,120
Police say the woman used a
kitchen knife to stab her son.

724
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,959
His body was found
in their basement.

725
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:13,840
The woman later attacked
officers with the knife.

726
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,399
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

727
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,959
Little is known about the
tragedy but neighbours say

728
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:23,800
boy was celebrating his
birthday today.

729
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,679
He had just turned seven.

730
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,320
Samuel.

731
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:47,760
Wake up, Mummy.

732
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:53,800
But you're the one who's
asleep, sweetheart.

733
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,120
Don't go down there.

734
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:08,080
It's not safe.

735
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:47,959
I thought you were dead.

736
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,320
I thought you were dead.

737
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:07,479
We can be together.

738
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:12,439
You just need to
bring me the boy.

739
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,879
You mean Samuel?

740
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,159
You can bring me the boy.

741
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:44,520
You can bring me the boy.

742
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,320
You can bring me the boy.

743
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,120
Stop calling him "the boy."

744
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,639
I think it's going to rain.

745
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,120
No.

746
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,280
No. No.

747
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,439
It isn't real, it isn't real,
it isn't real.

748
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:40,560
Aah! Ohh!

749
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:44,319
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

750
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:48,520
No, no.

751
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,359
No! No!

752
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,319
Bugsy!

753
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,080
Samuel!

754
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,520
Samuel.

755
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,919
Bugsy's hurt,
and we need to get help.

756
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,640
You don't want him to die,
do you?

757
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,080
Samuel.
Are you listening to me?

758
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,120
Let me in, you little shit!

759
01:11:26,839 --> 01:11:29,640
Let me in!
Let me in!

760
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:31,240
Let me in!

761
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,000
Let me in!

762
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,319
You little pig!

763
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,279
Six years old and
you're still wetting yourself!

764
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,160
You don't know how many times
I wished it was you,

765
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:07,560
not him, that died!

766
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,600
I just want you to be happy.

767
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:12,240
''I just want you
to be happy."

768
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:18,000
Sometimes...

769
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,919
I just want to smash your head
against a brick wall until

770
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,279
your fucking brains pop out!

771
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,919
You're not my mother.

772
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:28,959
What did you say?

773
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,399
I said, you're not my mother!

774
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,959
I am your mother!

775
01:12:37,919 --> 01:12:41,160
Run, run, run
as fast as you can!

776
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,759
Get awCIY!

777
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,000
Didn't I tell you not to play
with weapons?!

778
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:37,600
I'm sorry, love.

779
01:13:37,799 --> 01:13:39,000
I know it's late.

780
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:41,839
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

781
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm okay.

782
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,520
I know...

783
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:50,319
this time of year is
terribly hard for you.

784
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,600
And I know you don't want me to
go on about it, so I won"r.

785
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:57,000
I just wanted you to know that

786
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:59,439
I'd do anything for you and Sam.

787
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,359
I love you both.

788
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,919
Samuel.

789
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:11,759
I'm sorry.

790
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,600
I understand you're scared.

791
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:20,160
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

792
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,799
I haven’t been good at all.

793
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:29,399
I'm sick, Sam.
I need help.

794
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:36,279
I just spoke with Mrs. Roach.

795
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:41,799
We're gonna stay there tonight.

796
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:45,560
Do you want that?

797
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,120
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

798
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,160
I want you to meet your dad.

799
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,720
It's beautiful there.

800
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:13,560
You'll be happy.

801
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,160
- Aah!
- Unh!

802
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,439
Sorry, Mummy!

803
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,120
Aah!

804
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:44,240
Unh!

805
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,520
Mum!
Mum!

806
01:16:15,879 --> 01:16:17,080
I'm not leaving you!

807
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:22,720
Mum?

808
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,319
Mum?

809
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,080
We said we'd protect
each other!

810
01:16:39,839 --> 01:16:41,439
I know you don't love me.

811
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,120
The Babadook won't let you.

812
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:47,479
But I love you, Mum.

813
01:16:49,879 --> 01:16:51,399
And I always will.

814
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:02,759
You let it in!

815
01:17:02,959 --> 01:17:04,520
You have to get if out!

816
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,120
I don't want you to go away!

817
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,399
No, Mum, no!

818
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,799
NO! Mummy!

819
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,560
Mummy!

820
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:09,479
Mummy!

821
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:11,560
Mummy!

822
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:12,600
Mummy!

823
01:18:12,799 --> 01:18:14,359
Mummy!

824
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,520
Mummy!

825
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,680
Mummy!

826
01:18:55,959 --> 01:18:56,959
What is if?

827
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,919
You can't get rid
of the Babadook.

828
01:19:14,839 --> 01:19:15,759
Unh!

829
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:17,959
Ohm

830
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,600
What do you want?

831
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,720
What do you want?!

832
01:20:13,879 --> 01:20:15,640
No.

833
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:17,640
Keep breathing.

834
01:20:21,919 --> 01:20:23,000
Put your seat back, sweetheart.

835
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,680
10 more minutes,
and we're there.

836
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,080
No.

837
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,520
I think it's gonna rain.

838
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,319
Stop!

839
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,879
You are nothing.

840
01:21:42,759 --> 01:21:43,879
You're nothing!

841
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,359
This is my house!

842
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,799
You are trespassing in my house!

843
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,759
If you touch my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

844
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:13,479
Mummy, don't!

845
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:20,879
Don’t!

846
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,879
Watch out for your Mum's leg,
little one.

847
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,080
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

848
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:13,479
What time's the party?

849
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,479
Oh, any time
after 3:00 is fine.

850
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,680
I'll see you
in a few hours then.

851
01:25:17,839 --> 01:25:18,959
Bye.

852
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,520
Bye, Sam.

853
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:22,720
That school's a good choice.

854
01:25:22,919 --> 01:25:24,759
I've been doing a lot of
reading about it,

855
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,560
so I think Sam will be
happy there.

856
01:25:26,759 --> 01:25:28,600
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

857
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:30,319
It's time to get back.

858
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:33,680
We needed some time
to sort Cl few things out.

859
01:25:35,959 --> 01:25:38,919
- Are you having a party?
- It's Sam's birthday today.

860
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:42,240
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

861
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:43,479
That's not true.

862
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,560
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

863
01:25:46,799 --> 01:25:48,240
That's unusual.

864
01:25:51,799 --> 01:25:54,160
My husband died
the day that Sam was born.

865
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,640
He got killed driving Mum to
the hospital to have me.

866
01:25:59,919 --> 01:26:01,759
Sam's just like his dad was.

867
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,879
Always speaks his mind.

868
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:07,560
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

869
01:26:08,759 --> 01:26:10,160
My cousin's not coming

870
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:12,759
because I broke her nose
in two places.

871
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,279
I'll take that for you.

872
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,640
Good shot!

873
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:40,919
Look, there's another one!

874
01:26:41,759 --> 01:26:42,959
Where's your bowl?

875
01:26:46,799 --> 01:26:48,959
Wow, you've got a lot today!

876
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:52,240
Am I ever going to see it?

877
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,680
One day,
when you're bigger.

878
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:03,359
You go outside.

879
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,919
And you don't come in
until I tell you.

880
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,879
It's all right!
l’r's all right.

881
01:27:54,839 --> 01:27:55,919
It's all right.

882
01:27:56,759 --> 01:27:57,959
Shh!

883
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,120
Shh-shh!

884
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,799
Shh-shh!

885
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:07,680
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

886
01:28:08,759 --> 01:28:10,120
Shh-shh-shh.

887
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:32,640
How was if?

888
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:34,919
It's pretty quiet today.

889
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,720
Come here.

890
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,120
It's getting much better,
Mum.

891
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:50,399
Wait!

892
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:52,959
I have a new trick.

893
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:59,240
Life is not always as it seems.

894
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:02,479
Nothing in my hands,
nothing in my hands.

895
01:29:07,399 --> 01:29:08,879
That's great.

896
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,479
I haven't finished.

897
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,479
Abracadabra!

898
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:27,479
How did you do that?!

899
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,359
Come here, you.
Come here.

900
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,600
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
