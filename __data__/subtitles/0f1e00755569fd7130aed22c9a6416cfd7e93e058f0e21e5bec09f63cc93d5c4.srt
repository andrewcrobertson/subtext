(inhaling and exhaling deeply)

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,240
(male) OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
(cars whizzing past)

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,680
I eat losers for breakfast.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,720
(car accelerating)

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,080
Breakfast.

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,360
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,160
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
(cars whizzing)

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
I am lightning!

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,080
(pounding on door)

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,240
(male) Hey, Lightning! You ready?

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,800
(♪ Sheryl Crow:<i> Real Gone</i>)

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,640
(engine revving)

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,080

(crowd cheers)

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,360
Ka-chow!

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,520
(all cheer)

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Get your antenna balls here!

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
Go, Lightnin'!

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,360
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. (whistles)

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
(air wrench whirring)

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Uh! (screams)

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
(engine revs)

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
- (male) Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- (crowd cheers)

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
<i>We're midway through what may</i>
<i>be an historic day for racing.</i>

35
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's</i>
<i>through the roof.</i>

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're</i>
<i>gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,160
<i>(Bob) Three cars are tied</i>
<i>for the season points lead,</i>

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440
<i>heading into the final race</i>
<i>of the season.</i>

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,480
<i>And the winner of this race will win</i>
<i>the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,240
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,840
<i>have one more victory in him</i>
<i>before retirement?</i>

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
<i>(Darrell) He's been Dinoco's</i>
<i>golden boy for years!</i>

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,640
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,200
<i>(Bob) And, as always, in the</i>
<i>second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,960
<i>He's been chasing</i>
<i>that tailfin his entire career.</i>

47
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
<i>(Darrell) Chick thought</i>
<i>this was his year.</i>

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
<i>His chance to finally emerge</i>
<i>from The King's shadow.</i>

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>But the last thing he expected was...</i>
<i>Lightning McQueen!</i>

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,760
<i>(Bob) You know, I don't think</i>
<i>anybody expected this.</i>

51
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560
<i>The rookie sensation</i>
<i>came into the season unknown.</i>

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,200
<i>(Darrell) Will he be the first rookie</i>
<i>to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
<i>(Bob) The legend, the runner-up,</i>
<i>and the rookie!</i>

55
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,760
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,800
(breaks screeching)

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
No you don't.

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
- (chuckling)
- Hey!

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
- (tyres squealing)
- (crowd booing)

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,000
What a ride!

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,360
(chuckling)

62
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,640
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
(female) I love you, Lightning!

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
- Dinoco is all mine.
- (screaming)

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
(Darrell) Trouble, turn three!

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,320
- Get through that, McQueen.
- (Bob) Huge crash!

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,640
(crowd gasps)

68
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,040
(screaming)

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,160
(giggling)

70
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,800
- (grunts)

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,920
(both screaming)

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,040
(Bob) Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,280
(Darrell) There's no way the rookie
can make it through! Not in one piece.

74
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,960
(exhaling)

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
Yeah!

76
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Lightning! Oh!

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,000
(Darrell) Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

78
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,720
(Bob) A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,720
Yeah! Ka-chow!

80
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,040
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

81
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,400
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! (honking)

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,680
(Bob) While everyone
heads into the pits,

83
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

84
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,280
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,120
(air wrench whirring)

86
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,640
(chuckling) What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
- McQueen made it!
- (Chick) What?

88
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,640
He's not pitting!

89
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,880
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

90
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,720
He's not going into the pits!

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,320
(Darrell) The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

92
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
- (Bob) Says he likes working alone.
- Go!

93
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,480
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

96
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
(crowd cheers)

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
Come on, come on, come on!

98
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,400
We need tyres now!
Come on, let's go!

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,160
- No, no, no, no! No tyres, just gas!
- (male) What?

100
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,640
You need tyres, you idiot!

101
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,840
(Darrell) Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
(Bob) Right. No tyres again.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,320
(Darrell) That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

104
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,080
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

105
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,320
(cars whizzing)

106
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,840
(Bob) This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

107
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,960
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,320
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
(crowd cheers and whistles)

110
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,920
(screaming)

111
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- (tyre blows)

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,120
(Darrell) McQueen's blown a tyre!

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,920
(Bob) And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,600
- You fool!
- (grunts)

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,360
(male) McQueen's blown a tyre!

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
Go, go, go!

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,080
- (grunting)
- (tyre blows)

118
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,840
(Darrell) Lost another tyre!

119
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,160
- King and Chick come up fast!
- (Bob) Entering turn three!

120
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,120
Come on. (grunting)

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

122
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,840
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

123
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,200
(gasping)

124
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
(growling)

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,160
(Bob) The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

126
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,240
(Darrell) Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,160
- It's too close to call!
- I don't believe it!

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,560
Lightning!

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,880
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

130
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,640
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

131
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
And we don't know who won!

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
<i>(tape jittering)</i>

133
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
<i>(slow motion drone)</i>

134
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,520
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

136
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,280
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,</i>
<i>awaiting the results.</i>

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,960
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,</i>
<i>not taking tyres.</i>

138
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,080
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,880
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have</i>
<i>a crew chief out there?</i>

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,960
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing</i>
<i>than just winning.</i>

141
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,920
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...</i>
<i>Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

143
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,480
<i>- Sizzle?</i>
<i>- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

144
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,400
<i>No, I'm not.</i>
<i>Cos I'm a one-man show.</i>

145
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,040
<i>That was a confident</i>
<i>Lightning McQueen.</i>

147
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,480
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

149
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
You're blockin' the camera!

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

151
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,000
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

152
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,120
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr One-Man Show!

153
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

154
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,760
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

155
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,920
(crowd laughs)

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

157
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh, whatever.

158
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,640
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

159
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

160
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,320
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,880
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

162
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

163
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,240
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

164
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,040
In your dreams, Thunder.

165
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,320
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,240
You know, cos thunder
always comes after lightning.

167
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

169
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
That's right.

170
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
Right in the lens.

171
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

172
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,640

- That's it!

(crowd chattering)

175
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,280
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
Thank you, King.

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,320
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

178
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
It's the least I could do.

179
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,880
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

181

Kch-i-ka-chow!

182

- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

(both) We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

I love being me.

Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,920
Oh, hey, Mr The King.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
You got more talent in one lug nut

190
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,440

in their whole body.

191

- But you're stupid.

192

- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,920
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,720
(voice dwindling) and you let them
do their job, like they should.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,160
A good team.

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,160
- Yeah...

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,440

Oh, Lightning!

203
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,520
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

204
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

205
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,560
Thank you, Mr The King.

207
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,200
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

208
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,960
(revving) A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

209
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes!

210
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,280
(Bob) ...we have a three-way tie.

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,320
- (crowd cheers)
- (cameras flash)

212
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,200
(chuckling) Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

213
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,880
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

214
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,520
(Bob) Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

215
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,800
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

216
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,160
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

217
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,040
(whispering) Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

218
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

219
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,960
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

220
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,680
Yep! All right! Got it!

221
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,200
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,920
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
Huh?

224
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,520
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

225
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

226
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,960
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

227
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,760
Gotta make your appearance.

228
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,360
No. No! No, no, no, no!

229
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,880
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>
<i>Lightning McQueen here.</i>

230
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,600
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated</i>
<i>Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

231
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,400
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper</i>
<i>like Rust-eze.</i>

232
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,240
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,040
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too</i>

236
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
I met this car from Swampscott.

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,680
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

238
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,840
- You could see his dirty undercarriage.
- (crowd laughs)

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,040
(groaning) I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

240
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,560
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

241
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

242
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,520
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

243
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,760
(male 1) Remember, that salt and grime
can rust your bolts and freeze...

244
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,080
Hey, look! There he is!

245
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
Our almost champ!

246
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
(male 1) Get your rear end in here.

247
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,200
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

248
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,560
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

249
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

250
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
Yes, I know. (chuckles)

251
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,880
"Fred." Fred, thank you.

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,520
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

253
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,680
Looking good, Freddie!

254
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

255
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
We might clear enough
to buy you headlights.

256
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,040
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

257
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,600
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

258
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

259
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,320
because the track is always lit.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

261

You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

267
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,560
ran a great race today.

268
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,280
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

269
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,840
(whispering) And an insane
amount of luck,

270
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

271

And we're looking forward
to another great year.

Just like this year!

Not on your life.

Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

336
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
Gesundheit!

337
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,200

Hey, Mack! Mack!

346
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,200
Mack!

347
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840

Mack! Mack!

356
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,720
What? You're not Mack.

357
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,880
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

358
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,600
(Peterbilt)
Turn on your lights, you moron!

364
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Oh, no.

- Oh, maybe he can help me!
- (Sheriff backfiring)

366
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,240
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
(backfiring)

368
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,680
I haven't gone this fast in years.

369
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,600
(grunting) I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

370
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,960
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

371
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,760
What in the blue blazes?

372
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Crazy hot-rodder.

- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!

Boy, I was wonderin'

Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

- What's going on here? Please!
- (chuckling) You're funny.

426
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,000
I like you already. My name's Mater.

427
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Mater?

428
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,520
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

429
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,800
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

430
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,000
Uh...

431
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,360
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

432
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,480
What?

433
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,320
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

434
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,640
Where are you? Shoot!

435
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,280
You're in Radiator Springs.

436
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,760
The cutest little town
in Carburettor County.

437
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,720
Oh, great. Just great!

438
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,280
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

439
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,280
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

440
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,200
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

441
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,000
you and me go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

442
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,320
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

443
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,960
- Cool!
- Mater!

444
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,840
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

445
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,400
To not to.

446
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,880
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

447
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

448
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,000
(chuckling) "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

449
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,280
Ah!

450
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,080
(Sheriff) The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

451
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,600
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

452
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,800
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

453
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
- Fascist!
- Commie!

454
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,880
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

455
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,840
I gotta get to California, pronto.

456
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
Where's your lawyer?

457
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,640
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

458
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,600
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

459
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

460
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,360
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

461
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,240
All rise! The Honourable
Doc Hudson presiding.

462
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,680
Show-off.

463
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,840
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.

464
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,640
- (gasping)
- All right,

465
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

466
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
I want his hood on a platter!

467
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

468
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

469
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,840
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

470
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm...

471
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

472
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,840
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

473
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,360
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

474
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

475
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
Sorry I'm late, Your Honour!

476
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,440
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

477
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,960
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

478
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,480
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

479
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,520
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

480
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,720
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

481
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,960
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

482
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,880
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

483
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

484
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

485
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,920
- (revving)
- Agh! Ow!

486
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

487
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,520
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

488
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,360
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

489
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,680
Do what you gotta do, baby.
Be careful.

490
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

491
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
Ka-ching!

492
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,960
Ah!

493
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,240
I'll keep that in mind.

494
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,960
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

495
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,320
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

496
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,280
You know her?

497
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,080
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

498
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,320
What?

499
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,320
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

500
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,240
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

501
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,920
What do you want, Sally?

502
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,400
(sighing) Make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

503
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,600
No. I know his type. Racecar.

504
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
That's the last thing this town needs.

505
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,320
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

506
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,360
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

507
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,840
Here she goes again.

508
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,600
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

509
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,320
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

510
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,040
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travellers

511
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,320
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travellers? What travellers?

512
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,480
Ignore him.

513
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,920
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travellers

514
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,320
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

515
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,200
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- tyres.

516
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,920
And if no one can get to you?

517
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,160
I won't sell any... tyres.
I will lose everything!

518
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,080
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

519
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,440
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

520
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,160
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

521
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,720
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

522
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,880
What happens if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

523
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,560
- (all) Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

524
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,440
You think the car responsible
should fix our road?

525
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,520
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

526
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,680
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

527
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,040
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

528
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
Oh, he can do it.

529
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,080
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

530
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,800
(all) Fix the road!

531
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,280
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

532
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,640
(all cheer)

533
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,920
(honking) Order in the court!

534
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,440
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

535
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,480
- (all) Yeah!
- No!

536
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,880
(VW van) Nice ruling.

537
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,160
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

538
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,200
(chuckling) That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

539
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,000
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

540
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,880
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

541
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,400
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

542
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,200
(gurgling)

543
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,600
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

544
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,720
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

545
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,560
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

546
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,920
What? This place is crazy!

547
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,160
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

548
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,160
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

549
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,320
What?

550
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,920
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

551
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
You gotta be kidding me.

552
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,320
You start there where the road begins.

553
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,680
You finish down there
where the road ends.

554
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,800
(Mater) Holy shoot!

555
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

556
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,520
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

557
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,760
Five days?

558
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,760
I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

559
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

560
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,360
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

561
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,600
(grunting)

562
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,080
(tyres squealing, engine revving)

563
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,680
(Lightning) Freedom!

564
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,200
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

565
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,600
...and then...
then took the boot off.

566
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,440
Whoo-hoo!

567
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

568
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,160
California, here I come! Yeah!

569
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,560
Oh, feel that wind.

570
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,560
Yes!

571
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
(sputtering)

572
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,960
No. No, no, no.

573
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,360
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

574
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
How can I be outta gas?

575
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,360
(chuckling) Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

576
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,840
(stuttering) But how did,
how did... you...?

577
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,440
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

578
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,240
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

579
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,920
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

580
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
Hey, Sheriff.

581
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,720
- Why here?
<i>- (Italian) Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

582
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,680
- They were better before.
<i>- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

583
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,560
<i>-</i> Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

584
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

585
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,840
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

586
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,680
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

587
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,640
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

588
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,000
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

589
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,360
That's why we made him the judge.

590
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,680
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
<i>Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

591
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,240
Now, I'm not one to brag

592
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,920
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,080
Oh!

594
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

595
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,640
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

596
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,080
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

597
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,880
- (snorting, hacking)
- No, no, no!

598
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,040
That won't be necessary.

599
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,640
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

600
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,360
I could use a hose down.
Help me wash this off.

601
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,840
Where's he goin'?

602
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,240
He's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

603
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
I shouldn't put up with this.

604
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,840
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

605
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,160
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

606
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,400
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

607
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,120
Yes, I'm a real racecar. Look at me.

608
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

609
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,760
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

610
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,720
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

611
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I must scream it to the world!

612
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,080
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

613
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,680
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

614
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,720
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

615
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,440
- (Lightning) What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

616
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,840
Is that what I think it is?

617
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,680
(Sally) Customers.

618
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

619
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,640
Customers?

620
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,880
(Sally) Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

621
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

622
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,800
You all know what to do.
Nobody panics. Here we go!

623
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,520
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

624
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,000
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

625
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,760
- Honey, please.
- (Sally) Hello.

626
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,920
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

627
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,360
Legendary for its service and
hospitality. How can we help you?

628
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,960
- We don't need anything.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

629
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,640
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

630
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,080
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

631
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,040
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

632
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,200
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

633
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,880
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

634
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,800
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

635
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,200
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

636
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,760
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

637
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,160
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

638
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400
I do have a map
over at the Cosy Cone Motel.

639
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,840
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

640
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,560
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

641
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,120
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

642
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,160
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

643
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,400
No we just topped off.

644
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,320
And if you need tyres,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

645
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
home of the Leaning Tower of Tyres.

646
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,400
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

647
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

648
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,880
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

649
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,280
Maybe ghost flames!

650
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,000
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

651
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,000
- (both gasp)
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

652
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,000
(chuckling) OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

653
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,560
Ow!

654
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,840
(laughs) A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

655
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,160
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

656
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,720
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

657
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,400
(Van) OK! Yes. You bet.

658
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,720
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

659
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

660
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,160
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

661
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,640
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,240
No, not really. But listen.

663
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,120
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

664
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,160
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

665
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,400
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

666
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,840

- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

667
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,880
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

668
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,040
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

669
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm becoming one of them!

670
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,160
- (Lightning echoes)
- (sighing)

671
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,200
Don't worry. They know where we are now.
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

672
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,280
<i>(Male DJ) We'll be back</i>
<i>for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

673
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
- That's good.
-<i> ...after a Piston Cup update.</i>

674
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,720
<i>(Kori) Still no sign of Lightning</i>
<i>McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

675
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>and today became the first car</i>
<i>to spend practice time on the track.</i>

676
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,760
<i>(Chick) It's nice to get out here</i>
<i>before the other competitors.</i>

677
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,560

<i>Gives me an edge.</i>

678

679
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,760
(laughing)

680
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,800
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

681
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,720
Ha-ha!

682
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,560
Yeah!

683
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,880
(crowd shouting and cheering)

684
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,040
(girls chattering and giggling)

685
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,720
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

686
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
(gasping) Oh!

687
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,280
Let me get this straight.

688
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,320
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

689
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,000
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

690
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,400
I got a road to finish.

691
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,880
(grunting and revving)

692
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,440
- He's done!
- Done?

693
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,000
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

694
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,160
- (Bessie groans)
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

695
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,080
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
All you gotta say.

696
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,560
(Mater) Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

697
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,520
Oh!

698
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,640
(vibrating) It rides purty smooth.

699
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

700
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,880
- Oh!
- (blubbering)

701
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Red.

702
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,160
Who do you think you are?

703
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,560
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

704
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,040
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

705
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,560
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

706
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,280
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

707
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,960
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

708
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,200
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

709
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,040
- What?
- (chuckling) Me and you. That a joke?

710
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,440
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

711
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,200
If I win, you do the road my way.

712
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,120
Doc, what're you doin'?

713
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,840
I don't mean to be rude here,

714
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,840
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

715
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,640
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

716
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,160
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

717
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,480
(Sheriff) Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

718
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,960
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

719
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,000
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

720
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,600
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

721
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,800
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

722
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,640
and no lollygaggin'.

723
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,320
Speed. I'm speed.

724
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,760
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

725
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,000
(Luigi laughs)

726
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,960
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

727
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,560
- Peet stop!
- Uh... (chuckles)

728
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,520
The race is only one lap, guys.

729
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,080
<i>Uno</i> lappo! Don't need any help.

730
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,000
- I work<i> solo mio.</i>
- Fine. Race your way.

731
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,200
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

732
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,680
Gentlemen...

733
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,720
...start your engines!

734
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,520
(engine sputters)

735
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
(revving furiously)

736
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,840
-<i> ¡Hijole!</i> Check that out!
- Whoa.

737
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,320
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

738
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,720
Luigi?

739
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,960
(chuckling) On your mark, get set...

740
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,280
<i>Uno</i> for the money,
<i>due</i> for the show,

741
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:30,080
<i>tre</i> to get ready, and<i> quattro</i>
to... I can't believe it. Go!

742
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,520
(giggling)

743
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,000
(cheering)

744
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,440
Huh?

745
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,000
Doc... the flag means go.

746
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,400
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

747
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,240
Doc, what are you doing, man?

748
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,880
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

749
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,080
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

750
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,920
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

751
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,040
You got your tow cable?

752
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,320
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

753
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,720
(Doc) Oh, just in case.

754
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,440
(yelling) Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

755
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,280
No, no, no, no, no!

756
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,880
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

757
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,760
- Ow!
- (Fillmore) Bad trip, man.

758
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,320
(revving)

759
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,000
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

760
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,400
- I'm confused.
- (chuckling)

761
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,560
(Doc) You drive like you fix roads.

762
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,880
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

763
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,320
(gasps) Ah!

764
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

765
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,720
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

766
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,440
I can make a little turn on dirt.

767
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,960
You think?

768
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,440
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

769
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,960
Hey,<i> ése!</i>
You need a new paint job, man!

770
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,200
- (Lightning) No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

771
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,480
- That freak juice?
- (Lightning) Pass.

772
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,040
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

773
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,760
Nah, not me, Flo.

774
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,600
I'm on one of them there special diets.

775
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,400
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

776
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,760
"You race like you fix roads."

777
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,600
(grunting) I'll show him.
(grunting) I will show him!

778
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,280
- (tar splattering)
- Oh, great! I hate it!

779
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,920
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- (chuckles) Music. Sweet music.

780
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,680
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

781
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,520
(Lightning)
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

782
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,680
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

783
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,240
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

784
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,360
Wow.

785
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,120
(Mater) Mornin', Sally!

786
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,360
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

787
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,880
Yes! Uh, amazing!

788
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,560
Whoa-ho! Yeah! (sighing)

789
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,840
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

790
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,480
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

791
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,680
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

792
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,240
<i>(Italian) È bellissima!</i> It's beautiful!

793
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,680
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

794
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,000
Boy, I tell you what.

795
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,920
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

796
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,680
Doc, look at this!

797
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,680
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

798
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,200
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

799
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,640
Guido, look at Luigi!

800
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,600
This is<i> fantastico!</i>

801
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,080
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

802
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,520
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

803
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,840
That crazy old devil woman.

804
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,720
(sighs) Oh!

805
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,640
She's right!

806
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,280
- Ah!
- Guido!

807
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,920
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

808
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,200
Well, now... where the heck is he?

809
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,280
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

810
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,720
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

811
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,120
and asked me if he could
come down here.

812
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,600
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

813
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,880
(Lightning) No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

814
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

815
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,600
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

816
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,320
I'll keep an eye on him.

817
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,160
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

818
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,640
(engine revving)

819
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
(screaming)

820
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,800
(spitting)

821
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,960
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

822
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,760
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

823
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,160
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

824
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,760
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

825
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,880
Give it too much, you'll
be outta the dirt and in tulips.

826
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,080
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

827
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,840
I'll put it simple.

828
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,040
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

829
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.

830
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,480
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

831
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,360
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

832
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,080
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

833
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,560
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

834
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680
(groans)

835
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,800
(Lightning) Turn right to go left.

836
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,080
Hmm...

837
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,240
Whoa!

838
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,680
- Oh!
- (car crashing)

839
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,480
- Ow! Oh, that...
- (cactus crashing)

840
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,600
(screaming) Ow!

841
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,120
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

842
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,280
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

843
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,760
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

844
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,800
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

845
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,200
- Oh, Guido,<i> è bellissimo!</i>
<i>- Che cosa?</i>

846
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,640
- It looks great! This is great!
<i>- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

847
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,160
(grunts, passes gas)

848
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,120
Oh, Lord.

849
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,960
- (chuckles)
- (Sheriff) Mater!

850
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,200
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

851
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,520
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

852
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,440
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

853
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,000
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

854
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,760
(groaning) Oh...

855
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,520
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

856
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,120
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

857
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,480
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

858
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,800
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

859
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,920
You make-a such a nice new road.

860
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,640
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

861
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,400
Even though you not a Ferrari.

862
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,480
You buy four tyres,
I give you a full-a size spare

863
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,440
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tyres for free.

864
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,040
(chuckling) I like your style, eh?

865
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,640
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

866
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,120
You buy one tyre,
I give you three for free!

867
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,960
(Flo) Oh, would you look at that?

868
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,120
Ramone, Ramone!

869
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,000
(Luigi) Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

870
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,320
(Lightning) No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

871
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,120
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

872
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,840
You buy one tyre, I give you
seven-a snow tyres for free!

873
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,800
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

874
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,160
(exhales deeply)

875
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,360
Ah!

876
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,600
Stop! Let me...

877
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,840
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

878
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,960
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

879
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,320
Stop, stop! That's cold!

880
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,920
Help! Please! Stop!

881
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,360
- (coughing, sputtering)
- Thanks, Red.

882
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,840
What was that for?

883
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,520
- Do you want to stay at the Cosy Cone?
- Huh?

884
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,240
If you do, you gotta be clean. Even
in hillbilly hell we have standards.

885
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,000
What, I...? I don't get it.

886
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,720
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

887
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,960
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

888
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,680
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cosy cone.

889
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,640
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

890
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,200
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

891
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,440
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no. That's OK.

892
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,680
- Yeah, the Cosy Cone.
- (Sally) It's newly refurbished.

893
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,240
(Lightning chuckles) Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

894
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,440
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

895
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,920
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

896
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,640
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

897
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,080
Cone number one, if you want.

898
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,520
Oh...

899
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,400
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

900
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,560
Oh... (chuckles)
That's just a... Oh!

901
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,040
(both chuckle)

902
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

903
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,200
Gonna... Yeah.

904
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,520
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- (gasps)

905
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,200
Good-lookin' girl.

906
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,440
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

907
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,120
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

908
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,600
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

909
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,800
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
cos I'm in charge of watchin' you!

910
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,000
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

911
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,640
Well, that's all right,
Mr I Can't Turn On Dirt.

912
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

913
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,640
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

914
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,960
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

915
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,320
I can handle anything.

916
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,240
- (whispering) I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! (chuckles)

917
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,960
- (Mater) Tractor-tippin's fun.
- (Lightning) This is ridiculous.

918
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,560
- (tractors snore)
- (Mater) All right, listen.

919
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,640
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

920
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,560
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

921
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,520
(Lightning whispering) Mater!

922
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,040
Wait, Mater!

923
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,360
OK, here's what you do.

924
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,600
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

925
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,200
And they do the rest. Watch this.

926
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,080
- (honking loudly)
- Oh!

927
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,320
Oh... Oh! Oh... (mooing)

928
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,200
(gas sloshing, backfiring)

929
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,160
(laughing loudly)

930
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,840
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

931
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,240
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

932
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,920
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

933
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,480
- (honking)
- Oh!

934
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,160
Oh! Oh... (mooing)

935
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,120
(gas sloshing, backfiring)

936
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,200
(laughing) I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

937
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,080
Oh, your turn, bud.

938
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,480
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

939
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,760
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

940
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,320
(clucking)

941
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,720
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

942
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,320
(snoring)

943
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,120
- (revving engine)
- Oh!

944
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,280
(all exclaiming and mooing)

945
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,200
(all gurgling)

946
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,320
(all backfiring)

947
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,200
(angry mooing)

948
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,000
(mooing)

949
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,200
That's Frank.

950
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,840
- (bellowing angrily)
- (shouting)

951
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,600
- (mooing)
- (engine revving)

952
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,200
(Mater laughing)

953
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,000
Run!

954
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,560
- Here he comes, look out!
- (bellowing)

955
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,680
(laughing) Whoa!

956
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,280
(screaming)

957
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,680
Run! He's gonna get ya!

958
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,040
(Mater laughing)

959
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,080
Oh! Customers!

960
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,800
Oh!

961
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,200
Ah, no, no, no.

962
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,040
Oof! Oh!

963
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,640
(Mater) Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

964
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,240
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

965
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,400
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

966
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,400
Oh, yeah... yeah.

967
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,600
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

968
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,840
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

969
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,120
Oh...

970
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,360
- Gettin' cosy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

971
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,560
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

972
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,520
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

973
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,360
- Where, where?
- (laughing)

974
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,080
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

975
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,200
- (Mater) You do.
- (Lightning) No way.

976
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,480
- Way.
- Come on...

977
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,720
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature. Real grown up.

978
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,840
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

979
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,920
You love her! You love her.

980
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,440
Mater, enough!

981
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,360
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

982
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,840
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

983
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,800
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

984
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,000
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

985
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,760
(Lightning) What are you doing?
Watch out!

986
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,160
Mater? Mater!

987
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,840
- Mater!
- (laughing)

988
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,400
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

989
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,920
(screaming happily)

990
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,200
Oof!

991
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,720
(blubbering) Yee-hee!

992
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,040
(chuckling) He's nuts.

993
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,600
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

994
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,280
Just need to know where I've been.

995
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,320
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

996
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Rear-view mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

997
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,640
(chuckling) Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

998
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,720
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

999
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,480
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1000
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,920
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1001
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,040
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

1002
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,680
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

1003
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,400
with private helicopters.

1004
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,760
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

1005
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,960
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

1006
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,400
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

1007
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,880
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

1008
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,640
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1009
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,320
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1010
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

1011
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

1012
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,080
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!

1013
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,000
In what?

1014
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,840
My best friend.

1015
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,120
See you tomorrow, buddy!

1016

1018
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,040
(laughing)

1019
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,680
(revving engine) Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1020
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,120
(chuckling)

1021
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,960
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!

1022
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,440
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.

1023
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,760
(both scream)

1024
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,640
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.

1025
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,880
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.

1026
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,120
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.

1027
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,840
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.

1028
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,680
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?

1029
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,760
Something about a helicopter ride.

1030
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?

1031
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,640
- Did you mean it?
- What?

1032
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,840
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?

1033
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,120
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.

1034
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,240
Uh-huh.

1035
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,200
You know... Mater trusts you.

1036
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,320
Yeah, OK.

1037
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,000
- Did you mean that?
- What?

1038
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:15,680
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

1039
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,400
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.

1040
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,000
Yeah, OK. G'night.

1041
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,720
(groans) Oh...

1042
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,880
Hey, thank you.

1043
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,840
What did you just say?

1044
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,840
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.

1045
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,680
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.

1046
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,320
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.

1047
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,720
- G'night.
- Good night.

1048
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,440
Hmm.

1049
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,000
(reveille plays)

1050
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,880
(♪ Jimi Hendrix:<i> Star Spangled Banner</i>)

1051
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,960
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?

1052
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:14,160
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

1053
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,880
(groaning)

1054
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,680
(breathing rapidly)

1055
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,520
(muttering)

1056
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,800
(fast-paced electronic music)

1057
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,400
Ah!

1058
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,760
- (mooing loudly)
- (screaming)

1059
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,920
No!

1060
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,760
(yelling loudly)

1061
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,040
(mooing)

1062
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,480
- No! (gasping)
- (alarm beeping)

1063
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,280
I gotta get outta here!

1064
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,640
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

1065
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,960
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?

1066
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,520
(stuttering) I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.

1067
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,680
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.

1068
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,480
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!

1069
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,160
(Sheriff) Hope you enjoyed the show!

1070
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,400
(groaning)

1071
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,400
Whoa, Doc.

1072
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,200
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.

1073
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,040
What?

1074
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,360
He has a Piston Cup?

1075
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,640
Oh, my gosh.

1076
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,000
Three Piston Cups?

1077
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,360
- (Doc) Sign says stay out.
- (gasps)

1078
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,680
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...

1079
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,880
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.

1080
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,040
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!

1081
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,760
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

1082
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,800
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1083
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,480
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. We gotta talk.

1084
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,960
- You gotta show me your tricks.
- I tried that.

1085
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,800
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!

1086
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,320
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

1087
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,480
(country music)

1088
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,720
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.

1089
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,680
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.

1090
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,040
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your colour!

1091
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,680
- (Ramone) Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!

1092
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,960
There he is.

1093
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,200
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?

1094
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,040
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.

1095
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,720
No, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.

1096
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,040
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!

1097
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,400
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.

1098
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,560
I mean, have you ever seen him race?

1099
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,200
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!

1100
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,160
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

1101
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,720
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!

1102
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,960
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.

1103
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,480
(Ramone) I think he needs
a new coat of poly.

1104
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,200
- (Mater) Are you sick?
- You are lookin' peaked.

1105
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,920
He needs a new coat of poly!

1106
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,280
(gas bell rings)

1107
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,800
- (Sheriff) Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me.

1108
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,640
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.

1109
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,800
Hmm... I trust him.

1110
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,040
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?

1111
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,560
Yeah, a drive.

1112
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,640
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?

1113
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,360
Ah... No. No, we don't.

1114
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,600
(gas pump stops)

1115
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,760
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?

1116
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,720
(Flo) Mm-hm!

1117
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,240
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

1118
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,000
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

1119
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,760
That's so too much!

1120
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,280
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

1121
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
I don't know.

1122
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,240
Whoa! Yes.

1123
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,120
- (sputtering)
- (laughing)

1124
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,680
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

1125
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,400
- Bleah!
- (chuckling)

1126
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,920
- (grunts)
- (laughs)

1127
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,240
(sputtering)

1128
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,280
(laughing)

1129
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,400
(chuckles) Oh!

1130
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,760
(spitting)

1131
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,920
(Lightning) Wow. What is this place?

1132
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,800
Wheel Well.

1133
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,440
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

1134
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,160
This place?

1135
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,120
(horns beeping)

1136
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,880
(Sally sighing) Yeah, imagine.

1137
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,240
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

1138
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,160
You know, I don't get you.

1139
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,320
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

1140
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,720
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

1141
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,920
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

1142
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,120
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

1143
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,760
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

1144
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,440
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

1145
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,280
And you know what?

1146
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,360
It never felt... happy.

1147
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,760
Yeah. I mean... really?

1148
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,520
Yeah. So I left California.

1149
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,960
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

1150
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,480
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

1151
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,560
Well, they all did. And I never left.

1152
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,600
Yeah. You know, I understand.

1153
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,600
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

1154
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,200
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

1155
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,640
(inhaling heavily) I fell in love.

1156
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,400
- Oh.
- Yep.

1157
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,040
- Corvette?
- No.

1158
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,080
I fell in love with this.

1159
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,080
Whoa. Look at that.

1160
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,000
Look, they're drivin' right by.

1161
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,480
They don't even know
what they're missing!

1162
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,880
(Sally) Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

1163
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,800
Oh, yeah?

1164
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,440
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

1165
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,760
Really?

1166
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,560
(Sally) Yeah. Back then,

1167
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,000
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

1168
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,160
How do you mean?

1169
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,560
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

1170
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,880
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

1171
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,480
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

1172
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,040
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

1173
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,680
They drove on it to have a great time.

1174

(♪ James Taylor:<i> Our Town</i>)

1175
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,080
Well, what happened?

1176
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,640
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

1177
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,400
(Lightning) How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

1178
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

1179
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,520
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

1180
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,680
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1181
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,600
I had a great time.

1182
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,920
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

1183
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,240
You're welcome.

1184
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,040
Hey, listen, listen!

1185
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,160
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1186
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240

No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

1192
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,760
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tyres.

1193
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,640
- (Sheriff) Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1194
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,400
Then where did these
gol-durn tractors come from?

1195
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,800
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

1196
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,840
There's one goin' this way.

1197
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,960
I got it.

1198
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,760
Come here, little tractor,
come here.

1199
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,120
Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1200
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,960
No, no, no, no, come here.
What are you doing?

1201
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,720
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...

1202
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,680
...alone.

1203
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,080
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tyres?

1204

1205
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,000
Come on, Doc, drive.

1207
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,720
Ah... Yeah.

1208
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,480
- Wow.
- Huh?

1209
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,080
You're amazing!

1210
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,360
(coughing) What are you doin'?

1211
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,120
Doc, wait!

1212
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,880
(trucks mooing)

1213
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,440
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.

1214
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,520
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1215
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,920
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1216
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,040
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.

1217
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,800
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,

1218
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,080
but under the hood
you and I are the same.

1219
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,080
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.

1220
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,120
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

1221
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,480
You think I quit?

1222
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,840
(Lightning) Right.

1223
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,760
Your big wreck in '54.

1224
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,000
They quit on me.

1225
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,840
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

1226
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,600
You know what they said?
"You're history."

1227
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,000
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

1228
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,840
There was a lot left in me.

1229
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,600
I never got a chance to show 'em.

1230
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,360
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

1231
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,440
I just never expected that
that world would...

1232
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,680
...would find me here.

1233
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,160
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?

1234
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,480
No, I'm not.

1235
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,640
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?

1236
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:41,080
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

1237
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,840
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1238
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,480
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.

1239
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,880
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.

1240
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,280
Like you?
You've been here how long

1241
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,760
and your friends
don't even know who you are?

1242
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,520
Who's caring about only himself?

1243
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,360
Just finish that road
and get outta here!

1244
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,200

1253
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,800
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.

1254
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,160
Good riddance.

1255
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,480
He's gone?

1256
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,600
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

- No! I'm happy!

every second of the day anymore!

You're gonna miss your race.

Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.

Yeah, does anybody know

01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,560
(Flo laughs and shrieks)

1327
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,520
Just like in its heyday, right?

1328
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,320
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1329
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,000
(chuckling)

1330
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,040
Shall we cruise?

1331
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,200
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1332
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,760
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1333
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:27,200
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1334
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,120
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1335
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,560
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1336
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,920
(mooing)

1337
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,400
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1338
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,840
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1339
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,600
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1340
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,800
- Oh!
- (Mater chuckling)

1341
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,920
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1342
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,360
Good evenin', you two.

1343
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:14,040
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1344
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,960
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1345
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:27,720
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1346
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,360
Not that. That.

1347
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,840
(Sally gasps) Customers?

1348
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,160
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1349
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,640
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1350
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,840
(all gasp)

1351
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,560
It's the ghostlight!

1352
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:45,000
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1353
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,400
McQueen, over here!

1354
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,240
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1355
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,560
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1356
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,680
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tyres balding?

1357
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,600
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1358
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,200
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1359
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,480
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1360
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,160
Sally! Sally!

1361
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,280
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1362
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,080
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1363
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,600
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- (horn honking)

1364
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:16,120
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1365
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,600
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1366
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,280
(chuckling) You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1367
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,120
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1368
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,240
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1369
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,160
<i>(Harv) Is that the world's</i>
<i>fastest racing machine?</i>

1370
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,520
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1371
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,800
Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1372
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,360
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1373
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,760
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1374
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,920
- Harv?
- Come on!

1375
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,440
-<i> Kid, I'm over here!</i>
- How you doin', buddy?

1376
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,320
<i>My star client disappears</i>
<i>off the face of the earth!</i>

1377
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,800
-<i> How do you think I'm doing?</i>
- I can explain.

1378
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,680
<i>I'm doing great! You're everywhere!</i>
<i>Radio, TV, the papers!</i>

1379
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,040
<i>You can't buy this kind of publicity!</i>
<i>What do you need me for?</i>

1380
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,560
<i>A figure of speech.</i>
<i>You signed a contract.</i>

1381
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,760
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I can't find you on my GPS.</i>

1382
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,600
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1383
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,720
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
-<i> That's great, kid.</i>

1384
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,280
<i>Playtime is over, pal.</i>

1385
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:17,120
<i>While the world's been trying to</i>
<i>find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.</i>

1386
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,080
-<i> Who are they gonna woo?</i>
- Chick!

1387
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,480
<i>Bingo. In fact, check out</i>
<i>what's on the plasma right now.</i>

1388
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,680
<i>- Show us the thunder!</i>
<i>- You want thunder?</i>

1389
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,400
<i>You want thunder?</i>
<i>Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!</i>

1390
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,760
- Hey, that's my bit!
<i>- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1391
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,840
<i>Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,</i>
<i>or Dinoco is history, you hear me?</i>

1392
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,800
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1393
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,640
<i>No, wait. Where are you goin'?</i>

1394
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,840
<i>Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!</i>
<i>You want a bigger trailer?</i>

1395
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,360
Sally, I... I want you to...

1396
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,480
Look, I wish... (sighs)

1397
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,800
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1398
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,920
(groans, chuckles)

1399
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:05,240
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1400
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,440
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1401
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,040
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1402
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,680
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1403
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,000
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1404
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,480
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1405
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,520
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1406
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,800
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1407
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,280
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1408
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,800
<i>- Come on, get in the trailer.</i>
<i>-</i> Where's the old McQueen?

1409
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,560
- The bolt!
-<i> That's it. That's right, let's go!</i>

1410
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,240
<i>You're a big shining star.</i>
<i>You're a superstar.</i>

1411
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,160
<i>You don't belong there, anyway.</i>

1412
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,640
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1413
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,000
(engine starts)

1414
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,320
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1415
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,800
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1416
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,280
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1417
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,720
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1418
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,280
Best for everyone or best for you?

1419
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,920
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1420
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,880
(light buzzing)

1421
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,440
(Bob) Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1422
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,840
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1423
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,040
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1424
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,720
(Darrell) There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1425
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,440
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1426
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,600
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1427
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,320
(Bob) The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1428
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,520
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1429
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,120
(Darrell) I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1430
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,080
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1431
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,680
(Bob) In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1432
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,640
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1433
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,360
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1434
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:28,520
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1435
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,720
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1436
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,040
You wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1437
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,880
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1438
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,280
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1439
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,280
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1440
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,120
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1441
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,320
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1442
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,360
- Absolutely, Mr Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1443
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,320
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1444
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,840
(guard) Sorry, pal.

1445
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,320
(Lightning) OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1446
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,600
I am speed.

1447
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,280
(cars whizzing)

1448
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,640
Victory.

1449
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,720
One winner, two losers.

1450
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,760
(engine revving)

1451
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:21,360
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1452
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,040
(birds singing)

1453
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,400
(knock on door)
(Mack) Lightnin'! You ready?

1454
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,920
(gasping) Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1455
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,840
(indistinct chatter)

1456
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,120
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1457
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,000
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1458
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,240
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1459
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,680
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1460
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,040
(all shouting)

1461
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,880
(gulping)

1462
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,360
Uh-oh

1463
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,960
- (cheering, laughing)
- (giggling)

1464
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,320
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1465
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,600
(Bob) And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1466
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,960
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1467
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,280
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1468
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,480
(Darrell) Wearin' whitewall tyres,
of all things.

1469
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,560
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1470
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,920
(chuckling)

1471
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,120
Where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1472
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,200
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1473
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,360
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1474
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,640
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1475
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,520
Agh! Shoot!

1476
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,920
(Darrell) Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1477
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,880
(crowd cheering)

1478
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,520
Come on, you can do it!

1479
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,640
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1480
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,040
(Bob) Fifty laps down. The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1481
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:26,360
(Darrell) McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1482
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,600
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1483
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,160
(Bob) Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1484
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,920
(Darrell) He lost momentum,

1485
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,680
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1486
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,480
- (soft music)
- (birds singing)

1487
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,680
(breaks squealing)

1488
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,800
(Bob) McQueen spins out!

1489
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,560
(all gasp)

1490
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,400
(chuckling) Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1491
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,000
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- (all laugh)

1492
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,240
(groans)

1493
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:03,240
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1494
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,840
I don't think I...

1495
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,680
(Doc) I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1496
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,320
Doc?

1497
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,640
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1498
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,480
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1499
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,440
You said you'd never come back.

1500
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,200
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1501
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,000
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1502
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,960
(chuckles)

1503
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,520
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1504
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,840
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1505
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
Now, get back out there!

1506
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,160
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1507
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,920
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1508
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,280
- You'll have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1509
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,120
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1510
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,000
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1511
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,640
(murmuring)

1512
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,600
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1513
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,440
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1514
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,360
(Bob) It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1515
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,600
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1516
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,360
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1517
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,800
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1518
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,360
(crowd cheering)

1519
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,400
<i>(Bob) This is history in the making.</i>

1520
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,400
<i>Nobody has seen the racing legend</i>
<i>in over 50 years!</i>

1521
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:35,960
Hey, Doc!

1522
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:40,360
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1523
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:48,800
- (Bob) McQueen passes on the inside!
- (Darrell) He's nearly a lap down.

1524
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,800
(Bob) Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1525
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,760
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1526
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,440
<i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>

1527
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,400
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1528
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,760
Those round things are called tyres,
and they go under the car!

1529
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,000
(all laugh)

1530
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,800
<i>Con chi credi di parlare?</i>
<i>Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>

1531
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,960
No! No! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1532
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,160
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1533
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,120
What do you think of this?

1534
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,280
- (tyres squealing)
- That's it, kid.

1535
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,840
What?

1536
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,720
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1537
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:44,760
- (laughing) I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1538
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,000
(Bob) What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1539
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,680
This is what it's all about.

1540
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,960
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1541
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,800
(chortling)
Look at that boy go out there!

1542
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,760
(Chick) Oh! (grunting)

1543
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,560
No, you don't.

1544
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,280
(tyre blows)

1545
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,360
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1546
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,840
- Can you get back to the pits?
<i>-</i> Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1547
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,240
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1548
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,280
(Mack) We gotta get him
back out there fast

1549
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:29,280
or we'll be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1550
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,520
Guido! It's time.

1551
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,920
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1552
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,040
(air wrench whirring)

1553
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,800
- (Darrell) I don't believe it!
- (Bob) Fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1554
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,360
(Darrell) He's still gotta
beat that pace car!

1555
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,080
(Bob) It's gonna be close.

1556
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,760
- Yeah, baby!
- (all hollering)

1557
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,200
<i>(Darrell) He's back in!</i>

1558
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,520
Peet stop.

1559
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,880
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go!

1560
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,200
(Bob) This is it. We heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1561
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,680
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1562
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,360
(Darrell) A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1563
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:32,640
This is it, kiddo.

1564
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:35,160
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1565
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,760
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1566
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,600
- Go!
- (revving)

1567
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:46,120
- We'll see about that!
- (Bob) McQueen's going inside!

1568
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:53,360
- Chick and King are loose!
- (Darrell) I think McQueen's out!

1569
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,600
- McQueen saved it!
- (Bob) He's back on the track!

1570
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:08,320
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1571
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,000
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- (all cheer)

1572
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,600
(Darrell) Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1573
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,800
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1574
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,040
(grunts) I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1575
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,960
- Oh, no!
- (crowd gasps)

1576
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,760
(breaks screeching)

1577
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:52,480
(engine idling)

1578
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,000
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1579
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,040
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1580
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,040
(Flo) What's he up to, Doc?

1581
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,560
(grunting, moaning)

1582
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,280
What are you doin', kid?

1583
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,040
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1584
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,480
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1585
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,160
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1586
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,680
It's just an empty cup.

1587
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,720
(Bob) Is pushing on the last lap legal?

1588
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,680
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draught.

1589
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,040
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1590
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,840
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1591
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,200
- That's what I call racin'.
- (sobbing)

1592
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,680
(laughing)

1593
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,680
(crowd cheers wildly)

1594
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:07,200
<i>- Bravo il mio amico!</i>
<i>-</i> Way to go, buddy!

1595
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,880
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1596
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,560
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1597
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,920
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1598
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,400
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1599
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,440
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1600
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,600
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1601
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,200
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1602
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:33,600
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1603
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,040
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1604
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,520
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1605
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,200
- Boo!
- Boo!

1606
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,360
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1607
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,040
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1608
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,000
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1609
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,760
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1610
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:01,280
You're The King! Yeah!

1611
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,640
(crowd cheers)

1612
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,200
(laughing and cheering)

1613
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,760
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1614
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,520
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1615
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,480
Thanks, Doc.

1616
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,960
Hey, Lightnin'.

1617
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,760
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1618
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,600
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1619
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:34,680
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1620
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:40,600
But I didn't win.

1621
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,200
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1622
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,200
(Clank) He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1623
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:51,360
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- (all laugh)

1624
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,160
Thank you, Mr Tex, but...

1625
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,960
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1626
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,240
I'm gonna stick with them.

1627
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,360
Well, I sure can respect that.

1628
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,800
Still, you know,

1629
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:08,520
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1630
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,160
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1631
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:16,240
Actually, there is one thing.

1632
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,560
Whoo-hoo!

1633
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,480
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1634
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,960
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!

1635
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,920
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1636
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:42,520
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1637
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,840
to get tyres.

1638
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,840
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1639
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:53,120
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1640
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,480
A real Ferrari!

1641
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,720
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1642
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,240
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1643
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,040
Wow.<i> (Italian)</i>

Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1650
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:36,080
There's some rumour floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1651

is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1654
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,040
Well, I create feelings in others

So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1662
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,080
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1663
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,800
Hmm... Nah.

Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1674
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:54,560
Sorry, Mrs The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.
