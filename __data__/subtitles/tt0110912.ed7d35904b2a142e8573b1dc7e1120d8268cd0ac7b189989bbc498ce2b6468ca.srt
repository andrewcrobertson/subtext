1
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,633
No, it's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit,

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,754
You always say that: `'I'm through,
never again, too dangerous,.,"

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,919
- I'm always right too.
- But you forget about it in a day,

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,194
- The days of me remembering have
just begun, - You sound Iike.,,

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,314
- I sound like a sensible man. - No,
you sound like a duck. Quack, quack!

6
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,434
You`II never have to hear it again,
because l`ll never `'quack'` again!

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,236
- After tonight? - Correct,
l`ll have all tonight to "quack`'!

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,148
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Yes.

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,194
- Thank you,
- You're welcome.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,633
The way it is now l`m taking
the same risk as robbing a bank.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,834
I'm talking more of a risk, federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you.

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,158
They're insured. What do they care?
You don't even need a gun there,

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,477
This one bloke walks into the bank
with a portable phone,..

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,593
,.he gives the phone to the teller,
the bloke on the other end says,..

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,759
.,"Give this guy all your money
or we'Il kill his girl,", - Well?

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,274
It worked. The guy walked in with
a fucking phone, not a pistol!

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,996
- He cleaned the place out and they
didn`t do anything, - And the girl?

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,434
There probably never was a girl.
They robbed a bank with a telephone,

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,759
- You want to rob a bank? - It would
be easier than whatwe've been doing.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,839
- No more liquor stores?
- No!

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,953
There are too many foreigners now:
Vietnameses, Koreans,.,

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,870
If you say to empty the register,
they don't know what you're saying!

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,313
- These fuckers will make us kill
them. - I don`t want to. - Me either,

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,432
But we`II be in a situation
where it's either us or them,

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,714
It's them or these fucking Jews who
have owned the store 15 generations.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,150
You've got Grandpa lrving sitting
behind the counter with a Magnum!

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,478
Walk into one of those places with
a phone and see how far you get!

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,752
- Do you want a day job?
- Not in this Iife. - What then?

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,871
"Garçon'`, coffee!

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,111
This place,

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,272
"Garçon'` means `'boy".

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,312
This place?
A coffee shop?

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,829
What's wrong with that?

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,748
Nobody ever robs restaurants,
Why not?

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,233
Bars, Iiquor stores, gas stations,
you get your head blown off.,,

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,749
,.sticking up one of them!

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,670
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down,

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,793
They're not expecting to get robbed,
at least not as expecting,

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,119
- There's Iess of a hero factor here.
- They`re insured, just Iike banks,

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,439
The manager just wants to get you out
the door before you plug the diners,

41
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,155
The waitresses will never take
a bullet to save the register,

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,670
Some busboy getting paid
$ 1,50 an hour,.,

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,395
,.doesn't give a fuck
if you're stealing from the owner!

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,512
The customers don`t know
what`s going on,

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,633
One minute they're eating, then
there's a gun stuck in their face,

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,029
- Remember the last Iiquor store?
The customers came in. - Yes.

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,029
- You took their wallets,
that was a good idea. - Thank you.

48
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,152
We made more money from the wallets
than we did from the register.

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,910
- Lots of people come to restaurants,
- Lots of wallets! - Pretty smart.

50
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,354
Pretty smart!

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,114
- l`m ready, Let's do it right now,
right here. - All right.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,438
Same as Iast time, you're crowd
control, I handle employees,

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,873
- I Iove you, pumpkin,
- I Iove you, honey bunny.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,314
- Keep cool, this is a robbery!
- If any of you pricks move.,,

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,035
..I`ll execute every
motherfucking Iast one ofyou!

56
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,553
- Tell me again about the hash bar.
- What do you want to know?

57
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,438
- Is hash Iegal now? - Yes, but you
can't smoke a joint in a restaurant,

58
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,953
- You can smoke home or in designated
places, - A hash bar, - Yeah,

59
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,072
It's Iegal to buy it,
it's Iegal to own it.,.

60
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,192
,.and if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's Iegal to sell it.

61
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,313
It's illegal to carry it,
but that doesn't matter.,.

62
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,831
,.because if you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, they can`t search you.

63
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,557
- That's a right the cops don't have.
- Man, I'm fucking going!

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,879
You'd dig it the most. You know what
the funniest thing about Europe is?

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,992
- What?
- It's the little differences.

66
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,910
- They've got the same shitwe have,
but it's a Iittle different. - How?

67
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,033
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

68
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,152
I don`t mean a paper cup,
I mean a glass of beer,

69
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,272
In Paris you can buy a beer
in McDonald's,

70
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,872
- You know whatthey call a '`Quarter
Pounder with Cheese" in Paris? - No.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,630
- They've got the metric system, they
don't know what a pound is, - So?

72
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,753
- They call it "Royal with Cheese",
- Royal with Cheese!

73
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,078
- What do they call a "Big Mac'`?
- "Le Big Mac'`.

74
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,988
Le Big Mac!
What do they call a "Whopper"?

75
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,112
I don't know,
I didn't go to Burger King.

76
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,837
- In Holland they put mayonnaise
on French fries, - Yuck!

77
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,672
I saw them do it, man! Theyfucking
drown them in that shit!

78
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,593
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal,

79
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,232
- How many up there?
- Three or four,

80
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,557
- Counting our guy?
- l`m not sure.

81
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,673
- That means there could be
up to five guys. - It's possible,

82
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,633
We should have shotguns.

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,753
- What`s her name? - Mia,
- How did Marsellus and her meet?

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,872
I don't know,
however people meet people,

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,994
- She used to be an actress.
- Did she do anything I've seen?

86
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,317
- She starred in a pilot,
- What's a pilot?

87
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,637
- You know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

88
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,756
- But you're aware of the television,
that they show shows on it. - Yeah!

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,670
The way they pick TV shows is they
make one show that's called a pilot.

90
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,794
They show it to people who pick shows
and decide if they want to make more,

91
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,914
Some get chosen and become television
programs and others become nothing.

92
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,793
She starred in one
that became nothing,

93
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,913
Do you remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half black and half Samoan.

94
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,033
- They called him "Tony Rocky
Horror", - The fat one.

95
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,756
I wouldn't say fat, He's got a weight
problem, poor nigger, he`s Samoan,

96
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,873
- I think I know him.
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,994
The word is that it was on the count
of Marsellus Wallace`s wife,

98
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,313
- What'd he do, fuck her?
- No, nothing that bad.

99
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,434
- Well, what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

100
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,118
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Yeah,

101
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,233
- Then what'd Marsellus do?
- He sent a couple cats to his place,

102
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,354
They threw his ass over the balcony,
the nigger fell four stories.

103
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,473
He had a Iittle garden at the bottom
enclosed in glass Iike a greenhouse.

104
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,596
The nigger fell through it and then
he developed a speech impediment,

105
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,434
What a damn shame!

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,191
- If you play with matches,
you get burned. - What do you mean?

107
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,313
You don't give Marsellus
Wallace's wife a foot massage,

108
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,434
- Didn't he overreact? - Antwan
probably didn't expect that reaction,

109
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,554
- But he had to expect some reaction.
- It was only a foot massage,

110
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,673
It's laying your hands in a familiar
way on Marsellus` new wife.

111
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,191
It's not as bad as eating her pussy
out, but it`s the same ball park,

112
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,711
Eating the bitch out and giving her
a foot massage isn't the same thing.

113
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,833
- But it's the same ball park,
- It ain`t no fucking ball park!

114
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,796
Touching his wife's feet and sticking
his tongue in the holiest of holes,..

115
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,516
..ain't the same fucking ball park,
it ain't even the same sport!

116
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,031
- Foot massages don't mean shit.
- Have you ever done a foot massage?

117
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,550
I`m the foot fucking master!

118
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,674
- Have you done it a lot? - l`ve
got my technique down, no tickling,

119
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,997
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

120
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,671
Fuck you!

121
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,312
- Do you give them a Iot?
- Fuck you!

122
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,433
- I'm tired, I could use a foot
massage myself! - Back off.

123
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,552
I`m getting a little pissed here!

124
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,872
- This is the door.
- Here it is.

125
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,113
-What time have you got?
- 7:22 a,m,

126
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,515
It ain`t quite time yet,
let's hang back.

127
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,516
It's not right for Marsellus
to throw Antwan into a glass house..,

128
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,632
,,fucking up the way
the nigger talks,

129
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,958
If the motherfucker did that to me,
I'd kill him.

130
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,676
I ain't saying it's right,
but a foot massage means something,

131
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,191
I've given a million foot massages
and they all meant something.

132
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,314
We act like they don't, but they do,
That's what's so cool about them.

133
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,035
You don't talk about it,
but you know and she knows.

134
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,756
Fucking Marsellus knew it
and Antwan should have known better.

135
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,271
That's his wife, no man has
a sense of humor about this shit,

136
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,996
- You know what I'm saying?
- It`s an interesting point.

137
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,112
Come on, Iet's get into character.

138
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,714
- What's her name? - Mia, Why are
you so interested in his wife?

139
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,436
He's going to Florida and he asked me
to take care of her while he`s gone.

140
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,874
- Take care of her? - No, just take
her out, make sure she's not Ionely.

141
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,474
- You're going to take Mia Wallace
out on a date? - It is not a date.

142
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,991
It's like if you were going to take
your buddy's wife to a movie,

143
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,112
It`s just good company, that's all,

144
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,556
It's not a date,

145
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,997
Hey, kids. How are you boys doing?

146
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,518
Hey, keep chilling.

147
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,109
We`re associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace,

148
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,233
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

149
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,915
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

150
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,353
- You're Brett, right? -Yeah,
- I thought so,

151
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,474
You remember your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, don't you?

152
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,717
- Yes, I remember.
- Good,

153
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,756
Looks Iike me and Vincent caught you
at breakfast. What are you having?

154
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,396
- Hamburgers. - The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast!

155
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,679
- What kind of hamburgers?
- Cheeseburgers,

156
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,477
- No, where did you get them, Wendys,
McDonald's? - Big Kahuna Burger.

157
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,592
Oh, that`s the Hawaiian
burger joint!

158
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,395
I ain't never had one myself,
how are they?

159
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,513
- They're good,
- Do you mind if I try one of yours?

160
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,355
- This is yours, right?
- Yeah,

161
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,797
This is a tasty burger,
Vincent!

162
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,117
- Have you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger? - No.

163
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,997
- Want a bite? They`re real tasty,
- I ain't hungry. - Give them a try.

164
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,150
I can't get them because
my girlfriend is a vegetarian,

165
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,479
That makes me a vegetarian too, but
I do Iove the taste of a good burger.

166
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,074
Do you know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with cheese in France?

167
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,431
- No, - Tell him, Vincent,
- Royal with Cheese.

168
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,597
Do you know why they call it that?

169
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,632
- Because of the metric system,
- Our Brett has a big brain!

170
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,754
You're a smart motherfucker!
Right, the metric system.

171
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,438
- What's in this?
- Sprite. - Good.

172
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,556
- Can I have some of your beverage
to wash this down? - Go right ahead.

173
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,198
That hit the spot!

174
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,029
Do you know whywe're here? Tell
my friend where you hid the shit,

175
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,631
- It`s over there. - I don't remember
asking you a Goddamn thing!

176
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,952
- You were saying?
- It's in the cupboard,

177
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,193
No, the one byyour knees,

178
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,757
Are we happy, Vincent?

179
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,275
- Are we happy?
-Yeah, we're happy.

180
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,308
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

181
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,716
Yours is Vincent, right?
But I never gotyours,

182
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,437
- It's Pip and your ass ain't talking
your way out of this shit! - No.

183
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,192
I just want you to know.,.

184
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,154
We`re really sorrythat things got
so fucked up with us and Mr. Wallace,

185
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,274
We got into this thing
with the best intentions.

186
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,199
I'm sorry, did I break your
concentration? I didn't mean to,

187
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,190
Continue, you were saying something
about best intentions,

188
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,313
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

189
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,433
Well, allow me to retort,

190
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,710
- What does Marsellus Wallace
Iook like? - What?

191
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,348
- What country're you from? - What?
- Do they speak English in "What`'?

192
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,471
- What?
- Do you speak English? - Yes.

193
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,469
- Then you know what I'm saying!
- Yes. - Describe Marsellus Wallace.

194
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,832
- What?
- Say "what" one more time!

195
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,829
I dare you, say '`what"
one more Goddamn time!

196
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,077
- He's black,
- Go on! - He's bald,

197
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,352
- Does he look Iike a bitch?
- What?

198
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,792
- Does he look Iike a bitch?
- No!

199
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,040
- Then why are you trying to fuck him
Iike a bitch? - I didn't! - Yes!

200
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,152
- You tried to fuck him!
- No!

201
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,400
Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by nobody except Mrs. Wallace.

202
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,308
- Do you read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes.

203
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,637
I've got this passage memorized,
it fits the occasion,

204
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,038
Ezekiel: 25-17.
"The path of the righteous man,,."

205
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,870
",.is beset on all sides by
the inequities of the selfish.,.'`

206
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,992
`'..and the tyranny of evil men."

207
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,796
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will.,,"

208
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,117
'`.,shepherds the weak
through the Valley of Darkness,`'

209
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,997
'`For he is truly his brother`s keeper
and the finder of Iost children."

210
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,113
"l will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance,.."

211
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,074
".,and furious anger
those who attempt to destroy.,."

212
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,191
'`.,my brothers,`'

213
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,915
"And you will know my name
is the Lord.,,'`

214
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,589
'`..when I lay my vengeance
upon thee!"

215
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,795
When all this shit
is over and done,.,

216
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,913
,.I think you're going to find
yourself one smiling motherfucker.

217
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,956
The thing is that right now
you've got ability,

218
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,673
But, painful as it may be,
ability doesn`t last,

219
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,792
Your days are just about over.

220
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,913
That's a hard
motherfucking fact of life,

221
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,319
But it's a fact your ass is going
to have to get realistic about.

222
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,314
This business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers,.,

223
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,991
,.motherfuckers who thought their ass
would age like wine,

224
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,150
If you mean itturns to vinegar,
it does,

225
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,876
If you mean it gets better with age,
it doesn`t,

226
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,154
Besides, how many fights do you think
you've got in you anyway?

227
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,311
Two?

228
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,593
There are no fights for old boxers.

229
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,508
You came close,
but you never made it.

230
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,428
If you were going to make it,
you would've made it before now.

231
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,238
Are you my man?

232
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,032
It certainly appears so,

233
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,674
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting,

234
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,914
That's pride fucking with you.

235
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,032
Fuck pride!

236
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,636
Pride only hurts,
it never helps.

237
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,998
Fight through that shit!

238
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,310
Because a year from now, when you're
kicking it in the Caribbean,,.

239
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,877
.,you'Il say to yourself:
"Marsellus Wallace was right".

240
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,388
I`ve got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace,

241
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,676
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

242
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,511
Say it,

243
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,875
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

244
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,112
Oh, Vincent Vega,
our man in Amsterdam,..

245
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,233
..and Jules Winnfield, our man in
Englewood. Get your asses down here,

246
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,273
- What's up with those clothes?
- You don't want to know.

247
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,113
- Where's the big man? - He's over
there taking care of some business.

248
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,837
Hang back for a second. When you see
the white boy Ieave, go on over.

249
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,351
- How have you been? - Pretty good,
How about yourself? - All right.

250
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,757
I hear you`re taking
Mia out tomorrow.

251
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,950
At Marsellus' request.

252
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,552
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet,

253
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,238
- What's so fucking funny?
- Nothing. - I've got to pee,

254
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,954
I`m not a fucking idiot.

255
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,471
She's the big man's wife. I'Il sit
across from her, chew my food..,

256
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,957
,.and Iaugh at her jokes! - My name
is Paul, this is between you all!

257
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,675
Then what did you fucking ask me
about itfor?

258
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,153
- A pack of '`Red Apples`'.
- Filters? - No.

259
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,074
-What are you Iooking at, friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka,

260
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,793
- What was that? - You heard me
just fine, punchy!

261
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,789
Vincent Vega is in the house?
My man!

262
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,716
Here's your pack of Red Apples,
$ 1,40,

263
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,398
And some matches.

264
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,198
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

265
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,313
- Wow! - I'Il lend it to you,
it's a great book on piercing.

266
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,592
Do they use a gun to pierce your
nipples like they do your ears?

267
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,349
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

268
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,190
All my piercing, 18 places on my
body, have been done with a needle.

269
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,517
Five in each ear,
one through my Ieft nipple.,,

270
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,598
,.two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow.,.

271
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,712
.,one in my belly, one in my Iip,
one in my clit.

272
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,437
- And I wear a stud in my tongue,
- Excuse me, I'm just curious.

273
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,279
- Why would you wear a stud
in your tongue? - It's a sex thing.

274
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,392
- It helps fellatio,
- Vincenzo.

275
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,392
Step in my office,

276
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,714
Let's go, This is `'Panda'`
from Mexico, very good stuff,

277
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,594
That's "Bava`'.
Different, but equally good,

278
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,712
That is "Choco`'
from the mountains of Germany.

279
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,118
The first two are 300 a gram,
Those are friendly prices.

280
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,075
But this one is a Iittle
more expensive. This is 500 a gram,

281
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,192
When you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went,

282
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,313
There's nothing wrong with these,
This is real good shit,

283
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,515
- But this one is a fucking madman!
- I just got back from Amsterdam.

284
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,918
Am I a nigger? Are we in Englewood?
No, you're in my home,

285
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,636
White people who know the difference
between good and bad shit come here.

286
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,752
My shit can challenge
that Amsterdam shit..,

287
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,668
,,any old day of the week.
- That's a bold statement.

288
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,190
This ain`t Amsterdam,
this is a sellers` market.

289
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,551
Coke is fucking dead,

290
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,953
- Heroine is coming back
in a big fucking way. - All right.

291
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,952
Give me three grams of the madman.

292
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,277
If it's as good as you say,
I'll come back and buy another 1000,

293
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,393
I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

294
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,470
I'm giving you some out of my private
stash to show you how nice I am.

295
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,277
- I'm out of balloons, is a baggy
all right? - Yes, - AIl right,

296
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,396
- Honey, will you get me some baggies
and twisties from the kitchen? - OK,

297
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,553
Trudi ain`t got a boyfriend.
Want to hang out and get high?

298
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,672
Is Trudi the one
with all the shit in her face?

299
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,395
No, that's Jody, my wife.

300
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,032
- l`m sorry, man.
- That's all right.

301
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,756
- No, I can't. I've got to be
some place, - AII right,

302
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,592
Thank you!

303
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,991
- Have you still got your Malibu?
- You know what some fucker did?

304
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,353
-What? - He fucking keyed it,
- That's fucked up!

305
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,472
I had it in storage for three years.

306
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,229
I had it out for five days and
some piece of shit fucked with it,

307
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,558
They should be killed, No trial,
no jury, straight to execution.

308
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,151
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

309
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,751
- It would've been worth him doing it
so I could've caught him. - Fucker!

310
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,078
Only a chicken-shit
fucks with a man's automobile.

311
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,192
- You don't do it,
- It's against the rules.

312
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,108
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- Do you mind if I shoot up here?

313
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,233
- My house is your house,
- Thanks a lot.

314
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,428
"Hi, Vincent, l`m getting dressed,
The door is opened,`'

315
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,552
"Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.'`

316
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,991
Hello?

317
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,512
Vincent.

318
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:11,109
- Vincent, I'm on the intercom.
- Where is the intercom?

319
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,711
It's on the wall,
by the two African fellows,

320
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,434
To your right.

321
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,511
Warm!

322
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,911
Warmer!

323
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,032
- Disco.
- Hello.

324
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,754
- Push the button
if you want to talk. - Hello.

325
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,475
Make yourself a drink,
I'll be down in two shakes,

326
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,592
The bar is by the fireplace.

327
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,431
Okay.

328
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,312
Let's go.

329
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,675
What the fuck is this place?

330
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,794
This is "Jackrabbit SIim's",
An "EIvis man" should Iove it,

331
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,311
- Mia, let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here,

332
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,431
Don't be a,.,

333
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,438
After you, kitty cat,

334
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,508
Good evening, how can I help you?

335
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,633
- There's a reservation
under Wallace, - Wallace?

336
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,230
- We reserved a car,
- Oh, a car!

337
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,796
Seat them over there in the Chrysler,

338
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,631
Hello,

339
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,474
Let`s hear it for Ricky Nelson!
Fantastic job, thank you very much.

340
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,033
Vincent!

341
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,474
Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show,

342
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,833
We hope you enjoy your meal
here at Jackrabbit SIim's,

343
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,830
Call for Philip Morris!

344
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,272
- What do you think? - It's Iike
a wax museum with a pulse!

345
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,392
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?

346
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,631
Steak, steak?
Yes, `'Douglas Sirk Steak",

347
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,753
- I'Il have that. - Burned to a crisp
or bloody as hell?

348
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,873
BIoody as hell, l`ll also have
a "Vanilla Coke".

349
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,110
What about you, Peggy Sue?

350
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,472
I'II have
the `'Durward Kirby Burger",

351
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,798
Bloody,

352
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,559
- And a 5 dollar shake, - Which one?
- A '`Martin and Lewis",

353
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,313
- Did you just order
a 5 dollar shake? - Yes.

354
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,433
- A shake is milk and ice cream?
- The Iast I heard,

355
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,678
- That's 5 dollars? You don't put
bourbon in it or nothing? - No,

356
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,793
- Just checking. - I'Il be right back
with your drinks.

357
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,873
Could you roll me
one of those, cowboy?

358
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,033
- You can have this one, cowgirl!
- Thanks,

359
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,111
Think nothing of it,

360
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,393
Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

361
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,913
- I sure did. - How long were you
there? - Just over three years.

362
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,714
- I go there once a year to chill out
for a month. - I didn`t know that.

363
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,878
Why would you?

364
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,199
- I heard you did a pilot.
- That was my 15 minutes,

365
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,518
- What was it? - It was a show about
a team of female secret agents.

366
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,871
- It was called "Fox Force Five".
- What?

367
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,197
"Fox Force Five". `'Fox" as in
we're a bunch of foxy chicks.

368
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,517
'`Force'` as in we're forced
to be reckoned with,

369
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,033
'`Five" as in there were five of us,
The blonde was the leader,

370
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,152
The Japanese was a kung fu master.

371
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,750
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

372
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,872
The French fox's specialty was sex,

373
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,073
- What was your specialty?
- Knives.

374
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,911
My character grew up
raised by circus performers,

375
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,239
She was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

376
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,753
She knew a zillion jokes,
her grandfather taught her,

377
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,077
If we would have gotten picked up,..

378
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,795
.,in every show
I would have told another joke,

379
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,117
- Do you know a lot of jokes?
- I only got the chance to say one.

380
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,391
- We only did one show.
- Tell me,

381
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,308
- It`s corny.
- Don't be that way, tell me.

382
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,315
No, you wouldn't Iike it.
I'd be embarrassed,

383
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,149
You've already told
50 million people.

384
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,955
- I promise I won't laugh,
- That's what I'm afraid of,

385
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,598
- That's notwhat I meant. - I'm not
telling you, we built it up too much,

386
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,109
What a gyp!

387
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,998
"Martin and Lewis".

388
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,758
'`Vanilla Coke",

389
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,072
- Yummy.
- Can I have a sip?

390
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,634
Be my guest.

391
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,596
- I have to taste a 5 dollar shake!
- Use my straw, I don't have cooties,

392
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,714
- Maybe I do.
- I can handle cooties, - AII right,

393
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,713
- This is a fucking good milkshake.
- I told you,

394
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,435
I don't know if it`s worth 5 dollars,
but it's good.

395
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,076
- Don'tyou hate that?
- Hate what?

396
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,239
Uncomfortable silences,

397
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,559
Why do we feel it's necessary to yack
about bullshit to be comfortable?

398
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,836
- I don't know, it's a good question.
-You know you`ve found someone,..

399
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,670
,.special when you can shut the fuck
up and comfortably share silence!

400
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,794
I don't think we're quite there yet,
we just met each other,

401
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,718
I'Il tell you what.

402
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,395
I'll go powder my nose and you sit
here and think of something to say,

403
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,431
I'Il do that!

404
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,949
Okay.

405
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,952
I said, Goddamn!

406
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,992
Goddamn!

407
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,556
- I love finding my food waiting.
- We're lucky we got anything at all.

408
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,150
I don't think Buddy Holly
is much of a waiter,

409
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,272
We should have sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section,

410
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,554
- Which one? There are two, - No,
there are not. That's Marilyn Monroe,

411
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,115
That's Mamie Van Doren,

412
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,429
- I don't see Jayne Mansfield, she
must be off, - Smart. - At times!

413
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,553
- Did you think of something to say?
- Actually, I did.

414
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,111
However.,,

415
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,554
- You seem Iike a nice person and
I don't want to offend you, - Ohh!

416
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,470
This doesn't sound like the usual
boring getting to know you chitchat.

417
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,390
- It sounds Iike you actually
have something to say, - I do.

418
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,230
But you have to promise
notto get offended,

419
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,558
No, I can`t promise something like
that, I don`t know what you'Il ask,.,

420
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,071
,.and my natural response could be
to get offended, then through,,.

421
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,069
,.no fault of my own, I would have
broken the promise. - Forget it!

422
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,034
That's impossible,
this is far too intriguing,

423
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,757
- Is that so? - It's more exciting
that you don't have permission.

424
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,668
All right.
Here it goes.

425
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,792
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

426
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,196
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror,

427
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,314
- He fell out of a window,
- That is one way to say it!

428
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,432
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

429
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,553
Another way would be is that
he was thrown out by Marsellus,..

430
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,036
,,or that he was thrown out
of a window because of you,

431
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,518
- Is that a fact?
- No, it's just what I heard.

432
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,760
- Who told you? - They.
- They talk a Iot, don't they?

433
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,439
They certainly do!

434
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,793
- Don't be shy, what else
did they say? - l`m not shy.

435
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,912
- Did it involve the "F'` word?
- No,

436
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,716
- They said that Antwan had given you
a foot massage. - And?

437
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,638
And nothing, that's it.

438
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,278
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky
Horror out of a window.,.

439
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,474
,,for giving me a foot massage?
-Yes, - And you believe that?

440
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,516
- It sounded reasonable. - Marsellus
throwing Tony out of a window..,

441
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,632
.,for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

442
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,630
No, but it could've happened,
Marsellus is very protective of you.

443
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,596
A protective husband is one thing,
a husband almost killing a man,..

444
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,350
,.for touching his wife's feet
is something else. - Did it happen?

445
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,032
The onlything Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand at my wedding.

446
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,553
- Really? - The only ones who know
why Marsellus threw Tony..,

447
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,471
..out the window are Marsellus and
Tony, You men are worse than women!

448
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,388
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.,.

449
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,196
..the world famous,
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

450
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,835
One lucky couple will win this trophy
that Marilyn is holding.

451
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,516
Who will be our first contestants?

452
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,790
Right here.

453
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,959
- I want to dance,
- No, no, no!

454
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,197
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,..

455
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,312
.,told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

456
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,433
- I want to dance, I want to win,
I want that trophy. - All right.

457
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,869
- So dance good.
- AIl right,

458
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,992
Let's hear it for our contestants,

459
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,834
Let`s meet our first contestants.
Young lady, what is your name?

460
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,349
Mrs. Mia Wallace,

461
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,473
- How about your fellow?
- Vincent Vega,

462
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,593
Let's see what you can do,
Take it away!

463
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,595
Is that what you call
"uncomfortable silence"?

464
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,712
I don`t know what you call that,

465
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,913
- Drinks, music!
- I'm going to take a piss.

466
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,914
That's a Iittle more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

467
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,879
One drink and that's it,
Don't be rude, drink your drink!

468
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,199
But do it quickly,
Say "good night`' and go home.

469
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:25,076
This is a moral test to see whether
or not you can maintain loyalty.

470
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,431
Because being loyal
is very important,

471
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,998
You're going to go out there
and say.,.

472
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,597
.,`'Good night,

- `'PIease, hurry up!"
- "Yes.'`

481
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,109
'`Hold hands, you lovebirds."

482
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,150
Lance, answer!

483
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,790
"Now what do you say?"

484
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,912
"l give up, I'Il marry you."

485
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,555
Lance, the Goddamn phone is ringing!

486
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,831
I can hear it.

487
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,158
- I thought you told those assholes
never to call here this late! - Yes.

488
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,875
And that is exactly what l`m going
to tell this asshole now!

489
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,591
- Hello? - Lance, it`s Vincent.
I'm in big trouble, I'm coming over.

490
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,599
Hold your horses, man!
What's the problem?

491
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,792
- I've gotthis chick, she's ODing.
- Don`t bring her here.

492
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,789
- Do not be bringing some fucked up
chick to my house! - No choice.

493
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,037
- She's ODing?
- She's dying on me!

494
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,030
- Then take her to a hospital
and call a lawyer. - Negative!

495
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,154
This is not my problem. You fucked
her up, you fucking deal with this,

496
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,272
Are you talking on a cellular phone?

497
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,598
I don't know you, don't come here,
Prank caller, prank caller!

498
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,393
What the hell was that?

499
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,433
Have you Iost your mind? You were
talking about drugs on the phone.,.

500
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,156
,,and now you drive into
myfucking house! - Grab her feet.

501
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,274
- Don't bring this bitch in my house,
- She's Marsellus Wallace's wife,

502
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,394
Do you know who Wallace is? If she
croaks, l`m a fucking grease spot.

503
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,514
I'll tell him that you did not help,
that you let her die on your lawn,

504
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,632
Now come on! Help me, Pick her up,

505
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,751
Shit!

506
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,151
Lance!

507
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,035
It's 1 :30 in the morning,
what the fuck is going on out here?

508
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,553
- Who's she? - Go get the thing
with the adrenaline shot,

509
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,672
- What's wrong with her? - She's
ODing. - Get her out of here!

510
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,997
- Get the fucking shot!
- Fuck you!

511
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,240
- What a bitch! - Keep talking
to her, I'll go get my medical book.

512
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,354
- What for? - I've never had
to give an adrenaline shot.

513
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,474
- I don`t "trip`' with a bunch of
bubble-gummers, - Get the shot, - OK,

514
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,593
- l`m not stopping you, - Stop
talking to me! - Get the shot!

515
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,035
- Hurry up, Lance!
- I'm Iooking as fast as I can,

516
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,152
- What's he Iooking for?
- Some book.

517
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,752
- What are you looking for?
- A little black medical book,

518
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,874
- What? - It`s like a text book
they give to nurses,

519
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,992
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me, I have one.

520
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,113
- If it's so important, keep it
with the shot. - Stop bothering me!

521
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,437
- You'll never find anything
in this mess. - Shut up!

522
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,918
- I've been telling you to clean this
room for months! - Lance, come on!

523
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,032
- Get out of my way!
- Pig!

524
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,234
- Give her the shot. - AIl right.
While I do this, find her heart.

525
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,354
- Does it have to be exact? - Of
course, it`s a shot for her heart,

526
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,075
- Where the fuck is her heart?
Here? - That's it,

527
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,193
AII right, What I need is a big
magic marker, You got it?

528
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,472
- What?
- A magic marker, a felt pen!

529
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,673
- A fucking black magic marker!
Come on, man, - Fuck!

530
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,272
Okay, I think it's ready,

531
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,152
- All right. - Hurry up,
- Here, I'll tell you what to do.

532
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,068
- No, you`re going to give her
the shot. - I ain't giving itto her.

533
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,192
- I've never done this before,
- Me either,

534
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,949
You brought her here
and you're giving her the shot.

535
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,072
- Give her the shot,
- Here, - Give me that!

536
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,920
- Tell me whatto do, -You're giving
her an injection of adrenaline,,.

537
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:31,036
.,in her heart, You have to pierce
through here with a stabbing motion.

538
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,152
- I've got to stab her three times?
- No, just once,

539
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,071
You have to get through her bone and
to her heart, then press the plunger,

540
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,192
- Then what happens?
- I'm curious about that myself.

541
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,313
- Am I going to kill her? - No,
she's supposed to come out of it.

542
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,115
- AIl right, count to three.
- One.

543
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,679
Two,

544
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,311
Three!

545
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,318
If you're all right, say something,

546
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,271
Something!

547
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,835
That was fucking "tripy"!

548
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,871
Oh man!

549
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,831
Mia.

550
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,591
What..,

551
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,155
What's your thought
on how to handle this?

552
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,078
What's yours?

553
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,518
I`m of the opinion that Marsellus
doesn't need to know about this,

554
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,990
If Marsellus knew about this,
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

555
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,475
I doubt that!

556
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,593
I can keep a secret if you can.

557
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,114
Shake on it!

558
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,239
Mum's the word?
Cool!

559
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,511
If you'II excuse me, l`m going home
to have a heart attack!

560
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,511
Vincent.

561
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,836
- Do you want to hear
my `'Fox Force Five" joke? - Sure,

562
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,509
But I think I'm still
too petrified to laugh,

563
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,634
You won't laugh because it's not
funny, But I'll tell you if you want,

564
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,876
I can't wait!

565
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,790
Papa Tomato, Mamma Tomato and Baby
Tomato are walking down the street.

566
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,710
Baby Tomato starts Iagging behind
and Papa Tomato gets really angry,

567
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,072
He goes back, squishes him
and says: `'Ketchup!'`

568
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,075
Ketchup!

569
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,951
See you around.

570
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:04,309
"That funny silly dog thinks
totem pole is alive."

571
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,676
"He's an arctic tender foot."

572
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,509
`'That totem pole
has been here forever."

573
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,631
Butch.

574
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,837
- Stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

575
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,952
You've got a social visitor,

576
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,557
Remember when I told you that
your daddy died in a POW camp?

577
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,436
This is Captain Koons,
he was in the POW camp with daddy,

578
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,796
Hello, little man.
I heard a bunch about you,

579
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,792
I was a good friend of your dad`s.

580
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,948
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell
together for over five years.

581
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,870
Hopefully you`II never have
to experience this yourself,

582
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,992
When two men are in a situation,.,

583
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,510
,.Iike me and your dad were
for as Iong as we were,.,

584
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,235
..you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

585
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,797
If it had been me
who had not made it.,.

586
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,516
.,Major Coolidge would be talking
right now to my son Jim.

587
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,150
But the way it turned out,
l`m talking to you, Butch.

588
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,872
I've got something for you,

589
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,833
This watch was first purchased
by your great-grandfather.,.

590
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,952
.,during the First World War,,.

591
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,073
,.in a Iittle general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

592
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,355
It was made by the first company
ever to make wrist watches.

593
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,472
It was bought
by Private Eryne Coolidge..,

594
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,592
,.on the day he set sail for Paris.

595
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,919
Your great-grandfather wore this
watch every day he was in the war,

596
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,237
Then he went home
to your great-grandmother.,,

597
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,750
,.and put the watch
in an old coffee can,,.

598
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,873
..where it stayed until
your granddad, Dane Coolidge.,,

599
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,915
,,was called upon by his country
to go overseas and fight,

600
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,430
This time it was called World War Il.

601
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,554
Your great-grandfather gave this
watch to your granddad for good Iuck,

602
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,877
Unfortunately Dane was a marine.

603
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,994
He was killed with all the other
marines at the battle of Wake lsland.

604
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,389
Your granddad was facing death,
he knew it.

605
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,514
None of those boys had any illusions
about Ieaving that island alive.

606
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,633
Three days before the Japanese
took the island..,

607
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:58,357
,.he asked a gunner on an Airforce
transporter named Winocki.,.

608
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,508
.,a man he'd never met before,
to deliver to his infant son,,.

609
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,438
.,who he`d never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

610
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:11,554
Three days Iateryour granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

611
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:16,879
After the war was over, he went
to see your grandmother delivering.,.

612
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,993
,.to your infant father,
his dad's gold watch, this watch,

613
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,359
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi,

614
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,870
He was captured
and put in a prison camp,

615
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,120
If the gooks ever saw the watch,
it would be confiscated,..

616
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,837
..taken away, The way your dad saw
it, this watch was your birth right.

617
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,555
He`d be damned if he'd let anyone
put their greasy yellow hands on it.

618
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,673
So he hid it in the one place he knew
he could hide something, in his ass.

619
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,793
Five Iong years he wore
this watch up his ass,

620
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,310
Then he died of dysentery,
he gave me the watch.

621
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,434
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.

622
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,678
Then after seven years
I was sent home to my family,

623
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,791
Now,.,

624
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,515
,.Iittle man,
I give the watch to you,

625
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,758
It`s time, Butch.

626
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,348
Wearing blue trousers, weighing
210 pounds, FIoyd Ray Wilson,

627
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,194
- Wilson is dead, - Dan, that was the
most brutal fight we've ever seen.

628
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:14,633
Coolidge ran straight out. Do you
think he knew Wilson was dead?

629
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,754
Yes, I could see the frenzy in
his eyes, he knew what he was doing,

630
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,874
- Any man would've run straight out.
-Will this tragedy effect boxing?

631
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,993
Atragedy Iike this can`t help
but shake the world of boxing,

632
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,796
It's of paramount importance, during
the sad weeks ahead, that the WBA.,,

633
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,634
- Marsellus,
- I swear, it's not my fault!

634
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,754
- How are you doing? - Great,
I neverthanked you for dinner,

635
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,954
- What have you got? - He booked,
His trainer doesn`t know nothing.

636
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:30,359
- I think he's as surprised as we
are. - We want to know, not think.

637
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,270
Take him to the kennel, sick the dogs
on him. We'll find out what he knows.

638
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,393
- What about the search for Butch?
- I'Il scour the earth for him!

639
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:45,595
If he goes to Indochina, I want our
man in his rice ready to shoot him!

640
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,315
I will take care of it.

641
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,114
Mister.

642
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,309
- Mister,
- What?

643
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,433
You were in that fight on the radio.

644
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,751
- Are you the fighter? - Whatever
gave you that idea? - No, come on!

645
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,157
You're him, I know you're him!

646
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,715
- Tell me you're him.
- Yes, I'm him.

647
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,312
You killed the other boxing man.

648
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,073
- He's dead?
- The radio said he was dead,

649
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,312
I'm sorry about that, FIoyd.

650
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,878
- What it is like? - What is
what like? - Killing a man.

651
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,836
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands!

652
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:01,956
- Are you a weirdo? - No, it is
a subject I have much interest in.

653
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,874
You are the first person I have ever
met who has killed somebody.

654
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,551
What does it feel like
to kill a man?

655
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:21,714
Give me one of your cigarettes
and I'Il tell you all about it,

656
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,552
So, "Esmarelda",,.

657
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,755
.,`'Villa Lobos",

658
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,919
- Is that Mexican? - The name
is Spanish, but I'm Colombian,

659
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,032
- That`s some name, honey!
- Thank you,

660
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,752
- What is your name?
- Butch,

661
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,591
Butch!

662
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,430
- What does it mean? - You're in
America, our names don't mean shit!

663
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,714
So, Esmarelda,
what is it you want to know?

664
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:16,551
- I want to know what itfeels Iike
to kill a man. - I couldn't tell you.

665
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,431
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

666
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,553
Now that I know, you want to know
how I feel about it?

667
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,752
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it,

668
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:52,951
As soon as the word got out about the
fix, the odds went through the roof,

669
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,878
I know, unbelievable,

670
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,792
Fuck him! If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

671
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,712
Who gives a fuck! It's over now.

672
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:14,277
Enough about the poor Mr. FIoyd,
Iet's talk about the rich Mr, Butch!

673
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,193
How many bookers did you Iay it on?
All eight?

674
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:24,110
How Iong to collect? So you`II have
it all by tomorrow night,

675
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,232
I understand, a few stragglers aside.

676
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,273
Scotty, that is great news,

677
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,392
Me and Fabienne are going to leave
in the morning.

678
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,514
It'Il take us a couple days
to get down to Knoxville, Okay.

679
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,318
You're Goddamn right!

680
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:48,032
AII right, Scotty, The next time
I see you will be in Tennessee.

681
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,758
$ 45,60,

682
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,951
Now.

683
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,672
Here's a little something
forthe effort,

684
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,079
-What do you say if someone asks who
your fare was tonight? - The truth.

685
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,193
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans,

686
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:31,751
- Bon soir, Esmarelda.
- Buenas noches, Butch.

687
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,111
- Keep the Iight off,
- Is that better? - Yes.

688
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:59,398
- Hard day at the office?
- Pretty hard, I got in a fight!

689
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,718
Poor baby!
Can we make spoons?

690
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,673
I was thinking about taking a shower,
I'm stinking like a dog,

691
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,998
- I Iike the wayyou stink,
- Let me take this jacket off.

692
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,953
I was Iooking at myself in
the mirror, I wish I had a pot.

693
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:27,234
- You Iooked in the mirror and you
wished you had some pot? - A pot,

694
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,353
A potbelly, potbellies are sexy.

695
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:35,473
Well, you should be happy,
because you have one.

696
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,592
Shut up, fatso!
I don't have a pot.

697
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:44,317
I have a bit of a tummy, Iike Madonna
when she did `'Lucky Star",

698
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:49,833
- Is there a big difference between
a potbelly and a tummy? - It's huge,

699
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,075
- Would you Iike it
if I had a potbelly? - No.

700
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,591
Potbellies make a man look Iike
an oaf or Iike a gorilla.

701
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,917
But on a woman a potbelly is sexy.

702
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:08,717
The rest of you is normal, your face,
your Iegs, your hips, your ass,..

703
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,833
,.butwith a big
perfectly round potbelly.

704
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,953
If I had one I'd wear a T-shirt two
sizes too small to accentuate it,

705
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,871
- Men find that attractive? - l
don't give a damn what they think!

706
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,996
What we find pleasing to the eyes
and to the touch is seldom the same,

707
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:37,553
- If you had a potbelly, I'd punch
you in it, -You'd punch it? - Yes.

708
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,277
I`d smother you, I'd drop it on your
face until you couldn`t breathe!

709
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,392
- You`d do that?
- Yes.

710
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,471
- Did you get everything? - Yes.
- Good job, sugarpop.

711
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,673
- Did everything go as planned?
- You didn't listen to the,., Ouch!

712
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,793
- You didn't Iisten to the radio?
- I never Iisten to your fights,

713
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,912
- Were you the winner?
- I won all right.

714
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,715
- Are you still retiring?
- I sure am.

715
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,834
- So it all worked out in the finish.
- We're not at the finish yet, baby,

716
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,512
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

717
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,717
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

718
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,035
But they won't find us, will they?

719
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,157
Do you still want me to go with you?

720
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,108
I don`t want to be a burden, it`s.,.

721
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,471
Say it,

722
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,433
Fabienne, I want you to be with me,

723
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,637
- Forever?
- Forever and ever,

724
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,630
- Do you Iove me?
- Very much.

725
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,392
- Butch.,,
- Yes?

726
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,313
Will you give me oral pleasure?

727
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,238
Will you kiss it?

728
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,310
You first.

729
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,432
- Okay,
- Okay,

730
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,994
Butch, my Iove, the adventure begins.

731
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,878
- I think I cracked a rib.
- Giving me oral pleasure?

732
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,994
- No, retard, in the fight.
- Don`t call me "retard".

733
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,113
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it,

734
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:30,837
- Shut up, I hate that
Mongoloid voice, - Okay, sorry.

735
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,638
I take it back.

736
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,553
Will you hand me a dry towel,
my beautiful tulip?

737
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,754
I like being called a tulip, "Tulip"
is much better than '`Mongoloid".

738
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,671
I called you "retard",
not "Mongoloid" and I took it back.

739
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,792
- Butch,
- Yes, Iemon pie!

740
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,914
- Where are we going to go? - I'm
not sure yet, wherever you want,

741
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,552
I'm going to get
a lot of money from this,

742
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:06,878
But we can't live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

743
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,873
I was thinking that we could go
some place in the South Pacific.

744
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,992
The money we'Il have is going
to carry us a long way down there,

745
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,112
- We could live in Bora Bora.
- You bet.

746
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:23,439
If you don`t dig it after a while,
we can go to Tahiti or Mexico,

747
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:30,238
- I do not speak Spanish,
- Mexican is easy,

748
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,352
- '`Donde està Ia zapateria?'`
- What does that mean?

749
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:37,871
- "Where is the shoe store?"
- "Donde està..,`' - Spit,

750
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:43,474
- '`Donde està Ia zapateria?'`
- Excellent pronunciation!

751
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,952
You'Il be my little
mamasita in no time!

752
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,351
"Qué hora es?`'

753
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,951
- "Qué hora es?'`
- It`s time for bed!

754
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,758
Sweet dreams, jelly bean.

755
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,231
Butch.

756
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,515
Never mind.

757
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,550
You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

758
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:42,676
- What is this? - A motorcycle
movie, I don't know the name,

759
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,308
- Are you watching it?
- In a way!

760
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,079
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions!

761
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,078
- What was it about? - You're
the one who was watching it!

762
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:05,797
- Silly, what was your dream about?
- I don`t know, I don't remember,

763
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,476
- I never remember my dreams, - Look
at the grumpy man in the morning!

764
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:18,714
- Get up and we`II have breakfast,
- One more kiss.

765
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,232
- Satisfied?
- Yes.

766
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,558
Get up, lazybones!

767
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,832
- What time is it?
- AImost 9.

768
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,908
- What time does our train arrive?
- At 11:00,

769
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,158
- You know what l`m having
for breakfast? - What?

770
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:49,196
A big plate of blueberry pancakes
with maple syrup,.,

771
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,471
,.eggs over easy and five sausages,

772
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:56,798
- Anything to drink with that?
- That looks nice!

773
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:04,071
To drink a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee,

774
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,192
After that l'II have a slice of pie.

775
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,314
- Pie for breakfast? - Anytime
of day is a good time for pie,

776
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:18,310
BIueberry pie and on top
a thin slice of cheese,

777
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,432
Where`s my watch?

778
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,592
- It's there,
- No, it's not.

779
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,516
- Have you Iooked? - Yes! What
the fuck do you think I'm doing?

780
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,519
- Are you sure you got it?
- Yes, bedside table drawer.

781
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,598
- And the Iittle kangaroo?
- Yes.

782
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,678
Well, it's not here now!

783
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:50,194
- It should be, - Yes, but it's not!
Where the fuck is it?

784
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,554
Fabienne, that was
my father's fucking watch,

785
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:06,593
Do you know what he had to go through
to get me that watch? A Iot!

786
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,712
You could have set
all this other shit on fire.

787
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,152
But I specifically reminded you
not to forget the watch!

788
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,590
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

789
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,757
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or you didn't!

790
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,269
Then I did.

791
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,032
- Are you sure?
- No,

792
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,436
Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucker!

793
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:41,556
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

794
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,118
It's not your fault,

795
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,112
If you Ieft it at the apartment.,,

796
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,354
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault,

797
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:10,716
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
I reminded you about it,..

798
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,833
.,but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

799
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,353
If all I gave a fuck about
was the watch, I should've told you,

800
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,075
You're not a mind reader, are you?

801
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:39,594
- I'm sorry, - Don't be, I just
can`t have breakfast with you.

802
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,672
Why is that?

803
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,311
I've got to go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

804
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:55,436
-Won`t the gangsters be looking
for you there? - I'Il find out,

805
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,833
If they are and I don't think
I can handle it, I'Il split,

806
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,954
I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it.

807
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,468
Here`s some money,
have a nice breakfast,

808
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,592
I'Il be back before you can say
"blueberry pie'`.

809
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,518
BIueberry pie!

810
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,838
Maybe not that fast.
But pretty fast, okay?

811
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,198
- Bye.
- Bye.

812
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,711
Of all the fucking things,
she forgets my father`s watch!

813
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:37,038
I specifically reminded her:
"Bedside table, on the kangaroo`'!

814
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,197
`'Don`t forget my father's watch.'`

815
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,838
Looking good, Butch!

816
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:19,513
That's how you're going to beat them.
They keep underestimating you.

817
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,752
You motherfucker!

818
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,475
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

819
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:21,916
I`ll be glad to go to court,
that drunk hityou and then that car.

820
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,278
- Who?
- Him.

821
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,552
I'Il be damned!

822
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,392
- Can I help you with something?
- Shut the fuck up!

823
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,830
Hey, wait a minute!
What the fuck are you up to?

824
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,994
Come here, motherfucker!

825
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,795
Do you feel that sting?
That`s pride fucking with you!

826
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,117
You've got to fight
through that shit!

827
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,117
- You'd better kill me,
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed,

828
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,912
- Hold it rightthere!
- This ain't none of your business!

829
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:42,477
- I'm making it my business, Toss
the weapon, - You don't understand.

830
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,797
Toss the weapon!

831
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,956
Take your foot off the nigger
and put your hand behind your head.

832
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,278
- Approach the counter.
- This scum is trying to kill me!

833
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,154
Shut up, keep coming. Come on!

834
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,517
Zed, it's Maynard. The spider
just caught a couple flies!

835
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,753
Nobody kills anybody in my place
of business except me or Zed.

836
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,475
That's Zed.

837
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,953
- You said you'd wait for me,
- I did,

838
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,918
- How come they're all beat up?
- They did that to each other,

839
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,032
They came in fighting.

840
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,675
This one here
was going to shoot that one,

841
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,270
You were gonna shoot him, boy?

842
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,792
Is Grace all right out front?

843
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,912
- Yeah, Today's not Tuesday,
- No, it's Thursday,

844
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,032
She ought to be fine.

845
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,992
Bring out the gimp,

846
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,838
I think the gimp is sleeping,

847
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,158
I guess you'Il have to go
wake him up, won't you?

848
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,351
Get up.

849
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,154
Get down.

850
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,798
Which one of them
do you want to do first?

851
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,435
I ain't so sure yet,

852
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,399
Eeny, meany, miny, mo,

853
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:49,512
Catch a nigger by the toe,

854
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,238
If he hollers, let go!

855
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,239
Eeny, meany, miny, mo!

856
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,279
My mother said pick a perfect one.,,

857
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,837
,.and you are.,.

858
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,871
,.it!

859
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,713
I guess that means you, big boy!

860
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,318
- Do you wantto do it in here?
- No, in Russell's old room,

861
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:30,278
That sounds good to me,

862
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,838
Keep an eye on this one,

863
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,752
You want that gun, Don't you, Zed?

864
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,511
Huh?

865
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,152
Go ahead and pick it up,

866
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,191
Go ahead, pick it up.

867
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,791
Come on, Zed!

868
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,234
I wantyou to pick it up,

869
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,558
Step aside, Butch,

870
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,074
You okay?

871
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,228
No, man,

872
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,353
I'm pretty fucking far from okay.

873
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,195
What now?

874
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,551
What now,,.

875
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:44,476
I'Il tell you: I'm going to call a
couple hard, pipe-hitting niggers.,.

876
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,592
.,to go to work on the homes here.,.

877
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:51,713
..with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

878
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:56,313
You hear me talking,
hillbilly boy?

879
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,831
I ain`t through with you,
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass!

880
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:09,193
I meant,
what now between me and you?

881
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,472
Oh, thatwhat now!

882
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,397
I'Il tell you what's now
between me and you,

883
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,352
There is no me and you,

884
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,398
Not no more.

885
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:33,109
So, are we cool?

886
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,989
Yeah, we're cool.

887
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,789
Two things.

888
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,592
Don't tell nobody about this,

889
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,792
This shit is between me, you.,.

890
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:51,914
,.and mister, soon to be Iiving the
rest of his Iife in agonizing pain,.,

891
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,634
,.rapist!

892
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,752
It ain`t nobody else's business,

893
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:02,749
Two: you Ieave town tonight,
right now,.,

894
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,393
.,and when you're gone,
you stay gone or you'Il be gone!

895
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,393
You lost all your LA privileges,
Deal?

896
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,391
Deal.

897
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,118
Get your ass out of here,

898
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,391
Oh, shit!

899
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,151
Fabienne!

900
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,751
Fabienne!

901
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:30,313
Fabienne, get your shit.
We've got to go right now.

902
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:35,036
- And our bags? - Fuck the bags!
Let's split or we'll miss the train,

903
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:39,153
- Come on, I'Il be downstairs.
- Is everything well? - Come on!

904
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:42,078
Are we in danger?

905
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,715
Come on, honey!

906
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:53,071
- Where did you get this motorcycle?
- It`s a "chopper", Let's go.

907
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:58,718
- What happened to my Honda?
- l`m sorry, I had to crash it.

908
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:01,638
Come on now, please!

909
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:10,474
- Are you hurt? - I might've broken
my nose, no biggie, Hop on,

910
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,593
Baby, we`ve got to hit
the fucking road. Get on!

911
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,158
I'm sorry, come here,

912
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:25,959
- l`m sorry, - You were gone so long,
I started to think dreadful thoughts,

913
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,072
- I'm sorry. How was your breakfast?
- It was good,

914
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:34,194
- Did you get the pancakes? - They
didn't have any, I got buttermilk,

915
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:39,474
- Are you okay? - This has been
the single weirdest day in my Iife.

916
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,593
I`ll tell you all about it.
Get on, we've got to go.

917
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,672
- Whose motorcycle is this?
- It's a chopper.

918
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:53,796
- Whose chopper is this? - Zed`s.
- Who's Zed? - Zed's dead,

919
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:12,192
- Brett, you tried to fuck him!
- No!

920
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:17,314
Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by nobody except Mrs. Wallace.

921
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:21,831
- God, I don`t want to die! - Do you
read the Bible, Brett? - Yes.

922
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,953
There`s this passage I memorized,
it fits the occasion,

923
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:31,518
Ezekiel: 25-17.
"The path of the righteous man,,."

924
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,838
",.is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish.,."

925
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,952
`'..and the tyranny of evil men."

926
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:43,073
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will.,,"

927
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:46,192
'`.,shepherds the weak
through the Valley of Darkness,`'

928
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:50,916
'`For he is truly his brother`s keeper
and the finder of Iost children."

929
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,238
"l will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance,.."

930
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:59,399
".,and furious anger
those who attempt to destroy.,."

931
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,511
'`.,my brothers,`'

932
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:05,076
"And you will know
my name is the Lord,.,"

933
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,909
'`..when I lay my vengeance
upon thee!"

934
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,271
I'm fucked!

935
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,791
- I'm fucked! I'm fucked!
- Is he a friend of yours?

936
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:23,912
- Goddamn!
- Vincent, Marvin,

937
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:28,113
- Tell him to shut up.
- l`m fucked! - Marvin!

938
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,439
Knock it off.

939
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,757
Die, you motherfuckers!

940
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:04,431
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

941
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:09,554
Did you forget somebody was in there
with a "hand cannon"?

942
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:14,674
Did you see the size of that gun?
It was bigger than him.

943
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:22,358
- We should be dead.
- We were Iucky.

944
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,552
No, that wasn't luck,

945
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:29,673
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

946
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,997
Do you know what
`'divine intervention" is?

947
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,514
It means that God came down from
heaven and stopped the bullets?

948
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,714
Exactly, Vincent. God stopped
these motherfucking bullets!

949
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:53,191
- It's time for us to Ieave,
- Don't blow this shit off!

950
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:57,074
- What happened here was a miracle!
- This shit happens!

951
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:03,150
- This shit doesn't just happen, - Do
you want to continue in the car.,.

952
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:07,239
..or in a jailhouse with the cops?
- We should be dead!

953
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,275
What happened here was a miracle
and I want you to acknowledge it!

954
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,837
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

955
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,792
Let's go, nigger, come on!

956
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,114
Once I saw a show with this cop on
who was talking about a gunfight,.,

957
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:38,233
,.he had in the hallwaywith
this guy. He unloaded on this guy,

958
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:42,956
Nothing happened, he didn't hit
nothing, It was just him and the guy,

959
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,629
You know, it's freaky,
but it happens,

960
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:51,436
Go ahead and play blind man ifyou
want, but my eyes are wide open.

961
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:56,953
- What's that mean? - That`s it
for me, consider me retired.

962
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:00,550
- Jesus Christ.,.
- Don't blaspheme!

963
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:05,117
- Are you freaking out? - Today I'm
telling Marsellus that I'm through.

964
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:08,232
- Tell him why too,
- I will.

965
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:12,956
- I bet he'Il laugh his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does!

966
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:17,358
- Marvin, what do you make of this?
- I don't even have an opinion.

967
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,439
Do you think that God came down
and stopped the bullets?

968
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:25,590
- What the fuck happened?
Oh, shit! - Ah, man!

969
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,713
- I shot Marvin in the face, -Why'd
you do that? - It was an accident.

970
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:35,631
- I've never seen this kind of shit!
-You probably went over a bump,

971
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,153
- I didn't hit no bump! - I didn't
mean to shoot him, the gun went off,

972
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:46,274
-We're in a city in broad daylight,
- I can't believe it. - Believe it!

973
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:52,157
- We've got to getthis car off the
road. - Take it to a friendly place,

974
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:57,434
- Marsellus ain`t got no friends
in the Valley. - This ain't my town!

975
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:02,430
- Shit! - What are you doing? - I'm
calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

976
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:07,395
It's over the hill, If Jimmie ain't
home, I don't know what we'Il do.

977
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:12,674
I ain`t got no other partners in
this area. Jimmie! Hi, it's Jules.

978
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:19,797
Me and my homeboy are in deep shit,
We need your garage for a few hours.

979
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:26,990
We have to be delicate with Jimmie.
One remark and he`ll kick us out,

980
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:32,354
- If he does, what do we do? - We
ain`t going until we make some calls,

981
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,950
- I don'ttell a friend what's what.
- Tell him notto be abusive!

982
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:40,910
- He freaked out when he saw Marvin,
- Put yourself in his position.

983
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,318
He just woke up,
he wasn't expecting this shit.

984
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:51,675
- He`s doing us a favor. - If I have
to take shit, he can stick his favor.

985
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:57,750
- What are you doing? - I'm drying
my hands. - You have to wash them.

986
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:03,557
- I did. - I saw you get them wet.
- This shit is hard to get off!

987
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:08,629
I used the same soap you did, but the
towel didn`t look Iike a maxi-pad!

988
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:14,710
What if he sees this? Shit Iike this
will bring the situation to a head!

989
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:20,359
I ain'tthreatening you,
you know I respect you,..

990
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,315
.,but don't put me in this position,
AIl right? - AIl right, fine.

991
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:31,550
Ask me nice Iike that, no problem.
Just go handle your friend.

992
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:38,272
Damn! This is serious gourmet shit!

993
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:42,792
We would've been satisfied
with some Taster's Choice.

994
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,996
- What flavor is this?
- Knock it off, Jules!

995
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:53,432
- What? - I don`t need you
to tell me how good my coffee is.

996
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:59,954
I buy it, I know it's good. I buy the
expensive stuff, I want to taste it.

997
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:06,872
But this coffee ain't on my mind now,
it's the dead nigger in my garage,

998
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:12,234
- Jimmie, don't worry about it.
- Is there a sign outside my house.,.

999
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:16,991
..that says `'dead nigger storage'`?
- Jimmie, you know,,.

1000
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,556
Is there a sign that says
"dead nigger storage`'?

1001
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:26,118
- No,
- Right, because there ain't one.

1002
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:31,917
- Storing dead niggers ain't
my business! - We're not going to..,

1003
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:37,956
If Bonnie comes home and finds a dead
body here, I'm going to get divorced,

1004
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:44,190
No trial separation, no, I'm going
to get divorced and I don't want to!

1005
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,076
I want to help you,
but I don'twant to Iose my wife.

1006
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:55,230
- Jimmie, she ain`t going to Ieave
you, - Don't Jimmie me, Jules!

1007
01:54:55,440 --> 01:55:00,275
Nothing you can say will make me
forget that I Iove my wife.

1008
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,755
She comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

1009
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,157
She worked the graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1010
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:15,036
If you've got to make some phone
calls, do it. Then get out.,.

1011
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:19,552
.,before she gets here.
- We don't want to fuck your shit up,

1012
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,629
- l'II just call my people for help,
- You'Il fuck my shit up big time.,.

1013
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:31,359
..if Bonnie comes home.
Just go make your calls.

1014
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,315
Say she comes home.
What do you think she'll do?

1015
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,278
Don't tell me she'II freak,
That ain't no kind of answer,

1016
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:45,597
How much? A Iot or a Iittle?

1017
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:50,316
You've got to appreciate what
an explosive element Bonnie is.

1018
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:55,435
If she comes home and finds a bunch
of gangsters doing gangster shit..,

1019
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,916
,,there ain't no telling
what she'Il do,

1020
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:05,598
I grasp that,
I'm contemplating the "ifs".

1021
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:10,920
I don't want to hear no "ifs'`. I want
to hear: '`You ain't got no problem."

1022
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:16,353
"I'm on the motherfucker, Go chill
them out and wait for the cavalry."

1023
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:21,793
You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker,

1024
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,516
Go chill them out
and wait forthe Wolf,

1025
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,199
- You're sending the Wolf? - Do you
feel better? - Yes, head negro!

1026
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:36,392
That's all you had to say.

1027
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:40,272
Is she the hysterical type?

1028
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:43,711
When is she due?

1029
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,754
Give me the names again.

1030
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,873
Jules.

1031
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:56,629
Vincent.

1032
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:04,315
Jimmie, Bonnie.

1033
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:12,470
I`ll be there in ten.

1034
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:34,710
- You're Jimmie, This is your house?
- Yes, - I'm Wolf, I solve problems.

1035
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,869
- Good. We've got one, - So I heard.
May I come in? - PIease do,

1036
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:44,790
You must be Jules and you`re Vincent,
Let's get down to business,

1037
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:50,671
- If I was informed correctly,
the clock is ticking. - 100%,

1038
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,997
Your wife comes home at 9:30 a,m.

1039
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:59,194
- If she comes home and finds us
here, she won't appreciate it, - No,

1040
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:03,075
That gives us 40 minutes,

1041
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,716
Do what I say when I say to do it,

1042
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,674
There's a corpse in a car minus
a head in a garage, Take me to it.

1043
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:24,235
Jimmie, I smelled some coffee
back there. Will you make me a cup?

1044
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,271
Sure,

1045
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:34,192
- How do you take it?
- Lots of cream, Iots of sugar.

1046
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,597
How's the car? Does it stall, smoke,
make noise, is there gas, anything?

1047
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,635
- The car is cool, - Positive?
I don't want to get on the road,..

1048
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:52,392
,.and find out that the brake Iights
don`t work. - It's tip-top. - Good.

1049
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,750
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1050
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:04,029
- Here, Mr. Wolf,
- Thank you, Jimmie,

1051
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:15,434
You two take the body
and stick it in the trunk.

1052
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:20,760
This is a domesticated house. This
makes me think you've got cleaners,

1053
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,432
- Yes, under the sink. - You two
have to clean the inside of the car.

1054
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:29,279
I'm talking fast.

1055
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:34,156
Go into the back seat and scoop up
all the pieces of brain and skull.

1056
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:37,830
Wipe down the upholstery,
but don't overdo it,

1057
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:42,636
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts,

1058
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:47,118
The pools of blood that have
collected, soak them up.

1059
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:51,632
Jimmie, I need blankets,
quilts, bedspreads,

1060
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:56,231
The thicker and darker, the better,
No whites,

1061
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,116
We're going to Iine the front
and back seats and the floorboards.

1062
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:06,314
If a cop stops us and sticks
his snout in the car, it won'twork,

1063
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:11,514
But at a glance the car will appear
to be normal, Boys, get to work!

1064
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:15,713
- A "please'` would be nice,
- Come again?

1065
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,119
- A "please'` would be nice,
- I'm not here to say "please`'.

1066
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:24,312
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1067
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:28,911
If self-preservation is an instinct
you possess, do it quick.

1068
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:33,955
I`m here to help, If my help's not
appreciated, Iots of Iuck, gentlemen.

1069
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:37,436
Your help is definitely appreciated.

1070
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,873
I don't mean disrespect. I just don't
Iike people barking orders at me,

1071
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:47,517
Time is a factor.
I think fast and I talk fast.

1072
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:51,235
I need you to act fast
if you want to get out of this,

1073
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:55,115
Pretty-please,
clean the fucking car!

1074
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:01,514
Don't look at me Iike that.
I can feel your look,

1075
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:07,835
It's a 1974 Chevy,

1076
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,511
Green.

1077
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:15,237
Nothing, except the mess inside.

1078
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,633
About twenty minutes.

1079
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:24,270
Nobody who will be missed.

1080
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,350
You`re a good man, Joe. Thanks,

1081
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,998
- How are we coming?
- Good. I`ve got it all here,

1082
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:37,839
-You've got to understand,.,
- Call me Winston.

1083
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:45,355
You've got to understand something,
This is our best Iinen here,

1084
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:50,554
It was a wedding present from
my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Jinny.

1085
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,753
- They're not with us anymore and..,
- Let me ask you a question.

1086
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:58,313
- If you don't mind,
- No!

1087
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:05,197
- Were your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Jinny millionaires? - No.

1088
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:09,229
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is,

1089
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:14,434
I`m positive that if Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Jinny were here,.,

1090
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:18,633
.,they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1091
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,830
Your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do this.

1092
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:31,194
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom,

1093
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,198
How about you, Jimmie?

1094
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,391
Are you an oak man?

1095
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,871
Oak is nice.

1096
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:50,319
I'Il never forgive your ass for this.
This is fucked up repugnant shit!

1097
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:55,514
Haven't you heard of the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,.,

1098
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:59,713
,,he is forgiven for all wrong
doings. - Get out of my face!

1099
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:04,118
I have to pick up pieces of skull
because ofyour dumb ass!

1100
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,915
I've got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take!

1101
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:14,116
Right now l`m a race car in the red
and it's dangerous to be in the red!

1102
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,312
- I could blow.
- Really? - Yeah!

1103
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,513
Well I'm a mushroom cloud laying
motherfucker, motherfucker!

1104
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:26,714
Every time myfingers touch brain,
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone"!

1105
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:30,515
What the fuck am I doing?
You should be on brain detail!

1106
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:33,029
I'm washing the windows!

1107
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:46,599
Fine job, gentlemen.
We'Il make it out ofthis yet.

1108
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,951
I can't believe
this is the same car!

1109
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:54,113
Let`s not start
sucking each other's dicks yet,

1110
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:59,314
Phase one is complete. Let's move on
to phase two, clean you two!

1111
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:04,755
- Strip! - All the way?
- To your bare ass!

1112
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:11,717
Quickly, gentlemen. We`ve got 15
minutes before Jimmie's wife comes.

1113
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,198
- This morning air is chilly.
- Is this absolutely necessary?

1114
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:20,871
You know what you look like? Two
guys who just blew off a man's head,

1115
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:25,271
Stripping off
those bloody rags is necessary.

1116
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,514
- Toss them in the garbage bag!
- Don't Ieave this shit out front!

1117
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:39,953
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap!

1118
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:46,877
I'm sure you've been to the county
jail, Here it comes!

1119
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:51,070
- It's fucking cold!
- Better you than me, gentlemen.

1120
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,993
- Don't be afraid of the soap,
- Getthem up there a Iittle.

1121
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:59,919
- Vincent's hair,
- Goddamn it.

1122
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,231
Towels!

1123
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,678
They're dry,
toss them their clothes!

1124
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:20,676
Perfect!

1125
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:24,032
We couldn't have planned this better,

1126
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,994
You guys Iook Iike.,,
What do they Iook like, Jimmie?

1127
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,191
Dorks!

1128
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:32,835
They look Iike a couple of dorks!

1129
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:39,149
- They're your clothes! - Come on
or we'Il laugh ourway into prison,

1130
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:48,556
We're going to a place called
'`Monster Joe's Truck and Tow",

1131
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,509
Monster Joe and his daughter
were sympathetic to our dilemma.

1132
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:57,714
The place is North Hollywood.
We`ll be going up Hollywood Way,

1133
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,597
I'Il drive the tainted car.
Jules, you'll ride with me.

1134
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,790
Vincent, you'II follow in my car,

1135
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,994
If we come across any kind of Iaw,
nobody does a fucking thing.,.

1136
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:14,318
,,till I do something,
What did I say? - Don't do shit.

1137
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:19,036
- Unless what? - Unless you do it
first, - Spoken Iike a true prodigy.

1138
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:22,630
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1139
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:26,549
I don't know why the gun went off.
I'm cool.

1140
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,752
I drive fast, So, keep up,

1141
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:34,750
If you wreck my car, Monster Joe
will dispose of two bodies!

1142
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:39,631
Get out of my way, Rex!

1143
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:44,437
- We cool?
- Like it never happened!

1144
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,550
This is Raquel,

1145
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:52,994
- Some day all this will be hers!
- What`s with the outfits?

1146
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:56,351
Are you guys
going to a volleyball game?

1147
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:01,479
I`m going to breakfast. I`ll drop
you off. Where do you live?

1148
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:06,276
- Redondo. - Englewood,
- Shh! In your future I see..,

1149
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,836
..a cab ride!
Move out of the sticks, fellows!

1150
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,715
- Say good night, Raquel.
- "Good night, Raquel"!

1151
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:17,913
- See you guys around!
Stay out of trouble. - Mr. Wolf,

1152
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:22,796
- It was a pleasure watching
you work. - Thank you very much,

1153
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:26,071
Call me Winston,

1154
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:30,194
You see that, young Iady?

1155
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:34,234
- Respect for one's elder shows
character, - I have character!

1156
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:38,319
You are a character
doesn't mean that you have character,

1157
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:51,038
- Want to share a cab? - Do you feel
Iike having breakfast with me?

1158
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:53,551
Cool,

1159
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:01,152
I thought he'd be European,

1160
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:04,352
- He's about as European
as English Bob, - I know that now,

1161
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,758
-Was he cool or what? - Thank you,
- Totally cool, in control!

1162
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,272
He didn't even get pissed
when you were fucking with him,

1163
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:17,870
- Want some bacon?
- I don't eat pork.

1164
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:22,471
- Are you Jewish? - No.
I just don't dig swine, - Why not?

1165
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:27,316
- Pigs are filthy animals,
- But bacon tastes good.

1166
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,911
A sewer rat may taste Iike
pumpkin pie, but I'd never know,.,

1167
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:34,509
.,because I wouldn`t eat it!

1168
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:38,315
Pigs sleep and root in shit,

1169
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:43,514
- I don't eat animals that don`t
disregard their feces, - And dogs?

1170
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:48,714
- I don't eat dog either, - Do you
consider a dog a filthy animal?

1171
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:52,954
I wouldn't call it filthy,
but they're definitely dirty.

1172
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,593
But a dog's got personality.

1173
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:02,158
If a pig had a better personality,
he'd cease to be a filthy animal,

1174
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,756
He'd have to be one charming
motherfucking pig!

1175
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:09,191
Ten times more charming
than the one on Green Acres.

1176
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:19,115
Good, you're starting to Iighten up!

1177
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:23,072
You were so serious!

1178
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:26,955
- I was thinking, - About what?
- The miracle we witnessed,

1179
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:30,197
I witnessed a freak occurrence,

1180
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,994
What is a miracle?

1181
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:37,553
- An act of God!
- What`s an act of God?

1182
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:44,397
When God makes
the impossible possible.

1183
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:48,992
But this morning doesn't qualify,

1184
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:52,636
You're judging this the wrong way.

1185
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,435
It could be that God
stopped the bullets,.,

1186
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:59,632
,.or changed Coke to Pepsi.

1187
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,833
You don't judge this shit
based on merit.

1188
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:07,032
It's insignificant if what
we experienced was a miracle,

1189
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:11,472
I felt the touch of God!
God got involved.

1190
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:17,388
- But why? - I don't know why,
but I can`t go back to sleep.

1191
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:20,992
Are you serious? You're really
thinking about quitting?

1192
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,630
The life? Most definitely!

1193
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,912
Fuck! What are you going to do?

1194
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:32,153
That's what I've been contemplating,

1195
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:35,796
I`m going to deliver
this case to Marsellus,

1196
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,198
- Then I'm going to walk the earth.
- What do you mean?

1197
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:45,076
Like Cane in '`Kung Fu",
Meet people, get in adventures.

1198
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:49,398
- How Iong do you intend to do this?
- Till God puts me where he wants me,

1199
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:52,910
- What if he don't do that?
- Then l`II walk forever,

1200
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,914
- You've decided to be a bum.
- I'll just be Jules,

1201
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:04,114
No, you'Il be a bum Iike all those
pieces of shit who beg for change.,.

1202
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:09,314
.,sleep in garbage bins
and eat what I throw away,

1203
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:12,472
Without a job or a residence.,,

1204
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:15,399
.,you'Il be a fucking bum!

1205
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:18,273
This is where you and I differ.

1206
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,074
Garçon! Coffee!

1207
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:24,875
What happened this morning
is peculiar.

1208
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,150
But water into wine,.,

1209
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,557
- All shapes and sizes.
- Don`t talk to me that way.

1210
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:34,116
If my answers frighten you,
cease asking scary questions!

1211
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:39,311
I'm going to take a shit.

1212
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:47,232
Did you make this decision
when you were eating that muffin?

1213
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:51,473
Yeah, I was eating my muffin
and drinking my coffee.,.

1214
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:56,708
.,when I had what alcoholics refer to
as '`a moment of clarity`'.

1215
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,032
Fuck! To be continued.

1216
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:14,438
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you.

1217
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,277
- Keep cool, this is a robbery!
- If any of you pricks move.,,

1218
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:24,752
.,I'Il execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1219
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,670
You got that?
Keep quiet over there. Get down!

1220
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:34,277
You, take your dames over
to that booth on the count of ten!

1221
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:38,718
- Come out of the kitchen!
- Three, four, five, six,.,

1222
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,758
What the fuck are you doing?

1223
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,195
Throw those bags,

1224
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:48,911
Wake up!
Move!

1225
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:51,879
Get on the fucking floor!

1226
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:56,910
- Grandpa, get down!
- I'm the manager here,

1227
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:02,513
- There`s no problem.
- Are you going to give me problems?

1228
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:08,469
- We've got a hero here.
- Just execute him!

1229
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:13,396
I am not a hero.
I'm just a coffee shop manager,

1230
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:17,633
- The restaurant is ours!
- Just take whatever you want.

1231
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:21,432
Talk to the customers,
tell them to be fucking cool.

1232
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:24,473
- Everything will be over,
You understand? - Yes.

1233
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:30,392
Listen everybody!
Be calm.

1234
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:34,070
Cooperate and this
will all be over in a minute,

1235
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:35,759
Get the fuck down!

1236
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,957
I'm going to come around
and collect yourwallets,

1237
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:56,598
Don`t talk, justthrow them
in the bag. Are we clear?

1238
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:59,360
Wallets out.

1239
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:05,279
Fuck this, In the bag.
Put it in the fucking bag!

1240
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,511
What are you waiting for?
In the bag,

1241
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:15,679
Tips, in the bag.
Is that a cellular phone?

1242
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:18,030
- Yes.
- In the fucking bag.

1243
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,430
That's it. Now get on the floor.

1244
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,756
In the bag,

1245
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,279
In the bag,

1246
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,597
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty Iaundry.

1247
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,755
- You have to do it? That`s a shit
job. - I was thinking the same thing.

1248
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,639
- Open it.
- I can`t do that.

1249
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:07,830
- I didn't hear you,
- Yes, you did.

1250
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:12,995
- What's going on?
- We've got a vigilante in our midst.

1251
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:18,155
- Shoot him in the face! - I've
already had a gun pointed at me,

1252
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,516
Take yourfucking hand off that case,

1253
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:24,230
Stop causing problems,
you'll get us all killed,

1254
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:26,755
Shutthe fuck up, fat man!

1255
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,632
Be cool, honey bunny, No problem,
l`ve got it under control.

1256
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,072
Now I'm gonna count to three.

1257
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:41,271
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your face.

1258
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,279
Are we clear?

1259
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:51,559
One.,.

1260
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,799
,.two.,.

1261
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:01,753
.,three,
- Okay, you win. It's yours,

1262
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,033
Open it,

1263
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,878
What is it?

1264
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:16,599
What is it?

1265
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:21,439
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes.

1266
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:27,558
- It`s beautiful.
- What is it?

1267
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:33,716
You let him go!

1268
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:37,350
- Tell her to be cool!
- I'll kill you! - Say be cool!

1269
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:41,189
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- Let him go, I'll kill you!

1270
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:45,831
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- Be cool! - Chill that bitch out!

1271
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,992
- Tell her it's going to be
all right. - It`s gonna be all right,

1272
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:53,478
- Tell her to chill. - Chill out.
- Tell me her name, - Jolanda,

1273
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:57,429
- Jolanda, we're not going to do
anything stupid. - Don't hurt him.

1274
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:02,196
Nobody is going to hurt anybody.
We`re all going to be Iike Fonzie,

1275
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:07,668
- Jolanda, what's Fonzie Iike?
- He's cool.

1276
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:12,391
Correct! And that's what
we're gonna be, We're gonna be cool.

1277
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:16,553
Now I'm gonna count to three.

1278
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:21,713
When I count three,
I wantyou to let go of your gun.,.

1279
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:26,118
.,put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down,

1280
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:30,316
When you do it, do it cool,

1281
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,599
Are you ready?

1282
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:35,914
One, two.,.

1283
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,239
.,three,

1284
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:50,471
- Now you let him go!
- I thought you were gonna be cool,

1285
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:54,355
When you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

1286
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:59,435
When I get nervous, I get scared
and somebody could get shot.

1287
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:03,157
If you hurt him, you die.

1288
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:06,915
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1289
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,318
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that,.,

1290
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:16,076
,,and Ringo doesn`t want that,
So, Iet's see what we can do.

1291
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:20,154
Now, here's the situation.

1292
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:25,353
Normally your asses would be dead
as fucking fried chicken.

1293
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:29,678
But I'm in a transitional period
and I want to help you,

1294
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:33,509
But I can't give you this case
because it don't belong to me.

1295
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:37,272
Besides, l`ve been through
too much shit over this case,..

1296
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:39,471
..to hand it over to your dumb ass,

1297
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:41,958
Vincent!

1298
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:46,751
Be cool, Jolanda, it`s cool,
We're still just talking!

1299
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,190
Come on, Point the gun at me.

1300
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:54,349
Point the gun at me! There you go,
Vincent, just hang back.

1301
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:58,316
Don't do a Goddamn thing.
Tell her it's still cool.

1302
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:03,435
- It`s still cool, honey bunny. - How
are we doing? - I've got to pee.

1303
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:08,277
- I want to go home.
- I'm proud of you.

1304
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:12,314
And Ringo's proud of you,
Tell her you're proud of her.

1305
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,833
- I'm proud of you.
- I Iove you.

1306
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:20,949
- I Iove you too,
- Now, go in that bag,.,

1307
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,038
,,and find my wallet,

1308
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:28,591
- Which one is it? - The one
that says "bad motherfucker",

1309
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:45,155
That's it.

1310
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,198
Open it up, take outthe money,

1311
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,111
Count it.

1312
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:03,159
How much is there?

1313
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:09,676
- About 1,500 dollars,
- Take it, It's yours,

1314
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:15,634
With the rest of those wallets and
the register this is a good score,

1315
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:18,792
If you give him 1,500 dollars,
I'Il shoot him.

1316
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:24,549
No! Jolanda, he ain't gonna do
a thing. Shutthe fuck up, Vincent!

1317
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:28,120
- Shut up!
- Jolanda, stay with me.

1318
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:33,432
I ain't giving it to him, Vincent.
I`m buying something.

1319
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:39,152
- Want to know what I'm buying,
Ringo? - What? - Your life.

1320
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:44,955
I'm giving it to you so I don't have
to kill you, Do you read the Bible?

1321
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:50,234
- No,
- There's this passage I memorized.

1322
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:52,835
Ezekiel: 25-17.

1323
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:56,952
"The path of the righteous man
is beset by the inequities.,,`'

1324
02:20:57,160 --> 02:21:00,311
`',.of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men."

1325
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:04,712
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity shepherds the weak,.."

1326
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:07,753
`',.through the Valley of Darkness."

1327
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,992
'`For he is truly his brother`s keeper
and the finder of Iost children."

1328
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:14,192
"l will strike down
with great vengeance,.."

1329
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:17,233
'`..those who attempt
to destroy my brothers."

1330
02:21:17,480 --> 02:21:20,472
"You will know I am the Lord,.,"

1331
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:23,672
",.when I Iay my vengeance upon you,`'

1332
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,036
I`ve been saying that shit for years.

1333
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:30,232
If you heard it, that meant your ass,

1334
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:34,876
I never gave much thought
to what it meant,

1335
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:38,470
I thought it was some shit to say
before I popped a cap in a guy's ass,

1336
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,671
But this morning I thought twice,

1337
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:49,037
Maybe it means that you`re the evil
man and I'm the righteous man,

1338
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:55,191
This gun is the shepherd protecting
my ass in the valley of darkness.

1339
02:21:55,880 --> 02:22:00,874
Or it could mean that you're the
righteous man and I'm the shepherd,

1340
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:04,112
It's the world
that's evil and selfish,

1341
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:08,869
I'd like that,
but that shit ain't the truth.

1342
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:14,592
The truth is that you're the weak,.,

1343
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:19,197
.,and I am the tyranny of evil men,

1344
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:27,957
But I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying
real hard to be the shepherd,

1345
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:45,199
Go.

1346
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:06,799
- I think we should be Ieaving now.
- That`s probably a good idea,
