the world each night,

719
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:02,427
searching for children

720
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:04,632
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

721
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,737
- Not just any children...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

722
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:09,574
Let me guess.

723
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,677
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen to their parents or...

724
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:13,575
Wrong, Patty. (SCOFFS)

725
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:16,314
It's the good kids he wants.

726
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,647
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

727
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:23,585
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

728
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,806
he won't rest
until he has them

729
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:29,093
slung over his bony shoulder.

730
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:31,494
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

731
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:37,684
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

732
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:39,002
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

733
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:40,236
<i>And scared you better be!</i>

734
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,501
<i>Wander too close,
he'll drag you in</i>

735
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:43,271
<i>and make pencils
out of your fingers,</i>

736
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:44,705
and gobble
the rest of you down!

737
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:48,676
Are you with me, boy?

738
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,520
<i>Good.</i>

KARINA: Bagman?

740
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:22,710
You drew these?

741
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:26,783
Yep.

742
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:40,768
BARBARA: That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

743
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,632
Pat's was so intense,

744
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:46,201
I felt it was crucial
to give him

745
00:53:46,202 --> 00:53:48,601
as much context as possible

746
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,969
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

747
00:53:57,251 --> 00:54:01,287
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

748
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:05,324
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

749
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:09,227
Curiously, his methodology,

750
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:11,759
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

751
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,093
are remarkably consistent.

752
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:17,694
He has the power to paralyze

753
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:20,467
and incapacitate
parents and adults

754
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:23,240
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

755
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:26,439
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

756
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,744
It sustains him, nourishes him.

757
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:34,946
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

758
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:38,421
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

759
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:41,789
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

760
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:44,256
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

761
00:54:44,257 --> 00:54:45,758
On the contrary.

762
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,179
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

763
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,600
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

764
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:56,173
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

765
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:58,744
you're projecting
the supernatural

766
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:00,439
onto something...

767
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,727
- all too painfully real.

with the real stuff

769
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,387

770
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,683
the anger,

771
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:14,587

and violation,

772

and nightmares

773

when he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

783
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,981

for a room at the Hyatt.

with you and Liam at the mine?

cut off a lock of my hair.

we ran home screaming.

A lock of your hair?

812
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:15,842
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

813

one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

814

What the hell for?

816

where to find you.

No matter where
you try to run or hide.

818

Your father was something else.

819

I think in his own way
he was just trying to protect me.

820

A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

821
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,591
All I remember
was Mom was furious

822
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,311
'cause every night
I was convinced

823
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:49,581
he was tapping on my window.

824
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,612
And then one night,

825
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,982
the old man came in
and he said,

826
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:00,823
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing as Bagman."

827

But I'm afraid
I can't do that.

828

What I can do...

829
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:14,771
is tell you a secret
he don't want you to know.

830

no matter how big, or fast,
or sneaky he is,

832
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,011
he has weaknesses as well.

833
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:28,521
Escape his grasp long enough,
he'll rot away.

skinny finger on you.

that means more to them
than anything else in the world.

839
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:51,104
Something they love so much,

840
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:55,614
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

841
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,913
And believe you me,

842
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:00,047
a child's love...

843
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:03,585
can be a magical thing.

844
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:05,822

the humblest object...

845
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:08,759
into a totem...
