1
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,945
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:36,491
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,952
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,372
Speak!

5
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,125
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,255
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,133
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,303
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,891
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:06,104
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,483
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:16,531
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:20,660
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,705
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,791
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,335
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,338
Snow White!

18
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,624
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,419
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:16,215
<i>We are standing
by a wishing well</i>

21
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,344
<i>Make a wish into the well</i>

22
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,055
<i>That's all you have to do</i>

23
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,225
<i>And if you hear it echoing</i>

24
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,729
<i>Your wish will soon come true</i>

25
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:34,567
<i>- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing</i>

26
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,403
<i>For the one I love</i>

27
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,865
<i>- To find me
- To find me</i>

28
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,576
<i>- Today
- Today</i>

29
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,246
<i>- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping</i>

30
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,416
<i>And I'm dreaming of</i>

31
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,795
<i>- The nice things
- The nice things</i>

32
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,756
<i>- He'll say
- He'll say</i>

33
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,564
<i>- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing</i>

34
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,442
<i>For the one I love</i>

35
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,946
<i>- To find me
- To find me</i>

36
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,783
<i>- Today
- Today</i>

37
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,452
- Oh!
- Hello.

38
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,621
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,791
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,418
Don't run away.

41
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,130
<i>Now that I've found you</i>

42
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42,510
<i>Hear what I have to say</i>

43
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,013
<i>One song</i>

44
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,684
<i>I have but one song</i>

45
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:55,147
<i>One song only for you</i>

46
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:03,281
<i>One heart tenderly beating</i>

47
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,201
<i>Ever entreating</i>

48
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:11,706
<i>Constant and true</i>

49
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,293
<i>One love</i>

50
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:19,171
<i>That has possessed me</i>

51
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,675
<i>One love</i>

52
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,346
<i>Thrilling me through</i>

53
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,850
<i>One song</i>

54
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:35,229
<i>My heart keeps singing</i>

55
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,858
<i>Of one love</i>

56
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:44,864
<i>Only for you</i>

57
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,881
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,217
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,845
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,056
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,935
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,395
you will kill her!

63
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,023
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,608
Silence!

65
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:24,904
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,532
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,702
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,455
you do not fail,

69
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,752
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,264
<i>One song,
I have but one song</i>

71
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,990
Hello there.

72
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,950
What's the matter?

73
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,744
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,414
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,958
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,424
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,926
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,137
That's better.

79
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,682
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,519
There they are!

81
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,273
Can you fly?

82
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,152
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,287
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:01,375
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,252
I don't understand!

86
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,963
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,340
- But, but who?
- The Queen.

88
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,467
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,969
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,056
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,018
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,230
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,266
Oh!

94
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,439
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,192
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,780
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,326
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,120
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,790
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,212
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,799
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,791
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

103
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,294
<i>Life is just like a bright, sunny day</i>

104
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:35,714
<i>Your cares fade away</i>

105
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,384
<i>And your heart is young</i>

106
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,724
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

107
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,311
<i>All the world seems to waken anew</i>

108
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,564
<i>Rejoicing with you</i>

109
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,901
<i>As the song is sung</i>

110
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,571
<i>There's no use in grumbling</i>

111
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,243
<i>When raindrops come tumbling</i>

112
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,872
<i>Remember you're the one</i>

113
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:14,878
<i>Who can fill the world with sunshine</i>

114
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,590
<i>When you smile and you sing</i>

115
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,429
<i>Everything is in tune and it's spring</i>

116
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,848
<i>And life flows along</i>

117
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:32,104
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

118
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,695
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,156
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,075
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,413
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,250
I can't sleep
in the ground like you

123
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,253
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,924
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,595
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,221
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,016
You do?

128
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,519
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,525
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,070
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,919
I like it here.

132
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,684
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,363
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,410
Hello?

135
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,537
May I come in?

136
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,458
Shh!

137
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,645
Oh!

138
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,151
What a cute little chair!

139
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,239
Why, there's seven little chairs!

140
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,825
Must be seven little children.

141
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,455
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

142
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,461
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

143
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,509
And a shoe!

144
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,558
And just look at that fireplace.

145
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,519
It's covered with dust.

146
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,320
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

147
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,281
My, my, my!

148
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,617
What a pile of dirty dishes!

149
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,330
And just look at that broom!

150
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,961
Why, they've never swept this room.

151
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,421
You'd think their mother would…

152
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,967
Maybe they have no mother.

153
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,886
Then they're orphans.

154
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,347
That's too bad.

155
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,183
I know!

156
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,811
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

157
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,854
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

158
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,989
Now, you wash the dishes.

159
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,324
You tidy up the room.

160
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,286
You clean the fireplace.

161
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,371
And I will use the broom.

162
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,755
<i>Just whistle while you work</i>

163
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,887
<i>And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place</i>

164
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,098
<i>So hum a merry tune</i>

165
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:25,230
<i>It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace</i>

166
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,566
<i>And as you sweep the room</i>

167
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,776
<i>Imagine that the broom</i>

168
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,073
<i>Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune</i>

169
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,036
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

170
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,580
<i>When hearts are high the time will fly</i>

171
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,915
<i>So whistle while you work</i>

172
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,383
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

173
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,260
Not under the rug.

174
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,142
<i>So whistle while you work</i>

175
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,503
<i>We dig, dig, dig,
dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

176
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,755
<i>In our mine the whole day through</i>

177
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,468
<i>To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do</i>

178
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,720
<i>It ain't no trick to get rich quick</i>

179
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,014
<i>If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick</i>

180
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,433
<i>- In a mine
- In a mine</i>

181
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,769
<i>- In a mine
- In a mine</i>

182
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:55,440
<i>- Where a million diamonds
- Shine</i>

183
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,566
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

184
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:58,944
<i>From early morn 'til night</i>

185
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight</i>

186
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,285
<i>We dig up diamonds by the score</i>

187
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,496
<i>A thousand rubies
Sometimes more</i>

188
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,832
<i>Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for</i>

189
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,167
<i>We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig</i>

190
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,991
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

191
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,619
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

192
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,247
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

193
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,749
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

194
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:59,170
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

195
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,259
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

196
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,929
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

197
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,351
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

198
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,488
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

199
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:29,868
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho, hum</i>

200
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:34,748
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

201
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,210
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

202
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,548
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

203
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,553
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

204
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:53,183
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

205
00:23:55,518 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho…</i>

206
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,622
Let's see what's upstairs.

207
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,439
Oh, what adorable little beds!

208
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,736
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

209
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,781
Doc, Happy,

210
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,282
Sneezy, Dopey…

211
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,411
What funny names
for children!

212
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:58,206
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

213
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,210
I'm a little sleepy myself.

214
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,552
Oh! Oh!

215
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:36,286
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

216
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:41,458
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

217
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:46,546
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

218
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,176
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

219
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,972
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

220
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,903
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho</i>

221
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:14,616
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

222
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,245
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

223
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:23,833
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

224
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,921
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh…</i>

225
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,172
Look!

226
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,177
Our house! The lit's light…
Uh, the light's lit.

227
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,684
Jiminy Crickets!

228
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,270
- The door is open.
- The chimney's smoking.

229
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,855
- Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

230
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,524
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

231
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,025
Or a dragon.

232
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,570
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

233
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:56,074
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

234
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,868
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

235
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,995
- What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

236
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,832
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up… Sneak up.

237
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,376
Come on, hen… Uh, men. Follow me.

238
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,687
Psst!

239
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,752
Shh!

240
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,548
Shh!

241
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,635
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny…

242
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,096
Hook and granny…
Crooked fan…

243
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,931
Search everywhere.

244
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,660
Shh!

245
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:23,995
Quiet.

246
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,294
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

247
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,506
Hah!

248
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,467
Chair's been dusted!

249
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,303
Our window's been washed.

250
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,181
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

251
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,476
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

252
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,354
There's dirty work afoot.

253
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,482
Sink's empty.

254
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,485
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

255
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,197
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

256
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,284
My cup's been washed.

257
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,620
Sugar's gone.

258
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,332
Something's cooking.

259
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,502
Smells good!

260
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,672
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

261
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,053
See? It's witches' brew.

262
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,516
Look what's happened
to our stable… Uh, table.

263
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,226
Flowers!

264
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,980
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.

265
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:35,692
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

266
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:39,862
You know I can't stand it.
I can't… I can't… I… Oh.

267
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:41,322
Ah…

268
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,532
Ahhh…

269
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,413
Thanks!

270
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,713
Hey!

271
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,884
Shh!

272
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:06,389
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

273
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,225
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

274
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,770
When you gotta, you gotta.
I… I… I gotta.

275
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,356
It's coming.

276
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,652
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

277
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,696
Oh! Ah… Ah… Ah!

278
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,823
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

279
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,283
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

280
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,826
Make a hard knot.

281
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,995
There, that will hold him.

282
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,081
- Thanks!
- Shh!

283
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:35,418
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

284
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,926
- What's that?
- That's it.

285
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:47,764
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

286
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:13,623
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

287
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,961
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

288
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,172
Up. Down.

289
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,150
Here, take it.

290
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,153
Don't be nervous.

291
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,840
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

292
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,050
Yes! Right behind ya.

293
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,218
Here it comes!

294
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,397
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

295
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,065
Hold it shut.

296
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,287
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

297
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,497
Get it now!

298
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,873
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

299
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,958
Don't let it get away!

300
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,048
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

301
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,966
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

302
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,594
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

303
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,888
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

304
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,598
What was it doin'?

305
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,314
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

306
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,358
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

307
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,484
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

308
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,945
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

309
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,571
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

310
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,406
We'll kill it dead.

311
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,227
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

312
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,145
- Gee!
- What a monster!

313
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,772
It covers three beds.

314
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,483
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

315
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,193
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!

316
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,611
Shh!

317
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,348
Well, eh, ah…

318
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,853
- What is it?
- Why, it… It's a girl!

319
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,690
She's mighty purdy.

320
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:12,361
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

321
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,865
Angel, hah! She's a female!

322
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,869
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

323
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,039
What are wicked wiles?

324
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,333
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

325
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,584
Shh!

326
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,794
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

327
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,214
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

328
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,758
- Look out.
- She's movin'.

329
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,926
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

330
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,386
Hide.

331
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,392
Oh, dear.

332
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,563
I wonder if the children are…

333
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,567
Oh!

334
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,910
Why, why, you're little men!

335
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,250
How do you do?

336
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:16,425
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

337
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,804
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

338
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,557
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

339
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,560
I know, you're Doc.

340
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:30,439
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.

341
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:34,443
And you're, you're Bashful.

342
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,947
Oh, gosh!

343
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,827
And you, you're Sleepy.

344
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,620
How'd you guess?

345
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,958
And you?

346
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,712
And you're Sneezy.

347
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,637
- Yes, and you must be…
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

348
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,389
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

349
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,267
You mean he can't talk?

350
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
He don't know. He never tried.

351
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,813
Oh, that's too bad.

352
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,444
Oh!

353
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,279
You must be Grumpy.

354
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,449
Oh, yes! Yes!

355
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,827
Hah! We know who we are.

356
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,621
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

357
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:31,041
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

358
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,253
What are you… Who are you, my dear?

359
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,922
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

360
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,716
- Snow White?
- The Princess?

361
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,884
Yes.

362
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:44,555
Well… Well, my,
my dear Quincess… Uh, Princess.

363
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,099
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're…

364
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:50,227
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

365
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:54,064
We're bad as cornets…
No, no, as bad as… What was I sayin'?

366
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,358
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

367
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:59,153
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

368
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:03,032
- Who's… Uh, gutter…
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!

369
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,618
Please don't send me away!

370
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,787
- If you do, she'll kill me.
- Kill you?

371
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,038
- Who will?
- Yes, who?

372
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,123
- My stepmother, the Queen.
- The Queen?

373
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,750
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

374
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,920
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

375
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,588
I'm warnin' ya.

376
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,507
If the Queen finds her here,

377
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,052
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

378
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,721
But she doesn't know where I am!

379
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,724
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

380
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,393
She's full of black magic.

381
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,563
She can even make herself invisible.

382
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,731
Pfft!

383
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,401
Might be in this room right now.

384
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,242
Oh, she'll never find me here.

385
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,870
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

386
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,581
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and…

387
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:53,874
Cook?

388
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,544
Can you make dapple lumpkins…
Uh, lumple dapplins?

389
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:59,171
- Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!

390
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,881
Crapple dumpkins.

391
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,133
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie…

392
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,428
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!

393
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,284
Ah!

394
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,035
Soup!

395
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,579
Hooray!

396
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,596
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

397
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,306
Just a minute.

398
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:55,352
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

399
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,272
Wash? Wash?

400
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:01,942
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

401
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:07,615
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

402
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,700
'Tain't New Year's.

403
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,912
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

404
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,622
Perhaps we…

405
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:19,835
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

406
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:23,380
When? When. Uh, you said whe…

407
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:28,385
Why, last week.
Why, recently!

408
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,640
Yes, recently!

409
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,143
Oh, recently!

410
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,521
Let me see your hands.

411
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,030
Let me see your hands!

412
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:56,705
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

413
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,711
Come on, let's see them.

414
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,924
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

415
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,842
And you?

416
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,515
Worse than I thought!

417
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,225
Oh!

418
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,187
How shocking!

419
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,275
Goodness me, this will never do.

420
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:31,407
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

421
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,064
Hah!

422
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:09,903
Well, aren't you going to wash?

423
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,783
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

424
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:27,629
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?

425
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,643
Hah, women!

426
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,439
Courage, men, courage.

427
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:48,650
Don't be nervous.

428
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,156
Gosh, it's wet!

429
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,826
It's cold, too!

430
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:00,579
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

431
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,499
Well, it'll please the Princess.

432
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,959
I'll take a chance for her!

433
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:07,336
Me, too!

434
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,714
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

435
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,926
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

436
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,220
and they'll walk all over ya!

437
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,807
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

438
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,060
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

439
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,478
Do ya get in the tub?

440
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:27,064
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

441
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:30,317
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

442
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,237
<i>Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace</i>

443
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:36,156
<i>Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place</i>

444
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,409
<i>Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go…</i>

445
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,833
<i>Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff</i>

446
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,335
<i>Work up a lather
And when you got enough</i>

447
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,547
<i>Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go…</i>

448
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:57,427
<i>You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub</i>

449
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,513
<i>You sputter and splash
all over the tub</i>

450
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,267
<i>You may be cold
and wet when you're done</i>

451
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:06,228
<i>But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun</i>

452
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,189
<i>So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick</i>

453
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:12,693
<i>As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick</i>

454
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,696
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going…

455
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,630
Hah! Next thing ya know

456
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,884
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

457
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:41,430
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom."

458
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:42,639
Hah!

459
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:11,251
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

460
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:16,340
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

461
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,790
Get him!

462
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,043
Hey, let go of me!

463
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,754
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

464
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,923
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

465
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,884
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

466
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:03,470
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

467
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:08,350
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get… Don't get up… Don't get…

468
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,856
Get the soap!

469
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:27,536
- Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

470
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,671
Never say die. Never say die.

471
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,256
You don't…

472
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:03,238
<i>Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied</i>

473
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,866
<i>That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried</i>

474
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,952
<i>Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go…</i>

475
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:27,262
Ain't he sweet?

476
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:29,639
Smells like a petunia.

477
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,559
He sure is cute!

478
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,937
You'll pay dearly for this!

479
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,272
Supper!

480
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:41,735
- Supper!
- Food. Hooray!

481
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:46,948
Hah!

482
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,385
Magic Mirror on the wall,

483
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:09,805
who now is the fairest one of all?

484
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,767
Over the seven jeweled hills

485
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,395
beyond the seventh fall,

486
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,980
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

487
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:23,777
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

488
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:28,907
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

489
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,660
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

490
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,163
Behold her heart.

491
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,667
Snow White still lives,

492
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,877
the fairest in the land.

493
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,715
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

494
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,343
The heart of a pig!

495
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,012
Then I've been tricked!

496
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,413
The heart of a pig!

497
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,040
The blundering fool!

498
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,836
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

499
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,839
in a disguise so complete

500
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:29,384
no one will ever suspect.

501
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:36,600
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

502
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:41,062
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

503
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,901
Mummy Dust to make me old.

504
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:50,363
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

505
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:58,872
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

506
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,592
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

507
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,765
A blast of wind

508
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,310
to fan my hate!

509
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,022
A thunderbolt

510
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:28,109
to mix it well.

511
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,154
Now,

512
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:35,283
begin thy magic spell.

513
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,975
Look!

514
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,310
My hands!

515
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,651
My voice!

516
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:12,571
My voice.

517
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:19,953
A perfect disguise.

518
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,001
And now…

519
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,005
A special sort of death

520
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,674
for one so fair.

521
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:35,343
What shall it be?

522
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,053
Ah!

523
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,557
A poisoned apple!

524
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,393
Sleeping Death.

525
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,706
<i>I'd like to dance
and tap my feet</i>

526
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,708
<i>But they won't keep in rhythm</i>

527
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:52,837
<i>You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em</i>

528
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,841
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing</i>

529
00:52:56,925 --> 00:53:00,595
<i>Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?</i>

530
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:13,817
<i>I…</i>

531
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,492
Oh, gosh!

532
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:31,251
<i>I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb</i>

533
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,254
<i>And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him</i>

534
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,467
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing</i>

535
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,470
<i>Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?</i>

536
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:56,461
Watch out. Be ca… Watch… Watch…

537
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:58,546
Watch… Watch…

538
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:02,967
Thanks.

539
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:51,516
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

540
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,476
Hey! Hey!

541
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,111
Hooray!

542
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,902
That was fun!

543
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,737
Now you do something.

544
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,447
Well, what shall I do?

545
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,075
- Tell us a story.
- Yes, tell us a story.

546
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:54,162
- A true story.
- A love story.

547
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:58,249
Well, once there was a princess.

548
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,919
Was the princess you?

549
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:04,088
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

550
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:06,382
Oh, it was very easy.

551
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,719
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

552
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:11,930
The only one for me.

553
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:14,599
Was he strong and handsome?

554
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,434
Was he big and tall?

555
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:20,271
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

556
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,398
Did he say he loved ya?

557
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,525
Did he steal a kiss?

558
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:27,779
<i>He was so romantic</i>

559
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:32,784
<i>I could not resist</i>

560
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:48,049
<i>Some day my prince will come</i>

561
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:53,888
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

562
00:57:54,597 --> 00:58:00,561
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

563
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,941
<i>To be happy forever</i>

564
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:07,151
<i>I know</i>

565
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:10,446
Hah! Mush!

566
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:16,494
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

567
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:22,667
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

568
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:28,339
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

569
00:58:29,424 --> 00:58:34,178
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

570
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,102
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

571
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:45,148
<i>Come true</i>

572
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,746
Oh, my goodness!

573
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:01,748
It's past bedtime.

574
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,833
Go right upstairs to bed.

575
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,463
Wait! Hold on there, men!

576
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:14,552
The, uh, Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

577
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,179
But where will you sleep?

578
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:21,059
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in… in…

579
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:22,310
In a pig's eye!

580
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,563
In a pig's eye… Sty. No, no! I mean…

581
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,357
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

582
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,527
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

583
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,530
Now don't you worry about us.

584
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:39,660
- We'll be all right, ma'am.
- Go right on up now, my dear.

585
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,996
Well, if you insist.

586
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,541
Good night.

587
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,502
Good night, Princess.

588
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:52,465
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

589
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:55,843
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

590
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:58,930
Well, pleasant dreams.

591
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,933
Pleasant dreams.

592
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:08,147
Let go!

593
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,066
- I saw it first!
- Now, men, don't get excited.

594
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:12,485
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

595
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,904
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

596
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,755
Bless the seven little
men who have been so kind to me.

597
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:37,301
And… And may my dreams come true.

598
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,053
Amen.

599
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:43,474
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

600
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,310
Hah! Women!

601
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,652
A fine kettle of fish!

602
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,425
Dip the apple in the brew.

603
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,888
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

604
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:59,610
Look! On the skin!

605
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:03,781
The symbol of what lies within.

606
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:09,120
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

607
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,956
To make her hunger for a bite.

608
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:16,877
Have a bite?

609
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,091
It's not for you.

610
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,468
It's for Snow White.

611
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:28,222
When she breaks the tender peel

612
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:31,058
to taste the apple in my hand,

613
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:34,895
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

614
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,649
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

615
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,070
But wait!

616
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,991
There may be an antidote.

617
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,243
Nothing must be overlooked.

618
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:54,248
Oh, here it is!

619
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:06,844
"Love's First Kiss."

620
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,262
Bah!

621
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,681
No fear of that.

622
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,642
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

623
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:17,271
She'll be buried alive!

624
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,327
Buried alive!

625
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,382
Thirsty?

626
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:46,050
Have a drink!

627
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,779
Now, don't forget, my dear.

628
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:51,532
The… The old Queen's a sly one,

629
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,659
full of witchcraft.

630
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,953
So beware of strangers.

631
01:05:56,454 --> 01:05:59,123
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

632
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,626
See you tonight.

633
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:08,132
Uh, yes. We… Well, c'mon, men.

634
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,305
Be awful careful

635
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:18,142
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I…

636
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,396
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!

637
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:26,400
Hah! Disgustin'!

638
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:30,112
And be sure to watch out…
To wa… To wa…

639
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,739
To wa…

640
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,574
Watch out.

641
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,285
Thanks.

642
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:07,816
Well… All right.

643
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:12,738
But that's the last… Wha…

644
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,325
Oh, go on. Run along.

645
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:20,204
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

646
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,164
<i>It's off to work we go</i>

647
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:25,793
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

648
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:28,003
Good-bye! Good-bye!

649
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:33,926
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

650
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:37,263
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

651
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:02,830
Hah!

652
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:18,887
Good-bye, Grumpy!

653
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:32,860
The little men will be away

654
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:35,487
and she'll be all alone

655
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:39,533
with a harmless old peddler woman.

656
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:45,039
A harmless old peddler woman!

657
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:59,928
<i>Some day
my prince will come</i>

658
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:05,684
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

659
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:10,606
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

660
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:15,778
<i>To be happy forever I know</i>

661
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:23,369
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

662
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:28,290
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

663
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:32,961
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

664
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:38,300
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

665
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:42,971
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

666
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,808
<i>Come true</i>

667
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,984
All alone, my pet?

668
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:59,613
Why, why, yes, I am. But…

669
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:03,325
The, the little men are not here?

670
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:06,412
No, they're not, but…

671
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:07,955
Mmm-hmm.

672
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:11,625
Making pies?

673
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:14,586
Yes, gooseberry pies.

674
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,922
It's apple pies

675
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:20,300
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

676
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:25,681
Pies made from apples like these.

677
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:30,769
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

678
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:34,314
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

679
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,070
Like to try one?

680
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,364
Hmm?

681
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:46,201
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

682
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,545
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

683
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,506
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

684
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:03,218
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

685
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:08,015
There, there. I'm sorry.

686
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,018
Oh! My heart!

687
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:14,062
Oh, my… My poor heart.

688
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:18,025
Take me into the house and let me rest.

689
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:21,236
A drink of water, please.

690
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:53,227
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

691
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:57,564
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go</i>

692
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,902
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

693
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,626
Hey, look!

694
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:26,552
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

695
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,470
Go on! Get outta here!

696
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,644
What ails these crazy birds?

697
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:37,896
They've gone plumb daffy.

698
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,147
Yeah, they've…

699
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:49,741
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

700
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,953
I'll share a secret with you.

701
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,622
This is no ordinary apple.

702
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:58,333
It's a magic wishing apple.

703
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,169
A wishing apple?

704
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:02,629
Yes!

705
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:07,676
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

706
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,762
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

707
01:13:12,014 --> 01:13:13,932
Now, make a wish

708
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:16,351
and take a bite.

709
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,104
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

710
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,856
- 'Tain't natural.
- There's something wrong.

711
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:23,817
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

712
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:27,696
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

713
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,489
- The Queen!
- Snow White!

714
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:31,992
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

715
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:34,536
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

716
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,079
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

717
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:38,373
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

718
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,710
Come on! Giddap!

719
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:53,639
Wait for me! Wait for…

720
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:12,074
There must be something
your little heart desires.

721
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:15,535
Perhaps there's someone you love.

722
01:14:16,161 --> 01:14:18,121
Well, there is someone.

723
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:20,499
I thought so. I thought so!

724
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,462
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

725
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,423
Now, take the apple, dearie,

726
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,092
and make a wish.

727
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:35,013
I wish… I wish…

728
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:37,391
That's it, go on! Go on.

729
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:54,116
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

730
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:58,495
where we will live happily ever after.

731
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,540
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

732
01:15:05,961 --> 01:15:08,213
Don't let the wish grow cold!

733
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:12,968
Oh, I feel strange.

734
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:18,056
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.

735
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:22,436
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.

736
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:36,450
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

737
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:46,960
Hurry, hurry.

738
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,426
There she goes!

739
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,822
After her!

740
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:48,021
I'm trapped! What will I do?

741
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:51,274
The meddling little fools!

742
01:16:56,196 --> 01:17:00,117
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

743
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,954
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

744
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:06,456
Look out!

745
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,836
<i>One song</i>

746
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,588
<i>One song</i>

747
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:23,176
<i>I have but one song</i>

748
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,845
<i>- One song
- One song</i>

749
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:30,684
<i>- Only for you
- For you</i>

750
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:33,770
<i>One heart</i>

751
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:37,524
<i>Tenderly beating</i>

752
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:41,361
<i>Ever entreating</i>

753
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:47,367
<i>- Constant and true
- So true</i>

754
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,787
<i>- One love
- One love</i>

755
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,874
<i>That has possessed me</i>

756
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,461
<i>- One love
- One love</i>

757
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:03,800
<i>- Thrilling me through
- So true</i>

758
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:07,053
<i>- One song
- One song</i>

759
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:11,683
<i>- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing</i>

760
01:20:12,559 --> 01:20:17,063
<i>- Of one love
- One love</i>

761
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:23,570
<i>Only for you…</i>

762
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:55,685
<i>And away
to his castle you'll go</i>

763
01:20:56,770 --> 01:21:01,775
<i>To be happy forever we know</i>

764
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:41,606
Good-bye.

765
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,736
Good-bye, Grumpy.

766
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:48,988
Good-bye.

767
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,997
Oh, Dopey.

768
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,628
Good-bye!

769
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:25,108
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

770
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:30,864
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

771
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:35,118
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

772
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:38,955
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

773
01:22:40,165 --> 01:22:44,127
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

774
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:47,505
<i>Come true!</i>
