1
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,043
Do you think we're close?

2
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,255
They're almost
impossible to find.

3
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,049
No one's ever
captured one alive.

4
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,971
I agreed
to provide security for you...

5
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,682
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

6
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,309
Well, it's worth the wait.

7
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:02,936
Dead specimens show that

8
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:05,188
the peptides
in the spider's venom, they...

9
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:10,277
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

10
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,614
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

11
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,992
like <i>Las Arañas.</i>

12
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:18,618
<i>Las Arañas?</i>

13
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:22,622
The, uh, mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

14
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:23,832
and punish evil men

15
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:26,001
with their black,
poisoned touch?

16
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,253
I like to base my research
in science,

17
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:30,005
not legends, Mr. Sims.

18
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,798
Those powers are wasted here.

19
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:34,301
These little spiders

20
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,595
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

21
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:37,679
It could...

22
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:41,016
- Are you okay?
- No.

23
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,810
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

24
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,022
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

25
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,316
Not when I'm this close.

26
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,612
Perhaps you should rest.

27
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:56,740
I don't have time.

28
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,035
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,120
For the umbrella.

30
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,248
I found it.

31
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,875
I found the spider.

32
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:55,006
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

33
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,800
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,927
Something so small
yet have so much power.

35
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,764
Okay.

36
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:05,809
What are you doing?

37
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,019
I don't...

38
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,187
I don't understand.

39
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,606
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

40
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,025
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

41
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,527
I'm not interested
in helping people.

42
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:18,655
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

43
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,532
My road was
not as clear as yours.

44
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:22,117
We didn't have the same choices.

45
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,493
You're making
the wrong decision.

46
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:24,577
- Give me the spider!
- No.

47
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:25,829
You're making
the wrong decision.

48
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,414
- Give it to me.
- No.

49
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,624
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

50
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:30,917
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

51
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:42,137
No.

52
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,591
Her journey
will not be easy...

53
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,218
but she is strong.

54
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,512
She will come back
when she needs answers.

55
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,138
And when she does...

56
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,308
I will be here for her.

57
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,245
Come on!

58
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,873
Whoa!

59
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,752
Move!

60
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,045
All right! All right!

61
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:44,092
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

62
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,552
Code three.

63
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,846
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

64
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,265
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

65
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,142
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

66
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:53,935
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

67
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,572
Come on.

68
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,459
How you doing back there?

69
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,503
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

70
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,629
I was being shot at.

71
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,923
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

72
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,217
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

73
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:27,886
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

74
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:40,940
Shouldn't you be in school?

75
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,903
Who flips off an ambulance?

76
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,237
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

77
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,739
Jesus.

78
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,366
Kids.

79
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,708
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

80
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,628
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

81
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,838
Mm-mmm, I know how
these things work, Ben.

82
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,256
Oh, do you? How do you know?

83
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,549
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

84
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:09,844
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

85
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,846
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

86
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,431
She's gonna be okay.

87
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,643
Who?

88
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,603
Your patient.

89
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,147
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

90
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:23,733
Um...

91
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,568
You know what,

92
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:27,195
Mr. Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

93
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:29,364
Just take it.

94
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:30,990
Take it.

95
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,575
Just take it.

96
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:35,370
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

97
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,829
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:39,791
I'll take you in
to see her.

99
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,501
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

100
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,877
I'm her stepdaughter.

101
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,545
I think she might prefer...

102
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,173
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

103
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:49,676
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

104
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:51,594
Okay.

105
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:52,679
Come on, buddy.

106
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:54,555
Let's go see Mommy.

107
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:57,433
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

108
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,269
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

109
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,606
What am I supposed
to do with this?

110
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:05,400
Just put it in your pocket

111
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,610
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

112
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,614
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

113
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,618
Ugh, come on.

114
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,913
We both hate family stuff.

115
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,125
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

116
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,710
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

117
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,628
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

118
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,547
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

119
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,798
You know, I might sleep in.

120
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:31,134
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

121
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,260
You don't have a dog.

122
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,845
I might adopt one.

123
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,013
Return the favor.

124
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,974
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

125
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,642
I don't know
what you're talking about.

126
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,020
I was a model foster kid.

127
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,646
I peed outside and everything.

128
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:46,816
So, um...

129
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,487
I kinda met someone.

130
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,239
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,657
What's this one's name?

132
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:00,955
Oh.

133
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:03,166
Serious.

134
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,466
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

135
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,927
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

136
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,806
Oh! "You have
a winning personality."

137
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:20,099
I guess I got yours by mistake.

138
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,310
You're an asshole.

139
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,394
Here.

140
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,773
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

141
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,485
What if I don't wanna know?

142
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:31,778
Well, it's just a cookie.

143
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,076
"You will."

144
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,119
You will what?

145
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,831
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

146
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:46,417
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

147
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,296
It means that
their printer is broken.

148
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:51,589
We can't eat here anymore.

149
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:01,808
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

150
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,146
You think
I can manage both of these?

151
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:08,231
I think so, yeah.

152
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,565
<i>We'll have it
for you tomorrow.</i>

153
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,442
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheck.

154
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,277
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

155
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:14,362
I haven't seen him in a while.

156
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:15,613
Maybe we can work something out.

157
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:17,949
He's not
home right now, actually.

158
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,450
Look,
I'll be back tomorrow.

159
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,244
But no more excuses.

160
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,745
I swear. We'll have it.

161
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,705
All right.

162
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,079
Us strays
need to stick together.

163
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:07,748
{\an8}Somebody's hungry.

164
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,124
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

165
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:39,048
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

166
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,470
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

167
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,223
MVA, three vehicles.

168
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,976
<i>One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.</i>

169
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,769
<i>Copy that.
Sending backup to your location.</i>

170
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:52,937
It won't open.

171
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,231
All right, sir.

172
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,232
We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?

173
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,067
Just don't move.

174
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,944
Hi, sir.

175
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:01,279
Can you tell me your name?

176
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,738
Robert.

177
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:04,907
Robert, I'm Cassie.

178
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:06,951
I'm gonna help you out
today, okay?

179
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,286
You're gonna be all right.

180
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,453
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seatbelt.

181
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,621
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

182
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,248
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

183
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,000
on that side, okay?

184
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,835
Three, two, one.

185
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,046
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

186
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,131
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,925
One, two, three.

188
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:25,052
Okay. You're gonna be okay, sir.

189
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:26,721
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

190
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:29,348
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

191
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,267
- Cassie!
- Ben!

192
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,169
<i>79 over 55.</i>

193
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,670
<i>Dial it back, I'm fine.</i>

194
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,589
<i>You need a real workup
at a real hospital.</i>

195
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,591
<i>No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.</i>

196
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,134
<i>Games!</i>

197
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,802
<i>You guys are ice-cold.</i>

198
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,555
<i>Cassie!</i>

199
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,266
<i>This place has always
been a death trap.</i>

200
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,774
<i>You can't save
all three!</i>

201
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:20,858
<i>...you can use the web</i>

202
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:23,819
<i>to be in more than one place
at the same time.</i>

203
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,739
<i>You are the only one
who can change the future.</i>

204
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:27,990
<i>No!</i>

205
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,075
<i>Cassie!</i>

206
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,534
<i>That's it,
Cassie, breathe!</i>

207
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:31,744
Come on!

208
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,831
You're okay. You're okay.

209
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,043
Did I die?

210
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,169
Yeah.

211
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,672
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

212
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,590
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,094
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

214
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,605
You're not
goin' anywhere.

215
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,190
79 over 55.

216
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,402
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

217
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,112
with a real doctor.

218
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,279
I don't need a doctor.

219
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,323
I trust you.

220
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,493
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

221
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,620
Slightly above that
of a dead fish.

222
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:16,914
Ah!

223
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:20,793
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

224
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,004
Jump back in the water anytime.

225
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,345
You're not
goin' anywhere.

226
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,055
79 over 55.

227
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:36,100
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

228
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,018
with a real doctor.

229
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:40,771
Seriously, Ben,
dial it back.

230
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:41,939
I'm fine.

231
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,860
Wait, wait, wait. I need
to get your oxygen levels.

232
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,069
Again?

233
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,654
What are you talking about?

234
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,156
My O2 is 89.

235
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:53,284
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

236
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:56,662
Oh, you're right.

237
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,584
Are you okay?

238
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,960
What the hell
happened down there?

239
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,044
I'm fine.

240
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:07,673
I just wanna go home
and watch <i>Idol.</i>

241
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,508
Please stay where you are.

242
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:35,636
Wow.

243
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,514
Great apartment.

244
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,877
<i>Where's my spider?
They took my spider.</i>

245
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,888
<i>Who are you?</i>

246
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,211
No!

247
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,433
Bad dream?

248
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,643
It's not a dream.

249
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:08,646
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

250
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,815
Oh, wow,
that's a buzzkill.

251
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,363
The same three faces.

252
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:21,325
Every night, the same vision.

253
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:23,953
It's a curse.

254
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,996
But we all die someday.

255
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,165
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

256
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:30,542
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

257
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:33,545
you'd try to stop them.

258
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:36,256
Okay...

259
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,594
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

260
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,472
of dying over and over again.

261
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:44,890
And I can't escape it.

262
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,977
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

263
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,400
I will find them
and kill them first.

264
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,611
So you know who did it...

265
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:01,073
I mean, will do it?

266
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,285
It's always those three faces.

267
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,581
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

268
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,086
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

269
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,838
Huh.

270
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,507
But as the years pass...

271
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:21,510
there have been
technological advances.

272
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,597
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

273
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,810
The kind of technology
I've heard...

274
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,730
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

275
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,330
What are you doing?

276
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:53,959
How are you poisoning me?

277
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,461
What's your password?

278
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,255
I can't tell you. Oh, please!

279
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,467
Is "please" your password?

280
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:05,888
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

281
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,347
and I'll stop the poison.

282
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:21,445
Q-9-2-0...

283
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:25,282
B-3-7-5.

284
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,580
Oh, God.

285
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,004
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

286
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,381
today was the day
you were going to die.

287
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,230
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

288
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,107
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

289
00:22:58,107 --> 00:22:59,191
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

290
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,275
You know what you're doing.

291
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,819
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

292
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,903
Cassie!

293
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,030
- Hey!
- Hi.

294
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,907
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

295
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,700
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

296
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,245
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

297
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:14,039
Are you pressing the burgers?

298
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,415
I'm releasin' the fat.

299
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,750
That's called flavor, man.

300
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,418
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

301
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:19,795
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

302
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,631
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

303
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:23,757
I could use a beer?

304
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,760
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

305
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,180
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

306
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,432
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

307
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:33,559
That's boring.

308
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,394
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

309
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:36,478
No, there's...

310
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:38,355
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

311
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:39,439
It was cardiac arrest.

312
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,151
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

313
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:44,069
Really?

314
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:46,071
Dead, huh?

315
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:48,740
Did you see a white light or...

316
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,745
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

317
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:56,039
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

318
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,124
- Hey.
- Hey.

319
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,792
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

320
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,127
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

321
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,461
Yeah, they're ruined now.

322
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:02,880
Take that. For you, sir.

323
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:05,674
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:07,676
- We're ready to start.
- What?

325
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,011
What?

326
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:11,221
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

327
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:13,307
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

328
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,058
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

329
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:16,143
Have fun.

330
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:20,898
- ...for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

331
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:23,108
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

332
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,526
Okay. This is crazy.

333
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:25,819
Well,
I couldn't decide, so I got two.

334
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:27,070
Yeah, that's like...

335
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,281
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

336
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,116
Cassie Webb.

337
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,826
Um, thanks for having me.

338
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:36,121
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

339
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:37,748
Nice to meet you.

340
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:40,417
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

341
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,044
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

342
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:44,129
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

343
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,131
Where is it this time?

344
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,716
He's in Mumbai...

345
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,927
Shanghai...
I can't keep track.

346
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:55,557
Never stops
leaping around in there.

347
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:56,642
And always hungry.

348
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,895
Does it have a name? The...

349
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:03,815
We're saving that
for one of the games.

350
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,735
- Games?
- Games!

351
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,657
Games!

352
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:14,826
Okay.

353
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:19,456
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

354
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,668
Chloe, is that you?

355
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:25,671
Yes.

356
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:28,590
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

357
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,384
It was years
before I figured that one out.

358
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,389
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

359
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:37,891
Whose is this?

360
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,561
Oh, it's mine.

361
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:44,648
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

362
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:48,610
Um, well, my mother actually
died, uh, in childbirth.

363
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,781
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

364
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:55,617
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

365
00:25:55,617 --> 00:25:57,286
She died.

366
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,790
Uh, but, um,
I grew up totally healthy.

367
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:04,710
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

368
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:09,298
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

369
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:11,425
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

370
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:14,428
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

371
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:16,430
Okay, so let's, um...

372
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,681
let's move on to the next game.

373
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,935
Uh, guess the name
of Mary's baby.

374
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,437
Oh, yes!

375
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:25,981
Okay, I'll kick things off.

376
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,608
- Sam.
- Nope.

377
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:29,901
Steven.

378
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,903
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

379
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:33,613
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

380
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,077
Baby sausage?

381
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,079
Richard Junior?

382
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,456
Richard wishes.

383
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,250
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

384
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,252
Cassie... what's your guess?

385
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:51,089
Um... Mmm.

386
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:53,258
Um...

387
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:54,843
Do that thing
where you throw it up

388
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:55,927
and catch it on the...

389
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:58,513
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

390
00:26:58,638 --> 00:26:59,639
- Look at that.
- The name is...

391
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,356
Baby sausage?

392
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:10,984
Richard Junior?

393
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:12,277
Richard wishes.

394
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:15,655
Come on,
get your hamburger. Get your...

395
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:17,282
Cassie... what's your guess?

396
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:18,617
Put five dollars down,
let's go.

397
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,369
Wait. We just did this.

398
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,079
Do that thing
where you throw it up

399
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,163
and catch it on the...

400
00:27:25,707 --> 00:27:27,959
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

401
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:31,963
Uh, sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

402
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:33,548
Fire down at the docks.

403
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:34,633
So...

404
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,512
You okay?

405
00:27:38,512 --> 00:27:42,557
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

406
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,684
I got you, man.

407
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,520
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

408
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,230
The ones
who got out, come on. This way.

409
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,356
Get her out.
Come on.

410
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:50,857
Grabbin' a woman
on A-side here.

411
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:53,652
Go. Go. Go.

412
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:54,945
We need
more pressure in the line.

413
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:56,446
Keep pressure
on the leg here, okay?

414
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,658
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

415
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:00,742
Otherwise stable.

416
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,871
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

417
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:10,544
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

418
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:11,753
Let's go. Come on.

419
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,552
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

420
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:19,636
No, it's not safe.

421
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:20,595
The structure's unstable.

422
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:21,555
Hey,
the people are trapped.

423
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:23,473
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

424
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,809
The place is
packed with explosives.

425
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,103
Industrial grade fireworks.

426
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,563
It could blow up any minute.

427
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,693
It could blow up any minute.

428
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:36,486
<i><i>- Cassie!</i>
- It could blow up any minute.

429
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,239
<i>Cassie!

430
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,788
This place has
always been a death trap.

431
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,623
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

432
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:49,708
Otherwise stable.

433
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,877
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.</i>

434
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:55,672
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

435
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:56,756
Let's go. Come on.

436
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,180
I gotta get my guys in there.

437
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,347
The structure's unstable.

438
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:05,557
Hey, the people are trapped.

439
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:07,767
The place is
packed with explosives.

440
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,186
Industrial grade fireworks.

441
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:10,604
This place has
always been a death trap.

442
00:29:10,604 --> 00:29:12,981
Cassie! Cassie.

443
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,733
I need you at the triage.

444
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,359
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

445
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,278
Sir, you're okay.
You're okay.

446
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,071
He's stable. Ready to transport.

447
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,072
Yeah, copy that.

448
00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:21,990
We need every
able body down here.

449
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,074
You're gonna be okay.

450
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:24,784
Stabilize the head while
I get the longboard set up.

451
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,870
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

452
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,121
Copy that.

453
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,372
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

454
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:30,999
Will you let me drive?

455
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,167
What are you talking about?

456
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,128
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

457
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:36,463
Cassie, I need you over here.

458
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,090
Will you just let me drive?

459
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,259
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

460
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:43,970
I don't think
that's what's happening.

461
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,807
Don't let it
mess with your head.

462
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:49,935
Cassie, come on!

463
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,112
<i>This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.</i>

464
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:02,197
<i>Headed back...</i>

465
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,348
O'Neil, come on.

466
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,937
Come on. O'Neil.

467
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,438
Come on!

468
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:38,525
Let's get it!
Come on, let's go!

469
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:40,777
Wake up!

470
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:43,154
O'Neil, come on.

471
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:44,948
<i>Did you see
a white light or...</i>

472
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,324
<i>O'Neil, come on.</i>

473
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,952
<i>Cassie! Cassie!</i>

474
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:53,164
Come on. Come back.

475
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,668
Come on, come on.

476
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,670
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

477
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,797
It's all right. It's okay.

478
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:03,675
It's okay. Okay?

479
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,094
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

480
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:45,717
So, was it worth the trouble?

481
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,260
The scale
of the NSA surveillance

482
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,720
is unprecedented.

483
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,513
They can access everything.

484
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:53,308
There's nowhere to hide.

485
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:54,643
That's the idea.

486
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:56,895
The potential is infinite.

487
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,105
It's intoxicating.

488
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:02,525
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

489
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,153
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

490
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:06,946
It's gonna change everything.

491
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:11,076
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

492
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,161
before they get their powers.

493
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:15,038
This is what
they look like in your visions

494
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,456
as well as you can recollect.

495
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,959
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

496
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,253
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

497
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:25,632
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

498
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,635
Here's what
they should look like now.

499
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:35,141
They're younger than I thought.

500
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,687
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

501
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:41,523
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

502
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:44,275
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

503
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,695
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

504
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:49,364
I will not give up
everything I've built...

505
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:51,074
and have my life cut short.

506
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:55,912
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

507
00:32:55,912 --> 00:32:57,372
go to a museum...

508
00:32:57,372 --> 00:32:58,998
get money from an ATM...

509
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,084
wherever they are
in the world...

510
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:03,378
Find them.

511
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:05,588
I pay you a fortune.

512
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,298
Yeah, I'll find them.

513
00:33:10,677 --> 00:33:12,137
Still no blurriness.

514
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,805
No double vision.

515
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,014
No discoloration at all.

516
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,309
Your eyesight is good,

517
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,145
and all your other vitals
check out.

518
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:23,815
Um, but what about the visions?

519
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:26,818
How am I seeing that stuff?

520
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:29,487
Um, sometimes when
we experience trauma,

521
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,030
it can have a lasting effect.

522
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,949
This isn't trauma.

523
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,743
I knew he was gonna die.

524
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,203
I saw it.

525
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:38,997
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

526
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,540
from your other consultations.

527
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:44,419
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

528
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,962
The scan showed
no abnormalities.

529
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:47,797
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

530
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:49,758
but I don't understand
what's happening.

531
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:52,010
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

532
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,470
Get some rest.

533
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,637
Watch old movies.

534
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:56,347
If you still have concerns,

535
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:58,558
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

536
00:33:58,933 --> 00:33:59,934
But I'm sure

537
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:01,811
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

538
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,108
<i>I am in the presence</i>

539
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:08,860
<i>of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.</i>

540
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,572
<i>And you're going to show me
shadows of things</i>

541
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,866
<i>that have not yet happened
but will happen.</i>

542
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,786
<i>Spirit of the Future,</i>

543
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,996
<i>I fear you more than
any other specter I've seen.</i>

544
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:24,042
<i>But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.</i>

545
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:25,502
<i>I cannot change.</i>

546
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:27,295
<i>Whose funeral
were they talking about?</i>

547
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,385
<i>Hey, Cass, it's me again.
Uh, Ben.</i>

548
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,763
<i>I know you're there.
Just pick up.</i>

549
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:38,515
<i>I ought to be there
this time of day.</i>

550
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:40,391
<i>Okay, well, uh,</i>

551
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:43,102
<i>O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.</i>

552
00:34:43,102 --> 00:34:44,395
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

553
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:47,607
<i>I know it's the last place
you wanna be...</i>

554
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:50,735
<i>but it would help Susan
if you came.</i>

555
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,695
<i>It might help you too.</i>

556
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:54,697
<i>Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

557
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:56,908
<i>Cassie?</i>

558
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,202
<i>Cass?</i>

559
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,794
<i>Before I draw
nearer to that stone,</i>

560
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,128
<i>answer me one question.</i>

561
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:12,006
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be...</i>

562
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:15,635
<i>or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

563
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,428
Hate to break it to you,
Scrooge...

564
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,015
...but you can't
change anything.

565
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:26,229
Ah!

566
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,888
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be?</i>

567
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:03,182
<i>Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

568
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,901
This isn't gonna
change anything.

569
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:37,508
Guess you didn't die after all.

570
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,287
<i>Please keep</i>

571
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:07,747
<i>all personal belongings with you</i>

<i>throughout your trip.</i>

573
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:14,253
Come on, guys.
This way.

574
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,005
Come on. Let's go down the ramp.

575
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:17,590
Yeah, awesome.

576
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,400
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

577
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:39,070
<i>...New Haven now ready.
Track 25. All aboard.</i>

Anya Corazón is now moving
onto the platform.

581
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,869
She's on her own.

582
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:51,958
Julia Cornwall is
on the concourse, also alone.

Shit.

586
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,884
Um, what are the odds of them

587
00:38:01,884 --> 00:38:03,511
all being in the same place
at the same time?

588
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,971
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

589
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,765
<i>There must be something
that connects them.</i>

590
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:08,975
Or...

591
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,644
something that will.

592
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,146
<i>Please keep all belongings</i>

00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:22,405

- Oh, sorry.

- I don't know. Come on.

We don't have
tickets for this train.

Hey, help. Over here.

673
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,454
I've never been so happy
to see cops.

674
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:04,663
You guys
need to call for backup.

675
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:06,749
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

676
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:07,833
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

677
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:08,918
No. You don't understand.

678
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:10,586
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

679
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:11,837
You're safe.

680
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:14,340
Run! Go!

681
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,841
Run!

682
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:22,348
Run! Run!

683
00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:23,766
Go! Go! Go!

684
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:49,458
Come on.

685
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:54,588

00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:55,673
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

This is for you.

689
00:44:57,967 --> 00:44:59,677
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

690
00:45:00,886 --> 00:45:02,513
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

691
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:03,514
That guy was nuts.

692
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:04,807
Do you guys think
he killed those cops?

693
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:06,600
Uh, he could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

694
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,436
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

695
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:09,770
There's not enough
frictional force

696
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,272
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

697
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,356
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

698
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,315
What the hell is going on?

699
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:14,400
...much less the ceiling.

700
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,860
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

701
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,944
so what good is it?

702
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:19,113
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

703
00:45:19,113 --> 00:45:20,739
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

704
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:22,741
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

705
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:23,868
Your voices are, like,

706
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:25,578
drilling in the center
of my skull...

707
00:45:25,578 --> 00:45:26,662
and I need to think.

708
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:35,212
I'm Cassie. Okay?

709
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:36,338
What are your names?

710
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,257
What are your names?

711
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,383
I'm Julia Cornwall.

712
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:41,886
My dad lives here in New York,

713
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:43,220
and my mom lives
back in L.A., but...

714
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,847
We don't need
your whole life story.

715
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:48,934
I'm Anya Corazón.

716
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:50,603
Mattie Franklin.

717
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:52,938
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

718
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:54,023
I'm not... That's not...

719
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:55,566
That's not
what's happening here.

720
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:58,360
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

721
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:00,404
Your parents can handle this.

722
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:02,156
My parents
are on a business trip.

723
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:03,949
Uh, yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

724
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:05,326
Um, my dad
is busy working, so...

725
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:06,285
Oh, my God.

726
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:07,536
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

727
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:08,621
Well, where do
your friends live?

728
00:46:08,621 --> 00:46:09,580
I'll drop you off first.

729
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,498
<i>...are asking</i>

730
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:12,249
<i>for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest</i>

731
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:15,377
<i>seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...</i>

732
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:16,962
<i>at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.</i>

733
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:18,964
That's great. Good.

734
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:22,676
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

735
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:24,803
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

736
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,180
<i>She is also
the same person</i>

737
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,306
<i>police are
seeking to question...</i>

738
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:28,390
<i>in the possible abduction...</i>

739
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,308
She?

740
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:30,476
<i>...of the three
teenage girls.</i>

741
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:33,312
<i>Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.</i>

742
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:34,772
<i>The public has been asked
for any information...</i>

743
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:35,856
What?

744
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,066
<i>...and to keep
an eye out for these girls.</i>

745
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:39,985
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

746
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,111
And he was
crawling on the ceiling.

747
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:42,196
What about that guy?

748
00:46:42,196 --> 00:46:43,781
I mean, you saw. I...

749
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:44,990
No one saw ceiling guy.

750
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,534
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

751
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:48,035
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

752
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,578
I didn't know
what was happening.

753
00:46:49,578 --> 00:46:50,788
Okay, guys.

754
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:53,207
My uncle, Jonah, can totally
help us. I'm gonna call him.

755
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:54,708
You have a phone?

756
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,502
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

757
00:46:56,502 --> 00:46:58,045
No, you can't...

758
00:46:58,045 --> 00:47:00,506
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

759
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:01,799
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

760
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:03,050
What is your problem?

761
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,134
- What do you mean?
- Please.

762
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:05,719
I'm just
trying to help.

763
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:08,305
Okay. Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

764
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:09,807
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

765
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,308
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

766
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:14,144
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

767
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:16,188
because you guys
are the only ones

768
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:17,731
that know
what actually happened.

769
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,654
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

770
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:26,115
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

771
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:28,325
And, um...

772
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:30,744
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

773
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,541
You know...

774
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:39,295
This is still not a kidnapping.

775
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:40,838
Okay?

776
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:43,507
Feels like a kidnapping.

777
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,678
How did they get away?

778
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,888
It's like
they knew I was coming.

779
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:52,474
<i>No hits
at the train station, bus depot,</i>

780
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:53,684
<i>or any of the bridges.</i>

781
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:56,145
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

782
00:47:56,145 --> 00:47:58,397
<i>The police don't have
this technology.</i>

783
00:47:58,397 --> 00:48:01,609
<i>You have access
to every camera in the city.</i>

784
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:02,693
<i>We should be ahead of them.</i>

785
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:06,322
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

786
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:08,282
Use them better.

787
00:48:09,283 --> 00:48:10,784
I've always
wanted to be a Girl Scout.

788
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:11,869
Of course you did.

789
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,705
Anybody else starving?

790
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:16,290
All I have is gum.

791
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:20,502
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

792
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:22,880
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

793
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,131
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

794
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:27,092
Okay, I hope you're
good at, um, catching squirrels.

795
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:30,596
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

796
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:32,681
I told you, I don't know.

797
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:34,058
I've never seen him before.

798
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:35,142
Then how did you know
he was coming?

799
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:36,226
Oh, my God.

800
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:39,021
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

801
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:41,315
I don't know.

802
00:48:41,315 --> 00:48:43,942
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

803
00:48:43,942 --> 00:48:45,986
Stop asking me. Okay?

804
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:48,072
Wait. You're the paramedic.

805
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:50,866
You saved my stepmother,

806
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:52,868
then you were
super awkward about it.

807
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:57,539
That does sound like me.

808
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,750
Wait. I recognize you too.

809
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,043
What?

810
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:03,212
Yeah. You live in my building.

811
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:05,964
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

812
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:08,008
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

813
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:10,636
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

814
00:49:11,053 --> 00:49:12,429
You don't think this is weird?

815
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:14,682
That we both know you?

816
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:15,766
It's honestly, like,

817
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,976
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

818
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:22,606
What?

819
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:26,110
Total stranger.

820
00:49:27,736 --> 00:49:28,737
No.

821
00:49:29,863 --> 00:49:30,989
You flipped me off.

822
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,158
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

823
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:34,952
You guys, this is so freaky.

824
00:49:35,285 --> 00:49:37,204
Who are you? What is going on?

825
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,667
I can see the future.

826
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,128
Kind of.

827
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,135
I mean...

828
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,636
Oh!

829
00:49:52,761 --> 00:49:53,804
What the hell?

830
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:55,889
See? She didn't see that coming.

831
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:57,975
It doesn't work like that.

832
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,227
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

833
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:02,396
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

834
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:04,398
did you see us...

835
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:06,942
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

836
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:10,112
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

837
00:50:10,112 --> 00:50:12,698
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

838
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:14,950
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

839
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:18,495
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

840
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:21,248
So, you're welcome.

841
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,626
How does it work?

842
00:50:27,296 --> 00:50:28,547
It just happens.

843
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:30,507
Can you do it now?

844
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,218
I can't control it.

845
00:50:33,218 --> 00:50:36,263
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

846
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,806
Uh, no, he can't.

847
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:40,726
He was using his hands.

848
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:42,644
Why are you like this?

849
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:45,063
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

850
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:47,024
It was like a spider...

851
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,651
person.

852
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,455
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

853
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:04,750
Where are you going?

854
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,753
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

855
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,547
You can't just leave us here.

856
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:12,800
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

857
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,760
Oh, yeah, sure. Just three
teenagers alone in the woods.

858
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,929
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

859
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:19,139
You are way safer out here.

860
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,852
Just, you know,
be, um, like a Girl Scout girl.

861
00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:25,896
Be that. Just be that.

862
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:28,065
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

863
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:29,149
Cassie.

864
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,237
Can we trust you?

865
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,615
Three hours. Okay?

866
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:39,868
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

867
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:47,501
Seriously. Don't do dumb things.

868
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,130
She was talking to you.

869
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,299
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

870
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:02,724
I know tae kwon do.

871
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:04,393
You?

872
00:52:05,394 --> 00:52:07,563
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

873
00:52:07,563 --> 00:52:08,939
when my parents were divorcing.

874
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:12,317
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

875
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:15,362
- Ha!
- Uh...

876
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,949
That's what I thought.

877
00:53:32,314 --> 00:53:33,774
One second, cat.

878
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:38,278
Come on.

879
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:44,785
Research on Amazonian spiders...

880
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:48,747
peptides, more peptides.

881
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,207
Come on. Where is it?

882
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,002
Ah, spider people.

883
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:56,213
<i>Las Arañas.</i>

884
00:53:57,881 --> 00:53:59,591
Have you ever heard
of <i>Las Arañas?</i>

885
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:02,302
Me neither.

886
00:54:04,596 --> 00:54:07,182
"According to local folklore...

887
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:12,020
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

888
00:54:13,313 --> 00:54:16,942
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

889
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:20,237
"and they can
climb like spiders."

890
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:23,907
Just like ceiling guy.

891
00:54:30,372 --> 00:54:31,873
How would you know...

892
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:35,836
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

893
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,188
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

894
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:07,325
<i>"Las Arañas</i> are said to possess
a sixth sense...

895
00:55:07,868 --> 00:55:10,537
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

896
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:25,719
Oh, my God.

897
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:45,864
Hey, who's got the jerky?

898
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:46,948
You ate it all.

899
00:55:47,532 --> 00:55:49,284
I had, like, three pieces.

900
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:51,495
- Out of five.
- You counted?

901
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,538
You also ate all mine.

902
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,584
- What's this?
- Stop.

903
00:55:57,584 --> 00:55:58,835
Stop. Just...

904
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:00,962
Jeez.

905
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:04,633
Okay, forget jerky.

906
00:56:04,633 --> 00:56:08,011
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

907
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:09,471
Let's just go there
and get real food.

908
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,973
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

909
00:56:11,973 --> 00:56:13,183
She bailed on us.

910
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:15,393
We don't have any money, genius.

911
00:56:15,393 --> 00:56:17,229
Well, I have money, so...

912
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,564
You have money
so we should do what you want?

913
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,274
You got something to say?

914
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,778
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

915
00:56:24,778 --> 00:56:26,446
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

916
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:28,740
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

917
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,742
So sad about Martha Stewart.

918
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:35,539
My parents are in Beijing...

919
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,873
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

920
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:38,875
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

921
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,086
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

922
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:42,546
So...

923
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:43,922
I talk to them on Mondays.

924
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:45,132
So who do you live with?

925
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:47,217
The housekeeper.

926
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:51,054
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

927
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:53,640
I bet you have
your own room at least.

928
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:57,435
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

929
00:56:57,435 --> 00:56:59,771
- What about your mom?
- Uh, she's...

930
00:57:01,356 --> 00:57:02,524
not really around.

931
00:57:02,524 --> 00:57:03,900
She bailed on you?

932
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,070
Right. So, diner?

933
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:10,198
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

934
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:11,283
Yay.

935
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,451
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

936
00:57:16,288 --> 00:57:17,455
Julia, you in?

937
00:57:19,124 --> 00:57:20,417
Hey.

938
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:22,085
We have
to take care of ourselves.

939
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:30,594
Yeah.

940
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:33,930
You're right.

941
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,766
Let's go do this.

942
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:40,437
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

943
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:41,688
I heard that.

944
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:45,817
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

945
00:57:45,817 --> 00:57:47,611
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

946
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,030
Who says we like you now?

947
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,949
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

948
00:57:57,579 --> 00:57:58,705
Shit.

949
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:00,123
Do you think
there's ticks?

950
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,001
Can we walk

951
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:04,711
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

952
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:06,630
You said this was a shortcut.

953
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,840
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

954
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,133
You know
where you're going?

955
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:11,218
Yeah. Actually, I do.

956
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:15,305
Ow! Shit!

957
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:21,561
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

958
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,146
We're in the middle of nowhere.

959
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:24,564
No one's gonna
track us down here.

960
00:58:24,564 --> 00:58:26,358
Just don't make eye contact.

961
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:28,610
I hope
they have cherry pie.

962
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:40,872
Let's sit at the bar.

963
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:48,964
There you go.

964
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:51,466
Here.

965
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:54,135
Should we make a game plan?

966
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:56,346
Eat first, strategize later.

967
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:01,142
Okay. Here you go.

968
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:05,063
Mmm. Keep it coming.

969
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:08,900
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

970
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,443
Absolutely, great idea.

971
00:59:10,443 --> 00:59:11,528
Uh, right after cherry pie.

972
00:59:12,779 --> 00:59:15,115
No. No cherry pie.

973
00:59:16,616 --> 00:59:19,786
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

974
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,540
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

975
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,334
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

976
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,211
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

977
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:29,629
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

978
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,387
We should go over there
and talk to them.

979
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:39,055
Really?

980
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:41,933
No. Uh, we...

981
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,518
Should we? We can't.

982
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,395
Come on. You know you want to.

983
00:59:45,395 --> 00:59:46,479
No.

984
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:49,149
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

985
00:59:49,149 --> 00:59:50,442
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

986
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:51,818
Just hold on a second.

987
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:52,944
What is this?

988
00:59:52,944 --> 00:59:54,029
Do you want the Reuben?

989
00:59:55,322 --> 00:59:57,490
{\an8}It's just
a little confidence boost.

990
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,200
This isn't really my style.

991
01:00:00,827 --> 01:00:02,454
So what? You look cute. Come on.

992
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:04,956
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

993
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:06,666
Okay.

994
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,168
Hi. Hey, guys.

995
01:00:08,168 --> 01:00:09,961
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

996
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:11,338
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

997
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:12,839
We've been
saving these seats for you.

998
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:14,049
Awesome.

999
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,426
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

1000
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:17,510
Nice to meet you too.

1001
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,595
<i>...for your information.</i>

1002
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,388
<i>Can you just
confirm your location?</i>

1003
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:22,849
<i>4 Star Diner.

1004
01:00:22,849 --> 01:00:23,767
Hey.

1005
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:24,726
<i>Church Hill, New Jersey.</i>

1006
01:00:24,726 --> 01:00:26,186
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

1007
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:28,271
<i>Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.</i>

1008
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:30,190
Yeah. Patching you in now.

<i>Go ahead, 2-2-3.</i>

1012
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:47,374
No need to send backup.

1013
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:51,503
These aren't
our missing persons.

1014
01:00:53,213 --> 01:00:54,798
Code four. Repeat.

1015
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:57,258
These are not
our missing persons.

1016
01:01:07,685 --> 01:01:08,812
Girls!

1017
01:01:18,405 --> 01:01:19,406
Girls!

1018
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:25,286
Oh, God damn it.

1019
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:44,305
Girls!

1020
01:01:53,064 --> 01:01:54,649
Let's go. Let's go!

1021
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,860
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1022
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,944
I know you know the words.

1023
01:01:57,944 --> 01:01:58,945
Come on, get up here.

1024
01:01:58,945 --> 01:01:59,946
You should get up there.

1025
01:01:59,946 --> 01:02:01,865
So much
for not attracting attention.

1026
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,668
No. Please. Please, stop.

1027
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:15,253
Don't touch me, okay?

1028
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,588
Can you...

1029
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:18,756
What are you doing?

1030
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:19,966
- What are you...
- What is that?

1031
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:21,384
We have to go.

1032
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:26,181
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:02:29,017 --> 01:02:30,018
Get down!

1034
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:32,979
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

1035
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:34,105
You left us.

1036
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:36,774
I'm so sorry.

1037
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:40,778
Julia!

1038
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:42,238
Julia!

1039
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:44,449
Julia, get back!

1040
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:56,252
Come on!

1041
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:57,462
No! Mattie!

1042
01:02:58,505 --> 01:02:59,589
No.

1043
01:03:46,678 --> 01:03:48,471
<i>This track is going to be huge.</i>

1044
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:50,765
<i>Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.</i>

1045
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:55,645
Let's try that again.

1046
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:08,866
I love this song.

1047
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,371
Guys.

1048
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:16,165
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

1049
01:04:21,296 --> 01:04:22,672
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

1050
01:04:23,715 --> 01:04:25,174
Right. Okay.

1051
01:04:33,975 --> 01:04:35,268
Oh, my God. Come on.

1052
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:40,607
Seriously, dude.

1053
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:52,910
Come on. Let's go.

1054
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,829
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1055
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:55,955
I know you know the words.

1056
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,832
Come on, get up here.

1057
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,209
Hey!

1058
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,544
You should totally
get up there, dog.

1059
01:05:02,337 --> 01:05:03,338
Come on.

1060
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:14,432
Hey!

1061
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:20,480
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

1062
01:05:29,238 --> 01:05:30,907
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

1063
01:05:30,907 --> 01:05:32,450
Leave everything. Run!

1064
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,952
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

1065
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:36,663
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

1066
01:05:36,663 --> 01:05:37,830
Ah!

1067
01:05:55,306 --> 01:05:56,391
God!

1068
01:05:59,185 --> 01:06:00,978
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

1069
01:06:00,978 --> 01:06:03,314
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

1070
01:06:03,314 --> 01:06:05,441
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

1071
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:06,526
and you don't listen!

1072
01:06:06,526 --> 01:06:07,902
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

1073
01:06:07,902 --> 01:06:09,070
Don't even say anything!

1074
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:10,905
God!

1075
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,199
Your futures were almost...

1076
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:15,118
so different.

1077
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,705
You're lucky I saw them.

1078
01:06:18,705 --> 01:06:19,914
I'm so sorry.

1079
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:20,998
Yes.

1080
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:25,086
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

1081
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:28,423
God!

1082
01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:53,865
Amaria, where did they go?

1083
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:55,742
<i>I'm running checks now.</i>

1084
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,745
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

1085
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:00,538
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

1086
01:07:00,913 --> 01:07:02,331
I'm not interested in her.

1087
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:04,667
Focus on finding those girls.

1088
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,127
Cassandra Webb.

1089
01:07:06,919 --> 01:07:08,921
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

1090
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,673
Did you say, "Webb"?

1091
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,468
Uh, yeah. Do you know her?

1092
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:14,969
That's not possible.

1093
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:18,556
Come on.

1094
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:25,313
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

1095
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:29,275
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

1096
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:33,070
But you can see
the future.

1097
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:36,491
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

1098
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:38,409
I don't know
how to control them.

1099
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:40,495
It's useless.

1100
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:42,371
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

1101
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:43,831
Is your hand okay?

1102
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,584
It's fine.

1103
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:52,548
First thing
in the morning,

1104
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:53,674
I'm taking you all home.

1105
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:55,510
Your parents can deal with this.

1106
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,012
No, they can't.

1107
01:07:58,012 --> 01:07:59,055
Ugh.

1108
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:03,309
My mom's in a psych ward.

1109
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:07,438
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

1110
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:10,233
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

1111
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:12,026
and I don't think
that they want me there.

1112
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,240
I wondered if they missed me...

1113
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,159
if I ran away.

1114
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:22,912
Hmm, so you did.

1115
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:24,956
My parents
aren't around either.

1116
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,251
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

1117
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:29,836
I don't think they're gonna

1118
01:08:29,836 --> 01:08:31,254
fly back from China
to deal with this.

1119
01:08:31,254 --> 01:08:33,339
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

1120
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,049
I'm on my own.

1121
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:39,929
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

1122
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:42,932
- go to the police.
- No.

1123
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:49,146
My dad got deported
six months ago.

1124
01:08:50,273 --> 01:08:52,441
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

1125
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:53,985
What about your mom?

1126
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:55,862
My mom died when I was five.

1127
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:57,530
It's just me and my dad.

1128
01:08:58,656 --> 01:09:00,408
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

1129
01:09:00,408 --> 01:09:02,410
So, I've just been
living by myself

1130
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,661
at our apartment since then.

1131
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:04,745
You're on your own?

1132
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,457
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

1133
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:11,878
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

1134
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:17,216
So, I can't go to the police.

1135
01:09:17,216 --> 01:09:18,301
Okay?

1136
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:21,178
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

1137
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,807
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

1138
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:27,226
Or going into the foster system.

1139
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:31,105
Well...

1140
01:09:32,398 --> 01:09:34,984
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

1141
01:09:38,404 --> 01:09:40,489
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

1142
01:09:41,032 --> 01:09:42,033
Right.

1143
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:46,829
Cassie, please help us.

1144
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:11,599
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

1145
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,559
You won't be so lucky next time.

1146
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:15,895
Why are you doing this?

1147
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:18,689
I need to stop them
from killing me.

1148
01:12:19,732 --> 01:12:22,318
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

1149
01:12:22,735 --> 01:12:24,570
In the future,
they become much more.

1150
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:28,866
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

1151
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:32,078
Those girls cannot exist.

1152
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:34,580
How come you get to decide?

1153
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:37,041
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

1154
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:44,465
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

1155
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:47,510
Would I?

1156
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:50,805
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

1157
01:12:50,805 --> 01:12:52,556
The only thing I know is that,

1158
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,850
in the future,
they also have powers.

1159
01:12:56,894 --> 01:13:00,231
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

1160
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:02,566
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

1161
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:05,486
Your mother underestimated me.

1162
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:08,697
The power of the spider.

1163
01:13:09,657 --> 01:13:11,575
Don't make the same mistake.

1164
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:13,160
Tell me where they are!

1165
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:15,079
They don't mean anything to you.

1166
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:18,165
You could just walk away.

1167
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,639
What is this?

1168
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:21,228
Rise and shine.

1169
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:24,273
Okay, so this guy's hands

1170
01:14:24,273 --> 01:14:26,942
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

1171
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:29,570
and it is painful. I was lucky.

1172
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,197
The longer he holds on to you,

1173
01:14:31,197 --> 01:14:33,365
the more poison
gets into your system.

1174
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:34,450
Then what happens?

1175
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:37,203
Then your heart stops.

1176
01:14:38,787 --> 01:14:41,832
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

1177
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:45,544
So you interlock your hands
like this.

1178
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:47,588
You lock your elbows...

1179
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:50,257
and then you place
the heel of your hand

1180
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,593
right on the sternum. Okay?

1181
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:53,677
And then you pump.

1182
01:14:53,677 --> 01:14:56,013
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

1183
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:59,225
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

1184
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:00,935
You ready?

1185
01:15:00,935 --> 01:15:03,145
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

1186
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:06,523
Okay. And when do I stop?

1187
01:15:06,523 --> 01:15:08,359
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

1188
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:10,653
- Oh!
- And if you get tired,

1189
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:12,363
then you need
somebody to take over.

1190
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:14,448
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

1191
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:16,617
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mm-hmm.

1192
01:15:16,617 --> 01:15:19,578
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1193
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:20,663
- Yeah.
- Ready?

1194
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:21,997
- Yep.
- And go.

1195
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:27,419
Great. Nice, Mattie.

1196
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:28,504
Not cool.

1197
01:15:31,257 --> 01:15:33,092
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

1198
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:35,302
Get ready.

1199
01:15:37,429 --> 01:15:40,557
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

1200
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:41,934
Nice job, Anya.

1201
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:46,647
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

1202
01:15:47,564 --> 01:15:48,732
but you're a good teacher.

1203
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:54,863
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

1204
01:15:57,074 --> 01:15:58,367
About my mom.

1205
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:06,458
Wait, so you do know this guy.

1206
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:08,669
My mom did. I think.

1207
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:10,004
That's her.

1208
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:11,380
She's really pretty.

1209
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:17,511
So this is because of you?

1210
01:16:19,888 --> 01:16:22,808
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

1211
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:25,644
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

1212
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:30,482
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

1213
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:32,276
What kind of crazy stuff?

1214
01:16:33,277 --> 01:16:35,654
Climb like spiders.

1215
01:16:37,281 --> 01:16:39,992
So is he one of them?

1216
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:42,411
I need more information.

1217
01:16:46,206 --> 01:16:47,207
You're leaving.

1218
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:53,422
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

1219
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:54,923
How?

1220
01:16:57,926 --> 01:16:59,303
You have to go to Peru.

1221
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:03,766
I'll be gone a week.

1222
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:04,850
I don't wanna leave them,

1223
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,268
but he's out there
looking for them...

1224
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:07,353
and they're relying on me,

1225
01:17:07,353 --> 01:17:08,729
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

1226
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:11,106
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

1227
01:17:11,106 --> 01:17:12,316
while Richard's out of town.

1228
01:17:12,316 --> 01:17:14,526
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

1229
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:18,447
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

1230
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,908
Just be careful, okay?

1231
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:22,242
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1232
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:24,328
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

1233
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:26,246
Okay, well, neither did you.

1234
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,854
You have come back
looking for answers.

1235
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,901
Back?

1236
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:03,070
I promised your mother
I would be here.

1237
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:09,034
My mom thought
<i>Las Arañas</i> were a myth.

1238
01:20:09,034 --> 01:20:10,327
What do you think?

1239
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:13,038
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

1240
01:20:13,038 --> 01:20:14,540
She came here

1241
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,417
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

1242
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:19,545
She thought
she was being protected.

1243
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:20,837
By Ezekiel Sims?

1244
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:22,839
His motives were selfish.

1245
01:20:22,839 --> 01:20:24,716
He used your mom to find us.

1246
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:26,426
But, because
he stole the spider...

1247
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:27,636
he was cursed.

1248
01:20:28,428 --> 01:20:31,348
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1249
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,856
This is where my mom died?

1250
01:20:40,732 --> 01:20:42,359
And where you were born.

1251
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:51,118
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

1252
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:54,246
To see the future clearly...

1253
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:56,540
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

1254
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:57,666
That sounds like literally

1255
01:20:57,666 --> 01:21:00,085
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

1256
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:02,629
You have to go
back to your beginning

1257
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:04,006
and keep going past that.

1258
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:05,132
There are powers

1259
01:21:05,132 --> 01:21:07,384
you don't even know
you're capable of.

1260
01:21:08,552 --> 01:21:11,680
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1261
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:16,560
Do you trust me?

1262
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:20,939
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

1263
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:30,824
<i>You could just walk away.</i>

1264
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:33,410
<i>Your thread did not start
when you were born.</i>

1265
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,580
<i>They're almost
impossible to find.</i>

1266
01:21:37,414 --> 01:21:39,916
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1267
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:41,209
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

1268
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,711
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

1269
01:21:42,711 --> 01:21:44,880
Why did you hate me so much?

1270
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,964
Thank you.

1271
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:47,299
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1272
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:49,718
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

1273
01:21:50,302 --> 01:21:51,470
I found it.

1274
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:52,554
I found the spider.

1275
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,848
Incredible, isn't it?

1276
01:21:56,933 --> 01:21:58,852
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

1277
01:21:58,852 --> 01:21:59,936
Give it to me.

1278
01:21:59,936 --> 01:22:01,021
<i>You're making
the wrong decision.</i>

1279
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:02,773
- You could just walk away.
<i>- No, you're making the wrong...</i>

1280
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:18,038
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

1281
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:21,500
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1282
01:22:23,502 --> 01:22:25,462
Las Arañas
<i>could not stand by.</i>

1283
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:28,173
<i>We tried to save you both.</i>

1284
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:48,026
Her journey
will not be easy...

1285
01:22:48,026 --> 01:22:50,570
...but she is strong.

1286
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:01,790
Your test results came back.

1287
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,958
I'm sorry to tell you

1288
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,627
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

1289
01:23:05,627 --> 01:23:08,714
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

1290
01:23:08,714 --> 01:23:10,507
<i>But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.</i>

1291
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:13,301
Life expectancy varies.

1292
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:15,137
Do you need a tissue?

1293
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:16,930
No. No. I need a cure.

1294
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:19,516
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1295
01:23:19,933 --> 01:23:22,185
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

1296
01:23:22,686 --> 01:23:24,104
<i>It's experimental...</i>

1297
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:26,606
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

1298
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:28,316
That's why you went there?

1299
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:29,818
For me?

1300
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:32,320
I have to advise you against
traveling in your condition.

1301
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,407
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

1302
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:37,325
I know this is hard to accept.

1303
01:23:37,325 --> 01:23:38,910
No, no, I am...

1304
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:42,998
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

1305
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:46,334
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

1306
01:23:55,969 --> 01:23:56,970
You did it.

1307
01:23:58,847 --> 01:23:59,931
You did it.

1308
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:03,310
I never knew I was sick.

1309
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,521
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

1310
01:24:09,441 --> 01:24:11,943
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1311
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,865
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

1312
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:03,203
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1313
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:09,501
I was there.
I was in the room...

1314
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,546
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

1315
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:14,005
<i>You</i> did that.

1316
01:25:14,005 --> 01:25:17,050
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

1317
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:20,136
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

1318
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:23,265
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

1319
01:25:25,016 --> 01:25:27,853
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1320
01:25:27,853 --> 01:25:30,939
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1321
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:32,649
But I can't do what he can do.

1322
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:37,195
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

1323
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:40,240
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

1324
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,659
or the ability
to release poison...

1325
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:47,455
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

1326
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:50,250
Your mind
has infinite potential.

1327
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:53,670
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

1328
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:56,840
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

1329
01:25:57,465 --> 01:26:00,635
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1330
01:26:01,887 --> 01:26:04,306
And when you take on
the responsibility...

1331
01:26:05,473 --> 01:26:07,684
great power will come.

1332
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:26,202
Every day that goes by,

1333
01:26:26,202 --> 01:26:28,622
my appointment with death
gets closer.

1334
01:26:29,956 --> 01:26:31,666
And you still
have found nothing?

1335
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,251
How can she have kept

1336
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:35,462
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1337
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,380
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

1338
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:39,257
scanning CCTV camera.

1339
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:40,342
I have hacked

1340
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:42,177
police and emergency services
frequencies.

1341
01:26:42,177 --> 01:26:44,179
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

1342
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:46,139
including friends and family.

1343
01:26:48,058 --> 01:26:49,100
Still nothing.

1344
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,186
Do you understand?

1345
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:53,563
Huh?

1346
01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:55,774
Those girls cannot exist.

1347
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:57,567
They will try to destroy me,

1348
01:26:57,567 --> 01:27:00,362
as I will you
if you don't find them.

1349
01:27:02,155 --> 01:27:03,573
She can't hide them forever.

1350
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:10,997
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there. Uh...

1351
01:27:10,997 --> 01:27:12,791
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

1352
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,626
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

1353
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:15,710
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

1354
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,920
- after ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

1355
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,088
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

1356
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:19,214
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

1357
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:20,590
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

1358
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:22,217
- is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

1359
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,094
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

1360
01:27:24,094 --> 01:27:26,054
or my water broke.

1361
01:27:28,431 --> 01:27:29,516
Ew!

1362
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:31,142
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

1363
01:27:31,142 --> 01:27:32,978
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

1364
01:27:32,978 --> 01:27:34,062
Richard's not here,

1365
01:27:34,062 --> 01:27:36,856
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

1366
01:27:36,856 --> 01:27:39,317
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

1367
01:27:39,317 --> 01:27:40,944
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay. Uh...

1368
01:27:40,944 --> 01:27:45,073
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for, whoa,

1369
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:46,157
the ambulance.

1370
01:27:46,157 --> 01:27:48,243
The baby is not waiting.

1371
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:50,537
He's coming now. Ow.

1372
01:27:50,537 --> 01:27:51,955
Now.

1373
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:54,457
Uh, like, here?
In the dining room?

1374
01:27:54,457 --> 01:27:57,252
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1375
01:27:57,252 --> 01:27:58,336
Okay. Uh...

1376
01:27:59,129 --> 01:28:00,005
Ah!

1377
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:01,673
Uh, get in the car.

1378
01:28:05,343 --> 01:28:06,344
Keep your head down.

1379
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:11,766
It's gonna be okay.

1380
01:28:13,059 --> 01:28:14,060
Okay. Come on.

1381
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:15,145
Okay, okay.

1382
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:19,107
- Ah!
- Everyone okay?

1383
01:28:19,566 --> 01:28:21,067
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

1384
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:22,652
Seriously?

1385
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:24,487
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1386
01:28:24,487 --> 01:28:25,697
Uh, never mind.

1387
01:28:28,408 --> 01:28:29,576
Ah!

1388
01:28:29,576 --> 01:28:31,578
All right,
let's step on it.

1389
01:28:49,512 --> 01:28:51,347
<i>10-58 in progress. 30-relo-5.</i>

1390
01:28:51,347 --> 01:28:52,432
I might have something.

1391
01:28:52,432 --> 01:28:53,683
<i>Woman in labor.</i>

1392
01:28:54,893 --> 01:28:56,436
<i>20-Edward copy. En route.</i>

1393
01:28:56,436 --> 01:28:57,687
<i>- 13-Edward, go ahead.</i>
<i>- 10-4.</i>

1394
01:28:57,687 --> 01:28:58,813
<i>Possible D&D in progress.</i>

1395
01:29:00,523 --> 01:29:02,358
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

1396
01:29:02,358 --> 01:29:03,443
St. Timothy's.

1397
01:29:03,443 --> 01:29:04,694
Track the route.

1398
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:05,779
Tracking.

1399
01:29:43,817 --> 01:29:44,818
<i>The baby is not waiting.</i>

1400
01:29:44,818 --> 01:29:46,486
<i>...doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...</i>

1401
01:29:46,486 --> 01:29:47,570
<i>Get out,
get out, get out!</i>

1402
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:48,947
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!</i>

1403
01:29:49,322 --> 01:29:50,865
<i>What? What?

1404
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:52,117
<i>Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!</i>

1405
01:29:52,117 --> 01:29:53,201
Shit!

1406
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:06,381
Sorry, guys.

1407
01:30:09,592 --> 01:30:10,593
Hey!

1408
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:16,224
Thank you.

1409
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,189
So the last one was

1410
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:25,900
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

1411
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,861
Uh, so that means

1412
01:30:27,861 --> 01:30:30,864
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

1413
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:34,993
21.6 seconds.

1414
01:30:34,993 --> 01:30:37,245
That's pretty fast.

1415
01:30:37,245 --> 01:30:38,997
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

1416
01:30:38,997 --> 01:30:40,081
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

1417
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,625
<i>He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.</i>

1418
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:45,211
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

1419
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,921
Drive faster.

1420
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:49,382
Let's go.
Let's go, please.

1421
01:30:57,974 --> 01:30:59,517
Hack into traffic control.

1422
01:31:00,518 --> 01:31:01,728
<i>Turn the lights green.</i>

1423
01:31:03,605 --> 01:31:04,939
<i>Amaria, now.</i>

1424
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:06,733
Turning all
traffic lights to green.

1425
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:11,529
Why is no one stopping?
Hey!

1426
01:31:11,529 --> 01:31:12,864
Ben, watch out!

1427
01:31:14,449 --> 01:31:15,742
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

1428
01:31:16,034 --> 01:31:17,160
Whoa, whoa.

1429
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,953
Ben!

1430
01:31:21,831 --> 01:31:22,832
Everyone okay?

1431
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:23,917
Yeah.

1432
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,293
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1433
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:26,377
I'm fine.

1434
01:31:29,547 --> 01:31:30,506
Um...

1435
01:31:31,257 --> 01:31:32,800
What is that?

1436
01:31:36,846 --> 01:31:38,431
Oh, my God, it's him.

1437
01:31:39,182 --> 01:31:40,183
Guys.

1438
01:31:52,862 --> 01:31:54,155
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

1439
01:31:54,155 --> 01:31:55,365
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

1440
01:32:26,813 --> 01:32:27,814
Cassie!

1441
01:32:28,314 --> 01:32:29,899
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

1442
01:32:29,899 --> 01:32:31,442
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

1443
01:32:31,442 --> 01:32:34,737
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

1444
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:37,115
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

1445
01:32:37,115 --> 01:32:38,491
Well, what about you?

1446
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:41,244
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

1447
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:05,518
You're showing off.

1448
01:33:06,644 --> 01:33:07,645
Not yet.

1449
01:33:07,645 --> 01:33:09,939
Uh, I think we lost him.

1450
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:17,238
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

1451
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:19,032
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

1452
01:33:21,576 --> 01:33:23,161
Okay, press "charge."

1453
01:33:23,578 --> 01:33:24,871
Am I having a heart attack?

1454
01:33:25,872 --> 01:33:26,956
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

1455
01:33:26,956 --> 01:33:28,499
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

1456
01:33:28,499 --> 01:33:29,751
Hey, man!

1457
01:33:29,751 --> 01:33:31,461
Okay, get ready.

1458
01:33:33,212 --> 01:33:34,756
Get it close to the ceiling.

1459
01:33:34,756 --> 01:33:36,758
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

1460
01:33:38,217 --> 01:33:39,552
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

1461
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:44,265
Wait. Wait.

1462
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:46,392
Now.

1463
01:33:53,816 --> 01:33:54,984
Sorry.

1464
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:56,194
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1465
01:33:56,194 --> 01:33:57,570
- You okay?
- You okay?

1466
01:34:00,114 --> 01:34:01,199
Okay.

1467
01:34:02,325 --> 01:34:03,534
Now you're showing off.

1468
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,411
Maybe a little.

1469
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:36,317
Now what?

1470
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:38,653
<i>Those girls
cannot exist.</i>

1471
01:34:38,653 --> 01:34:40,238
<i>- ...doesn't look safe.</i>
<i>- It's a death trap.</i>

1472
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:41,531
<i>...infinite potential.</i>

1473
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:43,950
<i>This place has
always been a death trap.</i>

1474
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,326
<i>...packed with explosives.</i>

1475
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:46,619
<i>Get down!</i>

1476
01:34:48,746 --> 01:34:49,747
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1477
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:52,750
<i>Jump! Come on!</i>

1478
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,960
<i>Get in the helicopter.</i>

1479
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:04,679
I have a code 30. PD-36-307.

1480
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:07,682
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

1481
01:35:08,683 --> 01:35:09,684
<i>Copy that.</i>

1482
01:35:10,143 --> 01:35:11,144
Okay.

1483
01:35:15,398 --> 01:35:16,732
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1484
01:35:16,732 --> 01:35:18,234
It's already crazy.

1485
01:35:18,693 --> 01:35:19,902
You didn't bail on us.

1486
01:35:20,736 --> 01:35:21,779
Whatever happens,

1487
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:23,448
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1488
01:35:24,073 --> 01:35:25,533
We'll protect each other.

1489
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:26,659
Yeah, we're in this together.

1490
01:35:27,368 --> 01:35:28,369
Right?

1491
01:35:28,828 --> 01:35:29,829
Yeah.

1492
01:35:30,955 --> 01:35:32,582
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

1493
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:35,626
I know. It's not cool.

1494
01:35:35,626 --> 01:35:37,086
Let's go. Out the back.

1495
01:35:37,086 --> 01:35:38,296
- What?
- Go, go, go.

1496
01:35:49,182 --> 01:35:50,808
This doesn't look safe.

1497
01:35:50,808 --> 01:35:53,811
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1498
01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:55,730
That doesn't <i>sound</i> safe.

1499
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:57,356
It's a death trap.

1500
01:35:58,191 --> 01:35:59,734
And that's a good thing?

1501
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:01,652
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

1502
01:36:03,112 --> 01:36:04,614
No matter what happens...

1503
01:36:04,614 --> 01:36:07,116
we need to work together, okay?

1504
01:36:08,784 --> 01:36:10,745
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

1505
01:36:10,745 --> 01:36:12,622
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1506
01:36:13,456 --> 01:36:14,457
Are we ready?

1507
01:36:19,921 --> 01:36:22,757
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

1508
01:36:22,757 --> 01:36:25,092
Here. Take these.

1509
01:36:25,092 --> 01:36:27,428
Put them in
as many crates as you can.

1510
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:33,434
Okay?

1511
01:36:34,435 --> 01:36:35,811
You two, go that way.

1512
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,605
We need to slow him down.

1513
01:36:37,605 --> 01:36:39,941
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

1514
01:36:45,571 --> 01:36:46,739
I got this one.

1515
01:36:47,365 --> 01:36:48,658
Come on, Julia. Let's go.

1516
01:37:01,379 --> 01:37:02,463
Anya, go.

1517
01:37:06,175 --> 01:37:07,218
Go.

1518
01:37:18,646 --> 01:37:21,190
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

1519
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:28,072
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

1520
01:37:30,575 --> 01:37:31,742
Now!

1521
01:37:35,496 --> 01:37:36,622
Whoa!

1522
01:37:36,622 --> 01:37:37,707
Go! Run!

1523
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,418
Now you're really
showing off.

1524
01:37:40,918 --> 01:37:42,128
Come on, upstairs.

1525
01:37:53,806 --> 01:37:55,057
I knew. I knew she had a plan.

1526
01:37:55,057 --> 01:37:56,142
- Hey!
- Hey!

1527
01:37:56,642 --> 01:37:57,643
- Hey!
- We're here!

1528
01:37:58,102 --> 01:37:59,478
Down here!

1529
01:38:01,147 --> 01:38:03,441
<i>Make your way
to the south side.</i>

1530
01:38:05,901 --> 01:38:06,944
Come on.

1531
01:38:09,905 --> 01:38:11,073
Wait. Get down!

1532
01:38:13,284 --> 01:38:16,203
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

1533
01:38:17,163 --> 01:38:18,414
Anya, stop!

1534
01:38:27,673 --> 01:38:29,759
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

1535
01:38:37,475 --> 01:38:39,268
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

1536
01:38:39,268 --> 01:38:40,770
Get down!

1537
01:38:42,521 --> 01:38:44,357
Go to the ladder. Go!

1538
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,401
Come on, come on!

1539
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:53,366
<i>Use the web.</i>

1540
01:39:06,962 --> 01:39:08,005
Get to the helicopter.

1541
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:10,758
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

1542
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:16,097
<i>It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.</i>

1543
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:17,473
Guys, this way.

1544
01:39:17,473 --> 01:39:19,558
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

1545
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:25,439
Anya, jump.

1546
01:39:26,941 --> 01:39:28,734
Jump now! Julia, get back!

1547
01:39:36,117 --> 01:39:37,118
Julia, get down!

1548
01:39:47,128 --> 01:39:48,170
Ah!

1549
01:39:50,047 --> 01:39:51,048
Oh, God!

1550
01:39:52,133 --> 01:39:53,634
You should
have walked away.

1551
01:39:55,886 --> 01:39:57,012
You can't protect them.

1552
01:39:57,012 --> 01:39:58,097
Cassie!

1553
01:40:03,394 --> 01:40:04,770
Over here, asshole.

1554
01:40:07,273 --> 01:40:08,816
Mattie!

1555
01:40:14,572 --> 01:40:15,823
Ah!

1556
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:20,911
Don't hurt her!

1557
01:40:28,377 --> 01:40:29,503
Anya!

1558
01:40:31,839 --> 01:40:33,674
Cassie!

1559
01:40:51,275 --> 01:40:52,735
You can't save all three.

1560
01:40:55,613 --> 01:40:57,865
<i>And when you take on
the responsibility...</i>

1561
01:40:58,491 --> 01:41:00,284
<i>great power will come.</i>

1562
01:41:06,749 --> 01:41:09,126
Julia, I got you.

1563
01:41:09,126 --> 01:41:10,211
Come on.

1564
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:13,839
Mattie. You're gonna be okay.

1565
01:41:13,839 --> 01:41:15,841
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

1566
01:41:47,498 --> 01:41:49,542
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

1567
01:41:53,128 --> 01:41:54,630
What makes you so sure?

1568
01:42:01,971 --> 01:42:03,973
Come on. Come on, come on.

1569
01:42:03,973 --> 01:42:05,432
You're just like your mother.

1570
01:42:05,432 --> 01:42:07,268
Yes, I am.

1571
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,001
You've been trying
to change your future.

1572
01:42:33,752 --> 01:42:36,005
But the girls
were never your future.

1573
01:42:37,673 --> 01:42:38,716
I was.

1574
01:42:52,771 --> 01:42:54,648
No!

1575
01:43:07,077 --> 01:43:09,121
Uh... Uh!

1576
01:43:17,588 --> 01:43:19,548
No. Cassie!

1577
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:14,603
She's not breathing.

1578
01:44:14,603 --> 01:44:16,271
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

1579
01:44:17,064 --> 01:44:18,065
Beginning compressions.

1580
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:21,610
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

1581
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:22,987
Come on, guys. Come on!

1582
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:26,115
Keep going. We don't stop.

1583
01:44:27,032 --> 01:44:28,033
Come on, Cassie.

1584
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:30,327
I'm getting a little tired.

1585
01:44:30,327 --> 01:44:31,745
Okay. I'm right here.

1586
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:34,248
Cassie, wake up! Please.

1587
01:44:34,248 --> 01:44:36,000
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

1588
01:44:37,835 --> 01:44:39,628
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

1589
01:44:40,337 --> 01:44:42,256
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

1590
01:44:44,008 --> 01:44:45,801
Oh, my God!

1591
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:47,511
Cassie.

1592
01:44:48,846 --> 01:44:50,431
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1593
01:44:50,431 --> 01:44:51,515
Oh, my God. We did it.

1594
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,771
We did it.

1595
01:45:18,876 --> 01:45:19,877
Hi.

1596
01:45:22,337 --> 01:45:23,589
Hello.

1597
01:45:23,589 --> 01:45:24,673
Hi.

1598
01:45:26,967 --> 01:45:28,677
Oh, he's perfect.

1599
01:45:29,553 --> 01:45:30,554
He is.

1600
01:45:31,055 --> 01:45:32,681
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

1601
01:45:40,397 --> 01:45:41,690
We're still here, Cassie.

1602
01:45:42,483 --> 01:45:43,984
Yeah. We're not leaving you.

1603
01:45:44,985 --> 01:45:45,986
I wouldn't be here

1604
01:45:45,986 --> 01:45:47,488
if it weren't
for the three of you.

1605
01:45:48,113 --> 01:45:49,490
Right back at ya.

1606
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,991
Ben said to tell you

1607
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:52,493
that the baby
is doing really well.

1608
01:45:53,285 --> 01:45:54,870
And he's loving being an uncle.

1609
01:45:55,996 --> 01:45:58,999
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1610
01:46:00,084 --> 01:46:01,585
That's what he thinks.

1611
01:46:04,797 --> 01:46:07,132
Are you all immediate family?

1612
01:46:07,591 --> 01:46:08,801
Yes.

1613
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,428
They're all mine.

1614
01:46:18,519 --> 01:46:20,020
Can we get you anything?

1615
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,105
No.

1616
01:46:22,022 --> 01:46:24,108
I have everything I need
right here.

1617
01:46:53,303 --> 01:46:54,763
No.

1618
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:01,562
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

1619
01:47:01,562 --> 01:47:04,815
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

1620
01:47:04,815 --> 01:47:06,525
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

1621
01:47:06,525 --> 01:47:07,901
How'd you know?

1622
01:47:08,652 --> 01:47:09,736
Bless you, Anya.

1623
01:47:09,736 --> 01:47:10,821
What?

1624
01:47:13,365 --> 01:47:14,366
Thank you.

1625
01:47:18,203 --> 01:47:19,204
Mattie!

1626
01:47:19,204 --> 01:47:21,707
What? I told you I'm starving.

1627
01:47:21,707 --> 01:47:23,458
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

1628
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:25,294
...wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

1629
01:47:25,294 --> 01:47:27,171
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1630
01:47:28,463 --> 01:47:29,464
How's your eyesight?

1631
01:47:30,007 --> 01:47:31,675
I can see better
than I ever have.

1632
01:47:31,675 --> 01:47:32,759
Oh, yeah?

1633
01:47:33,385 --> 01:47:35,679
Can you see us in the future?

1634
01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:37,723
Yes.

1635
01:47:38,974 --> 01:47:40,184
I can see you.

1636
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,062
<i>Standing up
for what you believe.</i>

1637
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:50,903
<i>Never giving up.</i>

1638
01:47:56,366 --> 01:47:57,784
<i>Discovering
you were always</i>

1639
01:47:57,784 --> 01:47:59,369
<i>more powerful than you thought.</i>

1640
01:48:01,121 --> 01:48:02,915
Nothing I didn't already know.

1641
01:48:05,626 --> 01:48:07,044
I don't know about you two...

1642
01:48:07,628 --> 01:48:09,838
but that totally
makes sense to me.

1643
01:48:10,422 --> 01:48:12,341
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

1644
01:48:14,927 --> 01:48:16,428
What? I'm being serious.

1645
01:48:20,349 --> 01:48:22,684
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

1646
01:48:31,985 --> 01:48:33,528
<i>Whatever the future holds...</i>

1647
01:48:39,576 --> 01:48:40,786
<i>we'll be ready.</i>

1648
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,957
<i>And you know the best thing
about the future?</i>

1649
01:48:47,084 --> 01:48:49,002
<i>It hasn't happened yet.</i>
