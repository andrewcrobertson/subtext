<I>IF YOU HAD WINGS TO LIFT YOU</I>

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,763
<I>AND THE SECOND STAR YOUR GUIDE,</I>

4
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,936
<I>YOU'D FIND A PLACE WHERE</I>
<I>ALL THE SEASONS FLOURISH SIDE BY SIDE.</I>

5
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:04,524
<I>YET PAST THE SUMMER MEADOW</I>
<I>AND BEYOND THE AUTUMN WOOD,</I>

6
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:10,488
<I>LIES AN ICY LAND OF SECRETS,</I>
<I>A WORLD MISUNDERSTOOD.</I>

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,911
<I>BUT IF YOUR MIND IS OPEN</I>
<I>AND YOUR HEART JUST HAS TO KNOW,</I>

8
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:22,500
<I>YOUR WINGS CAN TAKE YOU FARTHER</I>
<I>THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT YOU'D GO.</I>

9
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,760
<I>WE'LL BE THERE</I>
<I>AT THE FIRST BREATH OF SPRING</I>

10
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,765
<I>WHEN THE BIRDS START TO SING</I>
<I>AND THE GRASS STARTS GROWING</I>

11
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,476
<I>WE'LL BE THERE</I>
<I>IN THE STILL SUMMER HEAT</I>

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,147
<I>WITH THE MEADOW'S GLEAMING GOLD</I>

13
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,483
<I>WE'LL BE THERE</I>
<I>ON THE CRISP AUTUMN DAYS</I>

14
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:51,696
<I>WITH THE LEAVES ALL ABLAZE</I>
<I>IN THE COOL BREEZE BLOWING</I>

15
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,325
<I>WE'LL BE THERE FOR IT ALL EVERY YEAR</I>

16
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,328
<I>AS WE'VE BEEN SINCE DAYS OF OLD</I>

17
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,834
<I>FOR WHAT IF THE WORLD IS WIDER</I>
<I>THAN WE EVER KNEW?</I>

18
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,133
<I>AND THROUGH ALL THE SEASONS</I>
<I>DIDN'T WE DREAM OF SOMETHING MORE?</I>

19
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,929
<I>WHAT IF WE BRAVE THE GREAT UNKNOWN?</I>

20
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:20,391
<I>WHAT IF WE'RE NOT SO ALL ALONE?</I>

21
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:26,564
<I>WHAT IF IT'S YOU I'M SEARCHING FOR?</I>

22
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,485
LOOK SHARP, EVERYONE!

23
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,487
THE SNOWY OWLS WILL SOON BE ARRIVING

24
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,740
TO TAKE THE SNOWFLAKE BASKETS
TO THE WINTER WOODS.

25
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:39,494
LUCINDA, STOP NOODLING
AND START TINKERING.

26
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,000
IS THAT THE LAST LOAD?

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,002
THANKS, CHEESE.

28
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,964
BASKET WEAVING
IS MY FAVORITE THING, BOBBLE.

29
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,883
REALLY? I'M PARTIAL TO MACRAMé.

30
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,718
MORNING, CLANK. MORNING, BOBBLE.

31
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,844
MORNING!

32
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,430
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO FINISH THE SNOWFLAKE BASKETS.

33
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,848
AYE, THAT WILL DO HER.

34
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,684
THANKS!

35
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,269
- CLANKY.
- OH! SORRY.

36
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,146
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MAKE THE BASKETS,

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,649
BUT DON'T GET TO TAKE THEM
TO THE WINTER FAIRIES.

38
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,485
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
GO INTO THE WINTER WOODS?

39
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,864
OH, WE WOULDN'T LAST A DAY IN THAT COLD.

40
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,742
BESIDES, I'M AFRAID OF GLACIERS.

41
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,952
GLACIERS?

42
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,413
THEY'RE KNOWN FOR THEIR STEALTH.

43
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,415
HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ONE.

44
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,833
YOU NEVER DO!

45
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,044
THE SNOWY OWLS!

46
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,048
PLACES, EVERYONE!

47
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,925
CLANK, BOBBLE, GET THAT BASKET UP.

48
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,719
RIGHT! GOT IT, FAIRY MARY!

49
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,970
START THE PULLEY!

50
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,997
OOH! NEWCOMER.

51
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:22,805
WOW.

52
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,891
THE FINAL SHIPMENT ORDER.

53
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:29,353
OH, GOODNESS! THEY NEED
20 MORE BASKETS FOR TOMORROW'S PICKUP.

54
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,164
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER WORLD OVER THERE.

55
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:52,502
WELL DONE, EVERYONE!
THE FIRST SHIPMENT IS HEADED FOR WINTER.

56
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,837
BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DO
FOR TOMORROW'S PICKUP,

57
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,757
SO THIS IS NO TIME TO REST ON YOUR LAURELS.

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,885
LUCINDA, GET OFF YOUR LAUREL
AND GET TO WORK.

59
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,641
LOOK OUT!

60
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,020
RUNAWAY BUNNY!

61
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,818
NO!

62
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,154
- GOT YOU!
- THANKS, TINK.

63
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,656
NO PROBLEM, FAWN.

64
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,201
COME ON, LITTLE GUY.
IT'S STILL A LONG WAY TO THE WINTER WOODS.

65
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,411
OH, YOU'RE TAKING THE ANIMALS TODAY?

66
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,538
TRYING TO.

67
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,498
IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO CROSS THE BORDER,

68
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,834
BUT THIS LITTLE GUY IS A HANDFUL.

69
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,419
HEY, UH, HOW ABOUT IF I HELP?

70
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,423
SLOW DOWN! SLOW DOWN!

71
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,176
- NEED SOME HELP?
- NOPE. DOING FINE.

72
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,970
THAT LOST THING REALLY IS HANDY.

73
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,012
YEAH.

74
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,306
HEEL, HOPPY, HEEL! SLOW DOWN!

75
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,316
WOW.

76
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,112
OH, DON'T BE SCARED, LITTLE FELLOW.

77
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,447
WE'LL LET THE WEASELS GO FIRST.

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,952
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON!

79
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,039
SO, HOW FAR DO WE TAKE THE ANIMALS IN?

80
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,709
- UH, TINK, WE DON'T CROSS THE BORDER.
- HUH?

81
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,210
WE JUST HELP THE ANIMALS CROSS.

82
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:20,381
BUT I THOUGHT ANIMAL FAIRIES
GOT TO CROSS WITH THE ANIMALS.

83
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,383
TINK, IT'S FREEZING OVER THERE.

84
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,344
BESIDES, NO WARM FAIRIES
ARE ALLOWED IN THE WINTER WOODS.

85
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,889
JUST LIKE WINTER FAIRIES
AREN'T ALLOWED OVER HERE.

86
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:30,850
WHO MADE UP THAT RULE?

87
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,728
I THINK IT WAS THE LORD OF WINTER.

88
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,021
WINTER HAS A LORD?

89
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,898
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. YOU READY?

90
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,993
- WOW.
- PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

91
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,830
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

92
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,583
THEY GET THEIR WINTER COATS
TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE COLD.

93
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,629
YOUR TURN. GO ON.

94
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,180
GO ON, NOW. FOLLOW YOUR BROTHERS.

95
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,450
BYE-BYE!

96
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,369
ALL RIGHT, BIG GUY.

97
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,204
OH, NO.

98
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,123
NO HIBERNATING YET.

99
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,667
YOU DO THAT IN WINTER!

100
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,711
COME ON. COME ON!

101
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,256
WAKE UP. WAKE UP.

102
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,925
OH...

103
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,301
COME ON.

104
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,220
WAKE UP.

105
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,097
RISE AND SHINE.

106
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,392
OOH!

107
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,163
OOH!

108
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,933
OH...

109
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,980
TINK!

110
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,149
TINK!

111
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,608
- TINKER BELL!
- WHAT?

112
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:53,159
OH, TINK! I TOLD YOU,
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CROSS.

113
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,746
YOUR WINGS.

114
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,164
I KNOW!

115
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,707
THEY WERE SPARKLING.

116
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,333
THEY'RE FREEZING!

117
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,169
WE'D BETTER GET YOU
TO A HEALING TALENT FAIRY.

118
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,462
- BUT...
- COME ON

119
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,761
MAY I HELP YOU?

120
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,012
HOW MUCH LONGER?

121
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,807
I TOLD YOU,
A RAINBOW COLLISION IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.

122
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,226
BUT THE PURPLE'S STARTING TO ITCH.

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,728
TAKE A SEAT.

124
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,235
OH. SNAPDRAGON, RIGHT?

125
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,361
MMM-HMM.

126
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,363
NOT AN EMERGENCY. PLANT IT OVER THERE.

127
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,406
THANK YOU.

128
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,784
HURRY, GIRLS.
WHAT IF WE'RE TOO LATE?

129
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,370
- OH. SORRY. DO YOU KNOW...
- WINDOW.

130
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,669
UH, UH,UH, UH!

131
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,088
PATIENT'S NAME?

132
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,547
TINKER BELL.

133
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,008
OH, YES. THE BORDER CROSSER. SHE'S...

134
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,551
FROZEN SOLID?

135
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,804
- ROOM TWO.
- OH, MY.

136
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,138
- THANK YOU.
- MMM-HMM.

137
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,932
- THIS WAY!
- COME ON, GIRLS. HURRY.

138
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,433
SHE'S RIGHT OVER HERE.
ROOM TWO.

139
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,851
- THERE SHE IS.
- TINK!

140
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,270
WE GOT HERE AS QUICK AS WE COULD.

141
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,939
WE DID HAVE TO STOP AT RECEPTION.

142
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,233
DID YOU REALLY CROSS?

143
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,068
WELL, DID YOU?

144
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,236
SHH!

145
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,823
- HMM...
- WHOA.

146
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:14,907
SHH!

147
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,951
MMM-HMM.

148
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,038
OKAY. YOU'RE ALL WARMED UP.
LET'S TEST YOUR WINGS.

149
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,248
OH. SURE.

150
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,332
OPEN.

151
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,251
MMM. CLOSE.

152
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,378
AND TRY A LITTLE FLAP.

153
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,421
A FLUTTER.

154
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,757
CAN YOU GIVE ME A FLITTER?

155
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:36,554
OKAY. WELL, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL. YOUR WINGS APPEAR TO BE FINE.

156
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,225
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SPARKLING?

157
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,352
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE LIGHT
REFLECTING OFF THE SNOW.

158
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,436
- BUT“
- YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER

159
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,479
CROSSED THE BORDER.

160
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,190
WINTER IS TOO COLD
FOR OUR WARM FAIRY WINGS.

161
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,277
NOW, TO BE SAFE,
I WANT YOU TO TAKE TWO SUNFLOWER SEEDS

162
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,904
AND COME BACK IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM.

163
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,407
- THANK YOU.
- MMM-HMM.

164
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,284
WE WERE WORRIED, TINK.

165
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,661
OH! YOU ARE SO LUCKY
NOTHING HAPPENED TO YOUR WINGS.

166
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,121
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

167
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,124
BUT SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.
THEY SPARKLED!

168
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,377
BUT YOU HEARD HER. IT WAS JUST THE LIGHT
REFLECTING OFF THE SNOW.

169
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,755
NO, IT WASN'T. THEY ACTUALLY LIT UP.

170
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,384
IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND FIREFLIES.

171
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,095
YOU SAW IT. DIDN'T YOU, FAWN?

172
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,305
NO.

173
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,808
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

174
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,351
WHO... UM...

175
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,936
UH“.NO?

176
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,232
LOOK, YOU GUYS, IT HAPPENED. IT FELT LIKE...

177
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,234
- LIKE...
- LIKE WHAT?

178
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,281
LIKE THE WINTER WOODS WAS CALLING ME.

179
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,325
YOU KNOW?

180
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,372
NOT REALLY.
GET THE DOCTOR.

181
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:50,461
ANIMAL FAIRY BOOKS,
<I>101 USES FOR PIXIE DUST,</I>

182
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,171
<I>BEAUTY AND THE BEES...</I>

183
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,298
THERE'S GOT TO BE A WING BOOK
HERE SOMEWHERE.

184
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,801
<I>RULES FOR RAINBOW RIDING. NO, NOT THAT.</I>

185
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,887
HUH? HEY.

186
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,847
SOMEONE'S BEEN EATING THE BOOKS!

187
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,850
BOOKWORMS.

188
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,186
OH. WHAT'S THIS?

189
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,437
AH!

190
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,272
LIGHT READING.

191
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,192
DUSTOLOGY, WINDOLOGY...

192
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,318
A-HA!

193
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,820
WINGOLOGY. THAT'S GOT TO HAVE IT.

194
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,200
OH!

195
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,623
GOT YOU!

196
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,916
AHEM.

197
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,793
SORRY.

198
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,961
MMM-HMM.

199
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,214
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

200
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,383
WING CARE. WING WASHING. WING TIPS.

201
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,802
"DON'T GET THEM WET."
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

202
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,430
SIZES, SHAPES, FLAPPING, FLUTTERING.

203
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,808
SPARKLING! I KNEW IT!

204
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,142
OH!

205
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,272
SORRY. FOUND IT!

206
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,315
HUH?

207
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,109
OH, NO.

208
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,529
THANKS A LOT.

209
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
HMM.

210
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,993
OKAY.

211
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:08,664
"SPARKLING WINGS.
WHEN A MOST INCREDIBLE...

212
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,041
"...THAT THE SPARKLE... THERE WERE TWO."

213
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,167
HUH?

214
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,795
"THAT THE SPARKLE... THERE WERE TWO."

215
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:19,258
TWO WINGS? TWO FEET?
TWO WHAT?

216
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,595
- PSST.
- OH!

217
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,723
- YES?
- HEY.

218
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,892
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SPARKLING WINGS?

219
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,979
NO. THE BOOKWORM ATE THAT PAGE.

220
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,647
YEAH, I KNOW.

221
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,649
BUT THE KEEPER DOES.

222
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,526
THE KEEPER? WHO'S THE KEEPER?

223
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:43,198
HE WRITES THE BOOKS.
HE IS THE KEEPER OF ALL FAIRY KNOWLEDGE.

224
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,577
THAT'S PERFECT. IS HE HERE?
I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

225
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,582
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO TALK TO HIM. BUT YOU CAN'T.

226
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,334
WHY NOT?

227
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,710
BECAUSE HE'S A WINTER FAIRY.

228
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,881
IN ORDER TO TALK TO HIM, YOU WOULD HAVE
TO GO TO THE WINTER WOODS.

229
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:02,259
AND THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
YOUR WINGS WILL FREEZE AND...

230
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,928
CHAPTER 16.

231
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,099
HMM. THE WINTER WOODS.

232
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,387
HMM.

233
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,523
CAN'T FLY.

234
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:02,861
HURRY, NOW, HURRY!
LET'S FINISH UP. STAND BY WITH THE PULLEY.

235
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:08,242
ALL RIGHT! IT'S THIS SEASON'S FINAL PICKUP,
SO LET'S MAKE IT OUR BEST.

236
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,205
LUCINDA, LET'S LEAVE THE LOAFING
FOR THE BAKING FAIRIES.

237
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,666
- OKAY, CLANKY.
- RIGHT!

238
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,750
OUCH!

239
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,336
SNOWFLAKE RELEASE SYSTEM WORKING!

240
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,840
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BE THE TEST SNOWFLAKE FOR A WHILE.

241
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,174
- TINK?
- HUH?

242
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,176
WE ALREADY CHECKED THAT BASKET.

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,303
RIGHT. UH...

244
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,518
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED ALL COZY?

245
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,979
I'M GOING TO THE WINTER WOODS.

246
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,730
THE WINTER WOODS?

247
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,149
SHH!

248
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,775
THE WINTER WOODS?

249
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,943
PLACES, EVERYONE!

250
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,361
THE SNOWY OWLS. THEY'RE HERE!

251
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,780
START THE PULLEY!

252
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:47,990
BYE!

253
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,327
TINK! WAIT!

254
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,414
YOU CAN'T CROSS THE BORDER, MISS BELL.
YOUR WINGS!

255
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,332
DON'T WORRY. THEY'RE IN MY COAT.

256
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,251
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE...

257
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,629
- THE SPARKLING?
- YES.

258
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,923
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN WINTER
WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS.

259
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,135
CLANK! BOBBLE!
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT BASKET?

260
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,470
WHAT? OH.

261
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,016
TINK?

262
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,851
I JUST HAVE TO DO THIS.

263
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,063
NO, NO. EVERYTHING IS FINE.

264
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:24,026
WE'RE JUST SAD TO SEE IT GO.
PRETTY BASKET.

265
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,070
OH! HONESTLY. LET IT GO!

266
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,665
THAT'S THE NEW ONE.

267
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,751
- UH, NEW ONE?
- MMM-HMM.

268
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,782
EXCELLENT WORK, EVERYONE.
THEY'RE OFF TO THE COLD OF WINTER.

269
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,952
WELL, THAT'S THAT UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

270
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,505
WOW. I MADE IT.

271
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,842
WELCOME BACK.

272
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,760
A WINTER FAIRY.

273
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,179
YOU READY FOR THE DROP-OFF?

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,224
COME ON. YOU DID IT YESTERDAY.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

275
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,185
ALL RIGHT THEN. HERE WE GO.

276
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,666
AH!

277
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,971
LOOK OUT!

278
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,438
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

279
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:11,735
OH, NO.

280
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,505
LORD MILORI.

281
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,051
AND WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

282
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,597
A BIT OF A BUMPY LANDING.
IT'S ONLY HIS SECOND DROP-OFF.

283
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,309
AS LONG AS THE BASKET MADE IT,
I'D SAY HE DID JUST FINE.

284
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,269
HOW WAS THE CROSSING?

285
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,689
FOUR BUNNIES,
TWO WEASELS, AND A MARMOT.

286
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,856
AND THEY ALL CROSSED SAFELY.

287
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,734
YES. I MET UP WITH THEM
ON THE NORTH SIDE.

288
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,363
THE SNOWFLAKES
ARE LOOKING QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

289
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,365
NO TWO ALIKE.

290
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,829
NO, NO,NO.

291
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,997
AMBITIOUS.

292
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,290
HMM.

293
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,211
NOW THAT IS ODD.

294
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,379
OH!

295
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,465
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LEFT
IN THE BASKET BY ACCIDENT.

296
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,634
RETURN THIS TO THE KEEPER.

297
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,760
THE KEEPER.

298
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:23,306
HE CAN SEND IT BACK
TO THE WARM SIDE WITH HIS NEXT DELIVERY.

299
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,242
IT MUST HAVE COME FROM
THE WARM SIDE. IN ONE OF THE BASKETS.

300
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,869
THANKS.

301
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,945
WHOA!

302
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,156
THAT'S THE END OF THAT CHAPTER.

303
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,658
BOY, THAT'S A BEAUTY.

304
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,620
<I>FLORA AND FAUNA OF THE FAIRIES.</I>

305
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:32,125
PUT A PERIOD THERE,
THEN WE ARE PRETTY MUCH DONE.

306
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,129
WAIT. I FORGOT TO NUMBER THE PAGES.

307
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,633
OH! I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START ALL OVER
ON THIS LARGE BOOK.

308
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,134
- KEEPER. KEEPER!
- YES, WHAT...

309
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,637
THE MOST AMAZING THING
HAPPENED. YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE IT.

310
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,305
OKAY, I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

311
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,556
I'VE NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE IT!

312
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,643
MY FRIENDS DIDN'T BELIEVE ME,
BUT HOW COULD THEY BECAUSE IT'S SO...

313
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,229
SLOW DOWN.
I CAN ONLY LISTEN SO FAST.

314
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,564
YESTERDAY,
AT THE BORDER, MY WINGS.

315
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,692
THEY ACTUALLY... THEY LIT UP.

316
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,070
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN!

317
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:03,907
OH...

318
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,827
WELL, I'LL BE A YETI'S UNCLE.

319
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,721
IN ALL MY YEARS.

320
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,897
YOUR WINGS. THEY'RE SPARKLING.

321
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:37,983
LIKE YOURS.

322
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,486
I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THE SPARKLING,

323
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,906
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SPARKLING
WITH MY OWN PEEPERS!

324
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,827
OH, UH, FOLLOW ME.

325
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,126
NOW, STEP THE FOOTSIES ON THE SNOWFLAKE.

326
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,316
JUST PUT YOUR WINGS INTO THE LIGHT.

327
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,418
THE MAINLAND.

328
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,821
OH, NO.

329
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,242
HELLO?

330
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,743
HELLO.

331
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,246
HELLO?

332
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,755
TWO FAIRIES BORN OF THE SAME LAUGH.

333
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,009
SO THAT MEANS...

334
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,510
YOU'RE MY...

335
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,387
SO WE'RE

336
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,515
SISTERS.

337
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,853
YES! AND YOUR WINGS ARE IDENTICAL.

338
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,771
THAT IS WHY THEY SPARKLE.

339
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,741
JINGLES!

340
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,871
AH... OH, BOY.
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

341
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,417
UM, I'M TINKER BELL.

342
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,169
I'M PERIWINKLE.

343
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,212
SO YOU MUST HAVE BEEN AT THE BORDER.

344
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,506
YEAH. I WAS HOPING TO SEE
THE ANIMALS CROSS.

345
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,091
I GUESS I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

346
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,594
ME EITHER.

347
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:54,846
WHAT?

348
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,018
I USUALLY JUST WEAR THEM AT HOME.

349
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,563
- WOW.
- HELLO.

350
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,732
KEEPER, ARE YOU IN?

351
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:07,901
YUMPING YETIS, LORD MILORI!

352
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,402
IF HE SEES YOU, HE'LL SEND YOU BACK.

353
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,738
KEEPER? ARE YOU HERE?

354
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,157
DON'T WORRY.
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

355
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,992
WHERE ARE YOU?

356
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,662
AH. COME BACK LATER!

357
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:20,997
KEEPER?

358
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,333
WHOA, BOY. CAN'T GET THAT ONE BACK.

359
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,959
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

360
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,586
IT'S IMPORTANT.

361
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,631
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

362
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,885
I'M RIGHT HERE, LORD MILORI.

363
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,512
DID YOU RECEIVE THAT WING BOOK?

364
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,430
YOU KNOW, ONCE UPON A TIME,

365
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,767
YOU'D STOP BY JUST TO SAY HELLO
AND HOWDY-DO.

366
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,478
I'M SORRY. HELLO.

367
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,105
HOWDY-DO?

368
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,856
HOWDY-DO.

369
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,070
THIS BOOK HAS ME WORRIED.
WHAT IF A WARM FAIRY BROUGHT IT HERE?

370
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,908
WELL, THAT MIGHT BE NICE,
THEN, MEETING A WARM FAIRY.

371
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,702
ESPECIALLY ONE
WITH SUCH GOOD TASTE IN BOOKS.

372
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,287
IT'S TOO COLD.

373
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,540
MAYBE IF THEY WERE WEARING A COAT,

374
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,583
OR ONE OF THEM LITTLE SWEATER VESTS.

375
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,960
- THEY'RE NICE.
- I'LL REMIND YOU.

376
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,878
CROSSING THE BORDER IS FORBIDDEN.

377
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,630
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IT WASN'T.

378
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:14,467
THE RULE IS THERE TO KEEP THE FAIRIES SAFE.
THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

379
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,510
BUT I...

380
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:20,056
IF A WARM FAIRY COMES HERE,
YOU WILL SEND THEM BACK.

381
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,684
OF COURSE.

382
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,312
THANK YOU.

383
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,281
WELL, YOU HEARD THE LORD MILORI.

384
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,409
HE SAID YOU MUST GO BACK HOME.

385
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,453
OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T SAY WHEN.

386
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,666
NOW, LISTEN, YOU TWO,
IT GETS COLDER AFTER THE DARK,

387
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,961
SO IT'S BEST TO GET TINKER BELL
HOME BEFORE THE FIRST MOONLIGHT.

388
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,588
THANK YOU, DEWEY.

389
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:52,755
DEWEY?

390
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,008
THAT'S HIS REAL NAME.

391
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,468
IT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS CALL ME.

392
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,471
THANK YOU.

393
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,931
DEWEY.

394
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,184
DEWEY.

395
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:08,229
SO, UM, I'M A FROST FAIRY. I FROST THINGS.

396
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,107
- OH. I'M A TINKER. I...
- TINKER THINGS?

397
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,026
YEP. I EVEN MADE THIS COAT.

398
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,861
- OH, I LIKE IT.
- THANKS.

399
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:15,987
YOU'RE WELCOME.

400
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,113
SISTERS.

401
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:21,534
IT'S AMAZING. THE DUST TRAVELS
ALL THE WAY FROM THE PIXIE DUST TREE.

402
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,994
KIND OF LIKE YOU DID.

403
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,205
...TERENCE AND I
BARELY ESCAPED THE PIRATE SHIP!

404
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,290
- IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?
- UH...

405
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,667
SO LIZZY LOVES FAIRIES?

406
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,086
YEAH. SHE EVEN BUILT A FAIRY HOUSE.

407
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,380
THAT'S HOW I MET HER.
YOU SEE, ME AND VIDIA...

408
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,180
YOU COLLECT LOST THINGS, TOO?

409
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,098
I CALL THEM FOUND THINGS.

410
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:48,478
<I>I NEVER KNEW</I>
<I>I LOST YOU TILL I FOUND YOU</I>

411
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:55,902
<I>AND YOU'D NEVER GUESS</I>
<I>HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO ME</I>

412
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:00,740
<I>NOW I WANT TO</I>
<I>THROW MY ARMS AROUND YOU</I>

413
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,285
<I>TELL A THOUSAND TALES</I>
<I>THAT WILL ASTOUND YOU</I>

414
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:09,707
<I>EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU</I>
<I>TELLS ME THIS WAS MEANT TO BE</I>

415
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:14,170
<I>DON'T YOU SEE?</I>
<I>I'M ON YOUR SIDE</I>

416
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,091
<I>LET'S TAKE THIS RIDE</I>

417
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,761
<I>AND TOGETHER WE'RE FACING THE WORLD</I>

418
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:25,223
<I>DOING THINGS NOBODY'S DONE BEFORE</I>

419
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,685
<I>AND THE GREAT DIVIDE</I>

420
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,146
<I>DOESN'T SEEM SO WIDE</I>

421
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,439
<I>ANYMORE</I>

422
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,857
THIS IS THE FROST FOREST.

423
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,651
WOW.

424
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:37,860
THAT'S GLISS.

425
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,824
COME ON, SPIKE. PRACTICE.

426
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,286
OKAY, OKAY. PRACTICING.

427
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,955
AND THAT'S SPIKE. SHE'S A BIT...

428
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,039
WHOA!

429
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,214
- HI.
- SISTERS?

430
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,383
WELL, I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC!

431
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,012
WOW, YOU TWO LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE!

432
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:07,932
I MEAN, EXCEPT FOR YOUR CLOTHES
AND YOUR HAIR AND PERI'S A BIT MORE PALE.

433
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,976
BUT YOUR NOSES ARE VERY SIMILAR.

434
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,896
FORGET THEIR NOSES.
SHE'S A WARM FAIRY. IN WINTER!

435
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:17,233
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE GOT TO SHOW HER AROUND!

436
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,359
OH, OH, OH!

437
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,237
LET'S TAKE HER ICE SLIDING!
COME ON, SPIKE!

438
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,780
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS!

439
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,115
IT SOUNDS FUN.

440
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,160
YEAH. GREAT IDEA.
PUSH THE WARM FAIRY DOWN A HILL OF ICE.

441
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,163
OKAY, WELL, WAIT FOR ME, YOU GUYS.

442
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:35,752
<I>AND IF YOU'LL BE THERE</I>
<I>BESIDE ME WHEN I FALTER</I>

443
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:40,590
<I>THEN WHATEVER COMES I KNOW</I>
<I>WE'LL TAKE IT ALL IN STRIDE</I>

444
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,926
READY, SET, SLIDE!

445
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,183
<I>I'M ON YOUR SIDE</I>

446
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,686
<I>LET'S TAKE THIS RIDE</I>

447
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,774
<I>AND TOGETHER</I>
<I>WE'RE FACING THE WORLD</I>

448
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:01,235
<I>DOING THINGS</I>
<I>NOBODY'S DONE BEFORE</I>

449
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,697
<I>AND THE GREAT DIVIDE</I>

450
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,284
<I>DOESN'T SEEM SO WIDE</I>

451
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:09,369
<I>ANYMORE</I>

452
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,583
UM... I KNOW. FAVORITE STAR?

453
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,751
SECOND STAR

454
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:17,752
- TO THE RIGHT.
- TO THE RIGHT.

455
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,547
OKAY. FAVORITE DRINK?

456
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,049
HOT CHAMOMILE TEA.

457
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,634
ICED CHAMOMILE TEA!

458
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,010
OM

459
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,222
OKAY, MY TURN. HOW ABOUT FAVORITE BUG?

460
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,016
BUG? IT'S TOO COLD FOR BUGS OVER HERE,

461
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,977
BUT IN ONE OF DEWEY'S BOOKS,
I READ ABOUT BUTTERFLIES.

462
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,939
OH, IN BUTTERFLY COVE,
THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THEM.

463
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,316
IT'S IN SUMMER. IT'S RIGHT OVER...

464
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,693
UM... HMM.

465
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,904
I GUESS YOU CAN'T SEE IT FROM HERE.

466
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,241
NO. YOU CAN'T.

467
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,576
WHAT'S IT LIKE OVER THERE?

468
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,661
WARM.

469
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,038
AND THE COLORS? THE SOUNDS?

470
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,165
ALL THE ANIMALS. AND THE FISH.

471
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,667
THEY SWIM IN MELTED ICE, RIGHT?

472
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,876
WATER.

473
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,838
I WISH...

474
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,674
I WISH I COULD GO THERE.

475
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,972
- PERI??
- YEAH?

476
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:19,021
I MADE IT WARMER OVER HERE.
MAYBE I COULD MAKE IT COLDER OVER THERE.

477
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,606
ARE YOU...

478
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,608
ARE YOU SAYING I COULD CROSS?

479
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,528
- YEAH!
- OH, TINK.

480
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,530
YOU COULD SHOW ME YOUR WORLD.

481
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,657
I COULD MEET YOUR FRIENDS.

482
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,284
DO YOU THINK I COULD SEE A BUTTERFLY?

483
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,119
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE.

484
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,204
OH!

485
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,042
UH, TINK?

486
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,214
- I CAN'T FLY!
- TINK!

487
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,217
HOLD ON. HOLD ON!

488
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,220
I'M SLIPPING!

489
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:58,394
THAT'S IT, FIONA. THAT'S IT.

490
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,481
ARE YOU GIRLS ALL RIGHT?

491
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:03,608
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

492
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,236
ARE YOU SURE? NOTHING BROKEN?
NOTHING BRUISED?

493
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,822
NO. WE'RE OKAY.

494
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:12,116
THIS TIME.

495
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,535
LORD MILORI WAS RIGHT.

496
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,206
CROSSING THE BORDER
IS JUST TOO DANGEROUS.

497
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,374
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

498
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,001
I'M SORRY, GIRLS,

499
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:26,714
BUT I'M AFRAID THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT
LIKE YOU HOPED.

500
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,258
WE HAVE TO TAKE TINKER BELL HOME.

501
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,681
LET'S GO, FIONA.

502
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,865
IT'S...

503
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,784
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

504
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,898
I CAN'T WATCH, FIONA.

505
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,570
I PROMISED MYSELF
I WASN'T GOING TO DO THIS.

506
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,573
OKAY. HERE'S THE PLAN.
MEET ME HERE TOMORROW.

507
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,742
OH, THANK GOODNESS. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE REALLY SAYING GOODBYE.

508
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,911
NO! I JUST MET MY SISTER
I NEVER KNEW I HAD

509
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,872
AND I'M GOING TO SAY GOODBYE FOREVER?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

510
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:43,165
SO...

511
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:48,504
CLANK? BOBBLE?

512
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,008
GUYS?

513
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:03,978
OOPSIE.

514
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,063
TINK! YOU'RE BACK!

515
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,692
- YES.
- SORRY!

516
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,111
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE A TROLL.

517
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,195
A TROLL?

518
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,114
I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE USED
THE TROLL STOPPER.

519
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,741
WHAT IF IT WAS A TROLL?

520
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,576
YOU'D BE SAYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

521
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,119
GUYS. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

522
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,537
OH, RIGHT.

523
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,874
- I NEED YOUR HELP.
- IS IT ABOUT A GLACIER?

524
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,878
NO. BUT IT'S KIND OF A SECRET.

525
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,713
I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW.

526
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,345
I'M PRETTY SURE THESE BUTTONS WILL WORK,
BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE OF THEM.

527
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:40,264
AYE, UNLESS WE USE
A COUPLE OF ACORN CAPS.

528
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,891
RIGHT! GOOD IDEA.

529
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,226
WHOO! NOW WHERE IS THAT CLANKY?

530
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,479
OH, YES, I'M RIGHT HERE.

531
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,563
OH!

532
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:51,067
I DIDN'T TELL EVERYBODY.

533
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:55,696
JUST FAWN, RO, SIL, DESS, AND VIDIA.

534
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,116
SO, THERE'S ANOTHER YOU.

535
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,077
- VIDIA!
- YEAH.

536
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,495
I'VE GOT A SISTER.

537
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,455
<I>I TOLD YOU!</I>

538
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,665
BUST MY BONNET.

539
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,625
- AMAZING!
- IT'S FANTASTIC!

540
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,876
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

541
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,002
BUT HOW?

542
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,755
THEY WERE BORN OF THE SAME LAUGH!

543
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,758
TELL THEM, TINK,
WHAT YOU TOLD ME AND BOBBLE.

544
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,427
HER NAME'S PERIWINKLE.

545
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:22,473
SHE'S A FROST FAIRY,
AND SHE'S JUST AMAZING.

546
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,059
I'M MAKING THIS MACHINE
SO SHE CAN COME HERE AND MEET YOU ALL,

547
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,478
AND AFTER THAT
WE'LL GO STRAIGHT TO QUEEN CLARION!

548
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,854
OH...

549
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,565
UM, HAVE YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

550
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:35,236
"HI, QUEEN CLARION. MEET THE WINTER
FAIRY I SMUGGLED OVER THE BORDER."

551
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,696
VIDIA!

552
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,781
WHEN QUEEN CLARION
HEARS HOW WE FOUND EACH OTHER,

553
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,032
AND THAT WE'RE SISTERS,

554
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,951
SHE WILL CHANGE LORD MILORI'S RULE.

555
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,786
OH, OF COURSE SHE WILL.

556
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,538
SHE'D NEVER WANT YOU TO BE APART.

557
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,374
IT'S LIKE YOU FOUND THE PERFECT LOST THING.

558
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,502
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO LOSE HER.

559
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,379
WELL, THEN, LET'S GET TO WORK!

560
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,880
JUST TELL US WHAT TO DO.

561
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:55,923
GREAT!

562
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,717
OKAY. WE NEED TO PLACE
THAT WHEEL RIGHT HERE.

563
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,801
GOT YOU, TINK.

564
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,761
AND LET'S GET THAT PROPPED UP OVER THERE.

565
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,179
I FEEL SO TINKERY.

566
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,764
- CLANK, BOBBLE...
- WAIT, WAIT.

567
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:04,890
FINISH UP THE CHASSIS?

568
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,183
EXACTLY.

569
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,935
- COME ON, CLANKY!
- BOBBLE!

570
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:12,189
PERHAPS YOU AND I ARE BROTHERS!
IT'S POSSIBLE.

571
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,316
WE LOOK ALMOST EXACTLY ALIKE.

572
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,702
ANYONE SEE YOU?

573
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:25,995
NO.

574
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,663
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THIS!

575
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,750
SO, DID YOU BRING IT?

576
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,793
YES.

577
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,045
WATCH THE BRANCH.

578
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,049
CAREFUL. MORE TO THE RIGHT.

579
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:43,387
FOR THE RECORD, WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING
THIS, WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE DOING.

580
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,683
AS ORDERED. ONE BIG BLOCK OF ICE.

581
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,394
COURTESY OF OUR RESIDENT GLACIER FAIRY.

582
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,021
HEY.

583
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,564
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

584
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,857
IT'S PERFECT!

585
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,404
UH, ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S NOT LURING YOU INTO A TRAP?

586
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,084
OH! IT'S ONE OF THOSE...

587
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,961
THINGS WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING?

588
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,838
IT'S A SNOWMAKER!

589
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,883
IT MAKES SNOW!

590
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,762
YEP, THIS IS YOUR TICKET
TO THE WARM SIDE OF PIXIE HOLLOW.

591
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,305
WAIT A SECOND.

592
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,183
THIS IS CRAZY!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS THING WORKS!

593
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,101
OH, IT WORKS, ALL RIGHT.

594
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,229
AYE, WE MADE IT OURSELVES.

595
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,732
OF COURSE YOU DID. JUST WALK AWAY.

596
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,318
HOW DOES IT WORK?

597
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,486
GUYS?

598
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,446
PULL.

599
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,406
MOVE THIS AROUND HERE.

600
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,496
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
STEP ASIDE FOR THIS PART.

601
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,750
HA! THEY'RE SERIOUS.

602
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,103
SNOW!

603
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,521
WOW.

604
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,774
YOU DID IT! YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!

605
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,280
OOH! IT'S COLD.

606
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,116
SO?

607
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,327
HMM.

608
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,037
GO, GO ON.

609
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,789
LIVE IT, MAN.

610
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,463
WHOA!

611
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,176
WELCOME, MISS WINKLE.

612
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,386
THANK YOU.

613
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:51,223
ALL RIGHTY! YOUR TOUR BEGINS
WITH THE AUTUMN FOREST.

614
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:54,518
NEXT IT'S A QUICK STOP
IN SPRINGTIME SQUARE.

615
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,979
AND FINALLY, THE PIXIE DUST TREE,

616
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:59,899
WHICH, AS YOU KNOW,
MAKES ALL FAIRY LIFE POSSIBLE.

617
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:04,069
AYE, THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL BE MEETING
HER MAJESTINESS, THE QUEEN.

618
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,487
THE QUEEN?

619
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,781
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE QUEEN!

620
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,283
SHE'S VERY WISE.

621
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,243
AND IF WE TELL HER WE'RE SISTERS,

622
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,245
SHE'LL CHANGE LORD MILORI'S RULE.

623
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,830
THAT IS SO EXCITING!

624
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,958
SAY HI FOR ME, OR CURTSY,
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO.

625
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,628
- SURE.
- AND BRING ME BACK AN ACORN. A BIG ONE!

626
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,254
- AFTER YOU.
- THANK YOU.

627
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:24,882
BYE!

628
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,469
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GOING TO GET AN ACORN!

629
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,471
FINALLY! THAT IS SO EXCITING!

630
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,020
WOW.

631
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:47,321
<I>JUST WHEN</I>
<I>WE THOUGHT LIFE COULDN'T GET MUCH BETTER</I>

632
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:54,828
<I>A WISH WE NEVER KNEW</I>
<I>WE MADE CAME TRUE</I>

633
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,208
<I>WORLDS THAT WERE APART</I>
<I>HAVE COME TOGETHER</I>

634
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,293
- THERE SHE IS!
- SHE'S SO WINTERY.

635
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,796
<I>WE'LL BE FRIENDS</I>
<I>NO MATTER WHAT THE WEATHER</I>

636
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,130
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

637
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,465
WAIT FOR THE SIGNAL.

638
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:12,554
<I>WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WONDROUS</I>
<I>THINGS THAT WE CAN DO HERE WITH YOU</I>

639
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,099
THAT'S IT. OPERATION PERIWINKLE IN EFFECT.

640
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:23,065
<I>WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE</I>

641
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:28,404
<I>LET'S TAKE THIS RIDE</I>

642
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,868
<I>AND TOGETHER WE'RE FACING THE WORLD</I>

643
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:38,288
<I>DOING THINGS NOBODY'S DONE BEFORE</I>

644
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:42,167
<I>AND THE GREAT DIVIDE</I>

645
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,336
<I>DOESN'T SEEM SO WIDE</I>

646
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,381
BUTTERFLIES!

647
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,011
SURPRISE!

648
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,389
OH! YOUR FRIENDS DID ALL THIS?

649
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,182
THEY WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

650
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:01,395
EVERYONE, THIS IS PERIWINKLE, MY SISTER.

651
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,604
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

652
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,856
- OH, WOW!
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

653
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,860
HELLO. IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU.

654
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:11,488
I AM ROSETTA. THIS IS...

655
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,533
SHE'S A WINTER FAIRY.
SHE'S NOT FROM THE MOON.

656
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:17,870
OH, RIGHT. I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M JUST SO EXCITED!

657
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,747
IT'S GREAT TO MEET ALL OF YOU.

658
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,624
THIS IS SO REMARKABLE!
YOU TWO ARE SISTERS!

659
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,877
YEAH. A LITTLE FAIRY-TO-FAIRY ADVICE.

660
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,297
TINK CAN BE TRICKY
TO GET ALONG WITH AT TIMES.

661
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,174
YEAH. LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

662
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,342
WE CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE OVER HERE!

663
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,178
SO... ARE YOU COLD ENOUGH?

664
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,305
YEAH. IT'S PERFECT.

665
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,599
OM

666
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,100
AW!

667
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,102
OH, I NEARLY FORGOT.

668
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:47,066
THIS IS FOR YOU.
IT'S CALLED A PERIWINKLE. ALSO.

669
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,650
THANK YOU.

670
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,154
I'LL KEEP IT FOREVER.

671
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,534
LOOK AT THAT!

672
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:58,702
IT'S FROST.

673
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:01,789
SHE AND HER FRIENDS PRACTICE
IN THE FROST FOREST. YOU SHOULD SEE IT!

674
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:04,124
OH, YOU SHOULD SEE TINK ON ICE SKATES.

675
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,918
SHE'S A NATURAL.

676
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,045
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAD THAT LOST THING.

677
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,923
- UH, SHE COLLECTS LOST THINGS, TOO?
- YEAH!

678
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,424
YOU GUYS ARE SO ALIKE.

679
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,509
I KNOW.

680
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,512
EVEN OUR WINGS ARE IDENTICAL.
THAT'S WHY THEY SPARKLED.

681
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,763
- LET'S SHOW THEM.
- I DON'T FEEL SO...

682
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,181
OH! PERIWINKLE!

683
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,265
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

684
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,101
I THINK SHE'S GETTING A LITTLE TOO HOT.

685
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,853
MY WINGS, I CAN'T FEEL THEM.

686
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,190
I THINK THEY'RE TOO WARM.

687
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,858
OH, THE SNOWMAKER!

688
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,027
IT'S RUNNING OUT OF ICE!

689
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:33,779
WE HAVE TO GET HER BACK TO THE BORDER!

690
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,823
TINK, WHAT ABOUT THE QUEEN?

691
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:37,199
THERE'S NO TIME.

692
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,910
CLANK, GRAB SOME ICE.
WE'LL WRAP HER WINGS.

693
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,956
BE CAREFUL. GENTLE. EASY.

694
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,375
OKAY. LET'S GO. HURRY!

695
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,002
ALL TOGETHER. ALL TOGETHER.

696
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:50,420
ALL TOGETHER.

697
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,797
HURRY!

698
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,882
WE CAN DO THIS!

699
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,636
HURRY!

700
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,346
GO, GO, GO!

701
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,807
HOLD ON. WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

702
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,684
HURRY! IT'S NEARLY OUT OF ICE!

703
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,102
NOT MUCH FURTHER.

704
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,816
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

705
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,235
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT!

706
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:16,947
LET ME HELP YOU.

707
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,536
I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

708
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,792
PLEASE, CAN YOU HELP HER?

709
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,172
TINK.

710
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:46,727
GENTLY. LIFT YOUR WINGS.
LET THE COLD SURROUND THEM.

711
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,871
YOU'RE OKAY. YOUR WINGS ARE OKAY.

712
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,664
YEAH. YEAH.

713
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,626
THIS IS WHY WE DO NOT CROSS THE BORDER.

714
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:16,215
NO, IT COULD'VE WORKED!
WE JUST NEEDED A BIGGER PIECE OF ICE!

715
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:19,718
AND WHEN THAT WAS GONE?
YOUR WINGS COULD HAVE BROKEN.

716
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:26,225
BUT THEY DIDN'T. I'M FINE. THANKS TO THEM.

717
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,481
THE RULE IS THERE TO PROTECT YOU.
I'M SORRY.

718
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:35,234
YOU TWO MAY NEVER SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

719
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:37,653
OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

720
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,154
WE'RE SISTERS.

721
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,325
WE WERE BORN OF THE SAME LAUGH.

722
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,541
ALL THE MORE REASON YOU SHOULD WANT
TO KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE.

723
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:53,961
RETURN HOME.

724
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,842
COME ON, TINK. LET'S GO HOME.

725
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,135
NO!

726
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:07,724
LORD MILORI,
YOUR RULE WILL NOT KEEP US APART.

727
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:08,892
TINKER BELL.

728
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,939
THIS IS NOT LORD MILORI'S RULE. IT'S MINE.

729
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,941
QUEEN CLARION?

730
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:17,901
I'M SORRY.

731
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,161
YOU SHOULD GET DEEPER INTO THE COLD.

732
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,455
BACK TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.

733
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:11,640
SPEAKING OF SPARKLING,
WE CAN CONCLUDE

734
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:17,312
THAT IT SPREADS IN A SPIRAL
AND CIRCLES THE CENTER.

735
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:19,523
OH!

736
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,619
HELLO?

737
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:34,913
HELLO?

738
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:42,671
PERI?

739
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,935
QUEEN CLARION. WHY?

740
00:48:58,645 --> 00:48:59,646
TINKER BELL.

741
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,859
LONG AGO,
WHEN PIXIE HOLLOW WAS VERY YOUNG,

742
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,195
TWO FAIRIES MET AND FELL IN LOVE.

743
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,657
ONE OF THEM WAS A WINTER FAIRY...

744
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,035
...AND THE OTHER
WAS FROM THE WARM SEASONS.

745
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,664
THE TWO FAIRIES WERE ENCHANTED
WITH EACH OTHER.

746
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,542
AND EVERY SUNSET,
THEY MET AT THE BORDER...

747
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,752
...WHERE SPRING TOUCHES WINTER.

748
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:27,757
BUT AS THEIR LOVE GREW STRONGER,
THEY WISHED TO BE TOGETHER...

749
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,385
...AND SHARE EACH OTHER'S WORLDS.

750
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,806
SO THEY DISREGARDED THE DANGER
AND CROSSED.

751
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,268
ONE OF THEM BROKE A WING.

752
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,689
FOR WHICH THERE IS NO CURE.

753
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,067
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD,
QUEEN CLARION DECREED

754
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:48,653
THAT FAIRIES MUST NEVER AGAIN
CROSS THE BORDER.

755
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:52,282
AND I AGREED THAT OUR TWO WORLDS

756
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,243
SHOULD FOREVER REMAIN APART.

757
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:58,914
AND THE TWO FAIRIES?

758
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,249
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

759
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:06,671
THEY HAD TO SAY GOODBYE.

760
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:31,071
WE SAW THE SNOW.

761
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,864
QUEEN CLARION, SOMETHING'S WRONG!

762
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,783
THE TEMPERATURE,
IT SEEMS TO BE PLUMMETING!

763
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,618
THE HIBISCUS ARE HALFWAY TO HIBERNATION!

764
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,995
NOW, NOW, MINISTERS, LET'S NOT PANIC.

765
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,247
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

766
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,748
SNOW!

767
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,042
HEAVE!

768
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,126
HO!

769
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,170
- HEAVE!
- HO!

770
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:48,838
PUT YOUR MUSCLE INTO IT, CLANKY!

771
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:50,382
I'M TRYING, BOBBLE!

772
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,552
WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID THIS GET HERE?

773
00:50:53,635 --> 00:50:56,763
WE DON'T KNOW, MISS BELL,
BUT IT'S STUCK REAL GOOD!

774
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,766
AYE, AND IT'S MAKING THAT THING BIGGER
BY THE MINUTE!

775
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:03,645
GUYS, DOWN HERE!

776
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:04,729
- COME ON!
- GOT IT!

777
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:05,981
OKAY, PUSH!

778
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:09,985
ALL TOGETHER. ALL TOGETHER!

779
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,530
UPSY-DAISY.

780
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,075
WE DID IT!

781
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,952
WE DID IT!

782
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,161
IT'S OVER.

783
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:22,289
UH, I DON'T THINK IT IS.

784
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,126
OH, MY GOODNESS.

785
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,837
THE SEASONS HAVE
BEEN THROWN OUT OF BALANCE.

786
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,963
BUT IF THE TEMPERATURES

787
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,632
CONTINUE TO DROP,
IT WILL FREEZE ALL OF PIXIE HOLLOW.

788
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:38,847
- OH, NO.
- QUEEN CLARION, THE PIXIE DUST TREE.

789
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,934
WE MUST HOPE
THE TREE SURVIVES THE FREEZE.

790
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,854
OTHERWISE THERE WILL
BE NO MORE PIXIE DUST.

791
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,816
LIFE IN PIXIE HOLLOW WILL CHANGE FOREVER.

792
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,444
AND NO FAIRY WILL EVER FLY AGAIN.

793
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,114
HURRY. WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

794
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:01,244
GRAB AS MANY AS YOU CAN
AND HEAD FOR THE PIXIE DUST TREE!

795
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:05,081
HURRY, GUYS! THIS WAY!
HOP TO IT! THAT'S IT!

796
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,505
SNUG AS A BUG.

797
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:14,633
OH, NO!

798
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,267
COME ON, THAT'S IT.

799
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:26,603
JUST A LITTLE FASTER.

800
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:27,937
THAT'S IT, FAIRIES.

801
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:31,733
LAY THE BLANKETS ALONG THE BRANCHES,
AS MANY AS YOU CAN!

802
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:34,569
WE MUST PROTECT THE PIXIE DUST TREE!

803
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,988
- MISS BELL!
- TINK! DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

804
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,157
NO! THIS IS MY LAST RUN!

805
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,034
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE TREE!

806
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,418
EVERYBODY OKAY?

807
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:55,340
GREAT. THERE YOU GO. NICE AND TOASTY.

808
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,634
YOU GUYS JUST STAY HERE AND KEEP WARM.

809
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:01,596
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

810
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:09,270
L'£'$ STILL ALIVE.

811
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:15,985
PERI.

812
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,697
DEWEY, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.

813
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,865
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE PIXIE DUST TREE.

814
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,033
NOW DON'T WORRY...

815
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:23,535
WHOA!

816
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,619
CAREFUL.

817
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:27,122
I'M SURE THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

818
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,248
OH!

819
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,710
OH, DEAR.

820
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:46,266
OKAY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORRY
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

821
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:50,437
TINK?

822
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,732
PERIWINKLE!

823
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,045
TINKER BELL! ARE YOU OKAY?

824
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:18,256
WHY WOULD YOU FLY HERE?

825
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,424
I HAD TO.

826
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,426
YOUR JACKET. PUT ON YOUR JACKET.

827
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,052
PIXIE HOLLOW'S IN TROUBLE.

828
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,930
THERE'S A FREEZE MOVING IN,
AND THE PIXIE DUST TREE IS IN DANGER.

829
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:27,849
OH, THAT EXPLAINS IT.

830
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,269
THE PIXIE DUST HERE,
IT ALREADY STOPPED FLOWING.

831
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,605
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

832
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:36,900
YOUR FROST, IT KEPT THE FLOWER ALIVE.

833
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:40,111
OH! OH! OH!
FROST DOES THAT. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BLANKET.

834
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,697
IT TUCKS THE WARM AIR INSIDE
AND KEEPS OUT THE COLD.

835
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:48,995
WE COULD FROST THE PIXIE DUST TREE
BEFORE THE FREEZE HITS IT.

836
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,457
UH, ONE QUESTION.
WHAT ABOUT OUR WINGS?

837
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,543
IF IT'S A FREEZE,
IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO CROSS.

838
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,505
THEN WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

839
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,554
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE BORDER!

840
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:14,604
THE AUTUMN WOODS.

841
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:20,318
THE FREEZE.
IT'S MOVING SO FAST.

842
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,403
COME ON! WE HAVE TO GET TO THE TREE!

843
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,338
THAT'S IT, CLANKY.

844
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:44,926
QUEEN CLARION, IT'S NOT WORKING.

845
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,636
THE WIND, IT'S TOO STRONG!

846
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,060
TINKER BELL.

847
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,354
QUEEN CLARION! THEY CAN HELP.

848
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:00,441
OUR FROST, IT COVERS LIKE A BLANKET.
IT CAN PROTECT THE TREE.

849
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,115
DO IT.

850
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,638
OH, NO.

851
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:32,056
IT'S GETTING COLDER.

852
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,642
LET'S HAND OUT THE BLANKETS.
THEY'LL KEEP US WARM!

853
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,728
HURRY, PERI. HURRY!

854
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:50,074
THAT'S IT. THERE YOU GO!
MAKE SURE TO COVER YOUR WINGS!

855
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:53,912
THE TREE! IT'S TOO BIG.
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT.

856
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,583
I'M SORRY.

857
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:21,814
WHOOPSIE! HA!

858
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,072
LORD MILORI.

859
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,448
WE'VE COME TO HELP.

860
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,075
NOW, YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GOING TO LET YOU

861
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,327
DO THIS ALL BY YOURSELF, NOW DID YOU?

862
00:57:35,954 --> 00:57:37,956
THE TREE SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITY.

863
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:41,376
BUT ANY FAIRY WE CAN SPARE
SHOULD TRY TO FROST THE OTHER SEASONS.

864
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:45,713
START AT THE FREEZE LINE
AND SPREAD OUT TO SPRING AND SUMMER.

865
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,632
THE REST OF YOU, COVER THE TREE!

866
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:57,141
OH, MY GOODNESS.

867
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,644
LOOK, BOBBLE! THE SNOWY OWLS!

868
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:00,728
AH!

869
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:06,526
THANK YOU.

870
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:07,986
STAY WARM.

871
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:09,612
OH.

872
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,035
NOW!

873
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:48,026
WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN. JOIN THE OTHERS.

874
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:02,623
THE FREEZE IS UPON US.
YOU MUST TAKE COVER.

875
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:03,708
FOLLOW ME.

876
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:07,628
OH, I HOPE IT WORKS.

877
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:09,422
TINK!

878
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:21,434
WILL EVERYTHING BE ALL RIGHT?

879
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:24,645
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

880
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,487
THANK YOU, MILORI.

881
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,197
PLEASE, TAKE COVER.

882
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,999
WINTER FAIRIES, STAND GUARD.

883
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,239
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

884
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,209
IT WORKED! IT WORKED, TINKER BELL.

885
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:52,919
OH, THANK GOODNESS!

886
01:01:58,299 --> 01:01:59,342
WE DID IT.

887
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:09,518
WHOA!

888
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:13,773
OH!

889
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,243
COME ON, EVERYONE!

890
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,830
TINK! COME ON!

891
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,668
TINK?

892
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,629
WHAT'S WRONG?

893
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:46,847
OH!

894
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,854
WHEN YOU FLEW TO WINTER,
THAT'S WHY YOU FELL.

895
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:57,942
OH, NO.

896
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,443
OH, TINKER BELL.

897
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:00,611
TINK.

898
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,864
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

899
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,784
WE HAD TO SAVE THE TREE.

900
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:11,330
BESIDES, THERE'S NO CURE
FOR A BROKEN WING.

901
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,875
I'M SO SORRY.

902
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,724
THIS HAPPENED
BECAUSE WE TRIED TO KEEP YOU APART.

903
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,393
BUT NEVER AGAIN.

904
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,562
YOU BELONG TOGETHER.

905
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,574
IT'S GETTING WARMER.

906
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:48,743
YOU SHOULD GET BACK TO WINTER.

907
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,204
YEAH.

908
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:01,505
I'LL BE OKAY.
I'LL MEET YOU TOMORROW AT THE BORDER.

909
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:07,553
SISTERS?

910
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,597
SISTERS.

911
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:20,900
JINGLES!

912
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:03,317
UH... EH...

01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:04,777
THAT'S A NEW CHAPTER.

914
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:11,450
OKAY, THAT WAS AMAZING.

915
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:13,577
MISS BELL, YOU ARE FANTASTIC!

916
01:05:18,249 --> 01:05:20,876

I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO
THE SMOOCHY, SMOOCHITY.

918
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:25,589
GUESS THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE NOW.

919
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:43,858
NEXT!

920
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,697
UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO FIRST.

921
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,658
NEXT.

922
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,160
UGH! ALL RIGHT.

923
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,330
OOH! WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT.

924
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:00,875
OH!

01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,544
THAT FEELS GOOD.

927
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,222
LOOK OUT! RUNAWAY BUNNY!

928
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,647

929
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,274
HEY, LITTLE BUDDY.

931
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,488
IT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS CALL ME.

932
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,365
WOW!

933
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,536
I LOVE YOUR WORK.
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

934
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,747
OKAY, YOU CAN LET GO OF MY HAND NOW.
