1
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,734
Okay, time to eat.

2
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,039
Let's see, open the app.

3
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,308
I'm gonna get
a double pepperoni pizza,

4
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,779
uh, order of breadsticks and...

5
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:53,681
...well, lasagna.

6
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:54,782
Yeah.

7
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,383
Ooh, new item alert.

8
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,786
Jalapeno breadstick
quick bites.

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,789
Huh. It might be nice to have
something in the salad family.

10
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,191
And do I want dessert?

11
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,995
Ooh, I'm gonna be naughty.

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,963
Butterscotch budino.

13
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,665
Okay, I'm gonna have five.

14
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,801
Delivery?

15
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,937
Goes without saying...
now, please.

16
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,639
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

17
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,708
Eh, all right. That ought to
hold me till breakfast.

18
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,843
Oh, hey.

19
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,544
Wait, are you guys early
or am I late?

20
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:27,247
No matter. I have got
a real treat for you today.

21
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,486
No, not a treat for you.

22
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,321
Okay.

23
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,860
Anyway, about that treat.

24
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,063
Can I just say, you will not be
disappointed.

25
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,132
It's a story about me...

26
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,733
...that no one's
ever heard before,

27
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,136
featuring someone in my life...

28
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,637
...you've never met.

29
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:53,641
I don't know about you,
but color me intrigued.

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,245
Oh, yeah, drone delivery.

31
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,180
Welcome to the future.

32
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,215
You know, to really understand
everything,

33
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,919
I'm gonna have to take you back
to where it all began.

34
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,320
Don't want anything
to take away

35
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,289
from the flavor of the cheese.

36
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,665
And like every great story,
it all started...

37
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,305
...on a dark and stormy night.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,614
Wait here, Junior.

39
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,184
I'll be right back.

40
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,453
Open wide, Jake.

41
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,058
Aw.

42
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,999
Oh!

43
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,206
Oh.

44
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,907
Hi there, little buddy.

45
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,877
Hi.

46
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,227
You hungry, little guy?

47
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,733
You want a little more?

48
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,437
Whoa, you are a hungry
little guy.

49
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,507
Uh, uh...

50
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,810
That was a quick dinner,
<i>Signor</i> Jon.

51
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,478
You must've been
very hungry.

52
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,181
Can I bring you anything else?

53
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,183
Uh, yes.

54
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,252
<i>Grazie,</i>
<i>grazie.</i> Thank you very much.

55
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,220
Some lasagna.

56
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:27,889
<i>Si.</i>
Lasagna for one.

57
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,156
Uh, yeah.

58
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,026
You know what, no,
uh, make it family style.

59
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,794
-Very good.
-To go, please, Vito.

60
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,296
Okay, everybody.

61
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,530
Huh? Where'd he go?

62
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,166
-You all know this one.
-Hey!

63
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,135
Stand up and sing.

64
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,137
-Join with us.
-Oh, no.

65
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,641
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

66
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,509
Pardon me. I hate this.
What? Hey.

67
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,344
-Hey!
-Oh, no.

68
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,614
Hey!

69
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,816
Ugh.

70
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,589
Hey!

71
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,392
Hey!

72
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,865
Hey!

73
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,034
Your takeout is ready,
<i>Signor</i> Jon.

74
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,235
Yes.

75
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,037
One <i>famiglia</i> style lasagna
to go.

76
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,805
Whoa, whoa, uh, uh...

77
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,607
You eat alone
too much, Jon.

78
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,708
Yeah.

79
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,943
You should get on
the dating apps.

80
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,010
-No, I'm good, thanks.
-There's Bumble, Tinder,

81
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,444
-Gluten-Free Singles...
-Oh, really?

82
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,780
-Hot Sauce Passions.
-No, I could never.

83
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,315
And you should spend
serious money

84
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,783
-on premium memberships.
-Bye.

85
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,120
Huh?

86
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,356
Oh, hey.

87
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,358
Well, that was
an interesting dinner...

88
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,226
that you had.

89
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,462
Well, I guess, um,

90
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,099
this is where we say goodbye.

91
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,569
Aw, you're really cute,

92
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:52,340
but I... I can't have pets
in my apartment.

93
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,143
So, I'll see you around.

94
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:57,712
Okay?

95
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,413
Go on.

96
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,849
Oh, no.

97
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,751
No, don't cry.

98
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:04,885
Don't cry.

99
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,188
Oh. Uh.

100
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,557
No, no, no, no, no. No.

101
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,392
Oh, no. Oh, no. Ah, oh.

102
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,861
Wait, wait, wait.

103
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,737
You don't have a home, do you?

104
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,575
Hmm.

105
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:50,865
And that's how I adopted Jon.

106
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,775
<i>So, I moved Jon</i>
<i>out of his apartment</i>

107
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,178
<i>to this nice little two-bed,</i>
<i>two-bath in the suburbs.</i>

108
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,048
<i>As soon as he understood</i>
<i>the ground rules,</i>

109
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,217
<i>well, let's just say,</i>
<i>we were living the dream.</i>

110
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,322
<i>And once we were</i>
<i>settled in,</i>

111
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:17,024
<i>I even let Jon get a pet.</i>

112
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,474
<i>Odie became</i>
<i>my most trusted ally.</i>

113
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:37,445
<i>He was kind, gentle,</i>
<i>and most importantly,</i>

114
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,046
<i>my unpaid intern.</i>

115
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,387
Huh?

116
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,156
Hmm.

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,701
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>as you can see,</i>

118
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,771
<i>life here</i>
<i>is pretty near perfect.</i>

119
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,606
Well, yeah, except for...

120
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,642
Time to go to the vet.

121
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,847
<i>We're gonna need the big scale.</i>

122
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,883
Does she need to announce it
to the whole office?

123
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,494
No. Please, no.
Ow, it's so hot.

124
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,962
Ow, it's really hurting.
Ow, ow, ow.

125
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,705
And that's why we should go
from Sunday to Tuesday.

126
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,074
Okay. Where were we?

127
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,879
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Good morning.

128
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,901
Oh!

129
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,938
What? Where'd you get
that chair?

130
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,913
-Uh.
-Ha.

131
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,882
<i>I think I was meant</i>
<i>to be here tonight</i>

132
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,518
<i>because I was meant</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

133
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,719
<i>-I think we were meant to be.</i>
<i>-That's what I meant to say.</i>

134
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,087
<i>You had me</i>
<i>at the word "meant."</i>

135
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,862
<i>We're gonna ride like the wind!</i>

136
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,198
<i>Faster! Harder! More insane!</i>

137
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,104
Odie? Yeah, can you put
this back to normal?

138
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,240
There you go,
just let the pepperoni's

139
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,242
healing powers work its magic.

140
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,168
You saw nothing.

141
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,780
<i>Up until that moment,</i>
<i>my life was a perfect souffle.</i>

142
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,952
<i>Little did I know</i>
<i>it was all about to collapse.</i>

143
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,091
<i>Imagine yourself drifting away</i>

144
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,927
<i>on a sea of tranquility.</i>

145
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,465
<i>There are no pets</i>
<i>to bother you, distract you,</i>

146
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,166
<i>or max out your credit card</i>

147
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,904
<i>by excessively placing</i>
<i>online food orders.</i>

148
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,847
Oh, yeah, sorry.

149
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,116
Huh? What? Who said that?

150
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,551
Huh? Odie?

151
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:04,619
Odie?

152
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,420
Odie!

153
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:07,921
It's time
for our midnight snack.

154
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,598
Thank you, good sir.

155
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,667
Your kindness will be rewarded.

156
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,107
What are we feeling
like tonight, huh?

157
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,143
French? Italian?

158
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,545
Chinese?

159
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,746
Cupcakes?

160
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,914
Chinese it is.

161
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,518
Odie, shape everything
from the bottom two shelves

162
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:37,619
into a dumpling.

163
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,888
-Hmm?
-Huh?

164
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:06,947
Late-night snackin'.

165
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,818
Not good for digestion.

166
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,385
Odie, I'm dreaming again.

167
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,355
Slap me across the face.

168
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,092
Nope. Still dreaming.

169
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,960
I must be really deep
in this one.

170
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,470
What do you guys--

171
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:31,806
What do you want? Money?
I don't have any money, okay?

172
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,307
Who-who carries cash anymore?

173
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,477
I've-- I-I've got Jon's
credit card number memorized.

174
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,879
5552-3857-5521.

175
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,414
Did you write that down?

176
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,050
Expiration code is 555.

177
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,453
The cat is out of the bag.

178
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,461
I really hope
this kidnapping plan works

179
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:55,697
or she'll put us down.

180
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,400
With her insults
and cutting observations.

181
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,704
I think this is
a case of mistaken identity.

182
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,471
You must be looking
for another gorgeous,

183
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:05,939
lovable kitty cat, right?

184
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,308
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

185
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,911
Hey, where you going?
No, no, come back, come back.

186
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,251
-No, no. Odie?
-Hmm?

187
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,620
I'll handle this.

188
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,020
All right, you guys!

189
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,590
I'm giving you
to the count of three

190
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,660
to get back here
and let us down.

191
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:28,663
One, two, three!

192
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,800
Four, five...

193
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,535
I am not kidding here.

194
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,471
308,

195
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,641
Three hundred and nine...

196
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,074
three hundred and--

197
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,711
I can't--
Yeah, they're not coming.

198
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,548
It's over.

199
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,751
Psst.

200
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:52,754
Huh?

201
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,488
Am I dead?

202
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,526
Are you an angel?

203
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,968
Please, take me.

204
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,404
I am ready to go
to that...

205
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:13,373
to that all-you-can-eat buffet
in the sky.

206
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,679
What? Listen,
I'm going to swing you out,

207
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:20,849
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

208
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,884
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

209
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,084
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

210
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,687
cutting a rope
over a 40-foot drop?

211
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,987
No time.

212
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,724
We got to get out of here
before they come back.

213
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:42,637
We need to go.
Come on, Junior.

214
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,172
Wait here, Junior.

215
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,876
I'll be right back.

216
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,444
I'll be right back.

217
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,950
You.

218
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,786
Hey, Junior.

219
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,421
-Huh?
-"Who is he?"

220
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:04,124
This is Vic. My "father."

221
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,561
Look, Junior, I know
how you might be upset.

222
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,228
Upset? Why would I be upset?

223
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,031
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

224
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,066
I'm probably just overreacting.

225
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,748
Oh, no, not her.

226
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,181
Okay, follow me, Junior.

227
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,984
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

228
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,853
You lost the privilege
of telling me what to do

229
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,120
a long time ago.

230
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,422
Hello, Vic.

231
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:36,858
Oh, dang it.

232
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,492
Scare cam.

233
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,796
Oh, you should've
seen your faces.

234
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,964
Ooh.

235
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,535
Okay, boys, show me.

236
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,202
Hello, Vic.

237
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,705
Oh, dang--

238
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,877
Post that ASAP.

239
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:03,083
What? Uh, hey, Jinx.

240
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,420
I haven't seen you since-- Oh.

241
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:10,190
W-Well, no hard feelings,
though, right?

242
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,561
Oh, I don't think so.

243
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,497
I'm a hugger. Oh!

244
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:19,667
Part of me wants to be mad
at her for kidnapping us,

245
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,035
but you got to love her energy.

246
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,236
Where are my manners?

247
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,607
Chop-chop, gentlemen.
Look alive.

248
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,889
Ah. Perfection.

249
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,958
You know, I was so delighted

250
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,961
that you accepted
my invitation here tonight.

251
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,931
Well, throwing us in a burlap
sack wasn't exactly an Evite.

252
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:51,899
Vic, you're so quiet.

253
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,702
Are you feline sad?
Cat got your tongue?

254
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,971
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

255
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,007
Excuse me, uh, how do you two
know each other?

256
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,240
Let me handle this, Junior.

257
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,043
Oh, don't "Junior" me.

258
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,979
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

259
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,547
Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

260
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:09,651
Anyway, can somebody please
tell me what is going on?

261
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,019
Well, we really don't
need to get into...

262
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,087
I'll take this one.

263
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,061
What?

264
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,462
I'm from a small town
outside London

265
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:25,332
that you've probably
never heard of.

266
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,202
Oh, I scratched and clawed
my way through hard times

267
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,106
to come here with one dream.

268
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,952
<i>I wanted to be seen.</i>

269
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,691
<i>I wanted to matter.</i>

270
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:54,361
<i>But I was a failure.</i>

271
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,197
The winner!

272
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:05,338
<i>And then</i>
<i>I met Vic and his crew.</i>

273
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,375
They were outcasts, losers.

274
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,677
Thugs.

275
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:13,280
<i>We didn't have much,</i>
<i>but we had each other.</i>

276
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,717
<i>We became a real family.</i>

277
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,086
Vic and family.

278
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,587
I know where this is going.

279
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:20,621
Excuse me? Garcon?

280
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:22,757
Uh, when might we expect
appetizers?

281
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,092
Perhaps an <i>amuse-bouche?</i>

282
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,594
And then one night,

283
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,229
<i>we were about to make</i>
<i>our biggest score,</i>

284
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,734
<i>enough milk to last us</i>
<i>for weeks.</i>

285
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,438
Vic!

286
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,543
Vic!

287
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,714
Jinx, I tried
to come back for you.

288
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,049
You have to know that.

289
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,184
Oh, yes,
you get an "A" for effort.

290
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,619
So, what happened next?

291
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,020
<i>Imagine Alcatraz...</i>

292
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,089
<i>but smellier.</i>

293
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:56,624
<i>It was cold.</i>

294
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,492
<i>And lonely.</i>

295
00:20:58,626 --> 00:20:59,861
<i>And stinky.</i>

296
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:02,797
<i>So very stinky.</i>
<i>I can't overstate that enough.</i>

297
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:05,666
<i>But it gave me purpose.</i>

298
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,869
<i>I needed to get out.</i>

299
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,670
<i>I just needed help.</i>

300
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,352
So, your purpose was
to escape jail

301
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,354
and get involved
with charities?

302
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,091
No. My purpose was...

303
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:31,626
revenge.

304
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,562
Oh, I see.
I went the other way with it.

305
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,329
I'm kidding.

306
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,365
Another cat would be
bent on revenge,

307
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,001
but I'm, uh...
Ooh, how would you put it?

308
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:44,839
Evolved, compassionate and
incredibly self-actualized.

309
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,339
Bingo.

310
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,408
I had such trouble finding him,

311
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,477
and when I discovered
you were his son,

312
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,514
I had no choice but
to kidnap you to lure him here.

313
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,716
No, listen, I totally get it.
It's-it's all--

314
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,719
It's all part of being
associated with Vic.

315
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:02,455
So, what do you need from him
to make this right?

316
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,991
I simply want him to pay back

317
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,392
the quart of milk
I lost that night,

318
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,727
and we'll call it even.

319
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,829
I can do that.

320
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,030
What he can't do
is raise a child.

321
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,598
-Just one quart.
-Just one quart.

322
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,699
-Done.
-Done.

323
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,134
For every day
I was in the pound.

324
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,236
-What, now?
-Nice twist. Well played.

325
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,771
Uh, how long were you
in the pound again?

326
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,272
Four years, seven months
and two days.

327
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,607
Oh! That long?

328
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,243
All right, I'm gonna do
the math here in my brain.

329
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,111
Uh, the way you do that is...

330
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:25,847
Odie?

331
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,850
1,675 quarts of milk.
Exactly right, Odie.

332
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:31,118
We both came up with it
at the exact same time.

333
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,754
Where am I gonna find
that much milk?

334
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,723
Well, I suggest you go back
to the place

335
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,357
you double-crossed me.

336
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,327
Lactose Farms.

337
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,529
Wow. Well, good luck, Vic.

338
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,599
I'll leave you two
to work out the fine print.

339
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:47,068
We'll just see ourselves out.
Odie?

340
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:50,805
Ah, no.
You're all going to do this.

341
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,106
What? Wait, why me?

342
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,774
He's the one who abandoned you.

343
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,344
Yes, but this is
more than a one-cat job.

344
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,612
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

345
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,780
of low-life cat burglars
he could ask.

346
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh, I'm sure he does, but if
I'm being completely honest,

347
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,652
seeing how miserable
you make one another

348
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,854
brings me endless satisfaction.

349
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,990
Oh, well, thank you
for your honesty.

350
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,424
And if I don't go?

351
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:14,629
You can stay and have a
playdate with Roland and Nolan.

352
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:17,732
Okay, boys... go play.

353
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,142
Ma'am, I think
this is an opportunity

354
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,911
to take a deep,
cleansing breath

355
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:33,581
and repeat
your anger management mantra.

356
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,388
Anyone else
have any objections?

357
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,290
Nope, I'm good.

358
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,658
Thanks for the opportunity.

359
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,593
Excellent.

360
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,129
Now, you boys have 72 hours.

361
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,935
Or else.

362
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:56,804
I-I can't believe
this is happening.

363
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,639
I don't see you for years,
and when I do,

364
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,074
you pull me
into a life of crime.

365
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,376
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head, too.

366
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,577
Well, that's the difference
between us,

367
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,746
because I never wanted
to see you again.

368
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,381
Now, I-I totally understand
your anger.

369
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,016
But if you give me
a chance to explain,

370
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,752
you'll see I am not
the bad guy you think I am.

371
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,888
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley.

372
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,790
-It wasn't like that.
-It was exactly like that!

373
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,625
No, it wasn't.
Let me tell you what,

374
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,026
-Junior...
-No, no. Ah!

375
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,962
I don't want to hear it.
This whole thing with Jinx?

376
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:24,497
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

377
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,635
Can't let you do that.

378
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:30,838
We'll be watching you.

379
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,039
Like a hawk.

380
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,883
Is today a Monday?

381
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,019
'Cause it feels
an awful lot like a Monday.

382
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,087
It's Thursday.

383
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,254
Not to me it's not.

384
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,390
Look, I know this isn't ideal,

385
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,158
but we have to do this.

386
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,794
So let's just try and make
the best of our time together.

387
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,597
Our time together?
What are you talking about?

388
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,132
Once we get this milk,

389
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:00,267
I want you out of my life.
Forever.

390
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,702
All right, just relax.

391
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:02,937
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

392
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,239
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

393
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,707
This will be
a quick grab and go.

394
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,209
You'll be back home
before you know it.

395
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:13,047
So how do we even get
to Lactose Farms?

396
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,448
It's way out in the country.

397
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,283
You ever jumped a train?

398
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,918
I've never jumped.

399
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:20,788
Look, if jumping a train
is too hard, just say it.

400
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,190
-How hard could it be?
-Exactly.

401
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:26,894
This is gonna be fun.

402
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,765
Garfield?

403
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:31,932
Odie?

404
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,167
Hello?

405
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,737
Garfield, how many times
have I told you

406
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:39,240
to close the refrigerator door?
Gar--

407
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,009
Wait, there's food
on the floor.

408
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:45,112
He's never
left food on the floor.

409
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,248
Garfield?

410
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,251
Garfield?

411
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,086
Garfield?

412
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,221
Garfield? Garfield? Garfield?

413
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,891
Garfield!

414
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,064
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

415
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:04,899
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

416
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:07,635
the direction of the sun
and various angles.

417
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:10,371
Yes, I say we jump the train
from right here.

418
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,540
Didn't I just say that?

419
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,907
I've seen it on television
a million times.

420
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,175
We'll need a hundred feet
of rope.

421
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,376
Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay, great.

422
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,744
Uh-huh. Yep.
We'll throw the rope

423
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,046
-over that branch right there.
-Branch. Uh-huh. Got it.

424
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,182
Can you follow me?
All right?

425
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:22,683
And then, timing it just right,

426
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,286
we swing over
as the train passes by

427
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,054
and land on top of the car.

428
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,722
-Boom.
-Or...

429
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,225
we can do this.

430
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,094
Odie, jump, boy.

431
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:35,696
Huh?

432
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,831
Uh-oh.

433
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,434
Whoa!

434
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,608
Part of me wants to help him.

435
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,311
No. This is how he learns.

436
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,788
I don't know.
It's kind of pricey.

437
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,723
How does it handle?

438
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,391
Whoa! I'll take it!

439
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,462
Whoa!

440
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,141
See? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

441
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,210
You and I have
different definitions of fun.

442
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,247
<i>Hello?</i>

443
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,748
Oh, finally. Hello!

444
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,618
<i>You've reached Find My Pet.</i>

445
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,185
<i>If your pet is lost,</i>
<i>we're here to help.</i>

446
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,621
Mm-hmm. Hi, yes. Great.

447
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:35,322
Okay, uh, my orange tabby
and my dog are both missing,

448
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,591
and I-I need your help.

449
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:37,825
<i>Please listen carefully,</i>

450
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,759
<i>as our menu options</i>
<i>have changed.</i>

451
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:39,994
-Okay.
<i>-If you'd like to hear</i>

452
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,462
<i>this call in Spanish...</i>

453
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,696
-What?
<i>-For Pig Latin,</i>

454
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,964
<i>-ess-pray even-say.</i>
<i>-</i> Come on.

455
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,132
<i>For gibberish...</i>

456
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,834
What do I press to talk
to a real person?

457
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,503
<i>Your call</i>
<i>is very important to us.</i>

458
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,871
-<i>There are...</i>
<i>-1,346</i>

459
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,206
<i>...people ahead of you.</i>

460
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,608
Wha-- What?

461
00:27:53,741 --> 00:27:55,610
Garfield, where are you?

462
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,417
Okay, Vic, you got
to figure this out.

463
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,986
Jinx can't be trusted,

464
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,956
and you got to keep
Junior safe.

465
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,193
You just got to figure out
a way to get him out of this.

466
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,462
Ah. Tell me, is it a burr?

467
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:17,498
It hurts.
Ah, you pulled my hair.

468
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:18,732
Ow, ow, ow.

469
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,334
Is that--
Is it a bug?

470
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,703
A bug?

471
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,371
-Ow. Ow. Owie. Ow.
-Hmm?

472
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,439
Odie, Odie.

473
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,010
Okay. Ah.

474
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,219
You know what, Junior?
This is gonna be good for you.

475
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,921
-What'll be good for me?
-What we're doing.

476
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,122
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

477
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,659
from a dairy to pay back
a deranged cat.

478
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,494
What part of that is
going to be good for me?

479
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,531
All of it.
You can't even imagine

480
00:28:49,664 --> 00:28:51,232
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

481
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,801
-Oh, yeah. Name one.
-Well, for starters,

482
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:57,071
you already know
how to get on a moving train.

483
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,876
I found it funny.

484
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,779
All I'm saying is that
to break into a dairy,

485
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,147
it's gonna take a few skills

486
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,483
I'm guessing a rounded,
mush-filled, overly-pampered

487
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,687
indoor cat like you
doesn't have.

488
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,689
So, we need to toughen you up.

489
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,891
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

490
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,261
You've obviously never been
in an Olive Garden

491
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,762
that's run out of breadsticks.

492
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,065
Anyway, I'm never gonna need
those skills

493
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,167
-you're talking about.
-But you'll have them.

494
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,802
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

495
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,238
or anything else, ever again.

496
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:32,973
You are missing the point.

497
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,576
You're going to learn
to improvise,

498
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,976
think on your feet,
develop moves

499
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,812
that'll come in handy out there
in the real world.

500
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,949
I wouldn't be in the real world
if it wasn't for you.

501
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,818
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

502
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,021
No. I would be asleep at home.

503
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:49,990
Missing out on life altogether.

504
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:53,060
Look, I'm just a dad trying
to teach his son some skills.

505
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,428
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

506
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,031
You can't make up for
five years of not being around.

507
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,832
-Ah, yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

508
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,401
-I think I can.
-In fact, you can't.

509
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,935
-Yes, I can.
-You really can't.

510
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,672
With your attitude, I can.

511
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:06,006
Ah! Okay, whatever, "Dad."

512
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,842
-Wow. Great lesson. Ugh!
-Hmm.

513
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,411
I'm done
talking to you.

514
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:11,579
You do not know me.

515
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:13,280
You don't know
the first thing about me.

516
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,783
I am not pampered.

517
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:17,918
I'm not anything
you think I am.

518
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:24,992
Okay. I'm just gonna say

519
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,361
that blanket is not
the best idea.

520
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,996
Ah, fantastic, thank you.

521
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:30,831
I'll take it from here.

522
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:35,202
Get them off, get them off!

523
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,539
Ah! Get them off me!

524
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,908
Wait, what are you doing?

525
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,348
-What did you do?
-Cedar chips.

526
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,550
Spiders hate them.

527
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,752
See?
Another life skill learned.

528
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,687
I-I-I, uh...

529
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,488
I think the words
you're looking for are...

530
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:55,590
"Thank you, Pops."

531
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:56,957
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

532
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,660
Oh! Here's our stop.

533
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,194
Really? Where?

534
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:07,368
Ooh, Odie, you'd think
he'd see that coming.

535
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,924
Cheese.

536
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,428
Yeah!

537
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,363
-Here you go.
-Yay!

538
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,944
Quaint. Just a simple
little grab and go?

539
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,980
Okay, okay, so they've done
a few upgrades

540
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:55,349
since I was last here.
Stop being so dramatic.

541
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,184
All we have to do
is climb the fence...

542
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:00,354
Yow!

543
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:29,183
Wait, is that Otto?

544
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,820
-Who?
-Otto, of "Otto and Ethel."

545
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,221
Uh, no clue
who you're talking about.

546
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,791
He's one of the mascots
of Lactose Farms.

547
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,092
See? On the side of the barn?

548
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,830
I'll bet he knows
how to get into that place.

549
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,163
Leave him alone.

550
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,999
Seems to be in a period
of meditation or depression.

551
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,168
Yes, he does. Hmm.

552
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,872
This calls for tact,
sensitivity and diplomacy.

553
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,373
Oh, yeah? And where are we
supposed to get that?

554
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,375
I have it. In spades.

555
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,645
Watch.
Maybe you'll learn something.

556
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,584
Excuse me.
You're Otto, right?

557
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,957
I'm Garfield.
A pleasure.

558
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,692
-Go away.
-I just wanted to say

559
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:11,826
I am a huge fan.

560
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,126
I have eaten everything

561
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,629
that has a picture
of your face on it.

562
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:15,930
I'm not that guy anymore.

563
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,431
I even loved
that recalled provolone

564
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:19,066
-from a few years back.
-Junior, no.

565
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,034
Yeah. Anyways,
here's the thing.

566
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,270
Me and my crew back there,
we're in a bit of a bind.

567
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:24,873
Got ourselves in a situation.

568
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,307
Long story short,
we could use your help.

569
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:30,512
You're a fan, huh?

570
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,881
Oh, yes.
Big-time.

571
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,147
Then sing the jingle.

572
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,885
Well, I don't really sing
on command.

573
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,586
I'm not a circus animal.

574
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,654
Sing it.

575
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,154
Really?

576
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:42,824
Sing it.

577
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,130
More spirit.

578
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:51,699
Livelier.

579
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,417
What was that for?

580
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:11,686
I hate that jingle.

581
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,288
You could've just
told me to stop.

582
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,542
Mm.

583
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,178
Let's go.
Kids are waiting.

584
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:53,093
Odie, come back.
Leave him alone.

585
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,562
He might punch you.

586
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:08,810
Was that... Ethel?

587
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,584
A few years back,

588
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,687
Old Man Lactose was forced
out of business.

589
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:22,624
The corporation that took over

590
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,892
separated me from my Ethel.

591
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:27,095
<i>Ethel!</i>

592
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,963
<i>You are my day!</i>

593
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:30,732
<i>You are my night!</i>

594
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,836
<i>I was put out to pasture.</i>

595
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,407
<i>She was put on display</i>
<i>as part of the tour.</i>

596
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:47,115
I tried to get in there
to break Ethel free,

597
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,684
but they stop me every time.

598
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:55,623
Now I only see her
six seconds, twice a day.

599
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:57,357
We-we feel you, Otto.

600
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:58,626
Come on, let's go, Junior.

601
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,662
Uh, we'll find another way
to break in there.

602
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:04,197
Wh-What could you possibly want
from that place?

603
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,166
Oh, you know,
a couple quarts of milk.

604
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,435
A couple thousand quarts.

605
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:09,704
Hmm. Good luck.

606
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,706
W-We'll take any
helpful hints you have.

607
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,473
-Pass.
-I-I'm telling you,

608
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:15,076
it's a life-or-death situation.

609
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:18,846
Then I hope you've
notified your next of kin.

610
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,915
What if we can get Ethel out?

611
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:22,750
Or get you a commemorative pin?

612
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,189
Where are we gonna find
a commemorative pin?

613
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,160
Now, pay attention.

614
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,194
Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

615
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,664
And here are the two places
you need to go.

616
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:41,035
First, the truck with your milk
is back here.

617
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:44,072
And this delicate buttercup
is my Ethel.

618
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,574
My North Star
and reason for living

619
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:49,610
is being kept by
those barbarians in...

620
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,746
a petting zoo.

621
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,214
Located here.

622
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,951
This cricket represents
the electrical room,

623
00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:59,120
this snail,
the refrigeration room.

624
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:01,455
This toadstool
is the loading dock

625
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,991
where you'll find the keys
to the trucks.

626
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,292
Wait, what's the pine cone?

627
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:07,494
The pine cone is
the cheese and butter room.

628
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,897
Ooh, cheese is
my love language.

629
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:11,231
Now, for this briefing,

630
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,233
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

631
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,170
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

632
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:18,840
-Oh!
-You are the majestic bullfrog.

633
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,778
Oh, yeah, that feels right.

634
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,981
You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

635
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,883
-And you...
-Wait for it.

636
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,718
...are roadkill.

637
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,956
Huh? What? Oh.

638
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,257
No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto.

639
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,060
Giving your new
best friend roadkill.

640
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,829
Seriously, though,
wh-what's my real token?

641
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:43,631
That is your real token.

642
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,233
Now, if you have
any chance of succeeding...

643
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,299
Wait, can I, uh-- Excuse me.

644
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,367
Can I switch
to something living?

645
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:48,936
Like, like the snail
or the cricket?

646
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,238
You should've spoken up sooner.

647
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,439
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

648
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,709
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

649
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:56,244
Come on, Roadkill, focus.

650
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:59,213
Oh, really? You give Vic
the majestic bullfrog.

651
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,348
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk.

652
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,317
And then you give me,
your new BFF, roadkill?

653
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,386
I mean, it feels disrespectful,
not gonna lie.

654
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,022
What makes you think he's dead?

655
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:09,791
My eyes.
I have eyes and can see.

656
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,193
It's a possum. They're masters
at playing dead.

657
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,861
Well, then,
little Daniel Day-Possum here

658
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:14,996
should do
Shakespeare in the Park.

659
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,296
Things aren't always
what they seem.

660
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,732
You're right.
But in this case, they are.

661
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,534
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

662
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,802
Oh, do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

663
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:22,904
Do possums play possum?
Is that what they do?

664
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:24,639
Yes. Possums are very clever.

665
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,108
Yeah, I'm sure he was until
the day he ate a pickup truck.

666
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,576
Uh, just ignore him.

667
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,244
Please, continue.

668
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,713
I'll just put this back
where you had it, mm-hmm.

669
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,749
The straightest line
to the loading dock

670
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:36,316
is through the snail here,

671
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,718
then the cricket there,

672
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:40,588
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

673
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,758
Each of these rooms have their
own set of unique challenges.

674
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,325
Well, why can't we just go
straight through the pine cone?

675
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,761
You don't want to go
through the pine cone.

676
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:49,096
Looks like the straightest shot
is through the pine cone.

677
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,731
You like walking
with those feet, do you?

678
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:53,601
You a fan of
unimaginable pain and misery?

679
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,703
Then go through the pine cone.

680
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,005
-Stay away from the pine cone.
-Got it.

681
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,740
Once you're inside
the facility...

682
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,844
<i>...you will enter</i>
<i>the electrical room.</i>

683
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,445
<i>There you will locate</i>
<i>the air vent.</i>

684
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,517
<i>Pop the grate and climb up.</i>

685
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:15,823
<i>Then you'll crawl through</i>
<i>a maze of vents</i>

686
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,390
<i>and drop down...</i>

687
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,161
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

688
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:23,463
<i>Next, you will need to hurl</i>
<i>your body over a 30-foot drop</i>

689
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:26,267
<i>to a series of hand rungs.</i>

690
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,536
<i>You'll propel yourselves</i>
<i>hand over hand</i>

691
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:32,039
<i>and drop down</i>
<i>directly into a loading dock.</i>

692
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:36,510
<i>From there, you'll locate</i>
<i>the keys to the milk truck.</i>

693
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,113
<i>Drive that truck to the</i>
<i>west pasture of the complex,</i>

694
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:40,748
<i>cut the lock on the gate,</i>

695
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:43,284
<i>and find the closest thing</i>
<i>we have</i>

696
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,419
<i>to an angel here on earth.</i>

697
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,926
<i>You'll escort my sweet Ethel</i>
<i>onto the truck</i>

698
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,362
<i>and drive her to freedom.</i>

699
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:59,133
It's going to take mad skills
to get that milk

700
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,602
and free my dear, sweet Ethel.

701
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:04,572
Clearly, this one is qualified
for the mission.

702
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,509
But I have some serious doubts
here about all of... this.

703
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:10,011
He's pointing to you,

704
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,078
Roadkill.

705
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:12,880
Let's get to work.

706
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,318
Stupid roadkill.

707
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,654
Hey! I'm working here!

708
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,690
Ugh, definitely a Monday.

709
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:25,293
<i>Your call</i>
<i>is fairly important to us.</i>

710
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,328
<i>If you've lost a cat,</i>
<i>please press one.</i>

711
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,664
<i>If your cat is orange,</i>
<i>please press two.</i>

712
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,699
<i>This doesn't really</i>
<i>accomplish anything</i>

713
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:34,802
<i>but gives you the false sense</i>
<i>that we're engaged with you.</i>

714
00:40:39,073 --> 00:40:41,976
All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

715
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,211
that you'll need to master

716
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,380
in order to break into
Lactose Farms.

717
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:49,417
Number one, develop
lightning-fast reflexes.

718
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,718
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

719
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,852
on the other side of that wall,

720
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:54,288
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

721
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,456
Yeah, no, no, no.
Depends what kind of pasta.

722
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,860
This pebble represents
danger you may encounter.

723
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,096
You need to grab it
before it grabs you.

724
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,463
It grabs me.

725
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,599
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

726
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:06,466
Too slow!

727
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,269
Ow. What was that for?

728
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:09,704
Being able to grab the pebble

729
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,306
could be the difference
between life and death.

730
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,474
All right,
let me try that again.

731
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,277
Ha! Got it!

732
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,713
Ah! Now, what was that for?!

733
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,414
It's never just
about the pebble.

734
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:21,782
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

735
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,452
Your head's got to be
on a swivel at all times.

736
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,853
You got to be ready
for anything.

737
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,755
I was ready.
He changed the game.

738
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,224
Sounds like
someone's making excuses.

739
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:35,296
And what was that about
being ready for anything?

740
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,530
You were distracting me!

741
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,366
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

742
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,600
You should have
seen that coming.

743
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,569
Toes on the line.
Guard your grill.

744
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,037
Cover your stomach.

745
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,673
There are surprises around
every corner at Lactose Farms.

746
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,209
You need to stay alert.
Too slow.

747
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,777
A baby could have
seen that coming.

748
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,114
Too slow. Too slow.

749
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,584
Too slow!

750
00:41:56,717 --> 00:41:58,719
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

751
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,087
if you can't survive
this training.

752
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,990
-Are you for real?
-Wh-What kind of dairy is this?

753
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:06,627
The kind of dairy that
requires teamwork to survive.

754
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,829
Danger could be anywhere,
gentlemen.

755
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,233
You've got to be ready
to outrun it.

756
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,507
Here comes the pain.

757
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,708
-Left, right, left, right.
-You're confusing me.

758
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:25,813
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

759
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,519
Shh.

760
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:39,093
I think I'm gonna need rehab.
Oh!

761
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,265
If this is going to work,

762
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,500
these two have to be
on the same page.

763
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,102
I'm out of ideas.

764
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,303
You got any?

765
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,574
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere,

766
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,476
getting beaten up
against my will

767
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,312
by a former celebrity steer.

768
00:42:58,446 --> 00:42:59,747
-Odie?
-Hmm?

769
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,249
Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

770
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:05,386
Odie, can you tell Vic that
I collapsed on this tree first

771
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,921
and that he needs
to find another one?

772
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:11,492
Odie, can you tell my son that
I will gladly find another one

773
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,694
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

774
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,496
Odie, can you tell my father

775
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:16,697
that he wouldn't be
lying in pain

776
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:17,865
if he led a better life

777
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,667
and didn't create problems
for himself?

778
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,037
Could you please inform my son

779
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,006
that he should focus on
fixing his own issues?

780
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,641
Odie? What?

781
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,678
Odie? What'd you do?

782
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:33,481
After all
I've let you do for me.

783
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,950
Hmm. What is this?

784
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,118
Huh?

785
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,387
Hey, watch it!

786
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:44,058
What's the problem, Vic?

787
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:45,860
Is this bothering you?

788
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:46,961
Ooh!

789
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:48,229
No.

790
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:51,832
In fact,
I don't mind it at all.

791
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:56,036
I don't mind it, either.

792
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,239
Ow!

793
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,842
I could watch this all day.

794
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,644
-Stop pulling.
-I'm not. You're pulling.

795
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:06,213
If I was pulling,
you would know it.

796
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:09,316
Why does everything you do
always end up hurting me?

797
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,552
Hurt you?

798
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:13,555
All I ever did was
try to help you.

799
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,256
Oh, you sure? 'Cause
every time you're around,

800
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,657
it ends up with me
in pain. Ow!

801
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,393
Odie, these ropes are
not funny anymore. Ow!

802
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:20,928
Hmm.

803
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:23,831
Maybe if you were a
little more open to seeing me,

804
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,699
things might be
better between us.

805
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,301
Oh, you do remember
you were the one

806
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,736
who left me in an alley, right?

807
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,738
You don't know
what you're talking about.

808
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:33,107
Then please enlighten me.

809
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:37,512
This is about to get real.

810
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:39,180
Oh, that's right,
you're normally never around

811
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:40,481
to actually defend yourself.

812
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:42,483
No back door
to slink out of this time.

813
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:43,884
First you abandon me,

814
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:46,921
then years later, you pull me
into a life of crime.

815
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:49,890
Well, classic "Father
of the Year" stuff, "Dad."

816
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:51,325
You know,
why would I ever think that

817
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,628
seeing you could be anything
other than a train wreck?

818
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,164
I did not leave you
in that alley!

819
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,466
Oh, you did. You told me
you'd come right back.

820
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:01,335
-You never did.
-No.

821
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:03,971
That is not what happened.

822
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:05,306
Oh, please.

823
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,474
You were probably on the run
from someone like Jinx,

824
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,176
and I was in the way.

825
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,277
No.

826
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,948
No, that...
that night...

827
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,785
<i>That night was different.</i>

828
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:43,844
Hey! Shoo, shoo!

829
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:45,412
Get out of here!

830
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,448
Wait here, Junior.

831
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,117
I'll be right back.

832
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,024
Oh, hey, get out of here!

833
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:31,760
Hey, how you doing? Yeah, yeah.

834
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,360
Ah, I had to shoo a cat.
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:34,962
Digging in the trash. Yeah.

836
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:37,031
So what you up to now, huh?

837
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:39,734
Still taking it easy?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

838
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:42,069
Oh, no, you're kidding.

839
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,772
Really?

840
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:45,873
Oh, yeah, yeah.

841
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,575
It's been raining here
for a while now.

842
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,511
Yeah, yeah.

843
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:51,211
Yeah. I'll see you then.

844
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,413
Okay, bye.

845
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,852
Hmm.

846
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,919
I... I never knew.

847
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,689
I know. How could you?

848
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:43,691
Why didn't you ever
come visit me?

849
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,627
I did.

850
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,697
A million times, I...

851
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:51,465
came to knock on your door,

852
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,334
and I'd see what a great life
you had with Jon,

853
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:55,637
so I just...

854
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:59,574
thought it was better
if I kept my distance.

855
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:03,343
I sense a positive breakthrough
in your relationship.

856
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:05,379
Am I wrong?

857
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:08,415
Good.
After an extensive evaluation,

858
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,084
I have concluded
that you two are, in fact,

859
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:13,153
ready to move forward
with this mission.

860
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:14,221
We are?

861
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:15,523
How is that
even possible?

862
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:17,559
Mathematically, it isn't.

863
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:19,761
But given your present levels
of incompetence

864
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:21,261
and overall lack
of basic skills...

865
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:22,463
Huh?

866
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:25,199
...I have determined
it would take roughly...

867
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:28,570
17 years to get you both
properly ready for this job.

868
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:30,337
And since we have...

869
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:33,273
less than 48 hours,

870
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,676
you've passed.

871
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:35,944
Congratulations.

872
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,645
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

873
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:22,322
She's really losing it.

874
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:26,895
Yes, what is it?

875
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:29,162
They're ready to rob the dairy.

876
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,966
Perfect.

877
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,002
Oh, everything is
going to plan.

878
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:35,737
Now it's time to make a call.

879
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:39,974
Excuse me. You keep that thing
in your folds?

880
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:41,843
That is so disgusting.

881
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:44,746
You, you dial the number
and put me on speaker.

882
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:48,983
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello?

883
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:50,985
-Lactose Farms?
<i>-How may I help you?</i>

884
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:53,353
It's come to my attention
that there'll be an attempt

885
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:56,456
to rob one of your
dairy trucks tomorrow.

886
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:59,326
It's not important who I am
or how I came to know this.

887
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:02,062
Just think of me
as a concerned citizen

888
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:04,899
intent on fulfilling
my civic responsibility,

889
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:05,967
as well as...

890
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:12,406
Uh, Chief?

891
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:18,178
We may have a situation.

892
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:22,617
Well, okay, then.
Let's go have a look-see.

893
00:51:27,055 --> 00:51:28,455
This is the third time
they've called.

894
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,526
It just sounds like
some cat prank calling us.

895
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:36,196
If it were a dog barking,
I'd be on board for a prank.

896
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,700
Them dogs are born
for mischief. They just are.

897
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,902
Not cats.

898
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,202
Oh, no.

899
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:45,006
Cats mean business.

900
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:55,215
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>there will be an attempt</i>

901
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,384
<i>to make off with one of</i>
<i>your milk trucks tomorrow.</i>

902
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:59,453
<i>I suggest you take</i>
<i>appropriate measures</i>

903
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:02,255
<i>to prevent this brazen thievery</i>
<i>from occurring.</i>

904
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,224
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

905
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:06,728
<i>Ha ha.</i>
<i>What an evil genius I am.</i>

906
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:10,364
Well, then, still seem like
a prank to you?

907
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,232
Eh, that last part
did a little.

908
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:14,035
What's our next move, Chief?

909
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:17,371
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

910
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:20,273
and formulate
an ingenious plan.

911
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:23,377
And you go get my car waxed.

912
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:26,313
Well, well, well,

913
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,983
would you look at that,
Margie Malone.

914
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:32,152
We're having
company tomorrow.

915
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:35,023
I guess I better take out
my finest china

916
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,257
to serve
a heaping plate...

917
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,193
of justice.

918
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,070
What are those for?

919
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:50,370
For us to communicate

920
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:54,307
once you're inside
the belly of the beast.

921
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,611
Uh... 'kay.

922
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:59,947
Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

923
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,215
Indoor cat.

924
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:03,785
These are better.

925
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,252
It just feels like Bluetooth
would be better.

926
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:06,353
These are better
than Bluetooth.

927
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:07,922
These-these are better
than Bluetooth?

928
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,091
They're equal.

929
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,826
And I don't have to pay
for the brand.

930
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:17,330
Hmm. Hmm?

931
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,901
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk.

932
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,402
-Do you copy?
-Mm-hmm.

933
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,604
Of course you can hear him.

934
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:26,373
He's standing
three feet away from you.

935
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,676
Oh, I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

936
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,579
Now, we just need to find...

937
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:35,183
a way in.

938
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,884
A-Anyone ever told you
that you take a lot of

939
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:38,720
dramatic pauses
when you speak?

940
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:44,025
Yes.

941
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,696
Hey, wait up!

942
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,565
Look at that.

943
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:52,499
Bingo.

944
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,002
Hello, everyone!

945
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:57,370
And welcome to
the one and only

946
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,274
If you will all
gather around me,

947
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,643
we'll begin our tour

948
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,812
and head into
the heart of the farm.

949
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:07,247
I know you're here.

950
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,349
I can feel it.

951
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:12,220
Show yourself.

952
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,155
<i>Today, you will discover</i>

953
00:54:14,287 --> 00:54:15,957
<i>the answers to</i>
<i>all of your dairy questions,</i>

954
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,326
<i>including the most asked</i>
<i>dairy question of all time:</i>

955
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:20,995
<i>are curds the whey?</i>

956
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,664
<i>Bullfrog, Chipmunk,</i>

957
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,166
<i>Roadkill, do you copy?</i>

958
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,135
Are you kidding me?
They actually work?

959
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,669
You should take this
to "Shark Tank."

960
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:30,337
<i>Now, remember,</i>
<i>the only way</i>

961
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,073
<i>to get the keys</i>
<i>to the milk truck</i>

962
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:33,541
<i>and free Ethel undetected</i>

963
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:36,343
<i>is by sticking to the path</i>
<i>I mapped out for you.</i>

964
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:38,613
<i>If you deviate</i>
<i>from that path,</i>

965
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:41,883
<i>you will trigger security</i>
<i>and all bets are off.</i>

966
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:42,984
<i>Understood?</i>

967
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:44,852
All right, look alive.

968
00:54:44,986 --> 00:54:46,087
The electrical access door

969
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,454
should be coming up
on your left.

970
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,690
Okay,
this way.

971
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:51,826
Hey, look. There it is.

972
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:58,099
Okay, we're in.

973
00:54:58,232 --> 00:54:59,466
<i>Continue through and locate</i>

974
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,203
<i>the air vent</i>
<i>at the end of the hallway.</i>

975
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:04,038
<i>That will take you</i>
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

976
00:55:05,273 --> 00:55:06,339
<i>Factory workers,</i>

977
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,075
<i>your 15-minute break</i>
<i>begins now.</i>

978
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:23,456
Oh, your feet
need a deep rinse.

979
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:31,364
What's the holdup, Junior?

980
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,734
How do you get through this?
You're bigger than me.

981
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:35,970
-Am I?
-Yes!

982
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:37,605
Well, the vent doesn't agree.

983
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:40,340
-Try sucking in your gut.
-I am.

984
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,809
Try sucking in
your butt and your gut.

985
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,623
Oh!

986
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:09,270
<i>Bullfrog,</i>

987
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:10,905
what's happening now?

988
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:16,010
We fell out of a vent
into a room that looks like

989
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:17,778
it's full of heavy machinery.

990
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:19,680
<i>Son of a cud.</i>

991
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:22,617
<i>You're in the pine cone.</i>

992
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,822
Jiminy Davis!

993
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:29,290
The perp is a cat!

994
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:31,692
And this one looks like it
could eat us out of business.

995
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:33,294
Oh, Vic! Vic!

996
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:34,562
Look,
there's the loading dock.

997
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,297
No, don't! Junior!
Don't move.

998
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:37,464
What? Why?

999
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,634
We're in the middle
of the pine cone.

1000
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:42,069
Otto told us to stay
out of the pine cone.

1001
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:43,971
Oh, stop.
There's no pine cone.

1002
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,306
Otto's a bit
of a worrywart.

1003
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:46,908
I can walk to
the loading dock from here.

1004
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,643
No!

1005
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:50,845
Junior!

1006
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,919
Mmm. Oh, cheddar.

1007
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:00,121
Probably one of
my top 26 favorite cheeses.

1008
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,188
Huh?

1009
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:02,990
Mmm.

1010
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:04,491
What do you think happens
when that gets to zero?

1011
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:08,495
Whoa!

1012
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:10,264
<i>Bullfrog,</i>
<i>what's happening now?</i>

1013
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:12,199
Roadkill got carried away
into the pine cone.

1014
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,367
Listen to me.

1015
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,969
You have to carry on
with the mission.

1016
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,871
Get to the loading dock
before the workers

1017
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:18,239
return from their break,

1018
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:19,941
or you'll miss your
only chance to get that truck.

1019
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,279
No, no, no!

1020
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:28,783
No, no, no, no!

1021
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,085
<i>Shred sequence initiated.</i>

1022
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:40,528
Odie! Oh.

1023
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:41,696
Oh, thanks, buddy,

1024
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:42,964
but-but I'm pretty full
from the cheddar.

1025
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:45,366
Oh, jump off.

1026
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,001
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

1027
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:57,812
Oh, good. He's safe.

1028
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:01,382
Uh, hang on.

1029
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,017
Wait. Where am I going?

1030
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:05,119
Fondue.

1031
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:07,922
Oh, no!

1032
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:49,830
Junior.

1033
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,143
Junior! Hey!

1034
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:09,518
Oh-ho, hoo!

1035
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,852
That was too close,
even for me.

1036
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:15,589
Thanks.

1037
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:17,091
I couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1038
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:19,960
<i>Workers, your break ends</i>

1039
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,228
<i>in five minutes.</i>

1040
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,232
Okay, Otto,
we're in the loading dock.

1041
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:26,400
Where are the keys?

1042
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:27,536
<i>They should be</i>
<i>hanging on</i>

1043
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:29,303
<i>a pegboard</i>
<i>on the far wall.</i>

1044
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:32,339
What do you mean
we have a problem?

1045
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:33,808
Uh, pegboard's empty.

1046
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:35,009
<i>Empty?</i>

1047
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:36,511
Now, would you

1048
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:38,345
look at this.

1049
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:40,748
Three misguided stray pets

1050
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,716
trying to steal
a truck of milk.

1051
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,787
Never a dull moment at
this dairy, is there, Margie?

1052
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,689
Well, you're looking for these,
aren't you?

1053
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:50,624
Well, here you go, then.

1054
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:56,864
So how's this gonna
play out, fellas?

1055
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:59,133
The easy way
or the hard way?

1056
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,236
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm up for either.

1057
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:06,006
Follow my lead.

1058
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,174
Huh? What?

1059
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:16,350
Who's next, then?

1060
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:19,753
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

1061
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,223
Crazy eyes?
Tragic sense of fashion?

1062
01:00:22,356 --> 01:00:23,357
Yeah. How did you know?

1063
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:24,792
Marge Malone.

1064
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:26,260
<i>Ethel!</i>

1065
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:27,562
<i>Otto!</i>

1066
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,430
She's not just my nemesis.

1067
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,632
She's also my enemy.

1068
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:33,667
Love to hear about it,
but right now, what do we do?

1069
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,102
Get those keys.

1070
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:37,304
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

1071
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,874
Come here, you!

1072
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,285
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style.

1073
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,631
No, no, no, no.
You're not getting away.

1074
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:03,998
I've already called the pound.

1075
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:06,700
Your days of thievery
end today.

1076
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:10,104
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1077
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:13,440
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1078
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:16,143
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1079
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,646
Otto.

1080
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,080
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

1081
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,716
Attempted perimeter breach.

1082
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,186
Junior, sorry about this.

1083
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,720
Sorry? For what?

1084
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:31,992
Vic?

1085
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,468
What are you doing?

1086
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:45,272
Vic!

1087
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:47,708
Don't you go. Vic!

1088
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:50,811
Please!

1089
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:58,352
Send security
to the loading dock.

1090
01:02:08,495 --> 01:02:09,830
Otto.

1091
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:15,903
You do not want
to try me today, mister.

1092
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:28,983
Get him!

1093
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:07,622
Whew.

1094
01:03:07,756 --> 01:03:09,056
Welcome back...

1095
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:12,893
...Victor.

1096
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:18,767
Oh, hey, Jinx.

1097
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:21,536
Why are you here?
I-I was bringing this to you.

1098
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,203
Were you?

1099
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:24,639
Really?

1100
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:25,939
Yeah, of course I was.

1101
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:27,609
That's what
we agreed to, right?

1102
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:28,942
Mm.

1103
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:33,947
So, you and me
square now?

1104
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:36,283
Not quite.

1105
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:39,019
There's still the matter
of those five years

1106
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,455
-I lost because of you.
-What?

1107
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:43,357
But I thought
this settled that.

1108
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,796
It was never about the milk.

1109
01:03:47,928 --> 01:03:50,364
It was about you getting
caught trying to steal it

1110
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,734
and being sent
to the pound.

1111
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:55,169
Like I was.

1112
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:59,039
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer.

1113
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:01,308
Like I did.

1114
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:03,578
Oh.

1115
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:05,714
I see.

1116
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:07,515
And I'm guessing
you have an idea about

1117
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,651
how that should happen.

1118
01:04:09,784 --> 01:04:13,287
As a matter of fact, I do.

1119
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,096
I can't believe
he did that.

1120
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:24,932
He ran out
and he left me.

1121
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:29,002
Again.

1122
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:31,171
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

1123
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,140
it was a lie.

1124
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:35,309
All of it.

1125
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:42,383
How could I have been
so stupid?

1126
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,289
Oh, come on, kid.

1127
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:51,593
Don't beat yourself up.

1128
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:54,796
Vic, man,
we've all been burned by Vic.

1129
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:55,996
Yeah, that's right.

1130
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,533
Burned every cat I know.

1131
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,569
Ah, yeah, the one thing
about Vic you can count on

1132
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:03,470
is that you can't
count on him.

1133
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:04,773
Tell me about it.

1134
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:06,373
Yeah,
I'll tell you about it.

1135
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,878
Long story short,
we all used to run in a pack

1136
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,912
until we had to kick him
out the crew.

1137
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,283
Like I said,
couldn't count on him.

1138
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,519
Sounds about right.

1139
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,420
He'd leave
in the middle of a job

1140
01:05:19,554 --> 01:05:21,321
just to go see his kid.

1141
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:24,091
Yeah, he said he wanted
to check up on him,

1142
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,059
make sure
he was doing okay.

1143
01:05:26,193 --> 01:05:27,361
But get this:

1144
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:28,996
he'd never actually visit.

1145
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,566
He'd just sit across the street
from his kid's house

1146
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:32,901
in a giant oak tree.

1147
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:34,134
That never happened.

1148
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,905
He'd watch that kid
eat and eat and eat...

1149
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:38,540
He'd put a notch
in the bark...

1150
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:41,341
-...and eat and eat...
-...every time he was there.

1151
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:42,844
Oh, yeah. Sure, he did.

1152
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:46,548
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

1153
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,015
Said that it was
his kid's...

1154
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:50,752
Family dinner night.

1155
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,593
Okay, hate to
tell you guys...

1156
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:01,061
I guarantee
that never happened.

1157
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:03,765
Okay? You all fell for
another one of Vic's lies.

1158
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,700
We all have.

1159
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:07,669
Because that's
what he does best.

1160
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,876
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

1161
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:16,678
Quick, pick the lock
on my cage.

1162
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,246
-Garfield, there you are!
-Jon!

1163
01:06:19,379 --> 01:06:21,315
Oh, take me away
from all of this.

1164
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,884
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

1165
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:24,418
You want this one, too?

1166
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,653
Oh, yes, I do.

1167
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:27,287
You sure he's yours?
He didn't have a tag.

1168
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:29,990
Uh-huh, yeah.
Oh, he has a tag.

1169
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:32,392
Huh? I have a collar
and a tag?

1170
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:34,729
-How long have I had those?
-Okay.

1171
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:35,797
I'm just gonna
need you to hold...

1172
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:38,600
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

1173
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,501
The Jon who was on hold
is dead!

1174
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,402
Do you understand?

1175
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:47,140
That's right.
I'm back, baby.

1176
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:52,379
I was just talking about you,
wasn't I?

1177
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:57,050
Oh, I've missed you, too.

1178
01:06:58,485 --> 01:06:59,821
<i>Ah,</i>
<i>coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!</i>

1179
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:01,556
<i>Ah, coochie-coochie-</i>
<i>coochie-coo!</i>

1180
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,695
Pooky!

1181
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:11,031
I have a lot to tell you.

1182
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:13,066
You're never gonna believe it.

1183
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,469
Crazy stuff happened.
I slept outside twice.

1184
01:07:15,937 --> 01:07:16,971
I know. Me.

1185
01:07:17,104 --> 01:07:18,907
Oh, and I got you
this commemorative pin.

1186
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:21,876
Dinner time!

1187
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,377
Talk later.

1188
01:07:39,293 --> 01:07:41,596
Say when.

1189
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,497
Never, Jon.

1190
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,800
Bury me in cheese.

1191
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:49,069
I have two more
in the freezer.

1192
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:50,538
Let me know when you want 'em.

1193
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:53,240
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

1194
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:55,309
Oh, I apologize in advance.

1195
01:07:55,442 --> 01:07:57,779
The eating you're about to see
will not be pretty,

1196
01:07:57,912 --> 01:07:59,279
and if you have
young children,

1197
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:00,982
this would be a good time
for them to leave the room.

1198
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:02,784
Mm-hmm.

1199
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:16,296
<i>He'd just sit</i>
<i>across the street</i>

1200
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,266
<i>from his kid's house</i>
<i>in a giant oak tree.</i>

1201
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,856
Oh, I know, I know.

1202
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,091
We're coming back.

1203
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:46,460
I just need to check
something out first.

1204
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,884
<i>He put a notch in the bark</i>

1205
01:09:11,019 --> 01:09:12,787
<i>every time he was there.</i>

1206
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:31,806
"He left a notch."

1207
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:35,610
Yeah, right.

1208
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:19,252
He was here.

1209
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:21,556
He saw me grow up.

1210
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:26,894
Oh. Ow.
Wow, that really stings.

1211
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:28,629
I don't know why
I didn't think it would.

1212
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,098
Give me a second.

1213
01:10:32,332 --> 01:10:34,301
Vic loves us!
Me first, of course,

1214
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:35,737
but then you, too!

1215
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,972
But me, a lot, and first!

1216
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:41,676
Wait, but if
he loves me-- us--

1217
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:44,979
why would he let me, us,
get captured at the dairy?

1218
01:10:45,113 --> 01:10:46,748
Unless...

1219
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,315
he wanted us to get captured!

1220
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:49,851
Hey, watch it!

1221
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:50,985
Yes, he knew that
Jinx wasn't gonna

1222
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:52,352
let him off the hook,

1223
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:54,488
but if we got caught,
we'd get sent to the pound,

1224
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:56,924
and Jon would
come to get us.

1225
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:58,325
Don't you see, Odie?

1226
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:00,995
He was trying to save us.

1227
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,265
We have to go save my dad.

1228
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:07,902
And here's
your favorite dessert,

1229
01:11:08,035 --> 01:11:10,204
Mount Candy-toa!

1230
01:11:10,337 --> 01:11:12,774
Uh, guys?

1231
01:11:17,145 --> 01:11:19,580
Oh, come on!

1232
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:29,524
What is this?

1233
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,507
Half a star
for Mamma Leoni's?

1234
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:49,010
She's a monster.

1235
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:52,947
She's gonna tie him up,

1236
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,149
take him on a train...

1237
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:56,383
She's going to throw

1238
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:58,286
him off the Mile High Bridge.

1239
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:00,755
We're gonna need help.
Who can we call?

1240
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,089
Hmm.

1241
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,091
Ha.

1242
01:12:04,225 --> 01:12:06,194
Ew. You got
a lot of waxy buildup.

1243
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,095
What's your Q-tip routine?

1244
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,263
You're right, you're right.

1245
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:10,932
We can deal with
that situation later.

1246
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:12,099
Hello?

1247
01:12:12,233 --> 01:12:14,467
Hello? Is anyone there?
Hello?

1248
01:12:18,206 --> 01:12:19,372
<i>Get off the line.</i>

1249
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:21,209
<i>This acorn is for</i>
<i>emergency use only.</i>

1250
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:24,145
Otto. Otto, please, listen.

1251
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:26,314
I want to make good
on our original deal,

1252
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:27,915
but...

1253
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,584
but I need a favor first.

1254
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:34,555
Otto, are you still there

1255
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:36,657
or are you taking
a dramatic pause?

1256
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:40,761
<i>I'm listening.</i>

1257
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:46,200
Hmm.

1258
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:47,635
You know, Vic,

1259
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:51,339
you only have yourself
to blame for this.

1260
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,775
Right. Look.

1261
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:57,778
There's got to be some way
for me to make this right.

1262
01:12:57,912 --> 01:12:59,547
I mean, I know we can
think of something.

1263
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,551
Oh, there is, and you will.

1264
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:19,600
So, once I get on the train,
I untie Vic, and we jump off

1265
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,202
right as the train
gets to the bridge.

1266
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:23,571
Correct. Chipmunk will be
waiting for you.

1267
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:26,807
<i>Confirm</i>
<i>your status, Chipmunk.</i>

1268
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:29,744
If you don't jump

1269
01:13:29,877 --> 01:13:31,078
right as the train
gets to the bridge,

1270
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:33,547
-you'll miss the net.
-Got it.

1271
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:35,448
It's getting close.

1272
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,351
Have you considered
throwing a rope over a branch

1273
01:13:37,484 --> 01:13:39,452
and just swinging onto
the passing train instead?

1274
01:13:39,587 --> 01:13:41,622
-You watch too much TV.
-I've never watched TV.

1275
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:43,891
Well, this way is much better
than your rope idea.

1276
01:13:44,025 --> 01:13:45,559
Better than the versatile,
reliable rope?

1277
01:13:45,693 --> 01:13:46,928
Look, I've studied
the science.

1278
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:48,362
I know what I'm doing.

1279
01:13:48,495 --> 01:13:50,331
And you think you can battle
these villains on your own?

1280
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:52,133
Oh, yeah. I have a plan.

1281
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:53,301
Odie?

1282
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:54,869
<i>Make the order.</i>

1283
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,404
Mm-hmm.

1284
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,340
Now get ready to fling me

1285
01:13:59,472 --> 01:14:01,642
in the direction
of that moving train.

1286
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:09,016
Get ready.

1287
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:12,520
If I don't make it back,

1288
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,056
tell my story. Now!

1289
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:18,659
Roadkill, you're too high.
You're gonna miss it.

1290
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:20,460
No, no,
this is how you do it.

1291
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,063
It's called
the ricochet approach.

1292
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,168
Ooh.

1293
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:28,436
It won't be long now.

1294
01:14:28,569 --> 01:14:30,738
I can't tell you
how excited I am

1295
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:32,373
for what's about
to happen next.

1296
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:37,278
Dad, I'm here
to rescue you.

1297
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:38,478
No, no, no,
no, no, Junior.

1298
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:39,680
-Get out of here.
-I'm gonna untie you,

1299
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:41,082
and we're gonna
jump off the train.

1300
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,316
No.
Just leave me and go.

1301
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,617
I didn't come this far
just to turn around.

1302
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,753
-Let me untie you.
-You're ruining everything.

1303
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:48,556
Quick, this way.

1304
01:14:57,832 --> 01:15:00,801
You half-wit.
Get them!

1305
01:15:10,978 --> 01:15:12,680
Oh!

1306
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:31,699
The bridge is coming up.

1307
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:33,567
We got to get
to the caboose now.

1308
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:36,037
-What? Why?
-Just follow my lead.

1309
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,939
Whoa!

1310
01:15:41,142 --> 01:15:42,476
Ha!

1311
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:47,048
Oi, kitty cat.

1312
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:50,217
Did you expect to take
us on all by yourself?

1313
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:53,721
No. I brought takeout.

1314
01:15:53,854 --> 01:15:55,156
What?

1315
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:56,791
Huh?

1316
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,522
Ow!

1317
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:29,457
Ow!

1318
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,437
I never understood
the purpose of salad

1319
01:16:43,572 --> 01:16:45,906
until this exact moment.

1320
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,141
Whoa.

1321
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:55,015
Go, go! Now!

1322
01:16:55,517 --> 01:16:56,817
Get after him!

1323
01:17:05,926 --> 01:17:07,094
Huh?

1324
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:14,835
Ow!

1325
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:19,673
Yeah, in case
you were wondering,

1326
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:21,375
I do my own stunts.

1327
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,776
Me...

1328
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,112
and Tom Cruise.

1329
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,284
Junior!

1330
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:38,292
Stop him!

1331
01:17:58,245 --> 01:17:59,480
Now, that's amazing.

1332
01:17:59,614 --> 01:18:00,748
I can't feel my tongue.

1333
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:01,849
<i>Roadkill.</i>

1334
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:03,984
Are you at the caboose,
ready to jump?

1335
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,174
Dad!

1336
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:28,577
-Dad!
-Jump, Junior.

1337
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,077
I'll catch you.

1338
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:54,034
Oh!

1339
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,204
What do we do now?

1340
01:18:57,338 --> 01:18:58,339
We do this.

1341
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:03,410
See ya, everyone.

1342
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:10,918
The net's too tight!

1343
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:12,486
Roadkill, the net
is too tight.

1344
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:13,787
I heard.

1345
01:19:20,595 --> 01:19:22,564
Hello again.
Welcome back.

1346
01:19:22,697 --> 01:19:24,765
Now, where were we?

1347
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:35,776
No, no, don't throw them
over just yet.

1348
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,911
Ooh-hoo, I want to find

1349
01:19:38,045 --> 01:19:41,415
the perfect place for them
to make the biggest splat.

1350
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:43,317
Hey, hey, Junior.

1351
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,385
Jun-Junior.

1352
01:19:44,519 --> 01:19:46,854
Get ready. Almost there.

1353
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:49,758
Sorry my rescue
didn't work out.

1354
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:53,294
No, you gave me
another chance.

1355
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:55,162
That's all that matters.

1356
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,605
Now, now!
Drop them now!

1357
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:05,540
What are you waiting for?

1358
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:09,877
Their love for one another
indicates that,

1359
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,046
despite their
current circumstance,

1360
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:13,947
they are at peace.

1361
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:17,151
-Because they are together.
-So?

1362
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:19,754
If the point of your revenge
was to hurt them,

1363
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,922
it has done the opposite.

1364
01:20:22,056 --> 01:20:23,924
It's actually
textbook irony.

1365
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:27,227
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

1366
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,632
You two are still
as weak as you were

1367
01:20:30,765 --> 01:20:32,966
when I found you sniveling
in the pound.

1368
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,469
Oh, no one will adopt us.

1369
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,404
I never grew
into my folds.

1370
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,808
I hide behind them because
I'm socially awkward.

1371
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,308
Please, somebody love me,

1372
01:20:41,442 --> 01:20:43,243
even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

1373
01:20:43,377 --> 01:20:46,113
and have the attention span
of a bloody goldfish!

1374
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:49,016
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

1375
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:51,418
I even spoke
with this ridiculous accent

1376
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,320
to make you feel
more at home.

1377
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:54,689
But no more.

1378
01:20:54,823 --> 01:20:56,725
I'm New York, loud and proud.

1379
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,992
I love myself the way I am,

1380
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:02,029
and I'm a big,
brave boy, baby!

1381
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:04,898
And I've been working on
my attention span.

1382
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:06,467
Is that a hot-air balloon?

1383
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:09,838
You two are

1384
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,239
-worthless!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1385
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,413
Might I just say,

1386
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:54,982
as someone else
with a zaftig figure,

1387
01:21:55,115 --> 01:21:56,751
you have a
beautiful body, sir.

1388
01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:59,554
-Whoa!
-Oh, dear.

1389
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,326
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

1390
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,530
There's something about your
cadence that really throws me,

1391
01:22:08,663 --> 01:22:09,597
but thank you.

1392
01:22:21,776 --> 01:22:22,811
Tee-hee.

1393
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,916
Tossing me off the train.
Did not see that coming.

1394
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:29,316
Well, when you live
in the wild,

1395
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,719
you got to keep your head
on a swivel.

1396
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,822
-Right.
-Mmm.

1397
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,957
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

1398
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:39,627
And that had
bird poop on it.

1399
01:22:39,761 --> 01:22:41,995
Hey. You good, Roadkill?

1400
01:22:42,864 --> 01:22:44,364
Mm, not quite.

1401
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:47,301
There's one last thing
to take care of.

1402
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:48,703
Cut to...

1403
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:58,680
<i>It was a dark and foggy night.</i>

1404
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:03,551
<i>The air was damp and</i>
<i>heavier than a broken heart.</i>

1405
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:05,854
<i>On nights like this,</i>
<i>you can't swing a cat</i>

1406
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:08,121
<i>without hitting</i>
<i>shady characters</i>

1407
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:11,425
<i>making shady deals</i>
<i>all over town.</i>

1408
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:17,532
<i>Oh, but this night</i>
<i>was going to be different.</i>

1409
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:19,934
<i>Justice was about to be served.</i>

1410
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:24,706
<i>With a helping of retribution</i>
<i>on the side.</i>

1411
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:27,509
Is that...
the package?

1412
01:23:27,642 --> 01:23:29,309
It is.

1413
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:32,312
Then we have a deal.

1414
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,785
No one
will come looking for her?

1415
01:23:37,919 --> 01:23:38,853
Nope.

1416
01:23:38,987 --> 01:23:40,053
I did what you said.

1417
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,823
I burned her paperwork,

1418
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:44,224
and then shredded it
and burned it some more.

1419
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,094
It's like she never existed.

1420
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:48,763
Except for the image
of her face

1421
01:23:48,897 --> 01:23:50,598
on millions of
dairy products.

1422
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:10,818
This...

1423
01:24:10,952 --> 01:24:12,587
...never happened.

1424
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:14,421
Agreed.

1425
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,092
Oh, save it, Cat Fancy.

1426
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,528
I know you planned
the milk truck heist

1427
01:24:20,662 --> 01:24:22,195
and then tried to throw
those innocent cats

1428
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,898
off a train to cover it up.

1429
01:24:24,032 --> 01:24:25,867
The boys told me everything.

1430
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:30,237
Mm, mm, mm.

1431
01:24:37,045 --> 01:24:39,346
Oh.

1432
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:44,318
Otto! Oh.

1433
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:51,325
You are my day.

1434
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,394
You are my night.

1435
01:25:30,497 --> 01:25:32,232
Uh... uh...

1436
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:35,502
Well,
this is us.

1437
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:37,772
Right. You're home.

1438
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:42,076
-Hey, listen, uh...
-I just, I just wanted to say

1439
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:43,811
-I'm sorry.
-...I'm sorry.

1440
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:45,445
Wh-What are you sorry for?

1441
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:50,718
For misjudging you.

1442
01:25:50,852 --> 01:25:51,853
Oh.

1443
01:25:52,553 --> 01:25:55,288
Well... thanks.

1444
01:25:55,422 --> 01:25:57,290
Well, I just wanted
to apologize to you for...

1445
01:25:57,424 --> 01:26:00,561
Everything bad that happened
to us the last three days?

1446
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:03,097
You know, you had your hand
in a few bad decisions

1447
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,499
back there, too, but...

1448
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:09,436
Yeah, I'm sorry for
dragging you into my world.

1449
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:12,073
This is where you belong.

1450
01:26:12,205 --> 01:26:14,108
Here with Jon and...

1451
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,144
What's your name
again? Odor?

1452
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:17,912
Hmm?

1453
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,017
So, um, yeah,
I should go.

1454
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:25,119
Yeah, yeah.
Um, I mean, unless...

1455
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:26,921
-you'd want to come in?
-Nah. No, no.

1456
01:26:27,055 --> 01:26:27,989
I don't think
that would work.

1457
01:26:28,122 --> 01:26:29,423
I'm...
I'm an outdoor cat.

1458
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:31,993
Right. Sure, sure.
No, I just, I figured that...

1459
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,161
No, no, no, no,
I get it.

1460
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:35,295
But, you know, uh,
I got this thing

1461
01:26:35,429 --> 01:26:37,765
on the other side of town
I got to go do, so...

1462
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:39,767
No, I'm-I'm very
busy, too. Yeah.

1463
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,637
See you around, then?

1464
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:45,106
-You know where to find me.
-In the kitchen.

1465
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:51,411
Well, take care.

1466
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,015
And remember...

1467
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:55,650
stay out of the pine cone.

1468
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,957
What? You heard him.
It's for the best.

1469
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:04,592
Mm-mm.

1470
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:09,731
Oh!

1471
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:11,165
You're back! What is going on?

1472
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:13,400
Are you okay?
I was so worried.

1473
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:15,136
You know, I was gonna add
more locks to the door,

1474
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:16,671
you know, try to keep you in,
but then I thought,

1475
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:18,773
"Well, what if they wanted
to be outdoor pets?"

1476
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:20,508
Do you want to be
free-range?

1477
01:27:20,641 --> 01:27:21,843
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1478
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:23,811
Oh, I really missed you guys,
and I got to say,

1479
01:27:23,945 --> 01:27:25,079
it's great to be
together again,

1480
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:26,914
-the whole entire family.
-Mmm.

1481
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:28,750
You have no idea
what the last few days

1482
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:30,184
have been like: phone calls

1483
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:31,384
and hold times and tears...

1484
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:33,320
Don't give me that.
I asked him to stay.

1485
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:35,422
He wanted to leave.

1486
01:27:35,556 --> 01:27:36,824
You heard him.
He said he had to...

1487
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,291
Well, I-I...

1488
01:27:39,827 --> 01:27:40,962
-Fine. I'll be right back.
-A family should consist--

1489
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:43,164
Wait! Wait!
What?

1490
01:27:43,296 --> 01:27:45,133
Am I
using trigger words

1491
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:46,466
that I'm not aware of?

1492
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,134
So, you coming in

1493
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:22,435
or do we have to bring food
up there to you?

1494
01:28:27,842 --> 01:28:29,143
I'll come to you.

1495
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:31,478
I just need to finish
something up here.

1496
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,261
You know,

1497
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:50,998
those notches show
how much you love me.

1498
01:28:51,132 --> 01:28:52,867
Is that
what you think they mean?

1499
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,101
Yeah.

1500
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:55,468
Nah,
I was just counting

1501
01:28:55,603 --> 01:28:57,672
how many slices
of lasagna you ate.

1502
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:05,012
<i>My medium is cuisine.</i>

1503
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:08,783
<i>My colors are flavors.</i>

1504
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:11,986
<i>My palette is my palate,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

1505
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:21,963
Dinner is served.

1506
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:29,402
Wow, son, I didn't know
you could cook.

1507
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:31,504
Ah, yes, pasta is my paint

1508
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:35,343
and the dinner plate
my... canvas.

1509
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,612
Oh, that's where that went.

1510
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,555
I've had worse.

1511
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:55,730
Thank you, Garfield.

1512
01:29:58,132 --> 01:29:59,399
Mmm. Mmm. Wow.

1513
01:29:59,533 --> 01:30:01,702
Uh, is he gonna be coming
around for dinner often?

1514
01:30:01,836 --> 01:30:04,672
-Yeah. He's family.
-Whoo!

1515
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:11,646
What? Why do I have
a takeout bill

1516
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,748
for 6,000 drone deliveries?!

1517
01:30:15,049 --> 01:30:16,083
Shh.

1518
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,194
Huh?

1519
01:38:58,038 --> 01:38:59,373
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1520
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:01,876
<i>Shush.</i>
<i>In case you hadn't noticed...</i>
