Mr. Hawkins?

357
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,382
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.

358
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,972
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key

359
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,476
when not in use. And, Doctor, again,

360
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,352
with the greatest possible respect,

361
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,399
zip your howling screamer.

362
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,647
Captain, I assure you I...

363
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,321
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

364
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,948
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

365
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,994
They're... How did
I describe them, Arrow?

366
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,573
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

367
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,786
"A ludicrous parcel
of driveling galoots," ma'am.

-There you go. Poetry.
-Now, see here...

369
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,510
Doctor, I'd love to chat,
tea, cake, the whole shebang,

370
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,756
but I have a ship to launch,

371
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,839
and you've got your outfit to buff up.

372
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,553
Mr. Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes

373
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,884
down to the galley straightaway.

374
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,641
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr. Silver.

375
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,643
What? The cook?

376
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,981
That woman! That feline!

377
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,902
Who does she think
is working for whom?

378
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,026
It's my map,
and she's got me bussin' tables?

379
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,860
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

380
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,913

in this or any galaxy.

391
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,774
Love the outfit, Doc.

Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.

tough getting used to,

399
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,506
but they do come in mighty handy
from time to time.

Oh. Ooh.

00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,614
Oh, don't fuss.

897
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,991
Uh... uh...

898
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,913

00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,018
Are you serious? It's back on the ship?

906
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,982
Stifle that blob and get low.

907
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,481
We've got company.

908
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,364
We need a more defensible position.

909
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,537
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.

910
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,824
Aye, Captain.

00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:56,954

I just want to hug you and squeeze you

00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,587
and hold you close to me.

923
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,924
All right. Okay.
Would you just let go of me?

924
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,599
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

925
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,433
It's just I've been marooned for so long.

I mean, solitude's fun.
Don't get me wrong.

Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?

939
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,713
I got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!

I remember Captain Flint.

Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,231
I think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

when I'm rambling.

But that means... But wait.

948
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,821
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

949
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,448
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

950
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,905

I do. I... Treasure!

to find a place to hide, okay?

Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search,

would you mind if we made a quick

I would've dusted a little more often,

we still have it.

01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,245
at least the part concerning you,

1039
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,083
I didn't mean a word of it.

1040

had thought I'd gone soft,

1043
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:34,981
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

Now, just see here, Jimbo...

1052
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,966
I mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

1053
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,389
Stick to it, right?

1054
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,303
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.

1055
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,226
I'm gonna make sure that you never see

1056
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,645
one drabloon of my treasure!

1057
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,308
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!

1058
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:22,691
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,817
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

1060
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,403
Now, mark me.

1061
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:34,957
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,

1062
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:39,170
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons

01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,137

01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,739
we must stay together and...

1069
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,203
And...

1070
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,367
-Ohh.
-And what? What?

1071
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,790
We must stay together and what?

1072
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:22,251
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.

1073
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,047
She's lost her mind!

1074
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,341
Well, you gotta help her.

1075
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,968
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

1076
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,841
I mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

1077
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,968
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

1078
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,299
You can't help people with a doctorate.

1079
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,885
You just sit there, and you're useless.

1080
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,561
It's okay, Doc.

1081
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,976
It's all right.

1082
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,692
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows
exactly how to get out of this.

1083
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,316
It's just Jimmy
has this knowledge of things.

1084
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,527
Jim, any thoughts at all?

1085
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,278
Without the map, we're dead.

1086
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,743
If we try to leave, we're dead.

1087
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,242
-If we stay here...
-"We're dead!

1088
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,248
"We're dead! We're dead!"

1089
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:09,503
Well, I think that Jimmy
could use a little quiet time. Heh.

1090
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,630
So I'll just slip out the back door.

1091
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,802
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah.

1092
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,727
I get this delightful breeze through here,

1093
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,928
which I think is important,

1094
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,513
because ventilation among friends...

1095
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,145
JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff?

1096
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,021
B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run

1097
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,273
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

1098
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:28,983
Not a clue.

1099
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,441
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think
I found a way out of here!

1100
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,985
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

1101
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,822
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!

(WHISPERING) Okay, here it is.

1106
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,054
We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i>
disable the laser cannons,

1107
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,056
and bring back the map.

1108

(MUFFLED) That's a good plan.

1109
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,725
I like that plan. The only thing is,

1110
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,308
I'm wondering, how do we get there?

1111
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:06,935

It's nagging at the back of my mind.

1244
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,536
Aah!

01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,504
-Captain Flint?
-In the flesh!

1246
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:36,462
Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,

1247
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,468
or anything that, that...
That resembles flesh,

1248
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,174
that's not there.

1249
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,848
And yet it's so odd, you know?

1250
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,305
I remember
there was something horrible

1251
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,607
Flint didn't want anyone else to know,

1252
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,777
but I just can't remember what it was.

1253

It's all flooding back! All my memories!

1263
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,672
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits,

1264
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,679
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

-Speaking of which...
-Huh?

1267
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,982
Flint wanted to make sure

1268
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,354
that nobody could ever
steal his treasure,

1269
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:33,731
so he rigged this whole planet

1270
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,939

I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second,

1408

I could chart my own course.
