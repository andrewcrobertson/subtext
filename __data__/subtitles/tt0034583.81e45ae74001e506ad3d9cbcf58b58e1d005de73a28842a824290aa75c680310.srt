1
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,575
With the coming
of the Second World War

2
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:19,663
many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately

3
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,874
toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,668
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,380
But not everybody could
get to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,259
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,845
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,270
across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:55,282
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa

10
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,118
to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:02,831
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck,

12
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,710
might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,129
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,175
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,426
And wait...

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,011
and wait...

17
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,430
and wait.

18
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,525
To all officers:

19
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:35,030
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

20
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,158
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

21
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:42,454
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

22
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,622
Important.

23
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,905
May we see your papers?

24
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,116
I don't think I have them on me.

25
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,453
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

26
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,663
Yes. Here they are.

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,919
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

28
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,003
Halt!

29
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,798
Halt!

30
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,576
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

31
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,204
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

32
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,123
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

33
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,584
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

34
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,169
The unoccupied desert.

35
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,546
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals,

36
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,383
and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

37
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,307
Along with these unhappy refugees

38
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,270
the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

39
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,853
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

40
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,315
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

41
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,567
This place is full of vultures.

42
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,237
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,000
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all. Au revoir, monsieur.

44
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,283
- Au revoir, madame.
- Au revoir.

45
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,327
What an amusing little fellow.

46
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,410
Waiter.

47
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,957
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,417
- I've left my wallet in the hotel.
- Oh.

49
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,477
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.

50
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,671
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

51
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,590
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

52
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,924
Thank you, thank you.

53
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,094
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca.

54
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,721
Major Strasser.

55
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,598
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

56
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,933
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

57
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,311
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

58
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,937
Captain Tonnelli.

59
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,421
- The Italian service at your command.
- That is kind of you.

60
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,116
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

61
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,912
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

62
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,872
Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.

63
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,290
What else, my dear major?

64
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,334
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

65
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,919
Realizing the importance of the case,

66
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,421
my men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

67
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,423
But we know already who the murderer is.

68
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,425
- Good. Is he in custody?
- There's no hurry.

69
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,761
Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

70
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,514
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

I'll never get out of here.

88
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,660
I'll die in Casablanca.

89
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,289
But can't you make it
just a little more? Please?

90
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,834
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

91
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,628
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

92
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,629
All right.

93
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,757
The trucks are ready.
The men are waiting. Everything is...

94
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,722
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

95
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,226
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here
from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

96
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,938
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

97
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,190
Remember, in cash.

98
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,365
- Cheerio.
- Cheer...

99
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,327
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

100
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,871
Mille grazie, signore.

101
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,415
Red for madame. Black for monsieur.

102
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,004
Um.. Waiter?

103
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:24,921
Yes, madame?

104
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,549
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

105
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,261
He never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

106
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,306
What makes saloonkeepers
so snobbish?

107
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,557
Perhaps if you told him

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,310
I ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

109
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,229
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

110
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,900
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

111
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,069
We have something
to look forward to.

112
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,864
And his father is the bellboy.

113
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,576
- For madame.
- Monsieur.

114
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,827
For monsieur.

115
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,354
Excuse me.

116
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

117
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,735
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...?

118
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,071
I know there is gambling in there.
There is no secret.

119
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,489
You dare not keep me out.

120
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,342
- Yes? What's the trouble?
- This gentleman...

121
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,244
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

122
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,996
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this,

123
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,540
you're very much mistaken.

124
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,417
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

125
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,088
Your cash is good at the bar.

126
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,090
What? Do you know who I am?

127
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,259
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

128
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,345
This is outrageous.
I shall report it to The Angriff.

129
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,809
Heh. Watching you just now
with the Deutsche Bank,

130
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,954
one would think
you've been doing this all your life.

131
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,772
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

132
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,233
But when you first came to Casablanca,
I thought...

133
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,359
You thought what?

134
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,320
What right do I have to think?

135
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,617
May 17?

136
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,622
Too bad about those
two German couriers, wasn't it?

137
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,417
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just two German clerks.

138
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,627
Today they are the honored dead.

139
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,965
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

140
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,091
I forgive you.

141
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,135
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

142
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,778
I forgot, you never drink with anyone.
I'll have another, please.

143
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,805
Yes, monsieur.

144
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,765
You despise me, don't you?

145
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,393
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

146
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,686
But why?

147
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,898
Oh, do you object
to the kind of business I do, huh?

148
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:53,361
But think of all those poor refugees
who must rot here if I didn't help them.

149
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,488
That's not so bad.

150
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,908
Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

151
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,619
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

152
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,040
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

153
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,502
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

154
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,505
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

155
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,800
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

156
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,720
And I'm leaving, finally, this Casablanca.

157
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,556
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

158
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,393
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

159
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,103
Look, Rick.

160
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,147
You know what this is?

161
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,943
Something that even you have never seen.

162
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,196
Letters of transit
signed by General de Gaulle.

163
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,783
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

164
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,700
One moment.

165
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,246
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

166
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,623
And then, addio, Casablanca.

167
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,001
You know, Rick,
I have many a friend in Casablanca,

168
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,963
but somehow, just because you despise me,
you are the only one I trust.

169
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,590
Will you keep these for me, please?

170
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,552
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

171
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,011
I don't want them here overnight.

172
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,471
Don't be afraid of that.

173
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,764
Please keep them for me.

174
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,600
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

175
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,061
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

176
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,855
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.

177
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,939
Yes, monsieur.

178
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,111
Rick, I hope you're more impressed
with me now, huh?

179
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,007
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

180
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,449
Just a moment.

181
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,789
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

182
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,872
Huh?

183
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,170
Oh. Heh. I've heard that rumor too.
Poor devils.

184
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,258
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

209
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,759
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

210
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,929
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

211
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,057
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

212
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,686
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

213
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,105
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

214
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,232
In refugees alone, we could make a fortune

215
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,234
if you'd work with me
through the black market.

216
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,028
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

217
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,073
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

218
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,324
Suppose we do.

219
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,868
When will you realize
that in this world today,

220
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,830
isolationism is no
longer a practical policy?

221
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,290
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

222
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh, I like it fine here.

223
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,127
He'll double what I pay you.

224
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,754
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend
the money I make here.

225
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,881
Sorry.

226
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,886
Boss's private stock...

227
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,014
- because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

228
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,100
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,

229
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,060
because, Yvonne, I love you.

230
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,602
Uh-oh.

231
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,064
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

232
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,818
Some Germans, boom, boom, boom, boom,
gave this check. Is it all right?

233
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,993
- Where were you last night?
- That's so long ago, I don't remember.

234
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,872
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

235
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,083
Give me another.

236
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,711
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

237
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,671
Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.

238
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,400
- Rick, I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

239
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,217
- Yes, boss.
- We're gonna get your coat.

240
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,301
Take your hands off me.

241
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,013
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

242
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,683
Hey, taxi.

243
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,228
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

244
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,230
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

245
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,994
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

246
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,692
- Yes, boss.
- And come right back.

247
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,110
Yes, boss.

248
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,916
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

249
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,251
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

250
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,836
Someday they may be scarce.

251
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,631
I think now
I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

252
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,341
Maybe get her on the rebound, eh?

253
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,968
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

254
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,981
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

255
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,403
The plane to Lisbon.

256
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,701
You would like to be on it?

257
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,829
Why? What's in Lisbon?

258
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,789
The clipper to America.

259
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,459
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

260
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,753
Did you abscond with the church funds?

261
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,797
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

262
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,800
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

263
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,510
It's a combination of all three.

264
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,137
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

265
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,932
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

266
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,018
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

267
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,813
- I was misinformed.
- Hm.

268
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,358
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

269
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,903
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs

270
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,905
and the cashier
would like some money.

271
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,741
I'll get it from the safe.

272
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,505
I'm so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know [...

273
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,413
Forget it, Emil.
Mistakes like that happen all the time.

274
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,914
I'm awfully sorry.

275
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,839
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight.

276
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,522
We're gonna make an arrest in your café.

277
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,509
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

278
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,927
A murderer, no less.

279
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,432
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

280
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,685
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

281
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,483
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

282
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,777
Out of my high regard for you,
we're staging it here.

283
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,404
It will amuse your customers.

284
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,573
Our entertainment's enough.

285
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,910
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

286
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,954
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

287
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,878
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

288
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,542
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

289
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,794
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

290
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,882
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

291
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,091
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

292
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,552
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

293
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,555
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

294
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,098
How observant you are.

295
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,143
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

296
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,226
Yeah?

297
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,229
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

298
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,525
There are many exit
visas sold in this café,

299
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,319
but we know that you've never sold one.

300
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,655
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

301
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,949
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

302
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,867
That is another reason.

303
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,745
There is a man who arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

304
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,581
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

305
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,875
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

306
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,252
Victor Laszlo?

307
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,797
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

308
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,257
Well, he's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

309
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,661
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

310
00:18:55,718 --> 00:19:00,098
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

311
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,308
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

312
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,394
- Manages what?
- His escape.

313
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,646
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

314
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,356
He escaped from
a concentration camp.

315
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,358
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

316
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:14,445
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

317
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,114
Is that a serious offer?

318
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,825
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

319
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,786
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

320
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,997
- Okay.
- Done.

321
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,418
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

322
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,712
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

323
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,381
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

324
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,676
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran,

325
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,886
he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

326
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,222
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

327
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,642
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

328
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,980
Whatever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

329
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:52,692
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell,

330
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,277
you are at heart a sentimentalist.

331
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,072
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

332
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,366
Let me point out just two items:

333
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,120
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

334
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,624
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

335
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,169
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

336
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,629
The winning side
would have paid you much better.

337
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,256
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

338
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,301
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

339
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,761
I have my orders.

340
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,056
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.

341
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,059
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

342
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,604
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

343
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,731
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

344
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,192
- L am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

345
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,360
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

346
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,874
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

347
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,459
I have already given him the best

348
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,170
knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

349
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,633
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

350
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,884
Yes, sir.

351
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,474
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

352
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,607
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

353
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,442
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

354
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,572
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

355
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,784
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot 26,
a good French wine.

356
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,536
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

357
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,998
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

358
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,585
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

359
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,337
I expected no less, captain.

360
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,880
Monsieur Ugarte.

361
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,967
Oh. Yes?

362
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,469
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

363
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,722
May I first please cash my chips?

364
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,649
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

365
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,026
Two thousand.

366
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,116
Thank you.

367
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,423
Rick! Rick, help me!

368
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,818
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me.

369
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,969
Do something! You must help me! Rick!

370
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,598
Do something. Rick! Rick!

371
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,686
Excellent, captain.

372
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,522
When they come to get me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

373
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,983
I stick my neck out for nobody.

374
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,777
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

375
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,987
Everything's all right.

376
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,282
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

377
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,575
Okay, boss.

378
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,622
Rick.

379
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,960
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

380
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,837
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

381
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,215
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

382
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,091
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

383
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,014
We are very honored tonight.

384
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:14,352
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

385
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,521
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

386
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,024
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

387
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,527
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

388
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,239
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

389
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,991
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

390
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,662
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

391
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,498
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

392
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,210
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

393
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,337
There seems to be no secret
about that.

394
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,505
Are you one of those people

395
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,508
who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

396
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,927
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

397
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,929
Can you imagine us in London?

398
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,640
When you get there, ask me.

399
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,433
Diplomatist.

400
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,601
How about New York?

401
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,853
Well, there are
sections of New York, major,

402
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,314
that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

403
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,274
Uh-huh.

404
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,037
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

405
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,570
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

406
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,906
And that takes in the field
of women too.

407
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,409
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

408
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,577
We have a complete dossier on you.

409
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,292
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

410
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,045
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

411
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,839
And also we know why you left Paris.

412
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,008
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

413
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,718
Are my eyes really brown?

414
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,887
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is,

415
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,223
an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca,

416
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,435
and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

417
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,689
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

418
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,609
In this case, you have no sympathy
for the fox, huh?

419
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:49,238
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

420
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,992
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers

421
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,410
until the day we marched in.

422
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,706
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

423
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,459
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

424
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,004
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

425
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,050
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

426
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,887
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

427
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,680
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

428
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,017
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

429
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,809
Perhaps.

430
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,857
Yes, monsieur?

431
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,778
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

432
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,515
Two Cointreaux, please.

433
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,598
Yes, monsieur.

434
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,727
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

435
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,815
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

436
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,859
If we would walk out so soon,
it would only call attention to us.

437
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,863
Perhaps Ugarte
is in some other part of the café.

438
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,158
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

439
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,869
- Well?
- You'll find a market there for this ring.

440
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,163
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

441
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,874
- Thank you, but I hardly think.
- Perhaps for the lady.

442
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,459
The ring is quite unique.

443
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,839
Oh, yes, I'm very interested.

444
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,298
Good.

445
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:32,925
What is your name?

446
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,386
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

447
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
Victor.

448
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,181
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

449
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,976
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

450
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,186
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

451
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,270
I'm sorry, it is.

452
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,276
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

453
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,528
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

454
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,654
Yes, what is it you want?

455
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,074
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

456
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,035
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

457
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,663
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

458
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,666
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

459
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,335
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

460
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,923
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

461
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,384
That was a gross understatement.

462
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,468
You're very kind.

463
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,430
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

464
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,390
Oh, no, Emile.
A bottle of your best champagne.

465
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,868
- And put it on my bill.
- Very well.

466
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,478
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

467
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,856
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

468
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,276
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano.

469
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,653
Somewhere I've seen him.

470
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,405
- Sam?
- Yes.

471
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,491
He came from Paris with Rick.

472
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,909
Rick? Who is he?

473
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,577
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.

474
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,496
- Rick is...
- Is what?

475
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,082
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man
that, well, if I were a woman,

476
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,877
and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

477
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,547
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

478
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,008
Excuse me.

479
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,384
Ah, major.

480
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,723
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

481
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,099
How do you do?

482
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,310
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

483
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,063
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

484
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,232
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

485
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,150
You were a Czechoslovakian.

486
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,402
Now you are a subject
of the German Reich.

487
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,199
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

488
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:24,245
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

489
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,205
This is hardly the time or place.

490
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,290
Then we shall state
another time and place.

491
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,709
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

492
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:31,877
With mademoiselle.

493
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,715
Captain, I am under your authority.

494
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,009
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

495
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:43,097
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

496
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,182
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

497
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,642
Mademoiselle.

498
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,730
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

499
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,651
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

500
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,571
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

501
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,356
I must find out what Berger knows.

502
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,567
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

503
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,921
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

504
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:58,839
- Yes.
- Monsieur?

505
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,257
Champagne cocktail, please.

506
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,886
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

507
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,389
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

508
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,559
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

509
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,728
As you see,
it was true every single time.

510
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,938
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

511
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,609
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

512
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,862
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

513
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,116
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

514
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,825
I see.

515
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:32,498
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

516
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,958
Underground, like everywhere else.

517
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,419
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

518
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,296
If you will come...

519
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,547
Monsieur.

520
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,646
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

521
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,272
Very well, mademoiselle.

522
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,612
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

523
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,364
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

524
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,783
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

525
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,493
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

526
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,788
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

527
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,914
Yes, sir.

528
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,628
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss llsa.

529
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,172
I never expected to see you again.

530
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,300
It's been a long time.

531
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,429
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

532
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,267
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

533
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,402
Where is Rick?

534
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,322
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

535
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,577
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

536
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,911
He went home.

537
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,000
- Does he always leave so early?
- Oh, he never...

538
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,711
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

539
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,254
Goes up there all the time.

540
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,259
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

541
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,388
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.

542
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,311
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

543
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,979
I don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.

544
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,690
Play it, Sam.

545
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,985
Play "As Time Goes By."

546
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,280
I can't remember it, Miss llsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

547
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,491
I'll hum it for you.

548
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,213
Sing it, Sam.

00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,052

Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

560
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:47,109
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present...

561
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,444
- Hello, llsa.
- Hello, Rick.

562
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,115
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also...

563
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,825
This is Mr. Laszlo.

564
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,188
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

565
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,704
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

566
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,831
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

567
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,041
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

568
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,167
Thanks, I will.

569
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:08,130
Well, a precedent is being broken.
Emile.

570
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:12,676
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

571
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,219
- What for?
- Your work.

572
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,054
Thank you. I try.

573
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,932
We all try. You succeed.

574
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,810
I can't get over you two.
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,

575
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,187
in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

576
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,315
I wasn't sure you were the same.

577
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,027
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

578
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,697
How nice. You remembered.

579
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,450
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

580
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,620
- Not an easy day to forget.
- No.

581
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,332
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

582
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,752
Yes. I put that dress away.

583
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,880
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

584
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,926
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

585
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,471
Lisa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

586
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,807
Soitis.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

587
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,353
It would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

588
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,481
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

589
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,483
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

590
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,070
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

591
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,531
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

592
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,284
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

593
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,411
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

594
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,708
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

595
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,794
He hasn't played it in a long time.

596
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,090
- Good night.
- Good night.

597
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,257
Good night.

598
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,227
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

599
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,522
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

600
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,983
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

601
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,484
- Good night.
- Good night.

602
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,107
Boss?

603
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,739
- Boss?
- Yeah?

604
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,701
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

605
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,784
Ain't you planning to go to bed
in the near future?

606
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,996
No.

607
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,956
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

608
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,250
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

609
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,335
Good, then have a drink.

610
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,379
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

611
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,089
Boss, let's get out of here.

612
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,759
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

613
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,511
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

614
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,555
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

615
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,724
We'll take the car and drive all night.

616
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,477
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

617
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,981
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

618
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,448
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

619
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,701
Well, that's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

620
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,413
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

621
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:33,210
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

622
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,293
What?

623
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,505
My watch stopped.

624
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,091
I bet they're asleep in New York.

625
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,219
I bet they're asleep all over America.

626
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,771
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world,

627
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,398
she walks into mine.

628
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,617
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

629
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,870
- Stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

630
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,289
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

631
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,209
- I don't think I can remember...
- If she can stand it, I can.

632
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:15,877
Play it.

633
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,921
Yes, boss.

634
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,056
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

635
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,141
What did you do,
and what did you think, huh?

636
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,518
We said no questions.

637
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,108
Here's looking at you, kid.

638
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,269
A franc for your thoughts.

639
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,105
In America they'd bring only a penny.

640
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,024
I guess that's about all they're worth.

641
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:47,529
Well, I'm willing to be
overcharged. Tell me.

642
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,948
Well, I was wondering.

643
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,117
Yes?

644
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,496
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

645
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,667
- Why there is no other man in my life?
- Uh-huh.

646
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,421
That's easy. There was.

647
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,590
He's dead.

648
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,385
I'm sorry for asking.

649
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,638
I forgot we said no questions.

650
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:21,271
Well, only one answer can
take care of all our questions.

651
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,736
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

652
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,822
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

653
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,743
I'm on their blacklist already.

Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

664
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,668
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne

665
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,670
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

666
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,173
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

667
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,800
You said it.

668
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,427
Here's looking at you, kid.

669
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,873
My German's a little rusty.

670
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,750
It's the Gestapo.

671
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,088
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

672
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,926
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

673
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,725
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

674
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,727
It's pretty bad timing.

675
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,230
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

676
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,609
Let's see.

677
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,529
Yes, I was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

678
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,573
Looking for a job.

679
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,789
Was that cannon fire?

680
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,292
Or is it my heart pounding?

681
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:34,005
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

682
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,509
And getting closer every minute.

683
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:41,012
Here, here, drink up.

684
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,931
We'll never finish the other three.

685
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,726
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

686
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,811
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

687
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:51,648
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

688
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,775
It's strange.

689
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:58,696
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

690
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,949
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

691
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,953
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

692
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,579
No, we must leave.

693
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,040
Yes, of course. We.

694
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,794
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

695
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,089
No, no. Not at my hotel. I...

696
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,467
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

697
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,095
I'll meet you at the station.

698
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,639
All right, at a quarter to 5.

699
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,516
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

700
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,227
-Oh.

701
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,022
That's too far ahead to plan.

702
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,108
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

703
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,004
Let's see. What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

704
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,113
Oh, darling.

705
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,825
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

706
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,328
Hey. Hey, what's wrong, kid?

707
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,503
I love you so much.

708
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,341
And I hate this war so much.

709
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:05,346
Oh, it's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

710
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,391
If you shouldn't get away...

711
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,268
I mean if...

712
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,021
If something should keep us apart,

713
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,149
wherever they put you

714
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,985
and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

715
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,117
Kiss me.

716
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,953
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

717
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:58,274
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

718
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,063
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

719
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,994
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

720
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,996
But this note came just after you left.

721
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,805
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

722
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,015
Do you hear me?

723
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,644
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

724
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,740
- Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Uh-huh.

725
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:33,077
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

726
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,456
- No, Rick. Not tonight. Please.
- Especially tonight.

727
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,835
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

728
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,671
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

729
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,424
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

730
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,094
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

731
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,889
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

732
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,058
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Please don't. Don't, Rick.

733
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,103
- I can understand how you feel.
- Huh.

734
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,773
You understand how I feel.

735
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,400
How long was it we had, honey?

736
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,445
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

737
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,113
Every one of them.

738
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,949
Mostly I remember the last one.

739
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:16,788
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain

740
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,414
with a comical look on his face

741
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,750
because his insides
have been kicked out.

742
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,754
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

743
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,547
Does it got a wild finish?

744
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,509
I don't know the finish yet.

745
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,346
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

746
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,894
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

747
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,938
At the house of some friends

748
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,982
she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

749
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,901
A very great and courageous man.

750
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,571
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world

751
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,658
full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

752
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,869
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

753
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,497
And she looked up to him

754
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,290
and worshiped him

755
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,293
with a feeling
she supposed was love.

756
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,254
Yes, that's very pretty.

757
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:10,466
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

758
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,553
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano

759
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,930
playing in the parlor downstairs.

760
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:21,435
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," it'd always begin.

761
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,774
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

762
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:28,817
Tell me,

763
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,696
who was it you left me for?

764
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,824
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between?

765
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,910
Or aren't you the kind that tells?

766
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,856
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

767
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,567
I would suggest you search the café
immediately and thoroughly.

768
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,612
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

769
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,822
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

770
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,950
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

771
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:19,869
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

772
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:23,205
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

773
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,084
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

774
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,421
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

775
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,970
There is nothing we can do.

776
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,642
I'm delighted to see you both.
Did you have a good night's rest?

777
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:43,559
I slept very well.

778
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:46,520
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

779
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,232
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

780
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,359
Thank you.

781
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:57,073
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

782
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:00,159
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

783
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,744
You have reached Casablanca.

784
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,705
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

785
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,832
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

786
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,835
Not at all. Renault's signature
iS necessary on every visa.

787
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,630
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

788
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,132
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

789
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,969
Well, perhaps I shall like it
in Casablanca.

790
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,178
And mademoiselle?

791
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,432
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

792
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,519
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

793
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,813
You may be
in Casablanca indefinitely.

794
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,482
Or you may leave
for Lisbon tomorrow.

795
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,818
- On one condition.
- And that is?

796
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,321
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague,

797
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,864
in Brussels, in Amsterdam,

798
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,325
in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.

799
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:44,078
- Even in Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

800
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,248
If you will furnish me
with their names and whereabouts,

801
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,811
you'll have your visa in the morning.

802
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,711
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

803
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,089
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

804
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,551
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

805
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,680
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp,

806
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,808
where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal,

807
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,935
I certainly won't give them to you now.

808
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:11,605
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

809
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,441
What if you murdered all of us?

810
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:17,820
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

811
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,197
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

812
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:24,160
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

813
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,828
But in one respect you are mistaken.

814
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,539
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

815
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,207
But there is one exception.

816
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,500
No one could take your place

817
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,961
if anything unfortunate
should occur to you

818
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,963
while you were trying to escape.

819
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,758
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

820
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,468
This is still unoccupied France.

821
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,679
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

822
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,557
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

823
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,394
By the way, monsieur, last night,
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

824
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,273
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

825
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,860
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

826
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,572
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

827
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,407
Signor Ugarte is dead.

828
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,950
Oh.

829
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,499
I'm making out the report now.

830
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,376
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide

831
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,796
or died trying to escape.

832
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:21,383
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

833
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,467
Good day.

834
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,017
Undoubtedly, their next step
will be to the black market.

835
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,352
Excuse me, captain.

836
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,521
Another visa problem has come up.

837
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,774
- Show her in.
- Yes, Sir.

838
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:49,578
Sorry, monsieur, we won't be able
to handle the police.

839
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,289
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

840
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:55,042
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

841
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,753
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

842
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,755
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

843
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,632
Thanks.

844
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,604
Don't be too downhearted.

845
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,857
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

846
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,233
Thank you very much, signor.

847
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,694
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

848
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,363
I see the bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

849
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,573
I'll have it sent over.

850
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,467
- Have a drink.
- L never drink in the morning.

851
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,953
And every time you send my shipment over,
it's a little short.

852
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,164
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

853
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,582
Here, sit down.

854
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,168
There is something
I want to talk over with you, anyhow.

855
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,251
Bourbon.

856
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:41,297
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

857
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,508
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

858
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:48,179
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead,

859
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,889
and no one knows where
those letters are.

860
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,390
Practically no one.

861
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,101
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

862
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,187
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

863
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,480
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

864
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,357
I'll handle the entire transaction.

865
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:03,235
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

866
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,945
And the carrying charges?

867
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,948
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

868
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,993
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

869
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,870
I'll tell him when he comes in.

870
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,539
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

871
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:19,627
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

872
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,843
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

873
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:31,055
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

874
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,807
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

875
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,852
Morning.

876
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,648
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

877
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,239
You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

878
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,657
Only 700 francs.

879
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,868
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

880
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:56,455
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

881
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,124
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

882
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,711
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

883
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:03,879
Doesn't matter.

884
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:08,092
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

885
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:11,428
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

886
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,013
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

887
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,183
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

888
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:19,937
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

889
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,063
Yes.

890
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,732
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

891
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,192
I don't think I will, Rick.

892
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,379
Why not? After all,
I got stuck with a railway ticket.

893
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,988
I think I'm entitled to know.

894
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,991
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

895
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:36,245
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

896
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,414
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

897
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:43,294
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

898
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,589
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

899
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:49,757
If we leave it that way,

900
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,469
maybe we'll remember those days
and not Casablanca.

901
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,347
Not last night.

902
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:59,143
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

903
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,271
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

904
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,064
You can believe that if you want to.

905
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,067
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

906
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,153
Above a saloon, it's true,

907
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,738
but walk up a flight.

908
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,323
I'll be expecting you.

909
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:17,494
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

910
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,038
You'll be there.

911
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,914
No, Rick.

912
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,086
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

913
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,381
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

914
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,515
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

915
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,475
Oh.

916
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,602
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

917
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,063
As leader of all illegal activities
in Casablanca,

918
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,898
I am influential and respected.

919
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,860
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

920
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,779
You, however, are a different matter.

921
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,824
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

922
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,245
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

923
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:03,374
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

924
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,334
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

925
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:09,129
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

926
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,632
We are only interested in two visas.

927
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,009
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor. No.

928
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,428
You two will want to discuss this.

929
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:18,764
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

930
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,436
No, llsa.
I won't let you stay here.

931
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,773
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

932
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,025
But if the situation were different,

933
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,820
if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one,

934
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:33,987
would you take it?

935
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,281
Yes, I would.

936
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,742
Yes, I see.

937
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:43,789
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

938
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,125
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks

939
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,003
and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

940
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,799
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

941
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,761
I love you very much, lisa.

942
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,014
Your secret will be safe with me.

943
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,226
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

944
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,019
Not more than 50 francs.

945
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,402
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

946
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,738
For the present, we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

947
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,199
Well, good luck, but be careful.

948
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,011
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

949
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,330
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

950
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:28,208
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

951
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,627
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

952
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,963
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

953
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,007
Yes, something.

954
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,593
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

955
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,554
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

956
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,682
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

957
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,684
Rick?

958
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,687
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

959
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,189
But it is worth a chance.

960
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,275
Thank you very much.
Good day.

961
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,195
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

962
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,280
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

963
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,200
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

964
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,826
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

965
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,338
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

966
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,090
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

967
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:21,094
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

968
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,263
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

969
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,807
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

970
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,434
I'm sorry.

971
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,745
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

972
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,667
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

973
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,710
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

974
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:56,004
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

975
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,382
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

976
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,425
I told Strasser
he wouldn't find the letters here.

977
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,928
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

978
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,180
You know how that impresses Germans.

979
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,142
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

980
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,770
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

981
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,399
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

982
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,027
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

983
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,120
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

984
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,707
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

985
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,919
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

986
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:37,629
Sascha!

987
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,548
French 75s.

988
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:43,510
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

989
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,970
We will begin with two.

990
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,231
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

991
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:59,484
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

992
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:09,453
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

993
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,417
You see, captain?

994
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,961
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

995
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:20,047
We try to cooperate
with your government.

996
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,466
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

997
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,968
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

998
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:27,471
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

999
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,014
I blow with the wind.

1000
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,516
And the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

1001
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,018
And if it should change?

1002
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,687
Surely the Reich
doesn't admit that possibility.

1003
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,981
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

1004
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:42,110
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

1005
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,030
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

1006
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,573
A leader? Like Laszlo?

1007
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:48,950
Mm-hm. I have been thinking.

1008
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,371
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

1009
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,454
I see what you mean.

1010
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,421
-Thank you, Carl.

1011
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:02,923
Thank you, Carl.

1012
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,967
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

1013
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,720
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

1014
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:09,930
Thank you very much.

1015
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,016
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy

1016
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,726
and a third glass.

1017
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,812
At last, the day is came!

1018
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,190
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

1019
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,859
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

1020
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:24,861
A very nice idea.

1021
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,154
To America.

1022
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,197
To America.

1023
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,117
To America.

1024
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,622
Liebchen, uh, sweetness heart.

1025
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:36,706
What watch?

1026
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,877
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

1027
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,840
You will get along beautifully in America.

1028
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:47,884
How is lady luck treating you?

1029
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:49,219
Oh, too bad.

1030
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,555
You'll find him over there.

1031
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,938
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

1032
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,066
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

1033
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,736
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

1034
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,279
My husband is with me too.

1035
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,282
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

1036
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,283
Will you have a drink?

1037
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,326
- No, of course not. You mind if I do?
- Oh, no.

1038
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,331
Monsieur Rick,
what kind of a man is Captain Renault?

1039
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,460
- Like any other man, only more so.
- No, I mean...

1040
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,336
Is he trustworthy? Is his word...?

1041
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,797
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

1042
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,424
He did. Captain Renault did.

1043
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,801
I thought so. Where's your husband?

1044
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:34,514
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

1045
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,516
Oh, of course he's losing.

1046
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,352
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

1047
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,938
We come from Bulgaria.

1048
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,066
Things are very bad there.

1049
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,068
The devil has the people
by the throat.

1050
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,821
So Jan and I, we...

1051
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,074
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

1052
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,577
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

1053
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,496
But we haven't much money,

1054
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,166
and traveling is so
expensive and difficult.

1055
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,460
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

1056
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:08,006
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

1057
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,633
Yes, I'll bet.

1058
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,010
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

1059
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,221
But we have no money.

1060
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,306
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

1061
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,642
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

1062
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,645
- And you want to know...
- Will he keep his word?

1063
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:23,938
He always has.

1064
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:25,982
Oh.

1065
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,152
Monsieur,

1066
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:30,362
you are a man.

1067
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,865
If someone loved you very much

1068
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:37,661
so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world,

1069
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,373
but she did a bad thing
to make certain of it,

1070
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,335
- could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

1071
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,798
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart,

1072
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,361
that would be all right, wouldn't it?

1073
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,219
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

1074
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,303
Go back to Bulgaria.

1075
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:59,224
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America.

1076
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:05,480
Oh, but if Jan should find out...
He is such a boy.

1077
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:08,650
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

1078
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,486
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

1079
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,489
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

1080
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,708
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1081
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,001
You see? Here we are again.

1082
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,253
I take that
as a great compliment to Sam.

1083
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:31,673
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

1084
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,594
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

1085
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,096
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

1086
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,141
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

1087
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,059
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,978
Right this way, if you please.

1089
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,857
I'l have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

1090
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,066
Thank you.

1091
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,369
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

1092
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,771
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1093
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,482
No. No, I guess not.

1094
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,275
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1095
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,236
I said 22.

1096
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,712
Leave it there.

1097
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,562
Cash it in and don't come back.

1098
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,359
Are you sure this place is honest?

1099
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:18,321
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1100
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:22,867
How are we doing tonight?

1101
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:26,371
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1102
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,042
Monsieur Rick.

1103
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,795
[... Oh.

1104
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,383
He's just a lucky guy.

1105
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,139
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

1106
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,266
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick.

1107
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,104
Captain Renault, may I...?

1108
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:55,525
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

1109
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,986
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

1110
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,321
I'm very happy for both of you.

1111
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,907
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1112
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,201
Well, maybe not so strange.

1113
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,079
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

1114
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,539
Nol!

1115
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,964
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1116
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,259
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1117
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,814
As I suspected,
you're a rank sentimentalist.

1118
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:35,774
Yeah? Why?

1119
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:37,984
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

1120
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,986
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1121
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,863
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

1122
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,824
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

1123
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:47,035
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

1124
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,245
Mm-hm.

1125
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,416
Monsieur Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you.

1126
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,419
- Go ahead.
- Well, isn't there some other place?

1127
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,463
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1128
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,592
- In my office.
- Right.

1129
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,638
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1130
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,141
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

1131
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:11,851
You know what I've been doing.

1132
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:16,314
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people

1133
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,399
that I reach America
and continue my work.

1134
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,984
I'm not interested in politics.

1135
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,779
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

1136
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,030
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1137
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:27,909
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

1138
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,619
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1139
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,704
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

1140
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:32,664
What of it?

1141
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:36,042
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

1142
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,169
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.

1143
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:41,172
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1144
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:44,259
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1145
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,178
- I1 appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

1146
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,223
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1147
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,058
My answer would still be the same.

1148
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,394
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1149
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,478
There is.

1150
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:57,856
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1151
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:01,276
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1152
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,278
- My wife?
- Yes.

1153
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,239
[men singing "Die Wacht Am Rhein"

1154
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,529
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1155
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,590
Vive la France!

1156
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,776
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence
in a café can inspire this demonstration,

1157
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,279
what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1158
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,614
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1159
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,701
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1160
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:15,910
The place is to be closed.

1161
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:18,288
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1162
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,208
- Santé, monsieur.
- Santé.

1163
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,795
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1164
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,214
This café is closed until further notice.

1165
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,716
Clear the room at once.

1166
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,804
How can you close me up?

1167
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:38,725
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1168
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,685
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1169
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:41,978
Everybody out at once.

1170
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:50,653
After this disturbance, it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1171
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,448
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1172
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:56,659
That is also true, except for one
destination. To return to occupied France.

1173
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:59,579
- Occupied France?
- Mm-hm. Under safe conduct from me.

1174
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:00,747
Of what value is that?

1175
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,958
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1176
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:07,378
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1177
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,839
The French authorities may find a reason

1178
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,841
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1179
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,176
The other alternative?

1180
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,636
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed

1181
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,056
that in Casablanca, human life is cheap.

1182
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,515
Good night, mademoiselle.

1183
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:24,144
Garcon?

1184
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,945
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1185
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,638
Our faithful friend is still there.

1186
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,016
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1187
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,142
I must.

1188
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:06,729
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1189
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:10,441
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1190
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:12,360
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1191
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:15,196
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1192
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,864
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1193
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:19,158
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1194
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,788
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1195
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,124
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1196
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:27,959
But no intention of selling them.

1197
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,562
One would think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1198
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,631
Did he give any reason?

1199
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:37,093
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1200
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,679
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1201
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,014
I don't know why he said that.

1202
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,280
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1203
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,491
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1204
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:05,037
- Llsa, I...
- Yes?

1205
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,249
When I was in the concentration camp,

1206
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,751
were you lonely in Paris?

1207
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,173
Yes, Victor, I was.

1208
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,009
I know how it is to be lonely.

1209
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,013
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1210
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,517
No, Victor, there isn't.

1211
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,648
I love you very much, my dear.

1212
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:36,110
Yes.

1213
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,446
Yes, I know.

1214
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,658
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1215
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,535
You don't even have to say it.

1216
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,496
I'll believe.

1217
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:50,541
Good night, dear.

1218
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:53,878
Good night.

1219
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:02,052
Victor.

1220
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,596
Yes, dear?

1221
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,269
Be careful.

1222
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,439
Of course I'll be careful.

1223
01:18:56,983 --> 01:19:00,027
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1224
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:01,946
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1225
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,990
Two weeks, maybe three.

1226
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,409
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1227
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,245
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1228
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:10,580
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1229
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,833
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1230
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:17,503
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1231
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:20,590
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1232
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:21,924
I won't.

1233
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,176
Good night.

1234
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:26,887
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1235
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,074
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1236
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:50,494
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1237
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:51,912
Well, won't you sit down?

1238
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:56,000
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1239
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:59,503
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1240
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:02,381
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1241
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:05,176
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1242
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:07,970
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1243
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,222
I know how you feel about me,

1244
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,309
but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1245
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,770
Do I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is,

1246
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,938
what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1247
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,732
It was your cause too.

1248
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,234
In your own way,
you were fighting for the same thing.

1249
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,529
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1250
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:27,698
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1251
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:33,913
Richard.

1252
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,833
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1253
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,711
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1254
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:44,340
Please, listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1255
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,592
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you told me.

1256
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:48,886
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1257
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,893
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1258
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:00,314
With so much at stake,
all you can think of is your own feeling.

1259
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:01,524
One woman has hurt you,

1260
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,943
and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1261
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,570
You're a coward and a weakling.

1262
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:13,369
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1263
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,456
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1264
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,376
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1265
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:21,544
What of it?

1266
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,505
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1267
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:33,013
Now, if you'll...

1268
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,934
All right.

1269
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,394
I tried to reason with you.

1270
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,355
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1271
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:44,900
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1272
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:48,279
Put them on the table.

1273
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:51,281
No.

1274
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:54,452
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1275
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:59,749
If Laszlo and the cause mean so
much to you, you won't stop at anything.

1276
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,085
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1277
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,424
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1278
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,306
Richard.

1279
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:17,850
I tried to stay away.

1280
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,978
I thought I would never see you again.

1281
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,523
That you were out of my life.

1282
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:47,338
The day you left Paris...

1283
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:51,050
if you knew what I went through.

1284
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,887
If you knew how much I loved you.

1285
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,641
How much I still love you.

1286
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,280
And then?

1287
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,954
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1288
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,707
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1289
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,168
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1290
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:29,004
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp.”

1291
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,842
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1292
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,260
Then it came.

1293
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,470
He was dead. Shot trying to escape.

1294
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,266
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1295
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,018
Then I met you.

1296
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,689
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1297
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:50,276
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1298
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,695
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1299
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,115
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1300
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,743
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife,
it would be dangerous for me

1301
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,287
and for those working with us.

1302
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,248
And when did you first
find out he was alive?

1303
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:07,835
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1304
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,045
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1305
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:13,465
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1306
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,010
He was sick. He needed me.

1307
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:20,180
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1308
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:24,351
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1309
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,478
Well...

1310
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,148
Well, you know the rest.

1311
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,361
Well, it's still a story
without an ending.

1312
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,613
What about now?

1313
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:38,907
Now?

1314
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,035
I don't know.

1315
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,788
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1316
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,082
And Laszlo?

1317
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:50,669
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1318
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,505
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1319
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,799
All except one.

1320
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,677
He won't have you.

1321
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,598
I can't fight it anymore.

1322
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,685
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1323
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,025
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1324
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,985
You have to think for both of us.

1325
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,196
For all of us.

1326
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:23,160
All right. 1 will.

1327
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,291
Here's looking at you, kid.

1328
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,796
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1329
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:49,144
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1330
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,980
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1331
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:52,606
Come inside.

1332
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:00,531
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1333
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:02,616
Thank you.

1334
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:07,121
I'll give you some water.

1335
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,219
Carl, what happened?

1336
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,305
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1337
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,182
We escaped at the last moment.

1338
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:29,601
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1339
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,230
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1340
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:35,816
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1341
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,610
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1342
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:49,163
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1343
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:03,844
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1344
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:05,971
This might come in handy.

1345
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:07,055
Thank you.

1346
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:09,767
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1347
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,271
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1348
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:16,815
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1349
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,194
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1350
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,695
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1351
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,947
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1352
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,450
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1353
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:28,636
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1354
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,091
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself

1355
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:33,082
of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1356
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:37,211
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1357
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,047
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1358
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:43,967
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself,

1359
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:45,469
and that you'll never succeed.

1360
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,013
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1361
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,601
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1362
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,978
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1363
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:57,147
It's perhaps a strange circumstance

1364
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:59,399
that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1365
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:02,361
The first evening I came into this café,

1366
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:04,696
I knew there was something
between you and lisa.

1367
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:07,116
Since no one is to blame,

1368
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,118
I demand no explanation.

1369
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,455
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1370
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,040
All right.

1371
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:16,583
But I want my wife to be safe.

1372
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:18,836
I ask you as a favor

1373
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:21,255
to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1374
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,048
You love her that much?

1375
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:26,093
Apparently you think of me
only as the leader of a cause.

1376
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,138
Well, I am also a human being.

1377
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:31,598
Yes, I love her that much.

1378
01:28:39,273 --> 01:28:40,899
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1379
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,610
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1380
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:44,736
On what charge?

1381
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,864
Captain Renault
will discuss that with you later.

1382
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:49,783
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1383
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:05,966
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1384
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:08,760
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1385
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,164
You might as well let him go now.

1386
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:13,432
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1387
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,017
If you were to help him escape...

1388
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,561
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1389
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,355
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1390
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:23,650
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1391
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,695
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1392
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,906
-As a matter of fact, I don't either.

1393
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,199
They're all excellent reasons.

1394
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,451
Don't count too much
on my friendship.

1395
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,996
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1396
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:40,250
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1397
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:42,753
Yes, I have the letters.

1398
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,005
But I intend using them myself.

1399
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:46,924
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane.

1400
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,717
- The last plane.
- Oh?

1401
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,887
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1402
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,056
- What friend?
- Llsa Lund.

1403
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:57,851
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1404
01:29:57,935 --> 01:29:59,853
The last man I want to see in America.

1405
01:29:59,937 --> 01:30:03,398
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1406
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,193
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1407
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,613
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1408
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:13,325
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to lisa and me.

1409
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,953
We have a legal right to go, that's true,

1410
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:19,289
but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1411
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,833
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1412
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,210
Lisa is Laszlo's wife.

1413
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:26,421
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1414
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:28,131
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1415
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,635
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big,

1416
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:35,180
something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years.

1417
01:30:35,264 --> 01:30:37,683
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1418
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:40,185
Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

1419
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:41,436
Then release him.

1420
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,273
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1421
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,984
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters

1422
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,569
and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1423
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:52,364
You get him, and we get away.

1424
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,242
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1425
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:58,245
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1426
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:01,373
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes,

1427
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,333
but you were never interested
in any woman.

1428
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:06,378
- Well, she isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1429
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:09,339
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1430
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:12,259
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1431
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:13,635
I'm gonna miss you.

1432
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:17,097
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1433
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,390
Oh, thanks.

1434
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:20,392
Go ahead, Ricky.

1435
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,228
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1436
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,272
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1437
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,524
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1438
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,617
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1439
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:41,204
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1440
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:45,000
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and
go to America. You're a lucky man.

1441
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:49,880
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1442
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:53,258
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1443
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:56,428
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1444
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,264
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1445
01:31:59,348 --> 01:32:00,932
Well, so long.

1446
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,727
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1447
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,812
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1448
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,224
You're late.

1449
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:45,727
I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel,
so I knew I'd be on time.

1450
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:49,064
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1451
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,066
This place will never be
the same without you.

1452
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:54,861
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1453
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:57,906
- Is everything ready?
- L1 have the letters right here.

1454
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,200
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1455
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:01,326
Sam's piano.

1456
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,162
-Serves me right for not being musical.

1457
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,831
Here they are.

1458
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,541
You better wait in my office.

1459
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:17,134
Here.

1460
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,845
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1461
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:20,929
Not yet.

1462
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,806
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1463
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,089
Everything is quite all right.

1464
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:27,436
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1465
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,895
Please trust me.

1466
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,649
Yes, I will.

1467
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:41,825
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1468
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:47,122
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1469
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:49,291
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1470
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,669
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1471
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:55,046
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1472
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,048
All you have to do is
fill in the signatures.

1473
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,176
Victor Laszlo.

1474
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:01,344
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1475
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:06,725
On the charge of accessory to the murder

1476
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,060
of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1477
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:13,231
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1478
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:16,067
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1479
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:21,323
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1480
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,742
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- I have. Sit down.

1481
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:25,827
- Put that gun down.
- I1 don't want to shoot you,

1482
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:27,829
but I will if you take one more step.

1483
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,957
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1484
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:37,589
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1485
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,925
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1486
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,551
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1487
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,346
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1488
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:46,932
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1489
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,309
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1490
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,818
Hello? Is that the airport?

1491
01:34:58,902 --> 01:34:59,736
Huh?

1492
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,905
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1493
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:04,699
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1494
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,451
There's to be no trouble about them.

1495
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,118
Good.

1496
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:10,372
Hello? Hello?

1497
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:16,670
-My car, quickly!

1498
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:19,130
This is Major Strasser.

1499
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,591
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1500
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:22,884
At once, do you hear?

1501
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,310
Hello, radio tower?

1502
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:35,397
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1503
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,358
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1504
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:42,404
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1505
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,489
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1506
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:00,380
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1507
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:02,674
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1508
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,801
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1509
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:05,884
Yes, sir.

1510
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:07,219
This way, please.

1511
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:12,183
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1512
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,768
You think of everything, don't you?

1513
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:17,397
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1514
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:21,109
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1515
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:22,569
I don't understand.
What about you?

1516
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,696
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1517
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,990
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1518
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,159
Last night
we said a great many things.

1519
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:30,952
You said
I was to do the thinking for us.

1520
01:36:31,036 --> 01:36:33,538
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1521
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:35,891
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1522
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,460
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

1523
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,755
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1524
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,717
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1525
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,552
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1526
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:51,348
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1527
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,600
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1528
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:56,186
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1529
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:59,189
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1530
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:02,859
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1531
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,027
But what about us?

1532
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,656
We'll always have Paris.

1533
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,700
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1534
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:12,577
We got it back last night.

1535
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:17,374
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1536
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,626
But I've got a job to do too.

1537
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,086
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1538
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,254
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1539
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,757
Lisa, I'm no good at being noble.

1540
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,653
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people

1541
01:37:28,677 --> 01:37:31,221
don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1542
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:33,807
Someday you'll understand that.

1543
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:36,893
Now, now.

1544
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:40,814
Here's looking at you, kid.

1545
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:59,207
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1546
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,543
There's something you should know.

1547
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,503
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1548
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:06,339
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1549
01:38:06,423 --> 01:38:09,092
- You said you knew about lisa and me.
- Yes.

1550
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:11,845
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1551
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:14,514
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, lisa?

1552
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:16,849
Yes.

1553
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:19,437
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1554
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,897
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1555
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:25,316
But that was all over long ago.

1556
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,195
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1557
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:31,322
I understand.

1558
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,825
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1559
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,202
I appreciate it.

1560
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,788
Welcome back to the fight.

1561
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,583
This time, I know our side will win.

1562
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,514
Are you ready, llsa?

1563
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,769
Yes, I'm ready.

1564
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:05,190
Goodbye, Rick.

1565
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:07,358
God bless you.

1566
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,279
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1567
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,008
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

1568
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:35,178
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1569
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:36,763
What you just did for Laszlo.

1570
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,057
That fairy tale you invented
to send lisa away with him.

1571
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,850
I know a little about women, my friend.

1572
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:43,186
She went.
But she knew you were lying.

1573
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:45,939
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1574
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:49,067
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1575
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,652
Especially for you.

1576
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:54,113
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1577
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,081
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1578
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:05,458
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1579
01:40:08,044 --> 01:40:10,255
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1580
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,840
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1581
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:17,470
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1582
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:20,515
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1583
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:24,435
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1584
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,479
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1585
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:41,661
Mon capitaine.

1586
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,079
Major Strasser has been shot.

1587
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,836
Round up the usual suspects.

1588
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:50,920
Oui, mon capitaine.

1589
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:16,321
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist,

1590
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,989
but you've become a patriot.

1591
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,366
Maybe, but it seemed like
a good time to start.

1592
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,826
I think perhaps you're right.

1593
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:50,730
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1594
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:53,858
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1595
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:55,568
I could be induced to arrange a passage.

1596
01:41:56,277 --> 01:41:57,528
My letter of transit?

1597
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,364
I could use a trip.

1598
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:02,825
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1599
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,954
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1600
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:08,081
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1601
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:12,377
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
