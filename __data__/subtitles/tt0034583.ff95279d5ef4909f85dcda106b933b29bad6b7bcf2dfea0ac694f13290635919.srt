00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,786
EXCUSE ME.
HELLO, RICK.

178
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,887
YOUR CASH IS GOOD
AT THE BAR.

179
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:48,089
WHAT? DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?

180
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:50,291
I DO. YOU'RE LUCKY
THE BAR'S OPEN TO YOU.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,999
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! I SHALL
REPORT IT TO THE<i> ANGRIFF.</i>

182
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,133
RICK, WATCHING YOU
WITH THE DEUTSCHE BANK,

183
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,737
ONE WOULD THINK YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THIS ALL YOUR LIFE.

184
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,139
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I HAVEN'T?

185
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,708
NOTHING, BUT WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME

186
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:07,342
TO CASABLANCA,
I THOUGHT--

187
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,878
YOU THOUGHT WHAT?

188
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:11,984
WHAT RIGHT DO I
HAVE TO THINK?

189
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:16,821
MAY I?

190
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:20,756
TOO BAD ABOUT THOSE
2 GERMAN COURIERS.

191
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,024
THEY GOT A LUCKY BREAK.

192
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,859
YESTERDAY THEY WERE
JUST TWO GERMAN CLERKS.

193
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,861
TODAY THEY'RE
THE HONORED DEAD.

194
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,863
YOU ARE A VERY
CYNICAL PERSON.

195
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,465
FORGIVE ME
FOR SAYING SO.

196
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,666
I FORGIVE YOU.

197
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:32,863
WILL YOU HAVE
A DRINK WITH ME?

198
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,836
NO.

199
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,671
I FORGOT. YOU NEVER
DRINK WITH ANYONE.

200
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,805
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER,
PLEASE.

201
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:38,740
YOU DESPISE ME,
DON'T YOU?

202
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,244
IF I GAVE YOU ANY THOUGHT,
I PROBABLY WOULD.

203
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,945
WHY? YOU OBJECT

204
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:46,081
TO THE KIND OF
BUSINESS I DO, HUH?

205
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,683
THINK OF ALL THOSE
POOR REFUGEES

206
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:50,853
WHO'D ROT HERE IF I
DIDN'T HELP THEM.

207
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:52,420
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

208
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:53,689
THROUGH WAYS
OF MY OWN,

209
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,891
I PROVIDE THEM
WITH EXIT VISAS.

210
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,626
FOR A PRICE, UGARTE,
FOR A PRICE.

211
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,630
BUT THINK OF
ALL THE POOR DEVILS

212
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,631
WHO CAN'T MEET
RENAULT'S PRICE.

213
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,634
I GET IT
FOR THEM FOR HALF.

214
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:06,401
IS THAT SO PARASITIC?

215
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,572
I DON'T MIND A PARASITE.
I OBJECT TO A CUT-RATE ONE.

216
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:11,973
WELL, AFTER TONIGHT,

217
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,976
I'LL BE THROUGH WITH
THE WHOLE BUSINESS.

218
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,578
I'M LEAVING, FINALLY,
THIS CASABLANCA.

219
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,514
WHO'D YOU BRIBE
FOR YOUR VISA,

220
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,048
RENAULT OR YOURSELF?

221
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:23,752
MYSELF. I FOUND MYSELF
MUCH MORE REASONABLE.

222
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,354
LOOK, RICK.

223
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,155
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

224
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:30,158
SOMETHING THAT EVEN YOU
HAVE NEVER SEEN.

225
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:34,162
LETTERS OF TRANSIT
SIGNED BY GENERAL DE GAULLE.

226
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:37,333
CANNOT BE RESCINDED,
NOT EVEN QUESTIONED.

227
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:38,768
ONE MOMENT.

228
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:40,735
TONIGHT I'LL BE
SELLING THOSE

229
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:43,738
FOR MORE MONEY THAN EVEN
I'VE EVER DREAMED OF,

230
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,741
AND THEN<i> ADDIO,</i>
CASABLANCA.

231
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,676
YOU KNOW, RICK,
I HAVE MANY FRIENDS,

232
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,477
BUT SOMEHOW, BECAUSE
YOU DESPISE ME,

233
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,012
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I TRUST.

234
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,214
WILL YOU KEEP THESE
FOR ME?

235
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,282
FOR HOW LONG?

236
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,051
PERHAPS AN HOUR. PERHAPS
A LITTLE LONGER.

237
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,020
I DON'T WANT THEM HERE
OVERNIGHT.

238
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,622
DON'T BE AFRAID
OF THAT.

239
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,023
PLEASE KEEP THEM
FOR ME.

240
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,758
THANK YOU. I KNEW
I COULD TRUST YOU.

241
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,228
OH, WAITER. I'M
EXPECTING SOME PEOPLE.

242
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:09,431
IF ANYBODY ASKS FOR ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,831
YES, MONSIEUR.

244
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,235
RICK, I HOPE YOU'RE MORE
IMPRESSED WITH ME NOW.

245
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:17,840
IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME,
I'LL SHARE MY GOOD LUCK

246
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,841
WITH YOUR
ROULETTE WHEEL.

247
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,242
JUST A MOMENT.

248
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:24,245
I HEARD A RUMOR
THOSE 2 GERMAN COURIERS

249
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:26,115
WERE CARRYING
LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

250
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:27,516
HUH?

251
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:31,114
OH. I'VE HEARD
THAT RUMOR, TOO.

252
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,522
POOR DEVILS.

253
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,688
YOU'RE RIGHT, UGARTE.

254
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:37,360

IMPRESSED WITH YOU.

HOW'S BUSINESS
AT THE BLUE PARROT?

301
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:03,345

308
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,157
IN REFUGEES ALONE,
WE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.

309
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,626

OF HAVING YOU--

340
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,861

YOU'RE GOING HOME.

341
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,233

TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

342

ARE, PUSHING ME AROUND?

344
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,572
I WAS A FOOL TO FALL
FOR A MAN LIKE YOU.

345
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:40,810
MAKE SURE SHE GETS HOME...
AND COME RIGHT BACK.

346
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:42,414
YES, BOSS.

347
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:54,990

348
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,425

00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,643
WE READ 5 TIMES
YOU WERE KILLED

695
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:09,044
IN 5 DIFFERENT
PLACES.

696
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,747
AS YOU SEE, IT WAS TRUE
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

697
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,749
THANK HEAVEN
I FOUND YOU, BERGER.

698
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:16,151
I'M LOOKING FOR
A MAN NAMED UGARTE.

699
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,153
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME.

700
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:20,155
UGARTE CANNOT EVEN
HELP HIMSELF.

701
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:22,157
HE'S UNDER ARREST
FOR MURDER.

702
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:25,361
HE WAS ARRESTED
HERE TONIGHT.

703
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,762
I SEE.

704
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,430

721

WHERE IS RICK?

734
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I DON'T KNOW.
I AIN'T SEEN HIM ALL NIGHT.

735
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,342
WHEN WILL HE
BE BACK?

736
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,678
NOT TONIGHT.
HE AIN'T COMIN'.

737
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,316
HE WENT HOME.

738
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,083
DOES HE ALWAYS
LEAVE SO EARLY?

739
00:31:55,152 --> 00:31:56,484
OH, HE NEVER--

740
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:59,688
HE'S GOT A GIRL
UP TO THE BLUE PARROT.

741

GOES UP THERE

742
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,260

A MUCH BETTER LIAR.

743
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,697
LEAVE HIM ALONE,

YOU WERE ASKING
ABOUT RICK. HERE HE IS.

766
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,928
MADEMOISELLE,
MAY I PRESENT--

767

HELLO, ILSA.

768
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:48,096

00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:50,966
THEN PERHAPS YOU ALSO--

771
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:52,734
THIS IS
MR. LASZLO.

772
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,236
HOW DO YOU DO?

773
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:56,867
ONE HEARS A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT RICK IN CASABLANCA.

774
00:33:56,936 --> 00:33:58,974
AND ABOUT VICTOR LASZLO
EVERYWHERE.

775
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,610
WON'T YOU JOIN US
FOR A DRINK?

776
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,012
OH, NO. RICK NEVER--

777
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:04,412
THANKS. I WILL.

778
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:07,149
WELL...A PRECEDENT
IS BEING BROKEN. EMIL.

779
00:34:07,218 --> 00:34:08,950
THIS IS A VERY
INTERESTING CAFE.

780
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:10,352
I CONGRATULATE YOU.

781
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:12,555
I CONGRATULATE YOU
FOR YOUR WORK.

782
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:14,256
THANK YOU. I TRY.

783
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:17,126
WE ALL TRY.
YOU SUCCEED.

784
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:19,161
I CAN'T GET OVER
YOU TWO.

785
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,162
SHE WAS ASKING
ABOUT YOU EARLIER

786
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,065
IN A WAY THAT MADE ME
EXTREMELY JEALOUS.

787
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,667
I WASN'T SURE
YOU WERE THE SAME.

788
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:26,769
THE LAST TIME WE MET--

789
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:28,373
IT WAS LA BELLE AURORE.

790
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:31,573
HOW NICE. YOU REMEMBERED.

791
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:34,738
THAT WAS THE DAY THE GERMANS
MARCHED INTO PARIS.

792
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,012
NOT AN EASY DAY
TO FORGET.

793
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,547
I REMEMBER
EVERY DETAIL.

794
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:41,586
THE GERMANS WORE GRAY.
YOU WORE BLUE.

795
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,153
YES. I PUT
THAT DRESS AWAY.

796
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:48,089
WHEN THE GERMANS MARCH
OUT, I'LL WEAR IT AGAIN.

797
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:50,158
RICKY, YOU'RE BECOMING
QUITE HUMAN.

798
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:53,161
I SUPPOSE WE HAVE
TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

799
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,562
ILSA,
IT'S LATE.

800
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:57,566
SO IT IS, AND WE HAVE
A CURFEW HERE IN CASABLANCA.

801
00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:00,168
IT WOULD NEVER DO
FOR THE CHIEF OF POLICE

802
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:02,370
TO BE FOUND
DRINKING AFTER HOURS

803
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,967
AND HAVE TO FINE HIMSELF.

804
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,675
I HOPE WE DIDN'T
OVERSTAY OUR WELCOME.

805
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:07,042
YOUR CHECK, SIR.

806
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,443
OH, IT'S MY PARTY.

807
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:10,040
ANOTHER PRECEDENT
GONE.

808
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,447
THIS HAS BEEN
A VERY INTERESTING EVENING.

809
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,316
I'LL CALL YOU A CAB.
GASOLINE RATIONING.

810
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:15,685
WE'LL
COME AGAIN.

811
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:16,584
ANY TIME.

812
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,520
SAY GOOD NIGHT
TO SAM FOR ME.

813
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:19,454
I WILL.

814
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:21,456
THERE'S STILL
NOBODY IN THE WORLD

815
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:24,693
WHO CAN PLAY
<i>AS TIME GOES BY</i> LIKE SAM.

816
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:27,630
HE HASN'T PLAYED IT
IN A LONG TIME.

817
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,898
GOOD NIGHT.

818
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:31,667
GOOD NIGHT.

819
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:32,704
GOOD NIGHT.

820
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:43,078
PUZZLING FELLOW, THIS RICK.
WHAT SORT IS HE?

821
00:35:43,147 --> 00:35:44,479
I REALLY CAN'T SAY,

822
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:46,748
THOUGH I SAW HIM
QUITE OFTEN IN PARIS.

823
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:48,349
TOMORROW AT 10:00
AT THE PREFECT'S OFFICE.

824
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,722
WE'LL BE THERE.
GOOD NIGHT.

825
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:31,363
BOSS?

826
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:36,131
BOSS.

827
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,533
YEAH?

828
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,735
AIN'T YOU
GOING TO BED?

829
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:40,969
NOT RIGHT NOW.

830
00:36:41,038 --> 00:36:43,239
AIN'T YOU PLANNING ON GOING
TO BED IN THE NEAR FUTURE?

831
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:44,273
NO!

832
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:45,273
YOU EVER GOING
TO BED?NO!

833
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,142
WELL, I AIN'T SLEEPY
EITHER.

834
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,144
GOOD.
THEN HAVE A DRINK.

835
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:51,146
NO, NOT ME, BOSS.

836
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:53,148
THEN DON'T
HAVE A DRINK.

837
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,150
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

838
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,152
NO, SAM.
I'M WAITING FOR A LADY.

839
00:36:57,221 --> 00:36:58,519
PLEASE, LET'S GO.

840
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:00,956
AIN'T NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
FOR YOU HERE.

841
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:03,959
SHE'S COMING BACK.
I KNOW SHE'S COMING BACK.

842
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:05,594
WE'LL DRIVE ALL NIGHT.
WE'LL GET DRUNK.

843
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,162
WE'LL GO FISHING AND STAY
AWAY TILL SHE'S GONE.

844
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,164
SHUT UP AND GO HOME.

845
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:11,803
NO, SIR.
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

846
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:19,074
THEY GRAB UGARTE,
THEN SHE WALKS IN.

847
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:21,477
WELL, THAT'S
THE WAY IT GOES.

848
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:23,679
ONE IN, ONE OUT.
SAM.

849
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:25,480
YES, BOSS.

850
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,083
IF IT'S DECEMBER 1941
IN CASABLANCA,

851
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:31,254
WHAT TIME IS IT
IN NEW YORK?

852
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:32,488
WHAT?

853
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:34,489
MY WATCH STOPPED.

854
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:37,292
I BET THEY'RE ASLEEP
IN NEW YORK.

855
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,532
I BET THEY'RE ASLEEP
ALL OVER AMERICA.

856
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,905
OF ALL THE GIN JOINTS
IN ALL THE TOWNS

857
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,907
IN ALL THE WORLD,

858
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:53,946
SHE WALKS INTO MINE.

859
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:01,649
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE PLAYING?

860
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,819
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING OF MY OWN.

861
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:04,654
WELL, STOP IT.

862
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:06,289
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO HEAR.

863
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:07,588
NO, I DON'T.

864
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:09,358
YOU PLAYED IT FOR HER,
YOU CAN PLAY IT FOR ME.

865
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,093
I DON'T THINK
I CAN REMEMBER--

866
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:13,929
IF SHE CAN STAND IT,
I CAN!

867
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:14,930
PLAY IT.

868
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:15,968

00:49:57,635 --> 00:50:00,735
WITH A FEELING
SHE SUPPOSED WAS LOVE.

1042
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:03,471
YES. IT'S VERY PRETTY.
I HEARD A STORY ONCE.

1043
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,474
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES
IN MY TIME.

1044
00:50:06,543 --> 00:50:10,478
THEY WENT ALONG WITH THE SOUND
OF A TINNY PIANO

1045
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:12,480
PLAYING IN THE PARLOR
DOWNSTAIRS.

1046
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:16,652
"MISTER, I MET A MAN ONCE
WHEN I WAS A KID,"

1047
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:17,886
IT ALWAYS BEGINS.

1048
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:24,093
OH, I GUESS NEITHER ONE
OF OUR STORIES IS VERY FUNNY.

1049
00:50:24,162 --> 00:50:27,496
TELL ME, WHO WAS IT
YOU LEFT ME FOR?

1050
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:31,366
WAS IT LASZLO, OR WERE THERE
OTHERS IN BETWEEN--

1051
00:50:31,435 --> 00:50:34,606
OR AREN'T YOU
THE KIND THAT TELLS?

1052
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:49,754
[DOOR CLOSES]

1053
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:00,595
I STRONGLY SUSPECT

1054
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:03,931
THAT UGARTE LEFT THE LETTERS
OF TRANSIT WITH MR. BLAINE.

1055
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,134
I SUGGEST YOU SEARCH THE CAFE
IMMEDIATELY AND THOROUGHLY.

1056
00:51:06,203 --> 00:51:07,435
IF RICK HAS THE LETTERS,

1057
00:51:07,504 --> 00:51:09,271
HE'S MUCH TOO SMART TO
LET YOU FIND THEM THERE.

1058
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,540
YOU GIVE HIM CREDIT
FOR TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS.

1059
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,542
HE'S JUST ANOTHER
BLUNDERING AMERICAN.

1060
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:16,746
WE MUSTN'T UNDERESTIMATE
AMERICAN BLUNDERING.

1061
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,546
I WAS WITH THEM

1062
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:21,149
WHEN THEY BLUNDERED
INTO BERLIN IN 1918.

1063
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:22,284
AS TO LASZLO,

1064
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:24,553
WE WANT HIM WATCHED
24 HOURS A DAY.

1065
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:27,792
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE.

1066
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,364
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

1067
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,365
I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU BOTH.

1068
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:40,168
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST?

1069
00:51:40,237 --> 00:51:41,569
I SLEPT VERY WELL.

1070
00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:42,871
THAT'S STRANGE.
NOBODY'S SUPPOSED

1071
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,573
TO SLEEP WELL
IN CASABLANCA.

1072
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:47,175
MAY WE PROCEED
TO THE BUSINESS?

1073
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:49,177
WITH PLEASURE.
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

1074
00:51:49,246 --> 00:51:51,579
VERY WELL.
LET'S NOT MINCE WORDS.

1075
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:54,778
YOU ARE AN ESCAPED
PRISONER OF THE REICH.

1076
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:56,517
SO FAR YOU HAVE
ELUDED US.

1077
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:57,886
YOU HAVE REACHED
CASABLANCA.

1078
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:01,190
IT'S MY DUTY TO SEE THAT
YOU STAY IN CASABLANCA.

1079
00:52:01,259 --> 00:52:03,524
WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUCCEED
IS PROBLEMATIC.

1080
00:52:03,593 --> 00:52:05,127
CAPTAIN RENAULT'S
SIGNATURE

1081
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:07,529
IS NECESSARY
ON EVERY EXIT VISA.

1082
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:09,331
WILL HERR LASZLO
RECEIVE A VISA?

1083
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,733
I'M AFRAID NOT.
MY REGRETS, MONSIEUR.

1084
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:15,137
PERHAPS I SHALL LIKE IT
IN CASABLANCA.

1085
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:16,537
AND
MADEMOISELLE?

1086
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:18,540
YOU NEEDN'T BE
CONCERNED ABOUT ME.

1087
00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:20,209
IS THAT ALL
YOU WISH TO TELL US?

1088
00:52:20,278 --> 00:52:21,476
DON'T BE
IN SUCH A HURRY.

1089
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:22,644
YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

1090
00:52:22,713 --> 00:52:25,147
YOU MAY BE IN CASABLANCA
INDEFINITELY,

1091
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:28,216
OR YOU MAY LEAVE
FOR LISBON TOMORROW

1092
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:29,585
ON ONE CONDITION.

1093
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:30,719
AND THAT IS?

1094
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:32,121
YOU KNOW THE LEADER

1095
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,521
OF THE UNDERGROUND
MOVEMENT IN PARIS,

1096
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,523
IN PRAGUE, IN BRUSSELS,
IN AMSTERDAM,

1097
00:52:35,592 --> 00:52:38,160
IN OSLO, IN BELGRADE,
AND ATHENS.

1098
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:39,728
EVEN BERLIN.

1099
00:52:39,797 --> 00:52:41,930
YES, EVEN IN BERLIN.

1100
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:44,532
IF YOU'LL FURNISH ME WITH
THEIR NAMES AND WHEREABOUTS,

1101
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:46,668
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR VISA
IN THE MORNING.

1102
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:49,738
AND THE HONOR OF HAVING
SERVED THE THIRD REICH.

1103
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:52,341
I WAS IN A GERMAN
CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR A YEAR.

1104
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,577
THAT'S HONOR ENOUGH
FOR A LIFETIME.

1105
00:52:54,646 --> 00:52:56,544
YOU'LL GIVE US
THE NAMES?

1106
00:52:56,613 --> 00:52:59,714
IF I DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO YOU
IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP,

1107
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:02,317
WHERE YOU HAD
MORE PERSUASIVE METHODS

1108
00:53:02,386 --> 00:53:03,718
AT YOUR DISPOSAL,

1109
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:06,922
I CERTAINLY WON'T
GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW.

1110
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:09,324
WHAT IF YOU KILL THESE MEN?

1111
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:11,126
WHAT IF YOU
MURDERED ALL OF US?

1112
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:12,660
FROM EVERY CORNER
OF EUROPE, HUNDREDS,

1113
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:15,330
THOUSANDS WOULD RISE
TO TAKE OUR PLACES.

1114
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:18,267
EVEN NAZIS CAN'T
KILL THAT FAST.

1115
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:20,268
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR ELOQUENCE

1116
00:53:20,337 --> 00:53:21,670
WHICH I NOW UNDERSTAND.

1117
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,405
BUT IN ONE RESPECT
YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

1118
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:27,408
YOU SAID THE REICH'S ENEMIES
COULD BE REPLACED.

1119
00:53:27,477 --> 00:53:28,810
THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION.
NO ONE COULD REPLACE YOU

1120
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:31,413
IF ANYTHING UNFORTUNATE
SHOULD OCCUR TO YOU

1121
00:53:31,482 --> 00:53:33,882
WHILE YOU WERE
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1122
00:53:33,951 --> 00:53:36,418
YOU WON'T DARE
TO INTERFERE WITH ME HERE.

1123
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:38,487
THIS IS STILL
UNOCCUPIED FRANCE.

1124
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:41,422
ANY VIOLATION OF NEUTRALITY
WOULD REFLECT ON RENAULT.

1125
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:44,627
INSOFAR AS IT IS
IN MY POWER.

1126
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:45,827
THANK YOU.

1127
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:49,031
LAST NIGHT, YOU EVINCED
INTEREST IN SIGNOR UGARTE.

1128
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,032
YES.

1129
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,367
YOU HAVE
A MESSAGE FOR HIM.

1130
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:56,005
NOTHING IMPORTANT,
BUT MAY I SPEAK TO HIM NOW?

1131
00:53:56,074 --> 00:53:58,073
YOU WOULD FIND
THE CONVERSATION

1132
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,042
A TRIFLE ONE-SIDED.

1133
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,680
SIGNOR UGARTE'S DEAD.

1134
00:54:07,551 --> 00:54:09,850
I'M MAKING OUT
THE REPORT NOW.

1135
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,055
WE HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED
WHETHER HE COMMITTED SUICIDE

1136
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,027
OR DIED
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1137
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,060
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH US?

1138
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,062
FOR THE TIME
BEING.

1139
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,700
GOOD DAY.

1140
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:29,071
UNDOUBTEDLY THEIR NEXT STEP
WILL BE TO THE BLACK MARKET.

1141
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,675
ANOTHER VISA PROBLEM
HAS COME UP.

1142
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:34,143
SHOW HER IN.

1143
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:35,780
YES, SIR.

1144
00:54:44,122 --> 00:54:47,555
SORRY. WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE POLICE.

1145
00:54:47,624 --> 00:54:50,558
THIS IS A JOB
FOR SIGNOR FERRARI.

1146
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:53,156
IT CAN BE MOST HELPFUL
TO KNOW HIM.

1147
00:54:53,225 --> 00:54:55,564
HE HAS A MONOPOLY
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

1148
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:57,999
YOU'LL FIND HIM
AT THE BLUE PARROT.

1149
00:54:58,068 --> 00:54:59,804
THANKS.

1150
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:13,582
DON'T BE TOO
DOWNHEARTED.

1151
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:16,185
PERHAPS YOU CAN
COME TO TERMS

1152
00:55:16,254 --> 00:55:17,787
WITH CAPTAIN RENAULT.

1153
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,187
HELLO, FERRARI.

1154
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:20,456
GOOD MORNING,
RICK.

1155
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,724
I SEE THE BUS IS IN.

1156
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:23,024
I'LL TAKE
MY SHIPMENT WITH ME.

1157
00:55:23,093 --> 00:55:24,960
NO HURRY. I'LL HAVE IT
SENT OVER. HAVE A DRINK.

1158
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:27,195
EVERY TIME YOU SEND
MY SHIPMENT OVER,

1159
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:28,597
IT'S ALWAYS
A LITTLE SHORT.

1160
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,800
CARRYING CHARGES,
MY BOY.

1161
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,000
HERE, SIT DOWN.

1162
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:35,804
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK OVER WITH YOU.

1163
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:36,872
THE BOURBON.

1164
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:39,074
THE NEWS ABOUT UGARTE
UPSETS ME.

1165
00:55:39,143 --> 00:55:40,475
YOU'RE A FAT HYPOCRITE.

1166
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:42,844
YOU DON'T FEEL ANY SORRIER
FOR UGARTE THAN I DO.

1167
00:55:42,913 --> 00:55:43,779
OF COURSE NOT.

1168
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:45,746
WHAT UPSETS ME
IS THAT UGARTE'S DEAD,

1169
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:48,183
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THOSE
LETTERS OF TRANSIT ARE.

1170
00:55:48,252 --> 00:55:49,617
PRACTICALLY NO ONE.

1171
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:51,419
IF I COULD
LAY MY HANDS ON THEM,

1172
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:52,620
I COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.

1173
00:55:52,689 --> 00:55:54,389
SO COULD I, AND I'M
A POOR BUSINESSMAN.

1174
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,557
I HAVE A PROPOSITION

1175
00:55:55,626 --> 00:55:57,392
FOR WHOEVER HAS
THOSE LETTERS.

1176
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:58,793
I'LL HANDLE
THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION,

1177
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:01,496
TAKE ALL THE RISK,
FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE.

1178
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:03,565
AND THE CARRYING
CHARGES?

1179
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:06,267
NATURALLY THERE WILL BE
A FEW INCIDENTAL EXPENSES.

1180
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:07,770
THAT'S THE PROPOSITION
I HAVE

1181
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,337
FOR WHOEVER
HAS THOSE LETTERS.

1182
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:10,972
I'LL TELL HIM
WHEN HE COMES IN.

1183
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,937
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHERE THOSE LETTERS ARE.

1184
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:15,043
YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.

1185
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:18,017
RENAULT AND STRASSER
PROBABLY THINK SO, TOO.

1186
00:56:22,353 --> 00:56:24,086
THAT'S WHY
I CAME OVER HERE,

1187
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:26,654
TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO RANSACK MY PLACE.

1188
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:28,990
DON'T BE A FOOL. TAKE ME
INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE.

1189
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:30,192
YOU NEED A PARTNER.

1190
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,164
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE GETTING BACK.

1191
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,597
GOOD MORNING.

1192
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:38,837
SIGNOR FERRARI'S
THE FAT GENT AT THE TABLE.

1193
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,976
YOU WILL NOT FIND A TREASURE
LIKE THIS IN ALL MOROCCO.

1194
00:56:47,045 --> 00:56:48,377
ONLY 700 FRANCS.

1195
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,778
YOU'RE BEING CHEATED.

1196
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:51,280
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THANK YOU.

1197
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:52,614
THE LADY'S A FRIEND
OF RICK'S.

1198
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:54,383
FOR FRIENDS OF RICK'S,
WE HAVE A SMALL DISCOUNT.

1199
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,785
DID I SAY 700?

1200
00:56:55,854 --> 00:56:57,619
YOU CAN HAVE IT
FOR 200.

1201
00:56:57,688 --> 00:56:59,622
I'M SORRY I WAS
IN NO CONDITION

1202
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:01,223
TO RECEIVE YOU
LAST NIGHT.

1203
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,624
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1204
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:04,226
FOR SPECIAL FRIENDS
OF RICK'S,

1205
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,627
A SPECIAL DISCOUNT--
100 FRANCS.

1206
00:57:05,696 --> 00:57:08,229
YOUR STORY HAD ME
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

1207

SOME NAPKINS.

WHY DID YOU COME BACK,

YOU RAN OUT ON ME

1213

1214
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:19,875
YES.

TO KNOW.

TO GO TO AMERICA.

YES, BUT WE HAVEN'T
MUCH MONEY.

1420

BUT WE HAVE NO MONEY.

1427
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,710

HE'S STILL WILLING

1428
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:15,978

1429

IF YOU DON'T HELP US,

1709
01:21:16,513 --> 01:21:18,380
VICTOR LASZLO
WILL DIE IN CASABLANCA.

1710
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,650
WHAT OF IT? I'M GOING
TO DIE IN CASABLANCA.

1711
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:23,883
IT'S A GOOD SPOT FOR IT.

1712
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:31,163
NOW, IF YOU--

1713
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,797
ALL RIGHT, I TRIED
TO REASON WITH YOU.

1714
01:21:35,866 --> 01:21:37,967
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

1715
01:21:38,036 --> 01:21:39,569
NOW I WANT
THOSE LETTERS.

1716
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:40,936
GET THEM FOR ME.

1717
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:43,175
I DON'T HAVE TO.
I GOT THEM RIGHT HERE.

1718
01:21:44,742 --> 01:21:47,410
PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.

1719
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:49,277
NO.

1720
01:21:49,346 --> 01:21:52,480
FOR THE LAST TIME,
PUT THEM ON THE TABLE.

1721
01:21:52,549 --> 01:21:55,685
IF LASZLO AND THE CAUSE
MEAN SO MUCH,

1722
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:57,886
YOU WON'T STOP AT ANYTHING.

1723
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:01,460
ALL RIGHT. I'LL
MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU.

1724
01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:04,960
GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.

1725
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:07,599
YOU'LL BE
DOING ME A FAVOR.

1726
01:22:11,903 --> 01:22:13,235
RICHARD.

1727
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:16,238
I TRIED TO STAY AWAY.

1728
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:19,842
I THOUGHT I WOULD
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,

1729
01:22:19,911 --> 01:22:23,082
THAT YOU WERE
OUT OF MY LIFE.

1730
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,966
THE DAY
YOU LEFT PARIS...

1731
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:50,138
IF YOU KNEW WHAT
I WENT THROUGH.

1732
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:53,141
IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
I LOVED YOU.

1733
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,249
HOW MUCH
I STILL LOVE YOU.

1734
01:23:10,962 --> 01:23:12,394
AND THEN?

1735
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:15,430
IT WASN'T LONG
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED

1736
01:23:15,499 --> 01:23:18,033
THAT VICTOR WENT BACK
TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

1737
01:23:18,102 --> 01:23:20,035
THEY NEEDED HIM
IN PRAGUE,

1738
01:23:20,104 --> 01:23:22,437
BUT THERE THE GESTAPO
WERE WAITING FOR HIM.

1739
01:23:22,506 --> 01:23:23,972
JUST A 2-LINE ITEM
IN THE PAPER,

1740
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,040
"VICTOR LASZLO
APPREHENDED.

1741
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:27,175
SENT TO
CONCENTRATION CAMP."

1742
01:23:27,244 --> 01:23:28,778
I WAS FRANTIC.

1743
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:31,780
FOR MONTHS
I TRIED TO GET WORD.

1744
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:33,048
THEN IT CAME.

1745
01:23:33,117 --> 01:23:36,051
HE WAS DEAD--
SHOT TRYING TO ESCAPE.

1746
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,986
I WAS LONELY.
I HAD NOTHING--

1747
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,655
NOT EVEN HOPE.

1748
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,223
THEN I MET YOU.

1749
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,191
WHY WEREN'T YOU
HONEST WITH ME?

1750
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,194
WHY DID YOU KEEP
YOUR MARRIAGE A SECRET?

1751
01:23:46,263 --> 01:23:47,429
IT WASN'T MY SECRET.

1752
01:23:47,498 --> 01:23:49,197
VICTOR WANTED IT
THAT WAY.

1753
01:23:49,266 --> 01:23:50,765
OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS
DIDN'T KNOW.

1754
01:23:50,834 --> 01:23:54,469
HE WANTED TO PROTECT ME.
I KNEW ABOUT HIS WORK.

1755
01:23:54,538 --> 01:23:56,805
IF THE GESTAPO KNEW
I WAS HIS WIFE,

1756
01:23:56,874 --> 01:23:58,107
IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
FOR ME

1757
01:23:58,176 --> 01:23:59,474
AND FOR THOSE
WORKING WITH US.

1758
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:02,678
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
FIND OUT HE WAS ALIVE?

1759
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,479
JUST BEFORE YOU AND I

1760
01:24:04,548 --> 01:24:06,481
WERE TO
LEAVE PARIS TOGETHER.

1761
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:09,084
A FRIEND TOLD ME
VICTOR WAS ALIVE.

1762
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:10,953
THEY WERE HIDING HIM
IN A FREIGHT CAR

1763
01:24:11,022 --> 01:24:12,955
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF PARIS.

1764
01:24:13,024 --> 01:24:14,951
HE WAS SICK.
HE NEEDED ME.

1765
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:18,360
I WANTED TO TELL YOU,
BUT I DIDN'T DARE.

1766
01:24:18,429 --> 01:24:21,363
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT PARIS

1767
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:24,366
AND THE GESTAPO
WOULD HAVE CAUGHT YOU.

1768
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:27,606
SO I...WELL,
YOU KNOW THE REST.

1769
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,975
WELL, IT'S STILL
A STORY WITHOUT AN ENDING.

1770
01:24:33,044 --> 01:24:34,944
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

1771
01:24:35,013 --> 01:24:36,712
NOW?

1772
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:38,113
I DON'T KNOW.

1773
01:24:38,182 --> 01:24:41,717
I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER
HAVE THE STRENGTH

1774
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:43,118
TO LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

1775
01:24:43,187 --> 01:24:45,353
AND LASZLO?

1776
01:24:45,422 --> 01:24:47,122
YOU'LL HELP HIM,
WON'T YOU?

1777
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:49,024
YOU'LL SEE
THAT HE GETS OUT.

1778
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:50,392
THEN HE'LL HAVE
HIS WORK--

1779
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:52,728
ALL THAT HE'S
BEEN LIVING FOR.

1780
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:54,129
ALL EXCEPT ONE.

1781
01:24:54,198 --> 01:24:56,735
HE WON'T HAVE YOU.

1782
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:01,403
I CAN'T FIGHT IT
ANYMORE.

1783
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:04,005
I RAN AWAY
FROM YOU ONCE.

1784
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:06,245
I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN.

1785
01:25:07,611 --> 01:25:10,545
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT ANY LONGER.

1786
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:13,749
YOU HAVE TO THINK
FOR BOTH OF US,

1787
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,787
FOR ALL OF US.

1788
01:25:19,223 --> 01:25:20,756
ALL RIGHT.

1789
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:22,394
I WILL.

1790
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,799
HERE'S LOOKING
AT YOU, KID.

1791
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:32,537
I WISH I DIDN'T
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1792
01:25:44,983 --> 01:25:46,715
I THINK
WE LOST THEM.

1793
01:25:46,784 --> 01:25:49,919
YES. I'M AFRAID THEY CAUGHT
SOME OF THE OTHERS.

1794
01:25:49,988 --> 01:25:51,556
COME INSIDE.
COME.

1795
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,925
COME, MR. LASZLO.

1796
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:59,194
I WILL HELP YOU...
IMMEDIATELY.

1797
01:25:59,263 --> 01:26:00,499
THANK YOU.

1798
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:05,304
[VOICES]

1799
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,482
CARL, WHAT HAPPENED?

1800
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,485
THE POLICE BREAK UP
OUR MEETING, HERR RICK.

1801
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:25,821
WE ESCAPED
IN THE LAST MOMENT.

1802
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,222
COME UP HERE.

1803
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,625
TURN OUT THE LIGHT
IN THE REAR ENTRANCE.

1804
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:31,226
IT MIGHT
ATTRACT THE POLICE.

1805
01:26:31,295 --> 01:26:32,795
SACHA ALWAYS
PUTS IT OUT.

1806
01:26:32,864 --> 01:26:33,929
TONIGHT HE FORGOT.

1807
01:26:33,998 --> 01:26:36,368
I WILL DO IT.

1808
01:26:43,202 --> 01:26:46,175
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE MISS LUND HOME.

1809
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:47,412
YES, SIR.

1810
01:26:57,521 --> 01:26:59,454
IT'S NOTHING.
JUST A LITTLE CUT.

1811
01:26:59,523 --> 01:27:01,591
WE HAD TO GET
THROUGH A WINDOW.

1812
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,793
THIS MIGHT
COME IN HANDY.

1813
01:27:03,862 --> 01:27:05,193
THANK YOU.

1814
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,195
HAD A CLOSE ONE, EH?

1815
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,331
YES, RATHER.

1816
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,735
DON'T YOU SOMETIMES WONDER
IF IT'S WORTH ALL THIS?

1817
01:27:12,804 --> 01:27:15,604
I MEAN, WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR.

1818
01:27:15,673 --> 01:27:18,206
YOU MIGHT AS WELL QUESTION
WHY WE BREATHE.

1819
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,475
IF WE STOP BREATHING,
WE'LL DIE.

1820
01:27:20,544 --> 01:27:22,878
IF WE STOP FIGHTING OUR
ENEMIES, THE WORLD WILL DIE.

1821
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:25,080
WHAT OF IT? IT'LL BE
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

1822
01:27:25,149 --> 01:27:26,481
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SOUND?

1823
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:29,484
LIKE A MAN TRYING TO CONVINCE
HIMSELF OF SOMETHING

1824
01:27:29,553 --> 01:27:32,454
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN HIS HEART.

1825
01:27:32,523 --> 01:27:36,091
EACH OF US HAS A DESTINY--
FOR GOOD OR EVIL.

1826
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,493
I GET THE POINT.

1827
01:27:37,562 --> 01:27:38,893
I WONDER IF YOU DO.

1828
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,097
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO ESCAPE FROM YOURSELF?

1829
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,531
YOU'LL NEVER SUCCEED.

1830
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,601
YOU SEEM TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT MY DESTINY.

1831
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,605
I KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE
ABOUT YOU THAN YOU SUSPECT.

1832
01:27:50,674 --> 01:27:53,608
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.

1833
01:27:53,677 --> 01:27:55,010
IT'S PERHAPS
A STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCE

1834
01:27:55,079 --> 01:27:57,913
THAT WE BOTH SHOULD BE
IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN.

1835
01:27:57,982 --> 01:28:00,515
THE FIRST EVENING
I CAME TO THIS CAFE,

1836
01:28:00,584 --> 01:28:03,918
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
BETWEEN YOU AND ILSA.

1837
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,256
SINCE NO ONE'S TO BLAME,
I DEMAND NO EXPLANATION.

1838
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:09,258
I ASK ONLY ONE THING.

1839
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:11,659
YOU WON'T GIVE ME
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

1840
01:28:11,728 --> 01:28:14,662
ALL RIGHT, BUT I
WANT MY WIFE TO BE SAFE.

1841
01:28:14,731 --> 01:28:19,267
I ASK YOU TO USE THE LETTERS
TO TAKE HER AWAY.

1842
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,264
YOU LOVE HER
THAT MUCH?

1843
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:25,273
YOU THINK OF ME
ONLY AS A LEADER OF A CAUSE.

1844
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,275
I'M ALSO A HUMAN BEING.

1845
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,881
YES, I LOVE HER THAT MUCH.

1846
01:28:35,948 --> 01:28:37,220
MONSIEUR LASZLO?

1847
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:38,553
YES?

1848
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:41,290
COME WITH US. WE HAVE
A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

1849
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:42,691
ON WHAT CHARGE?

1850
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,926
CAPTAIN RENAULT WILL
DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU LATER.

1851
01:28:44,995 --> 01:28:48,033
IT SEEMS THAT DESTINY
HAS TAKEN A HAND.

1852
01:28:58,775 --> 01:29:01,309
YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T
ANY ACTUAL PROOF.

1853
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,711
THIS ISN'T GERMANY
OR OCCUPIED FRANCE.

1854
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:06,715
YOU CAN ONLY FINE HIM
AND GIVE HIM 30 DAYS.

1855
01:29:06,784 --> 01:29:08,316
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
LET HIM GO NOW.

1856
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:09,685
I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO BE
TOO INTERESTED

1857
01:29:09,754 --> 01:29:11,086
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO LASZLO.

1858
01:29:11,155 --> 01:29:12,321
IF YOU HELPED HIM
ESCAPE--

1859
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:15,724
WHY WOULD I STICK
MY NECK OUT FOR LASZLO?

1860
01:29:15,793 --> 01:29:17,725
1--YOU BET 10,000 FRANCS
HE'D ESCAPE.

1861
01:29:17,794 --> 01:29:19,923
2--YOU'VE GOT
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

1862
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:21,329
DON'T BOTHER TO DENY IT.

1863
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,730
AND YOU MIGHT DO IT

1864
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:24,933
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
STRASSER'S LOOKS.

1865
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:26,201
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1866
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,336
I DON'T LIKE THEM,
EITHER.

1867
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:28,503
THEY'RE ALL
EXCELLENT REASONS.

1868
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,705
DON'T COUNT TOO MUCH
ON MY FRIENDSHIP.

1869
01:29:29,774 --> 01:29:32,340
IN THIS MATTER,
I'M POWERLESS.

1870
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,075
BESIDES, I MIGHT LOSE
THE 10,000 FRANCS.

1871
01:29:34,144 --> 01:29:37,212
YOU'RE NOT VERY SUBTLE,
BUT YOU ARE EFFECTIVE.

1872
01:29:37,281 --> 01:29:39,014
I GET THE POINT.

1873
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:43,018
YES, I HAVE THE LETTERS.
I INTEND USING THEM MYSELF.

1874
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:46,021
I'M LEAVING CASABLANCA
ON THE LAST PLANE TONIGHT.

1875
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:49,224
I'M TAKING A FRIEND--
ONE YOU'LL APPRECIATE.

1876
01:29:49,293 --> 01:29:50,225
WHAT FRIEND?

1877
01:29:50,294 --> 01:29:51,560
ILSA LUND.

1878
01:29:51,629 --> 01:29:54,362
THAT SHOULD PUT YOUR MIND
TO REST ABOUT LASZLO--

1879
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:57,967
THE LAST MAN I WANT
TO SEE IN AMERICA.

1880
01:29:58,036 --> 01:30:00,435
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TELL ME THIS.

1881
01:30:00,504 --> 01:30:02,437
YOU HAVE THE LETTERS
OF TRANSIT.

1882
01:30:02,506 --> 01:30:04,439
YOU CAN LEAVE
ANYTIME YOU PLEASE.

1883
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,508
WHY ARE YOU STILL
INTERESTED

1884
01:30:06,577 --> 01:30:08,104
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO LASZLO?

1885
01:30:08,173 --> 01:30:09,912
I'M NOT.
BUT I AM INTERESTED

1886
01:30:09,981 --> 01:30:12,514
IN WHAT HAPPENS
TO ILSA AND ME.

1887
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:14,510
WE HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT
TO GO, THAT'S TRUE,

1888
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:17,786
BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD
IN SPITE OF THEIR RIGHTS.

1889
01:30:17,855 --> 01:30:19,388
WHY SHOULD
WE HOLD YOU?

1890
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:20,822
ILSA'S LASZLO'S WIFE.

1891
01:30:20,891 --> 01:30:24,993
SHE PROBABLY KNOWS THINGS
STRASSER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

1892
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:26,195
I'LL MAKE A DEAL.

1893
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,796
INSTEAD OF THIS PETTY CHARGE,
GET SOMETHING BIG

1894
01:30:28,865 --> 01:30:31,799
THAT WOULD CHUCK HIM IN
A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR YEARS.

1895
01:30:31,868 --> 01:30:34,403
IT'D BE QUITE A FEATHER
IN YOUR CAP, WOULDN'T IT?

1896
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:35,804
IT CERTAINLY WOULD.

1897
01:30:35,873 --> 01:30:38,006
GERMANY--VICHY
WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.

1898
01:30:38,075 --> 01:30:39,207
THEN RELEASE HIM.

1899
01:30:39,276 --> 01:30:42,411
BE AT MY PLACE A HALF HOUR
BEFORE THE PLANE LEAVES.

1900
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,745
I'LL HAVE LASZLO COME THERE

1901
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:45,947
TO PICK UP
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT--

1902
01:30:46,016 --> 01:30:47,582
THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE CRIMINAL
GROUNDS FOR ARREST.

1903
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:50,385
YOU GET HIM,
AND WE GET AWAY.

1904
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:54,056
TO THE GERMANS, THAT LAST ONE
WILL BE JUST A MINOR ANNOYANCE.

1905
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:56,325
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.

1906
01:30:56,394 --> 01:30:58,660
MISS LUND--SHE'S
VERY BEAUTIFUL, YES,

1907
01:30:58,729 --> 01:31:01,664
BUT YOU WERE NEVER
INTERESTED IN ANY WOMAN.

1908
01:31:01,733 --> 01:31:03,665
SHE ISN'T
JUST ANY WOMAN.

1909
01:31:03,734 --> 01:31:07,669
I SEE. HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD?

1910
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:09,404
I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS
RIGHT NOW WITH LASZLO

1911
01:31:09,473 --> 01:31:10,673
IN THE VISITORS' PEN.

1912
01:31:10,742 --> 01:31:12,268
RICKY,
I'LL MISS YOU.

1913
01:31:12,337 --> 01:31:13,408
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN CASABLANCA

1914
01:31:13,477 --> 01:31:15,277
WHO HAS EVEN LESS
SCRUPLES THAN I.

1915
01:31:15,346 --> 01:31:16,278
THANKS.

1916
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:17,545
GO AHEAD, RICKY.

1917
01:31:17,614 --> 01:31:20,548
CALL OFF YOUR WATCHDOGS
WHEN YOU LET HIM GO.

1918
01:31:20,617 --> 01:31:22,550
I DON'T WANT THEM AROUND
THIS AFTERNOON.

1919
01:31:22,619 --> 01:31:25,257
I'M TAKING NO CHANCES,
NOT EVEN WITH YOU.

1920
01:31:31,896 --> 01:31:33,428
SHALL WE
DRAW UP PAPERS,

1921
01:31:33,497 --> 01:31:35,430
OR IS A HANDSHAKE
GOOD ENOUGH?

1922
01:31:35,499 --> 01:31:36,966
CERTAINLY
NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

1923
01:31:37,035 --> 01:31:39,167
BUT SINCE I'M IN A
HURRY, IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

1924
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:41,570
AH, TO LEAVE CASABLANCA
AND GO TO AMERICA--

1925
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:42,971
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

1926
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,707
BY THE WAY,
MY AGREEMENT WITH SAM

1927
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:48,110
IS THAT HE GETS
25% OF THE PROFITS.

1928
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:51,213
I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S 10%,
BUT HE'S WORTH 25.

1929
01:31:51,282 --> 01:31:54,349
ABDUL, CARL, AND SACHA
STAY, OR I DON'T SELL.

1930
01:31:54,418 --> 01:31:57,453
OF COURSE. RICK'S WOULDN'T
BE RICK'S WITHOUT THEM.

1931
01:31:57,522 --> 01:31:58,854
WELL, SO LONG.

1932
01:31:58,923 --> 01:32:00,455
DON'T FORGET,
YOU OWE RICK'S

1933
01:32:00,524 --> 01:32:02,457
100 CARTONS OF
AMERICAN CIGARETTES.

1934
01:32:02,526 --> 01:32:05,697
I SHALL REMEMBER
TO PAY IT TO MYSELF.

1935
01:32:24,148 --> 01:32:26,251
[BANGING ON DOOR]

1936
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:40,228
YOU'RE LATE.

1937
01:32:40,297 --> 01:32:41,163
I WAS INFORMED

1938
01:32:41,232 --> 01:32:42,898
JUST AS LASZLO WAS
LEAVING THE HOTEL,

1939
01:32:42,967 --> 01:32:44,199
SO I KNEW
I'D BE ON TIME.

1940
01:32:44,268 --> 01:32:45,901
I ASKED YOU TO TIE UP
YOUR WATCHDOGS.

1941
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,136
HE WON'T BE
FOLLOWED HERE.

1942
01:32:47,205 --> 01:32:48,637
THIS PLACE WON'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

1943
01:32:48,706 --> 01:32:50,038
I KNOW, BUT I'VE ALREADY
SPOKEN TO FERRARI.

1944
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:51,640
YOU'LL STILL
WIN AT ROULETTE.

1945
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:53,242
IS EVERYTHING READY?

1946
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:54,642
I HAVE
THE LETTERS.

1947
01:32:54,711 --> 01:32:57,245
WHEN WE SEARCHED THE PLACE,
WHERE WERE THEY?

1948
01:32:57,314 --> 01:32:58,213
SAM'S PIANO.

1949
01:32:58,282 --> 01:33:00,650

FOR NOT BEING MUSICAL.

1951
01:33:01,719 --> 01:33:03,052
HERE THEY ARE.

1952
01:33:03,121 --> 01:33:05,290
YOU'D BETTER
WAIT IN MY OFFICE.

1953
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,230
HERE.

1954
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:17,266
RICHARD, VICTOR THINKS
I'M LEAVING WITH HIM.

1955
01:33:17,335 --> 01:33:18,667
HAVEN'T YOU TOLD HIM?

1956
01:33:18,736 --> 01:33:20,068
NO, NOT YET.

1957
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:22,171
IT'S ALL RIGHT?
YOU ARRANGED EVERYTHING?

1958
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,738
YES. WE'LL TELL HIM
AT THE AIRPORT.

1959
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,475
THE LESS TIME TO THINK,
THE EASIER FOR ALL OF US.

1960
01:33:25,544 --> 01:33:26,778
PLEASE TRUST ME.

1961
01:33:29,046 --> 01:33:31,050
YES, I WILL.

1962
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:36,685
MONSIEUR BLAINE, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

1963
01:33:36,754 --> 01:33:39,658
SAVE IT. WE'VE LOTS
OF THINGS TO DO.

1964

THE MONEY.

1965
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,560
KEEP IT. YOU'LL
NEED IT IN AMERICA.

1966
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:46,361
BUT WE
MADE A DEAL.

1967
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:49,198
NEVER MIND. WILL YOU
HAVE TROUBLE IN LISBON?

1968
01:33:49,267 --> 01:33:50,365
NO. IT'S ALL ARRANGED.

1969
01:33:50,434 --> 01:33:53,568
GOOD. THE LETTERS ARE
ALL MADE OUT IN BLANK.

1970
01:33:53,637 --> 01:33:55,571
JUST FILL IN
THE SIGNATURES.

1972
01:33:57,536 --> 01:33:59,811
VICTOR LASZLO,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST...

WERE STOLEN.

YOU'RE SURPRISED
ABOUT MY FRIEND RICKY?

1977
01:34:09,954 --> 01:34:11,887
THE EXPLANATION
IS QUITE SIMPLE.

TRIUMPHED OVER VIRTUE.

1979

NOT SO FAST, LOUIS.

TO BE ARRESTED,

1981
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:19,628
NOT FOR A WHILE YET.

1982

HAVE YOU TAKEN LEAVE
OF YOUR SENSES?

1983
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,865
I HAVE.
SIT DOWN.

1984
01:34:22,934 --> 01:34:24,232
I WOULDN'T LIKE
TO SHOOT YOU,

1985
01:34:24,301 --> 01:34:26,034
BUT I WILL IF YOU
TAKE ONE MORE STEP.

1986
01:34:26,103 --> 01:34:29,669
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I WILL SIT DOWN.

WHAT THIS MEANS.

I DO. WE'LL DISCUSS
THAT LATER.

1991

AND YOU'RE NOT WITH HIM,

2043
01:36:56,654 --> 01:36:57,719
YOU'LL REGRET IT.

2044
01:36:57,788 --> 01:36:59,154
MAYBE NOT TODAY,
MAYBE NOT TOMORROW,

2045
01:36:59,223 --> 01:37:01,424
BUT SOON, AND FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

2046
01:37:01,493 --> 01:37:03,292
BUT WHAT ABOUT US?

2047
01:37:03,361 --> 01:37:06,195
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE IT.

2048
01:37:06,264 --> 01:37:09,164
WE'D LOST IT UNTIL YOU CAME
TO CASABLANCA.

2049
01:37:09,233 --> 01:37:11,200
WE GOT IT BACK
LAST NIGHT.

2050
01:37:11,269 --> 01:37:13,802
WHEN I SAID I
WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU.

2051
01:37:13,871 --> 01:37:15,304
AND YOU NEVER WILL,

2052
01:37:15,373 --> 01:37:17,038
BUT I'VE GOT A JOB
TO DO, TOO.

2053
01:37:17,107 --> 01:37:18,406
WHERE I'M GOING,
YOU CAN'T FOLLOW.

2054
01:37:18,475 --> 01:37:21,176
WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO,
YOU CAN'T BE PART OF.

2055
01:37:21,245 --> 01:37:23,913
I'M NO GOOD
AT BEING NOBLE,

2056
01:37:23,982 --> 01:37:25,914
BUT IT DOESN'T
TAKE MUCH TO SEE

2057
01:37:25,983 --> 01:37:27,715
THAT THE PROBLEMS
OF THREE LITTLE PEOPLE

2058
01:37:27,784 --> 01:37:30,920
DON'T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS
IN THIS CRAZY WORLD.

2059
01:37:30,989 --> 01:37:33,889
SOMEDAY YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND THAT.

2060
01:37:33,958 --> 01:37:35,127
NOW, NOW.

2061
01:37:37,594 --> 01:37:39,564
HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, KID.

2062
01:37:48,606 --> 01:37:50,309
[HONKS HORN]

2063
01:37:53,878 --> 01:37:55,210
EVERYTHING
IS IN ORDER.

2064
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:57,145
ALL EXCEPT
ONE THING.

2065
01:37:57,214 --> 01:37:58,614
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW

2066
01:37:58,683 --> 01:37:59,749
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

2067
01:37:59,818 --> 01:38:01,583
I DON'T ASK YOU
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

2068
01:38:01,652 --> 01:38:02,812
I'M GOING TO ANYWAY.

2069
01:38:02,881 --> 01:38:04,319
BECAUSE IT MAY MAKE
A DIFFERENCE LATER ON.

2070
01:38:04,388 --> 01:38:07,356
YOU SAID YOU KNEW
YES.ABOUT ILSA AND ME.

2071
01:38:07,425 --> 01:38:10,359
YOU DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
AT MY PLACE LAST NIGHT.

2072
01:38:10,428 --> 01:38:11,827
SHE CAME THERE FOR
THE LETTERS OF TRANSIT.

2073
01:38:11,896 --> 01:38:13,563
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

2074
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,824
YES.

2075
01:38:14,893 --> 01:38:17,365
SHE TRIED EVERYTHING,
AND NOTHING WORKED.

2076
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,101
SHE DID HER BEST
TO CONVINCE ME

2077
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:22,504
THAT SHE WAS STILL
IN LOVE WITH ME.

2078
01:38:22,573 --> 01:38:24,505
THAT WAS OVER LONG AGO.
FOR YOUR SAKE,

2079
01:38:24,574 --> 01:38:27,409
SHE PRETENDED IT WASN'T,
AND I LET HER PRETEND.

2080
01:38:27,478 --> 01:38:29,512
I UNDERSTAND.

2081
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:31,581
HERE IT IS.

2082
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,215
THANKS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

2083
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:36,251
WELCOME BACK TO THE FIGHT.

2084
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,959
THIS TIME I KNOW
OUR SIDE WILL WIN.

2085
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:54,639
ARE YOU READY, ILSA?

2086
01:38:56,808 --> 01:38:59,011
YES, I'M READY.

2087
01:39:02,413 --> 01:39:03,479
GOODBYE, RICK.

2088
01:39:03,548 --> 01:39:05,384
GOD BLESS YOU.

2089
01:39:07,217 --> 01:39:10,289
YOU'D BETTER HURRY
OR YOU'LL MISS THAT PLANE.

2090
01:39:27,905 --> 01:39:30,806
WELL, I WAS RIGHT.
YOU<i> ARE</i> A SENTIMENTALIST.

2091
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:32,207
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

2092
01:39:32,276 --> 01:39:34,209
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

2093
01:39:34,278 --> 01:39:35,811
WHAT YOU JUST DID
FOR LASZLO.

2094
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,178
THAT FAIRY TALE
YOU INVENTED.

2095
01:39:37,247 --> 01:39:38,914
I KNOW A LITTLE
ABOUT WOMEN.

2096
01:39:38,983 --> 01:39:41,249
SHE WENT, BUT SHE KNEW
YOU WERE LYING.

2097
01:39:41,318 --> 01:39:44,052
ANYWAY, THANKS
FOR HELPING ME OUT.

2098
01:39:44,121 --> 01:39:46,488
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
THIS WON'T BE PLEASANT

2099
01:39:46,557 --> 01:39:48,657
FOR EITHER OF US--
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.

2100
01:39:48,726 --> 01:39:50,158
I'LL HAVE TO ARREST YOU.

2101
01:39:50,227 --> 01:39:52,331
AS SOON AS THE PLANE GOES.

2102
01:39:59,098 --> 01:40:01,503
WHAT WAS THE MEANING
OF THAT PHONE CALL?

2103
01:40:01,572 --> 01:40:03,675
VICTOR LASZLO
IS ON THAT PLANE.

2104
01:40:05,376 --> 01:40:08,944
WHY DO YOU STAND HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU STOP HIM?

2105
01:40:09,013 --> 01:40:10,549
ASK MONSIEUR RICK.

2106
01:40:12,316 --> 01:40:14,116
GET AWAY
FROM THAT PHONE.

2107
01:40:14,185 --> 01:40:15,483
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
NOT TO INTERFERE.

2108
01:40:15,552 --> 01:40:17,920
I WAS WILLING TO SHOOT
CAPTAIN RENAULT,

2109
01:40:17,989 --> 01:40:19,591
AND I'M WILLING
TO SHOOT YOU.

2110
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:21,557
HELLO.

2111
01:40:21,626 --> 01:40:22,691
PUT THAT PHONE DOWN.

2112
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,726
GET ME THE RADIO TOWER.

2113
01:40:23,795 --> 01:40:25,630
PUT IT DOWN.

2114
01:40:38,909 --> 01:40:39,841
<i>MON CAPITAINE.</i>

2115
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:42,414
MAJOR STRASSER
HAS BEEN SHOT.

2116
01:40:46,017 --> 01:40:47,950
ROUND UP
THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

2117
01:40:48,019 --> 01:40:49,488
<i>OUI,</i>
<i>MON CAPITAINE.</i>

2118
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,059
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

2119
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:14,375
WELL, RICK, YOU'RE
NOT ONLY A SENTIMENTALIST,

2120
01:41:14,444 --> 01:41:16,378
BUT YOU'VE
BECOME A PATRIOT.

2121
01:41:16,447 --> 01:41:19,381
IT SEEMED LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO START.

2122
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,486
I THINK
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

2123
01:41:42,941 --> 01:41:45,273
IT MIGHT
BE A GOOD IDEA

2124
01:41:45,342 --> 01:41:46,908
FOR YOU TO DISAPPEAR

2125
01:41:46,977 --> 01:41:48,277
FROM CASABLANCA
FOR A WHILE.

2126
01:41:48,346 --> 01:41:50,245
THERE'S A FREE
FRENCH GARRISON

2127
01:41:50,314 --> 01:41:51,513
OVER AT BRAZZAVILLE.

2128
01:41:51,582 --> 01:41:53,849
I COULD BE INDUCED TO
ARRANGE YOUR PASSAGE.

2129
01:41:53,918 --> 01:41:55,250
MY LETTER OF TRANSIT?

2130
01:41:55,319 --> 01:41:56,847
I COULD USE A TRIP,

2131
01:41:56,916 --> 01:41:58,921
BUT IT DOESN'T
AFFECT OUR BET.

2132
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:01,422
YOU STILL
OWE ME 10,000 FRANCS.

2133
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:04,425
AND THAT 10,000 FRANCS
SHOULD PAY OUR EXPENSES.

2134
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,761
<i>OUR</i> EXPENSES?

2135
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:06,695
MM-HMM.

2136
01:42:06,764 --> 01:42:09,164
LOUIS, I THINK
THIS IS THE BEGINNING

2137
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:10,565
OF A BEAUTIFUL
FRIENDSHIP.
