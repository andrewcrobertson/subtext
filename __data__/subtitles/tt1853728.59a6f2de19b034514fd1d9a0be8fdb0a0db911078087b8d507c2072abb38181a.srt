1
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:26,284
[theme song plays]

2
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,204
[chains rattling]

3
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,054
[man grunting]

4
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,228
[horse nickering]

5
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,953
- Whoa.
- [horses snorting]

6
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,789
[gentle metallic rattling]

7
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,419
Whoa.

8
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,061
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

9
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,024
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

10
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,776
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

11
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:31,279
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:36,284
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,287
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:41,789
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

15
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:43,624
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

16
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,626
Might that be you?

17
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,756
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,799
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:52,884
[snorting]

20
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,554
- What kinda doctor?
- [Schultz] Dentist.

21
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,514
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

22
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,476
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,228
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:07,732
- Speak English.
- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,109
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,571
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,157
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:17,784
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,704
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:25,166
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,127
[man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,130
Who said that?

33
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:39,931
[Schultz lighting match]

34
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,720
What's your name?

35
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,768
Django.

36
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,688
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

37
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,775
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

38
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:37,405
Who are they?

39
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,450
Big John.

40
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,578
Ellis.

41
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:48,916
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,503
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,754
Not anymore.

44
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,884
Tell me...

45
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,262
if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,098
- would you recognize them?
- [man] Hey.

47
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:06,726
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like What?

48
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,436
Like that.

49
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:10,897
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,107
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,026
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:18,905
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,074
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,244
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,538
Move it.

56
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:32,627
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:36,589
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,550
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,304
Oh, very well.

60
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,014
[horse whinnying]

61
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,935
[man screaming]

62
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,732
[scream echoing]

63
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,331
[screaming continues]

64
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,502
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,587
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:19,048
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:22,635
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,596
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:27,473
And you killed Ace!

70
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,309
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,312
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

72
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,440
five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,485
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,196
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,700
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,868
[screaming resumes]

77
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:53,165
- [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,044
if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,422
Yeah.

80
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:00,881
Sold American!

81
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:05,011
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:12,935
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,276
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:23,904
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:25,948
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:27,908
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:32,079
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:50,097
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,608
[screaming]

90
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:05,696
Goddamn it! Oh!
[moaning]

91
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:12,536
One hundred... ten... 20...

92
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,538
and five...

93
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,957
for young Django here.

94
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,293
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,962
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:27,635
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,387
Do you have one?

98
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:32,473
- You go to hell, dentist.
- [scoffs]

99
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,642
I thought not.

100
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,312
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,235
Thank you.

102
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:47,988
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,495
[nickering]

104
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,335
Whoa.

105
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:08,968
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:14,181
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:17,184
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:22,481
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,567
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:28,320
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:34,160
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,871
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:40,583
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,835
Choice is yours.

115
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,381
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:50,551
the North Star is that one.

117
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,181
Ta-ta. [clucking]

118
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:14,074
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:17,536
- [lantern crashing]
- [chains rattling]

120
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:21,123
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,586
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:29,340
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,468
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,678
- I'll get you your freedom.
- [gun cocking]

125
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:38,599
- No. No, please...
- [gunshot echoing]

126
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,158
[dogs barking nearby]

127
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:23,269
[squeaking]

128
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,312
All right, now.

129
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,481
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

130
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,858
- [coughing]
- ...and then in the morning...

131
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,779
That's a nigger on a horse.

132
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,181
What's everybody staring at?

133
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:03,851
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

134
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,313
[goats bleating]

135
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,156
Whoa.

136
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,209
Good morning, innkeeper!

137
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:33,005
Two beers for two weary travelers.

138
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,923
It's still a bit early.

139
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,509
We won't be open for another hour.

140
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,511
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

141
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:45,100
[gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

142
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,353
Get that nigger outta here!

143
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:54,902
- [panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

144
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,238
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

145
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,282
[man] Sheriff! Help!

146
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,076
Alas.

147
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,996
Now we must act as our own bartender.

148
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,167
Sit down, my boy.

149
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,721
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [chortles]

150
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:28,143
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

151
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:36,068
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

152
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,655
bounty hunter.

153
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,080
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

154
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,832
No.

155
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,208
Well...

156
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:56,964
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

157
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:59,466
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

158
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,844
[tsking] Hat

159
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,141
Prost.

160
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:17,985
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

161
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:20,821
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:24,950
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

163
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,828
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:30,789
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,666
I truly have killed him,

166
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,836
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:39,339
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

168
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:41,967
What's a bounty?

169
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:47,222
It's like a reward.

170
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,768
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

171
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,811
Certain people, yeah.

172
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,104
Bad people?

173
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,233
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

174
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,694
Which brings me to you.

175
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:05,115
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

176
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,701
On one hand, I despise slavery.

177
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,996
On the other hand, I need your help.

178
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,541
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

179
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,086
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

180
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:20,464
work to my benefit.

181
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:25,302
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

182
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,226
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

183
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,109
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

184
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,115
However, at this endeavor,

185
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:52,412
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

186
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,542
But you do. Don't ya?

187
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,919
I know what they look like all right.

188
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:02,589
Good. So here's my agreement.

189
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:06,176
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

190
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:08,971
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

191
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:11,306
but I don't know where.

192
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:15,769
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

193
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:21,191
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

194
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,612
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

195
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:29,908
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

196
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,787
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

197
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:38,876
[scoffs]

198
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:47,050
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

199
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:54,266
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

200
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,019
Go about your business.

201
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,188
These jokers will be gone soon.

202
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:07,571
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

203
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:10,991
And scare all these nice people.

204
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,828
You ain't got nothing better to do

205
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:18,206
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

206
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,626
and show your ass?

207
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,633
- [metal springing noise]
- [sheriff screaming]

208
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,672
- [crowd gasping]
- [groaning]

209
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,215
[woman screams]

210
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,888
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- [groaning]

211
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,224
- [yelling]
- [shot echoing]

212
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,601
[woman gasps]

213
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,728
[crowd screaming]

214
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,526
Now you can get the marshal.

215
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:50,364
[man] Marshal! Marshal!

216
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,783
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

217
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,159
After you.

218
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,832
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

219
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,877
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

220
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,213
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

221
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,715
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

222
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,843
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

223
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,013
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

224
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,350
You in the saloon!

225
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,853
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

226
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:25,732
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

227
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,069
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

228
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,196
and I mean right now.

229
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:35,742
[Schultz] Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

230
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,703
Yes, it is.

231
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,955
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

232
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,416
[Schultz]
Na wunderbar, marshal.

233
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,503
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

234
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,589
and just as you have instructed,

235
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:52,426
I am ready to step outside

236
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:56,680
with my hands raised above my head.

237
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,183
I trust as a representative

238
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,729
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

239
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:09,735
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

240
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,738
before I've had my day in court.

241
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,240
You mean like you did our sheriff.

242
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,200
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

243
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,703
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

244
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,542
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

245
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,132
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

246
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,302
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

247
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,306
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

248
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:43,310
They're a little tense out there.

249
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:46,938
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

250
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,941
- [doors squeaking open]
- Come ahead.

251
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,241
You unarmed?

252
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,118
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

253
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:04,206
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

254
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:06,333
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

255
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,835
as to the incident that just occurred?

256
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,631
- Go on.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,925
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

258
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:18,345
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

259
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:21,932
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

260
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:26,186
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

261
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:30,941
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

262
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,693
with a price on his head of $200.

263
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,822
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

264
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,323
The hell, you say!

265
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,536
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

266
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:45,872
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

267
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,542
sometime in the past two years?

268
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:50,460
Yeah.

269
00:22:50,627 --> 00:22:54,047
[Schultz] I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

270
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:57,676
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

271
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,638
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

272
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:07,477
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

273
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:09,354
You're encouraged to wire him.

274
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:14,568
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

275
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:18,697
[guns uncocking]

276
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:26,663
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

277
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,749
[medium-tempo song plays]

278
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,840
I'll be damned.

279
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,455
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

280
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:14,169
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

281
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:18,381
What's your plan after that?

282
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:24,471
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

283
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:31,603
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

284
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,397
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

285
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:38,151
Oh, me and my wife do.

286
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:42,489
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

287
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,325
[man] Django.

288
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:48,578
Django, Django-

289
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:51,456
You got sand, Django.

290
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,042
Boy's got sand.

291
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,964
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

292
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:04,177
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

293
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:05,387
And the girl, too.

294
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:07,347
[groaning]

295
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:12,310
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

296
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,021
Both of 'em.

297
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:16,940
Separately.

298
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,735
And this one...

299
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:26,074
you will sell him cheap.

300
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,536
In Greenville...

301
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,041
there should be some sort
of a records office.

302
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:44,467
You know when she was sold...

303
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,888
you know where she came from,

304
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,890
and you know her name.

305
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,226
What is her name?

306
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:55,061
Broomhilda.

307
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,899
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

308
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:02,027
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

309
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:07,115
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

310
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,409
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

311
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:12,120
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

312
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,414
She speak a little German, too.

313
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,333
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

314
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,335
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

315
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,086
to speak German with.

316
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,257
Well, let me get this straight.

317
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:29,012
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

318
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,305
Yep.

319
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:37,103
They call me Hildi.

320
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:47,614
[rooster crowing nearby]

321
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:59,376
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

322
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,463
You'll be playing a character.

323
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:11,471
Hm?

324
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,598
No?

325
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:25,068
During the act, you can
never break character.

326
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:27,695
Do you understand?

327
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,990
Yeah. Don't break character.

328
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:37,247
And your character
is that of The Valet.

329
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,499
What that is?

330
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,794
That's a fancy word for servant.

331
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,212
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

332
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:45,547
[chuckles]

333
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:50,218
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

334
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,472
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

335
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,598
But of course.

336
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:59,436
[medium-tempo song
resumes playing]

337
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:25,587
Whoa.

338
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:33,470
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

339
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:37,015
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

340
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,060
- I said niggers on horses...
- [Schultz] His name is Django.

341
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:44,022
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

342
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,650
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

343
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:53,323
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

344
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,950
Allow me to unring this bell.

345
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:59,954
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

346
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,248
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

347
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:04,250
- [snorting]
- [women giggling]

348
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:07,462
Mr. Bennett?

349
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:11,841
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

350
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:15,970
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

351
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:18,056
to parley with you now.

352
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,186
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

353
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,815
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

354
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:29,776
to buy one of my nigger gals?

355
00:29:29,943 --> 00:29:31,611
No appointment, no nothin'?

356
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,696
Oh, I'm afraid so.

357
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:36,282
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

358
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,117
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

359
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,495
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

360
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,622
Now what you got to say about that?

361
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,877
Mr. Bennett.

362
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:51,297
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

363
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:56,636
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

364
00:29:58,054 --> 00:29:59,097
[chuckles softly]

365
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:04,310
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

366
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:07,397
Hm-mm.

367
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,151
[chuckles]

368
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:20,785
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

369
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,496
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

370
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:26,040
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

371
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,376
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

372
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:30,295
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

373
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,338
What's your Jimmie's name again?

374
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,007
<i>'</i> Django.
<i>'</i> Django.

375
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:36,342
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

376
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:39,721
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

377
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,180
As you please, Big Daddy.

378
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:45,268
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

379
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:48,771
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

380
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,441
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

381
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:54,611
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

382
00:30:54,777 --> 00:30:59,407
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

383
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,910
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

384
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,997
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

385
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,042
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

386
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,337
No. That's not what I said.

387
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,048
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

388
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:20,053
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

389
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:24,682
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

390
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,809
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

391
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,729
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

392
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:31,397
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

393
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:34,692
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

394
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,820
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

395
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,324
[playing medium-tempo tune]

396
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:47,497
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

397
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:50,583
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

398
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:53,920
That there is the pantry.

399
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:57,590
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

400
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:59,801
Po' little squirrels.

401
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:03,930
What you do for your massa?

402
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:05,898
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

403
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:08,434
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

404
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,937
You mean you wanna dress like that?

405
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:15,233
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

406
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,486
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

407
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,113
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

408
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,156
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

409
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:26,619
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

410
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:28,621
I don't know them.

411
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:31,040
They could be usin' a different name.

412
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,459
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

413
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:36,254
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

414
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,548
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:40,466
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

416
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,385
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

417
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:44,846
Well, one's over in that field.

418
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,646
[medium-tempo song plays]

419
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,528
[Django] Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

420
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:01,816
She work in the house, John.

421
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,698
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

422
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,825
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

423
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,869
Now, your Bible say...

424
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,625
[Django] Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

425
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,419
You ready?

426
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,880
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

427
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:20,423
it should be me. It should be me, John.

428
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,551
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

429
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:26,304
[dogs barking in distance]

430
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,351
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

431
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,064
She's a... she's a house slave.

432
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:40,651
- She a house slave, she can't be...
- [screaming]

433
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,657
[dogs howling]

434
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:55,541
[screaming]

435
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,507
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

436
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,553
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

437
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:07,512
[gasping sobbing]

438
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,641
L's on my knees, John.

439
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:13,768
I like the way you beg, boy.

440
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:16,437
[whip cracking, echoing]

441
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,066
Is that who you was lookin' for?

442
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:23,069
Yep.

443
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,655
Where the other two at?

444
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:29,575
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

445
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:31,410
They whippin' Little Jody?

446
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,913
Point me in that direction.

447
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:37,625
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

448
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:44,340
Go get that white man
I came here with.

449
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,260
- [man] Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

450
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:48,928
- Come on, girlie.
- [shrieks] Please!

451
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,639
- Come on. Get you set up now.
- [screaming]

452
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:54,267
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

453
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,395
- [cracking]
- "...and the dread of ye

454
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,856
shall be on every beast
of the earth."'

455
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:00,982
[cracking]

456
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:02,525
Come here now, woman!

457
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:05,778
- You'd better give me that arm!
- [screaming]

458
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:24,714
OK, she's ready!

459
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,093
[whimpering]

460
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:42,815
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

461
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,154
John Brittle!

462
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,385
- You remember me?
- [metal springing noise]

463
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,690
I like the way you die, boy.

464
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,990
Goddamn son of a bitch!

465
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,834
[grunting]

466
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,878
[whip cracking]

467
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:47,672
[groaning]

468
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,510
- Keep it funny!
- [grunting]

469
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,099
[yelling]

470
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:08,734
[man groaning]

471
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:19,537
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

472
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:21,789
[cocking pistol]

473
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,709
No! [groans]

474
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,631
[clicking]

475
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:36,387
Who were they?

476
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:40,099
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

477
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:41,767
Where's Ellis?

478
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,270
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

479
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:50,609
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

480
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:52,695
- Positive?
- I don't know.

481
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,114
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

482
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,532
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

483
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,993
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

484
00:38:12,214 --> 00:38:13,799
I'm positive he dead.

485
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:19,847
Django!

486
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,060
Everybody calm down.

487
00:38:24,226 --> 00:38:26,479
We mean no one else any harm.

488
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,189
Who are you two jokers?

489
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,358
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

490
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:34,195
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

491
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:38,949
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

492
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,077
In my pocket is a warrant,

493
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:45,331
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

494
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:49,376
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

495
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:54,548
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

496
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,801
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

497
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:02,348
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

498
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:04,183
These are wanted men.

499
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,810
The law wants 'em for murder.

500
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:10,106
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

501
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:13,567
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

502
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:17,196
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

503
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:22,701
I realize passions are high,

504
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:26,914
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

505
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,521
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

506
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,546
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

507
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:41,303
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

508
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:44,515
Gimme.

509
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:02,408
Satisfied?

510
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:11,208
May I have that back, please?

511
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:19,925
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

512
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:25,014
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

513
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,561
[Schultz whistling indistinctly]

514
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:54,376
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

515
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,638
[galloping hoofbeats]

516
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:11,769
- [dramatic choral music]
- [horses snorting, whinnying]

517
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,655
[men yelling, whooping]

518
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,668
Come on, men!

519
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:41,382
- [man 1] We're coming for you, nigger!
- [man 2] Hee-haw!

520
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:55,020
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

521
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:57,398
That's way too simple for these jokers.

522
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,776
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

523
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:05,990
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

524
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:11,078
Damn.

525
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,040
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

526
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,251
We ready or what?

527
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,795
[Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

528
00:42:19,962 --> 00:42:22,339
- [fabric ripping]
- Oh... Oh, shit.

529
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,717
I just made it worse.

530
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,927
Who made this goddamn shit?

531
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:30,055
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

532
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:33,809
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

533
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:36,562
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

534
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:38,397
I coulda cut it better than this!

535
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:41,358
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

536
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,735
Not too good.

537
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:47,239
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

538
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:50,909
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

539
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,162
- Shit.
- [man] Yeah.

540
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,372
I just made mine worse.

541
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,333
Oh, God.

542
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,043
Anybody bring any extra bags?

543
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,171
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

544
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,964
I'm just askin'.

545
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:05,924
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

546
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:07,301
Oh, well, shitfire!

547
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:10,554
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

548
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,681
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

549
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:15,559
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

550
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,145
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

551
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:22,107
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

552
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:24,276
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

553
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:28,197
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

554
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:31,533
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

555
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:35,704
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

556
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:38,957
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

557
00:43:39,124 --> 00:43:40,459
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

558
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:44,463
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

559
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,426
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

560
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,552
- Yeah.
- [mumbling agreements]

561
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,807
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

562
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,478
So how 'bout no bags this time,

563
00:43:59,645 --> 00:44:04,650
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

564
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:06,857
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

565
00:44:06,985 --> 00:44:10,322
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

566
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,491
But nobody can see.

567
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:13,742
So?

568
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:15,786
So it'd be nice to see.

569
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:20,707
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

570
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:26,255
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

571
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:29,216
- [overlapping shouts]
- [man] Sons of bitches!

572
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:31,718
I can't see shit!

573
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:35,514
[Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

574
00:44:36,348 --> 00:44:38,350
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

575
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,144
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

576
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,728
- What?
- They tricked us!

577
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:42,938
Well, where are they?

578
00:44:43,105 --> 00:44:44,523
Auf Wiedersehen.

579
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,277
- [all shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

580
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,030
Oh! [chuckles]

581
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:53,240
Bull's-eye.

582
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:56,076
- [men yelling]
- [horses whinnying]

583
00:44:56,243 --> 00:44:59,538
- [Django] Look at 'em run.
- [all shouting]

584
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,751
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

585
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:06,879
Goddamn it!

586
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,261
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

587
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:20,601
Would you care to?

588
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:29,234
Can't see shit outta this!

589
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,029
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

590
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:35,532
[Schultz]
Big Daddy's getting away.

591
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,950
I got him.

592
00:45:41,413 --> 00:45:43,916
- [slow-motion impact sound]
- [Big Daddy grunting]

593
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,258
Got him.

594
00:45:58,096 --> 00:46:01,099
[chuckles] The kid's a natural.

595
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,439
[animal yipping nearby]

596
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:15,572
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

597
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,991
Broomhilda is a German name.

598
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:20,869
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

599
00:46:21,036 --> 00:46:23,288
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

600
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,042
Broomhilda is the name of a character

601
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:31,129
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

602
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:33,257
There's a story about Broomhilda?

603
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,133
Oh, yes, there is.

604
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:44,643
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

605
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:52,442
Would you like me to tell you?

606
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:59,950
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

607
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,872
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

608
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:10,127
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

609
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,545
What she do?

610
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:13,964
I can't exactly remember.

611
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,800
She disobeys him in some way.

612
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:20,137
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

613
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:21,930
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

614
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:23,348
It's a German legend,

615
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:26,310
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

616
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,522
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

617
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:37,279
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

618
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:43,076
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

619
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:49,666
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

620
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,336
Does a fella arise?

621
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,464
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

622
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:57,674
A fella named Siegfried.

623
00:47:58,383 --> 00:47:59,384
Does Siegfried save her?

624
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:04,181
Quite spectacularly so.

625
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:09,353
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

626
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:14,232
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

627
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,902
And he walks through hellfire...

628
00:48:19,237 --> 00:48:21,615
because Broomhilda's worth it.

629
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:27,412
I know how he feel.

630
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,750
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

631
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:41,426
Now, look, Django...

632
00:48:44,346 --> 00:48:48,392
I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

633
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:53,105
but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

634
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:58,610
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

635
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:01,655
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

636
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:06,785
But let me ask you a question.

637
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:16,712
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

638
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:20,549
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

639
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:22,718
What's not to like?

640
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:25,303
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

641
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,306
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

642
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:30,559
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

643
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,686
but normally, that's a good thing.

644
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:35,689
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

645
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:37,858
What you mean "partner up"?

646
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:42,320
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

647
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:45,323
I give you a third of my bounties.

648
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:50,454
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

649
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,540
I'll take you to Greenville myself

650
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:56,918
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

651
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:02,924
Why you care what happen to me?

652
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:06,636
Why you care if I find my wife?

653
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,180
Frankly...

654
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,350
I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

655
00:50:12,517 --> 00:50:16,354
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

656
00:50:17,606 --> 00:50:21,318
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

657
00:50:23,862 --> 00:50:26,740
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

658
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:29,534
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

659
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,461
[medium-tempo song plays]

660
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:39,831
[man] You got her.

661
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,551
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

662
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:54,429
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

663
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:56,181
He'll have a loved one with him.

664
00:52:56,348 --> 00:52:58,850
Maybe even share a last word.

665
00:53:00,852 --> 00:53:02,896
That's better than most of them get.

666
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:05,357
Damn sight better than he deserves.

667
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:14,866
Put down the rifle.

668
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,579
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

669
00:53:20,372 --> 00:53:22,707
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

670
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,171
Read it aloud.

671
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:30,840
Consider that today's lesson.

672
00:53:33,259 --> 00:53:35,929

01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:58,254
[Calvin] Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

857
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,172
[man screaming]

858
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:02,133
[Calvin] There you go!

859
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,928
There you go! Look at that.

860
01:06:07,012 --> 01:06:09,974
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

861
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:12,184
Do what I told you, boy!

862
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,811
- There you go!
- [bones cracking]

863
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:16,272
- No!
- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!

864
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,483
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

865
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:21,736
[man screaming]

866
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:24,405
- Oh, no, Luigi.
- [screaming]

867
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:31,537
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [screaming]

868
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:33,330
Oh...

869
01:06:33,497 --> 01:06:36,333
- [panting]
- [man continues screaming]

870
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,422
[playing pool]

871
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:43,716
[screaming continues]

872
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:45,176
Finish him.

873
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,223
Go on, boy, finish him!

874
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:54,185
[screaming halts]

875
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,438
[Moguy] That's why they
call him Big Fred.

876
01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:01,025
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

877
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:03,402
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

878
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:06,572
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

879
01:07:07,198 --> 01:07:08,908
Mercedes.

880
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,222
Tequila.

881
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:42,733
What's your name?

882
01:07:44,902 --> 01:07:46,403
Django.

883
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:50,491
Can you spell it?

884
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:56,664
D-J-A-N-G-O.

885
01:07:58,165 --> 01:07:59,667
The D is silent.

886
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:01,418
I know.

887
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,218
[speaks foreign language]

888
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,888
[Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

889
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,765
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

890
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:17,518
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

891
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:20,485
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

892
01:08:20,604 --> 01:08:21,605
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

893
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:25,651
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

894
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:32,491
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

895
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:33,951
Yessir.

896
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:47,256
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

897
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,632
[Calvin chuckles]

898
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:52,428
Where'd you dig him up?

899
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,848
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

900
01:08:57,558 --> 01:08:59,643
I've heard tell about you.

901
01:09:00,394 --> 01:09:03,147
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

902
01:09:03,314 --> 01:09:05,441
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

903
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:09,820
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

904
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,199
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

905
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:19,580
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

906
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:21,957
No offense given...

907
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,001
none taken.

908
01:09:24,168 --> 01:09:25,878
[Schultz] Monsieur Candie...

909
01:09:26,045 --> 01:09:29,548
I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

910
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:31,175
One...

911
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,929
you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

912
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,932
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

913
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:39,934
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

914
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,936
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

915
01:09:42,102 --> 01:09:44,188
Do not spare the rum.

916
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:47,858
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

917
01:09:48,025 --> 01:09:49,735
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

918
01:09:49,902 --> 01:09:55,032
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

919
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,703
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

920
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,289
I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

921
01:10:02,456 --> 01:10:04,583
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

922
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,294
at above top-dollar market price.

923
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:10,005
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

924
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,549
it would be to discuss business.

925
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,721
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

926
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:20,224
We were discussin' my curiosity.

927
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:23,519
Thank you.

928
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,397
[Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

929
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,860
Sheba... you stay right there.

930
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,570
I know you didn't mean me.

931
01:10:35,322 --> 01:10:37,825
- Prost!
- German.

932
01:10:38,742 --> 01:10:42,538
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

933
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,748
I'm doing business with both y'all.

934
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:47,334
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

935
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:51,255
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

936
01:10:51,422 --> 01:10:52,589
Hm.

937
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:54,883
So...

938
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,969
Bright Boy...

939
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:59,096
Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

940
01:10:59,263 --> 01:11:01,432
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

941
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:03,100
Not for top dollar.

942
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:07,312
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

943
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:09,606
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

944
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:12,026
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

945
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:14,153
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

946
01:11:15,112 --> 01:11:18,282
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

947
01:11:18,449 --> 01:11:22,745
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

948
01:11:24,997 --> 01:11:28,667
Well, you won't sell your best.

949
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:31,253
You won't even sell your second best.

950
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,090
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

951
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:39,178
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

952
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:42,014
[chortles]
...who knows what could happen?

953
01:11:44,349 --> 01:11:46,643
And what do you consider ridiculous?

954
01:11:47,644 --> 01:11:51,732
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

955
01:11:53,484 --> 01:11:55,527
How much would you say, Django?

956
01:11:58,906 --> 01:12:00,616
Twelve thousand dollars.

957
01:12:01,325 --> 01:12:02,993
[straw slurping]

958
01:12:05,162 --> 01:12:09,166
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

959
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,251
but now you have my attention.

960
01:12:24,932 --> 01:12:30,604
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

961
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:33,190
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

962
01:12:33,357 --> 01:12:37,277
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

963
01:12:37,444 --> 01:12:40,322
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

964
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,032
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

965
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:44,326
You can tie your horse up back there.

966
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:53,836
[Calvin] Django.

967
01:12:58,632 --> 01:13:02,261
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

968
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:07,599
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

969
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:11,895
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

970
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:16,733
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

971
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,402
The exceptional nigger.

972
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:21,446
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

973
01:13:22,573 --> 01:13:23,740
Sun is up.

974
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:26,785
Shining on all of us.

975
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,459
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

976
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:35,919
Quite an honor.

977
01:13:36,086 --> 01:13:37,796
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

978
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:41,341
<i>[Calvin] But I do believe that,
given time,</i>

979
01:13:41,508 --> 01:13:44,469
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

980
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:47,264
become if not frequent...

981
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:50,142
more frequent.

982
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:56,481
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

983
01:13:56,648 --> 01:13:59,526
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

984
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,196
[men laughing]

985
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,790
- Whoa!
- [whinnying]

986
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:18,712
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

987
01:14:18,879 --> 01:14:20,797
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

988
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:22,007
Are you kidding me?

989
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:24,176
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

990
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:26,887
Now take your hand off your pistol!

991
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,766
Butch, that means you too.

992
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:34,978
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

993
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,690
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

994
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:40,984
He broke my collarbone!

995
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:45,447
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

996
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:48,659
- [man] Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

997
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:51,411
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

998
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:54,039
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

999
01:14:54,206 --> 01:14:55,999
You wanna hold my hand?

1000
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,460
[chuckling]

1001
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,629
[rap song playing]

1002
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:02,422
[clucking]

1003
01:15:02,589 --> 01:15:05,259
Willie, take us home.

1004
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:09,513
[man] Start moving!

1005
01:15:15,894 --> 01:15:17,145
Head 'em out!

1006
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,375
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1007
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:05,736
No, sir.

1008
01:16:05,902 --> 01:16:07,404
You want a boot heel in it?

1009
01:16:08,613 --> 01:16:09,573
No, sir.

1010
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,784
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1011
01:16:12,951 --> 01:16:16,079
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1012
01:16:16,246 --> 01:16:17,789
Now move, nigger!

1013
01:16:18,332 --> 01:16:19,750
[horse snorting]

1014
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:22,044
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1015
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,087
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1016
01:16:24,254 --> 01:16:27,841
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:28,008 --> 01:16:31,053
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? [chuckles]

1018
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,554
Indeed.

1019
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,435
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1020
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:42,314
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1021
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:45,567
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1022
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:50,113
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1023
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,910
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1024
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,120
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1025
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:03,752
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1026
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:07,297
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1027
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:09,341
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1028
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:11,968
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1029
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:16,765
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1030
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,892
You lose sight of why we're here.

1031
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:20,860
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:17:21,019 --> 01:17:23,522
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1033
01:17:23,688 --> 01:17:28,652
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1034
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:33,490
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1035
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:36,660
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1036
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,371
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1037
01:17:40,372 --> 01:17:45,794
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1038
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,754
and he didn't bat a eye.

1039
01:17:49,172 --> 01:17:50,298
You remember that?

1040
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:53,885
Yeah, of course I remember.

1041
01:17:54,052 --> 01:17:57,514
What you said was that
this is my world...

1042
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:00,475
and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1043
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,354
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1044
01:18:08,024 --> 01:18:11,194
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1045
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,739
that was the general gist.

1046
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,408
[sighing]

1047
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:19,995
See you at Candyland.

1048
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:30,297
[Django]
All right, niggers, back at it.

1049
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,633
That means you too, Moonlight.

1050
01:18:42,476 --> 01:18:45,103
[dogs barking nearby]

1051
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:12,422
[dogs barking loudly]

1052
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:23,892
[Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1053
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:27,312
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1054
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:29,564
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1055
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:31,024
[Calvin] Yes, you can.

1056
01:19:31,191 --> 01:19:34,736
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1057
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:37,322
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1058
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:40,116
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

1059
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:42,327
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1060
01:19:42,494 --> 01:19:44,037
Hush up! Hey!

1061
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:46,831
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1062
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:49,251
[dogs whining]

1063
01:19:56,341 --> 01:19:59,803
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

1064
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,638
Yessir.

1065
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,848
[dogs resume barking]

1066
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,479
[barking stops]

1067
01:20:24,202 --> 01:20:26,329
How long was he loose?

1068
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:29,749
[speech slurred]
A night. Day.

1069
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:31,543
Half the other night.

1070
01:20:32,669 --> 01:20:34,212
How far he get off the property?

1071
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:36,089
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1072
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:38,383
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1073
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,926
Hm.

1074
01:20:41,177 --> 01:20:44,514
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1075
01:20:44,681 --> 01:20:46,308
One-a this new lot.

1076
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,186
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1077
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:52,856
[D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

1078
01:20:53,023 --> 01:20:54,543
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

1079
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,110
Now, no beggin'.

1080
01:20:57,277 --> 01:20:59,738
No playin' on my soft heart.

1081
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,744
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

1082
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:12,208
I done paid $500 for you.

1083
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:17,255
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1084
01:21:17,422 --> 01:21:19,799
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1085
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:23,845
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1086
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:26,723
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1087
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,391
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1088
01:21:28,558 --> 01:21:31,561
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1089
01:21:31,728 --> 01:21:32,771
Yessir.

1090
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,484
Still, the fact remains:

1091
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:41,279
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1092
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:43,990
So what about my $500, huh?

1093
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,786
What about my $500?

1094
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:50,872
You gonna reimburse me?

1095
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:59,255
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1096
01:21:59,422 --> 01:22:01,466
- [laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

1097
01:22:03,259 --> 01:22:05,762
[laughter continues]

1098
01:22:07,764 --> 01:22:09,474
I'll reimburse you!

1099
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,437
You Will?

1100
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:17,190
Yep.

1101
01:22:19,943 --> 01:22:22,654
You'll pay $500

1102
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:26,282
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1103
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:27,575
No, he won't.

1104
01:22:29,828 --> 01:22:31,913
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1105
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:34,791
Matter of fact, so am I.

1106
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:37,419
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1107
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,465
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1108
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:42,340
You heard him.

1109
01:22:51,516 --> 01:22:55,270
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1110
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,107
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1111
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:01,860
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1112
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,572
That right.

1113
01:23:06,573 --> 01:23:07,907
[Calvin] For that matter...

1114
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,785
nor have I.

1115
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:18,042
Now...

1116
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,338
seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1117
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:28,178
you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1118
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,847
He's your nigger.

1119
01:23:34,601 --> 01:23:36,686
Mr. Stonesipher?

1120
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:41,441
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1121
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:46,404
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
- [barks echoing]

1122
01:23:47,864 --> 01:23:50,074
Get 'im, get 'im!

1123
01:23:51,117 --> 01:23:53,620
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1124
01:23:53,787 --> 01:23:55,205
Whoo-ee!

1125
01:24:00,418 --> 01:24:03,046
- [dogs snarling]
- [screaming]

1126
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:25,610
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1127
01:24:25,777 --> 01:24:27,946
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1128
01:24:28,112 --> 01:24:32,742
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1129
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:34,619
Hm.

1130
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:37,080
You are used to it?

1131
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:40,208
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1132
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:45,088
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1133
01:24:45,255 --> 01:24:46,881
whenever you're ready.

1134
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:50,426
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1135
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:52,220
Let's get to it.

1136
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:57,809
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1137
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:01,437
Follow me.

1138
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,743
[snarling]

1139
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,001
[clucking]

1140
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,377
[nickering]

1141
01:26:58,721 --> 01:27:01,432
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1142
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:04,435
Stand up straight, now!

1143
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:06,896
Get up there.

1144
01:27:07,063 --> 01:27:09,649
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1145
01:27:09,816 --> 01:27:11,442
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1146
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:13,695
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1147
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:12,628
[indistinct chatter]

1148
01:28:13,337 --> 01:28:14,964
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1149
01:28:15,131 --> 01:28:17,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1150
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:20,928
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1151
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,432
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1152
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:26,976
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir. [laughs]

1153
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:30,688
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1154
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:34,776
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
- [all chuckling]

1155
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:38,780
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1156
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,032
[laughing]

1157
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:45,661
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1158
01:28:45,828 --> 01:28:47,497
Hey, Snowball?

1159
01:28:48,706 --> 01:28:52,293
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1160
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,296
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1161
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,223
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1162
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,674
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1163
01:28:58,841 --> 01:29:00,961
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1164
01:29:01,094 --> 01:29:05,389
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1165
01:29:05,556 --> 01:29:07,934
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1166
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:10,353
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1167
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,315
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1168
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:17,735
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1169
01:29:17,902 --> 01:29:21,906
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1170
01:29:22,073 --> 01:29:25,993
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1171
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,537
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1172
01:29:27,703 --> 01:29:31,207
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1173
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:33,751
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1174
01:29:33,918 --> 01:29:35,586
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1175
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:38,381
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1176
01:29:39,382 --> 01:29:40,883
Yessir. I understand.

1177
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,511
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1178
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,805
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1179
01:29:46,973 --> 01:29:48,641
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1180
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:51,018
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1181
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,771
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1182
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:56,232
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1183
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:58,442
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1184
01:29:58,609 --> 01:30:00,945
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1185
01:30:01,112 --> 01:30:03,364
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1186
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,741
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1187
01:30:05,908 --> 01:30:07,827
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1188
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:09,620
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1189
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:13,666
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1190
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:16,294
Go on, now.

1191
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,630
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1192
01:30:19,797 --> 01:30:21,132
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1193
01:30:21,299 --> 01:30:24,844
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1194
01:30:25,011 --> 01:30:26,179
Now...

1195
01:30:26,345 --> 01:30:31,017
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1196
01:30:31,184 --> 01:30:34,270
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1197
01:30:34,437 --> 01:30:39,483
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1198
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:43,654
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1199
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:48,284
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1200
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:51,829
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1201
01:30:51,996 --> 01:30:54,123
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1202
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:55,333
You know where it is.

1203
01:30:55,499 --> 01:30:57,251
Like you on a rope!

1204
01:30:58,461 --> 01:31:01,214
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1205
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:04,926
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1206
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:08,888
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1207
01:31:09,055 --> 01:31:10,014
Nigger gal?

1208
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:13,184
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1209
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:15,937
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1210
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:20,274
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1211
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:24,612
[laughs] You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1212
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,157
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1213
01:31:28,324 --> 01:31:30,159
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1214
01:31:30,326 --> 01:31:31,744
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1215
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:33,579
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1216
01:31:33,746 --> 01:31:36,415
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1217
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:40,294
- What?
- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1218
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:43,076
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1219
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,883
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1220
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,510
She bein' punished.

1221
01:31:47,677 --> 01:31:50,012
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1222
01:31:50,179 --> 01:31:52,848
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1223
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:55,518
- Two.
- When did she go?

1224
01:31:55,685 --> 01:31:58,187
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1225
01:31:58,354 --> 01:32:01,023
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1226
01:32:01,941 --> 01:32:05,444
[Stephen] Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1227
01:32:05,611 --> 01:32:09,907
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1228
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:12,994
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1229
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,370
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1230
01:32:14,537 --> 01:32:16,205
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1231
01:32:16,372 --> 01:32:19,166
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1232
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:22,003
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1233
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:25,214
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1234
01:32:25,381 --> 01:32:29,302
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1235
01:32:29,468 --> 01:32:30,428
Hildi is my nigger.

1236
01:32:30,594 --> 01:32:33,764
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1237
01:32:33,931 --> 01:32:37,143
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1238
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:39,729
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1239
01:32:39,895 --> 01:32:42,356
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1240
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:46,694
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1241
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:48,029
Yessir.

1242
01:32:49,322 --> 01:32:51,907
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1243
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:55,453
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1244
01:32:55,619 --> 01:32:56,996
[Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.

1245
01:32:57,163 --> 01:33:02,043
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1246
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:05,087
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1247
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:09,759
[clucking]

1248
01:33:09,925 --> 01:33:12,678
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1249
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:15,389
Cora! Come here!

1250
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:18,601
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1251
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:21,145
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1252
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:23,773
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1253
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:27,318
- Yessir.
- [soft guitar music plays]

1254
01:34:08,192 --> 01:34:10,069
[Hildi screams]

1255
01:34:10,903 --> 01:34:13,614
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1256
01:34:14,824 --> 01:34:16,200
[Hildi yelling]

1257
01:34:16,367 --> 01:34:19,912
[gasping screaming]

1258
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:23,666
[sobbing]

1259
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:47,189
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1260
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,570
[slow-tempo song plays]

1261
01:34:56,115 --> 01:34:58,742
[woman sings in foreign language]

1262
01:36:14,443 --> 01:36:15,611
[exhales]

1263
01:36:22,368 --> 01:36:23,827
Hello, ladies.

1264
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:27,373
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1265
01:36:31,544 --> 01:36:34,004
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1266
01:36:35,464 --> 01:36:37,591
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1267
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:40,970
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1268
01:36:41,136 --> 01:36:43,931
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1269
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:46,016
- [chuckles]
- [forced chuckle]

1270
01:36:47,184 --> 01:36:49,186
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1271
01:36:49,353 --> 01:36:54,316
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1272
01:36:57,653 --> 01:36:59,989
The doctor here speaks German.

1273
01:37:01,991 --> 01:37:03,951
And I've been informed you do as well?

1274
01:37:05,494 --> 01:37:07,663
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1275
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:13,419
[Speaking German]

1276
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:15,838
Ha! [laughs]

1277
01:37:16,005 --> 01:37:18,007
Astonishing.

1278
01:37:18,173 --> 01:37:19,842
[Speaking German]

1279
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:27,182
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1280
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:37,818
<i>Ja.</i>

1281
01:37:58,464 --> 01:38:00,049
[speaks German]

1282
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:02,676
Don't be afraid.

1283
01:38:40,756 --> 01:38:43,258
Hm. Pardon.

1284
01:38:50,849 --> 01:38:52,142
<i>Danke.</i>

1285
01:39:35,978 --> 01:39:37,604
[chuckling]

1286
01:40:20,397 --> 01:40:22,441
[repeats German phrase]

1287
01:40:37,581 --> 01:40:39,166
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1288
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,335
[gasping]

1289
01:40:43,754 --> 01:40:44,922
[moaning]

1290
01:40:47,758 --> 01:40:51,053
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1291
01:40:52,638 --> 01:40:53,972
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1292
01:40:54,139 --> 01:40:55,500
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1293
01:40:55,557 --> 01:40:58,597
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1294
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:01,438
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1295
01:41:01,605 --> 01:41:03,816
[laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1296
01:41:03,982 --> 01:41:06,568
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1297
01:41:06,735 --> 01:41:12,533
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1298
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:17,079
But the best three by far were Samson...

1299
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:20,056
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1300
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:23,544
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1301
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,296
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1302
01:41:26,463 --> 01:41:29,550
[chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1303
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:32,302
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1304
01:41:32,469 --> 01:41:34,471
[all laugh]

1305
01:41:35,973 --> 01:41:41,311
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1306
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:45,190
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1307
01:41:45,357 --> 01:41:49,111
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1308
01:41:49,778 --> 01:41:51,864
Samson's the champion.

1309
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:53,824
Them other two pretty good.

1310
01:41:55,117 --> 01:41:56,718
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1311
01:41:56,785 --> 01:41:57,911
It's all right.

1312
01:41:58,078 --> 01:42:00,163
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1313
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:03,709
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1314
01:42:03,876 --> 01:42:08,171
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1315
01:42:08,338 --> 01:42:09,423
Is that right?

1316
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:13,677
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1317
01:42:13,844 --> 01:42:14,803
Hm.

1318
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:17,431
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1319
01:42:19,182 --> 01:42:21,393
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1320
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,646
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1321
01:42:24,813 --> 01:42:27,566
- A sense of Showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1322
01:42:27,733 --> 01:42:30,944
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1323
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:32,738
[all chuckling]

1324
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:34,385
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1325
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:35,449
More like Nigger-les.

1326
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:37,743
[laughing]

1327
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:43,290
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1328
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:46,585
'the right nigger."'

1329
01:42:46,752 --> 01:42:51,048
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1330
01:42:51,214 --> 01:42:53,926
But is he right as rain?

1331
01:42:55,177 --> 01:42:56,595
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1332
01:42:56,762 --> 01:43:00,557
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1333
01:43:00,724 --> 01:43:02,643
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1334
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,561
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1335
01:43:04,728 --> 01:43:05,729
Nobody.

1336
01:43:05,896 --> 01:43:07,776
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1337
01:43:07,898 --> 01:43:09,298
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1338
01:43:09,441 --> 01:43:11,443
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1339
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:12,819
Hm-mm.

1340
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:17,199
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1341
01:43:17,366 --> 01:43:19,446
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1342
01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:23,538
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1343
01:43:23,705 --> 01:43:26,249
In other words, first thing is first.

1344
01:43:26,416 --> 01:43:27,876
First thing's first.

1345
01:43:32,714 --> 01:43:34,341
[whispers in German]

1346
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:38,929
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1347
01:43:39,096 --> 01:43:40,973
Famously.

1348
01:43:41,723 --> 01:43:44,393
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1349
01:43:44,559 --> 01:43:47,896
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1350
01:43:48,063 --> 01:43:49,943
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1351
01:43:50,065 --> 01:43:52,150
[laughing]

1352
01:43:52,317 --> 01:43:54,361
Two weeks in Boston!

1353
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:57,322
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [coughing]

1354
01:43:57,489 --> 01:43:59,199
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1355
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:04,579
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1356
01:44:04,746 --> 01:44:08,834
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1357
01:44:09,001 --> 01:44:10,877
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:12,379
You might-a caught yourself

1359
01:44:12,546 --> 01:44:13,797
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1360
01:44:13,964 --> 01:44:16,049
[Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1361
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:18,218
- [Stephen] Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1362
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:20,012
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1363
01:44:20,178 --> 01:44:23,140
Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]

1364
01:44:23,306 --> 01:44:24,850
[Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.

1365
01:44:25,017 --> 01:44:27,269
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1366
01:44:27,436 --> 01:44:31,940
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1367
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:34,192
[Lara Lee giggles]

1368
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:36,820
Well, naturally.

1369
01:44:36,987 --> 01:44:40,615
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1370
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:43,577
- not the plucked chicken.
- [all chuckle]

1371
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:46,246
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1372
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:48,331
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1373
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:49,541
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes,

1374
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,869
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1375
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:54,087
You know that nigger, don't you?

1376
01:44:55,005 --> 01:44:56,298
- Who?
- "Who?"

1377
01:44:56,465 --> 01:44:59,551
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1378
01:45:01,303 --> 01:45:03,305
At the table?

1379
01:45:03,472 --> 01:45:04,723
I don't know him.

1380
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:07,934
- You don't know him.
- No.

1381
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:10,937
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1382
01:45:13,023 --> 01:45:14,107
[chuckles]

1383
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:18,028
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1384
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,450
OK.

1385
01:45:24,701 --> 01:45:27,829
Yeah. If you say so.

1386
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:37,714
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1387
01:45:39,091 --> 01:45:44,262
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1388
01:45:44,429 --> 01:45:46,765
What would your price be?

1389
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:48,892
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1390
01:45:49,059 --> 01:45:52,521
and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1391
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,733
9,000. Maybe.

1392
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:03,782
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1393
01:46:03,949 --> 01:46:06,118
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1394
01:46:06,284 --> 01:46:07,244
Sure wasn't.

1395
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:09,121
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1396
01:46:09,287 --> 01:46:11,456
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1397
01:46:11,623 --> 01:46:14,042
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1398
01:46:14,209 --> 01:46:15,929
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1399
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:18,964
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1400
01:46:19,131 --> 01:46:23,385
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1401
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:28,014
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1402
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:31,017
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1403
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:39,025
[deep inhale]

1404
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:43,280
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1405
01:46:43,446 --> 01:46:44,739
[chuckles]

1406
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,619
[slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1407
01:46:49,786 --> 01:46:53,123
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.

1408
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,417
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1409
01:46:55,584 --> 01:46:59,129
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1410
01:46:59,296 --> 01:47:02,465
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1411
01:47:02,632 --> 01:47:04,426
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1412
01:47:04,593 --> 01:47:07,679
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1413
01:47:07,846 --> 01:47:10,891
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1414
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:12,058
Hm-mm.

1415
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:13,894
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1416
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:16,688
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1417
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:21,568
So, say I return in about...

1418
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:26,031
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1419
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:27,449
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1420
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,659
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1421
01:47:29,826 --> 01:47:32,787
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1422
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:36,666
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1423
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:38,585
Gentlemen...

1424
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:41,588
may I propose a toast.

1425
01:47:43,965 --> 01:47:48,845
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1426
01:47:49,012 --> 01:47:51,681
- [all chuckling]
- To The Black Hercules.

1427
01:47:51,848 --> 01:47:53,225
[Stephen] The Black Hercules.

1428
01:47:53,391 --> 01:47:54,809
[speaks low]
To The Black Hercules.

1429
01:47:54,976 --> 01:47:58,813
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]

1430
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,398
Hm.

1431
01:48:00,565 --> 01:48:03,818
Hildi, top my drink off.

1432
01:48:06,905 --> 01:48:11,952
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1433
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:15,330
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1434
01:48:15,497 --> 01:48:18,250
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1435
01:48:18,416 --> 01:48:21,169
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1436
01:48:21,336 --> 01:48:22,671
through a bramble bush.

1437
01:48:22,837 --> 01:48:25,958
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1438
01:48:26,091 --> 01:48:27,676
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1439
01:48:27,842 --> 01:48:29,010
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1440
01:48:29,177 --> 01:48:30,637
[Hildi] No, sir.

1441
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:32,138
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1442
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:35,976
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1443
01:48:36,142 --> 01:48:39,396
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1444
01:48:39,562 --> 01:48:41,690
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1445
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:44,901
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1446
01:48:45,068 --> 01:48:46,820
No, we just talked and...

1447
01:48:46,987 --> 01:48:49,364
[Calvin] Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1448
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:51,324
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1449
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:53,535
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1450
01:48:53,702 --> 01:48:56,788
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1451
01:48:56,955 --> 01:48:58,915
- Go on.
- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.

1452
01:48:59,082 --> 01:49:01,459
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1453
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:04,546
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1454
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:07,716
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1455
01:49:07,882 --> 01:49:10,468
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1456
01:49:10,635 --> 01:49:14,222
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1457
01:49:14,389 --> 01:49:16,558
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1458
01:49:16,725 --> 01:49:18,725
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1459
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:19,936
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1460
01:49:20,103 --> 01:49:22,355
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1461
01:49:23,148 --> 01:49:26,192
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1462
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:30,280
- [exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1463
01:49:30,447 --> 01:49:33,116
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1464
01:49:34,326 --> 01:49:36,119
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1465
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,044
[Lara Lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1466
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,879
[approaching footsteps]

1467
01:49:47,505 --> 01:49:50,717
- [Lara Lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!

1468
01:49:50,884 --> 01:49:53,345
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1469
01:49:53,511 --> 01:49:54,846
Come on in here.

1470
01:50:01,353 --> 01:50:05,148
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1471
01:50:05,315 --> 01:50:07,275
You say you ain't know him.

1472
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:09,486
Huh?

1473
01:50:09,652 --> 01:50:15,241
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1474
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:19,788
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1475
01:50:21,956 --> 01:50:23,583
Mr. Stephen...

1476
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:25,585
I don't.

1477
01:50:25,752 --> 01:50:28,254
Why is you lying to me?

1478
01:50:30,632 --> 01:50:31,966
I ain't.

1479
01:50:32,133 --> 01:50:34,636
Then why is you crying?

1480
01:50:34,803 --> 01:50:36,971
You scarin' me.

1481
01:50:37,138 --> 01:50:41,059
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1482
01:50:42,727 --> 01:50:45,814
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1483
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:49,109
was positively soul-enriching.

1484
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:52,153
[Calvin] Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1485
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,156
You stay right here.

1486
01:51:00,495 --> 01:51:04,999
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1487
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:08,002
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1488
01:51:10,004 --> 01:51:15,969
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1489
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:17,512
I'm all ears.

1490
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:19,389
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1491
01:51:20,014 --> 01:51:21,599
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1492
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:25,103
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1493
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:28,356
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1494
01:51:28,523 --> 01:51:31,234
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1495
01:51:31,401 --> 01:51:32,527
Excuse him.

1496
01:51:32,694 --> 01:51:36,448
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1497
01:51:36,614 --> 01:51:38,533
You mean get up out of my chair?

1498
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:42,036
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1499
01:51:42,203 --> 01:51:46,040
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1500
01:51:46,207 --> 01:51:48,835
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1501
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:50,879
We're having white cake!

1502
01:51:51,045 --> 01:51:53,381
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1503
01:51:53,548 --> 01:51:57,886
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1504
01:51:58,052 --> 01:51:59,846
[whispers] Meet me in the library.

1505
01:52:00,013 --> 01:52:03,099
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1506
01:52:03,266 --> 01:52:05,143
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1507
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:10,315
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1508
01:52:10,482 --> 01:52:11,649
Yessir.

1509
01:52:12,567 --> 01:52:16,237
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1510
01:52:16,404 --> 01:52:18,245
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1511
01:52:18,323 --> 01:52:21,951
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1512
01:52:22,118 --> 01:52:23,411
[all chuckle]

1513
01:52:24,954 --> 01:52:26,748
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1514
01:52:32,921 --> 01:52:34,714
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1515
01:52:36,174 --> 01:52:39,552
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1516
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:45,141
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1517
01:52:45,308 --> 01:52:47,977
[chuckles] The circus?

1518
01:52:48,144 --> 01:52:49,646
[fire crackling]

1519
01:52:54,442 --> 01:52:56,236
What is the matter?

1520
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:06,579
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1521
01:53:06,746 --> 01:53:10,291
- They wants that girl.
- [chuckling]

1522
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:13,211
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1523
01:53:13,378 --> 01:53:16,548
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1524
01:53:16,714 --> 01:53:20,385
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1525
01:53:20,552 --> 01:53:22,720
They here for that girl.

1526
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:25,515
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1527
01:53:25,682 --> 01:53:29,310
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1528
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,605
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1529
01:53:32,772 --> 01:53:35,149
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1530
01:53:35,316 --> 01:53:37,777
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1531
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:40,196
But he's just about to buy

1532
01:53:40,363 --> 01:53:43,575
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1533
01:53:43,741 --> 01:53:46,744
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1534
01:53:52,166 --> 01:53:54,168
Where you gettin' all this?

1535
01:53:55,295 --> 01:53:57,088
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1536
01:53:57,255 --> 01:53:59,757
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1537
01:53:59,924 --> 01:54:04,220
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1538
01:54:04,387 --> 01:54:06,222
She probably his wife.

1539
01:54:06,389 --> 01:54:09,183
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1540
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:12,437
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1541
01:54:15,023 --> 01:54:16,983
If she's who they want...

1542
01:54:17,567 --> 01:54:21,863
why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1543
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:25,533
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1544
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:31,164
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1545
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:35,543
Yes, it did.

1546
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,506
His wife, huh?

1547
01:54:44,385 --> 01:54:48,097
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1548
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:49,682
[chuckles]

1549
01:54:51,392 --> 01:54:53,394
Those lying...

1550
01:54:54,228 --> 01:55:00,234
goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1551
01:55:02,445 --> 01:55:03,613
Sons of bitches!

1552
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:09,035
Out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1553
01:55:10,286 --> 01:55:11,746
Oh, there you are.

1554
01:55:11,913 --> 01:55:14,707
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1555
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:16,334
[all chuckling]

1556
01:55:16,501 --> 01:55:18,670
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1557
01:55:18,836 --> 01:55:21,923
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1558
01:55:22,090 --> 01:55:25,134
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1559
01:55:25,301 --> 01:55:26,386
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1560
01:55:26,552 --> 01:55:30,431
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1561
01:55:30,598 --> 01:55:32,850
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1562
01:55:46,114 --> 01:55:49,826
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1563
01:55:51,869 --> 01:55:54,789
Apropos, before your exit,

1564
01:55:54,956 --> 01:55:58,960
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1565
01:55:59,127 --> 01:56:02,046
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1566
01:56:02,213 --> 01:56:04,340
And we will again. In a moment.

1567
01:56:20,815 --> 01:56:22,859
Who's your little friend?

1568
01:56:25,236 --> 01:56:26,279
[clearing throat]

1569
01:56:27,822 --> 01:56:29,323
This is Ben.

1570
01:56:30,658 --> 01:56:35,663
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1571
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:38,249
And I do mean a long damn time.

1572
01:56:39,333 --> 01:56:43,087
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1573
01:56:43,963 --> 01:56:46,007
and my daddy's daddy.

1574
01:56:46,174 --> 01:56:48,760
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1575
01:56:51,596 --> 01:56:53,264
Old Ben took care of me.

1576
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:59,645
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1577
01:56:59,812 --> 01:57:05,693
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1578
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:12,617
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1579
01:57:13,868 --> 01:57:17,663
surrounded by black faces.

1580
01:57:19,707 --> 01:57:22,043
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1581
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:25,379
I only had one question:

1582
01:57:29,091 --> 01:57:31,552
- Why don't they kill us?
- [laughs]

1583
01:57:34,555 --> 01:57:39,727
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1584
01:57:39,894 --> 01:57:44,816
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1585
01:57:44,982 --> 01:57:50,112
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1586
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:53,699
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1587
01:57:56,244 --> 01:57:57,745
But he never did.

1588
01:57:59,622 --> 01:58:00,915
Why not?

1589
01:58:02,291 --> 01:58:07,088
You see, the science of phrenology

1590
01:58:07,255 --> 01:58:12,343
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1591
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:17,890
In the skull of the African here,

1592
01:58:18,057 --> 01:58:20,184
the area associated
with submissiveness

1593
01:58:20,351 --> 01:58:25,857
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1594
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:28,609
[sawing]

1595
01:58:41,372 --> 01:58:43,332
If you examine...

1596
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:46,878
this piece of skull here...

1597
01:58:53,175 --> 01:58:56,762
you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1598
01:59:00,349 --> 01:59:04,061
Here, here and here.

1599
01:59:04,228 --> 01:59:05,479
Now...

1600
01:59:05,646 --> 01:59:10,651
if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1601
01:59:10,818 --> 01:59:13,321
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1602
01:59:13,487 --> 01:59:16,824
most associated with... creativity.

1603
01:59:17,491 --> 01:59:19,327
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1604
01:59:19,952 --> 01:59:22,079
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1605
01:59:22,246 --> 01:59:24,540
unburdened by genius,

1606
01:59:24,707 --> 01:59:28,878
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1607
01:59:30,004 --> 01:59:31,339
servility.

1608
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:34,091
Now, Bright Boy...

1609
01:59:35,009 --> 01:59:37,178
I will admit you are pretty clever.

1610
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:41,724
But if I took this hammer here...

1611
01:59:43,851 --> 01:59:46,187
and I bashed in your skull with it...

1612
01:59:47,188 --> 01:59:52,526
you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1613
01:59:53,778 --> 01:59:55,237
as Old Ben.

1614
01:59:56,364 --> 01:59:59,951
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1615
02:00:00,117 --> 02:00:03,079
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1616
02:00:03,245 --> 02:00:06,499
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1617
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:10,711
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1618
02:00:10,878 --> 02:00:13,214
but that you can believe!

1619
02:00:13,381 --> 02:00:16,175
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1620
02:00:16,342 --> 02:00:18,719
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1621
02:00:23,432 --> 02:00:25,851
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1622
02:00:30,398 --> 02:00:31,774
Where were we?

1623
02:00:36,237 --> 02:00:37,655
Jackass.

1624
02:00:41,659 --> 02:00:43,160
Ah, yes.

1625
02:00:43,327 --> 02:00:46,080
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1626
02:00:46,247 --> 02:00:48,708
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1627
02:00:48,874 --> 02:00:50,251
Am I right?

1628
02:00:54,255 --> 02:00:55,589
Right.

1629
02:00:58,009 --> 02:00:59,510
Bring out Hildi!

1630
02:01:02,263 --> 02:01:03,806
Get over there yonder.

1631
02:01:05,266 --> 02:01:07,518
- [screams]
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1632
02:01:07,685 --> 02:01:08,936
[Stephen] Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1633
02:01:09,103 --> 02:01:10,646
[Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1634
02:01:14,942 --> 02:01:17,528
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1635
02:01:17,695 --> 02:01:20,448
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1636
02:01:20,614 --> 02:01:24,952
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1637
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:28,164
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1638
02:01:28,330 --> 02:01:32,293
To which you said, "$12,000."

1639
02:01:33,085 --> 02:01:34,837
- [yells]
- Now, considering y'all

1640
02:01:35,004 --> 02:01:36,964
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1641
02:01:37,131 --> 02:01:41,093
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1642
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,679
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1643
02:01:43,846 --> 02:01:49,810
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1644
02:01:49,977 --> 02:01:53,731
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1645
02:01:53,898 --> 02:01:59,528
the price is $12,000.

1646
02:01:59,695 --> 02:02:03,491
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1647
02:02:05,743 --> 02:02:07,286
Yes, I do, doctor.

1648
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,123
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1649
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:14,835
Broomhilda here is my property.

1650
02:02:15,002 --> 02:02:20,132
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1651
02:02:21,217 --> 02:02:23,511
And if y'all think my price...

1652
02:02:24,178 --> 02:02:26,889
for this nigger here
is too steep...

1653
02:02:27,056 --> 02:02:30,518
- [grunts]
- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1654
02:02:34,438 --> 02:02:37,566
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1655
02:02:37,733 --> 02:02:39,860
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1656
02:02:40,027 --> 02:02:44,532
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1657
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:48,869
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1658
02:02:49,036 --> 02:02:50,371
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1659
02:02:50,538 --> 02:02:54,416
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1660
02:02:55,626 --> 02:02:56,961
Yes, you may.

1661
02:03:10,724 --> 02:03:11,934
That 12.

1662
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,857
- Sold!
- [screaming]

1663
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:20,568
To the man with the exceptional beard

1664
02:03:20,734 --> 02:03:24,071
and his unexceptional nigger.

1665
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:32,204
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1666
02:03:32,371 --> 02:03:36,041
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1667
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:37,960
$12,000.

1668
02:03:41,088 --> 02:03:43,257
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1669
02:03:44,133 --> 02:03:45,885
Now, gentlemen...

1670
02:03:47,094 --> 02:03:48,971
if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1671
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:52,391
we will be serving white cake.

1672
02:03:53,267 --> 02:03:54,894
[Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp]

1673
02:04:52,201 --> 02:04:53,401
- [screaming]
- [dogs snarling]

1674
02:05:08,259 --> 02:05:09,718
[screaming]

1675
02:05:20,729 --> 02:05:22,064
Well done, Calvin.

1676
02:05:24,566 --> 02:05:27,444
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1677
02:05:28,904 --> 02:05:32,574
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1678
02:05:36,829 --> 02:05:37,913
[Stephen] Doctor!

1679
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:40,708
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1680
02:05:40,874 --> 02:05:42,042
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1681
02:05:42,209 --> 02:05:43,544
Let it be.

1682
02:05:43,711 --> 02:05:45,629
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1683
02:05:45,796 --> 02:05:47,214
I'll handle this.

1684
02:06:13,073 --> 02:06:14,366
White cake?

1685
02:06:15,367 --> 02:06:17,619
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1686
02:06:18,662 --> 02:06:19,872
Hm.

1687
02:06:24,626 --> 02:06:25,627
[Calvin chuckles softly]

1688
02:06:27,588 --> 02:06:30,299
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1689
02:06:31,008 --> 02:06:35,763
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1690
02:06:35,929 --> 02:06:37,765
D'Artagnan.

1691
02:06:38,557 --> 02:06:42,353
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1692
02:06:42,519 --> 02:06:43,979
Come again?

1693
02:06:47,066 --> 02:06:51,111
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers.

1694
02:06:51,278 --> 02:06:52,946
Yes, of course, doctor.

1695
02:06:53,113 --> 02:06:54,656
I figured you must be an admirer.

1696
02:06:54,823 --> 02:06:59,244
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1697
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:03,123
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1698
02:07:03,290 --> 02:07:05,250
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1699
02:07:07,294 --> 02:07:09,129
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1700
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:16,512
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1701
02:07:18,806 --> 02:07:20,599
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1702
02:07:22,476 --> 02:07:24,686
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1703
02:07:28,524 --> 02:07:31,318
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1704
02:07:31,485 --> 02:07:33,153
- May I?
- Of course.

1705
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:34,696
Thank you.

1706
02:07:36,824 --> 02:07:39,785
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1707
02:07:39,952 --> 02:07:42,121
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1708
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:44,498
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1709
02:07:45,749 --> 02:07:48,669
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1710
02:08:09,982 --> 02:08:11,191
Thank you.

1711
02:08:14,778 --> 02:08:17,072
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1712
02:08:19,324 --> 02:08:21,702
consider yourself a free woman.

1713
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:35,591
Mr. Candie...

1714
02:08:37,551 --> 02:08:41,346
normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1715
02:08:41,513 --> 02:08:45,976
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1716
02:08:46,143 --> 02:08:48,479
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1717
02:08:48,645 --> 02:08:53,317
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1718
02:08:57,196 --> 02:08:58,489
Let's go.

1719
02:08:59,448 --> 02:09:00,991
Come on.

1720
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:04,786
One more moment, doctor!

1721
02:09:06,663 --> 02:09:07,706
What?

1722
02:09:12,419 --> 02:09:14,546
It's a custom here in the South...

1723
02:09:15,047 --> 02:09:20,427
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1724
02:09:21,261 --> 02:09:23,305
It implies good faith.

1725
02:09:23,472 --> 02:09:26,517
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1726
02:09:26,683 --> 02:09:28,977
in my house, doctor.

1727
02:09:29,853 --> 02:09:32,773
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1728
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:34,942
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1729
02:09:35,108 --> 02:09:38,403
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1730
02:09:39,029 --> 02:09:42,032
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1731
02:09:42,199 --> 02:09:43,992
No, I don't.

1732
02:09:45,661 --> 02:09:50,874
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1733
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:56,004
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1734
02:09:56,171 --> 02:09:58,799
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1735
02:09:59,675 --> 02:10:02,511
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1736
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:06,974
you don't shake my hand.

1737
02:10:07,933 --> 02:10:13,605
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1738
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:15,524
I don't think so.

1739
02:10:16,525 --> 02:10:17,693
Mr. Pooch?

1740
02:10:19,528 --> 02:10:24,241
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1741
02:10:24,408 --> 02:10:26,159
you cut her ass down.

1742
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:30,414
[cocking shotgun]

1743
02:10:48,181 --> 02:10:51,518
You really want me to shake your hand?

1744
02:10:53,186 --> 02:10:54,771
I insist.

1745
02:10:55,856 --> 02:10:58,525
If you insist.

1746
02:11:00,861 --> 02:11:02,070
[metal springing noise]

1747
02:11:15,125 --> 02:11:18,128
No! Calvin!

1748
02:11:19,212 --> 02:11:20,797
Calvin!

1749
02:11:20,964 --> 02:11:23,300
[slow heartbeat rhythm]

1750
02:11:27,137 --> 02:11:29,640
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1751
02:11:32,476 --> 02:11:34,227
[sobbing]

1752
02:11:41,902 --> 02:11:44,071
Ni99er's gone crazy! Help!

1753
02:11:44,237 --> 02:11:46,031
- [screaming]
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1754
02:11:46,198 --> 02:11:47,908
- [gunshot]
- [Screaming]

1755
02:11:51,995 --> 02:11:53,038
Ah! [screams]

1756
02:11:53,205 --> 02:11:54,373
[grunting]

1757
02:11:57,918 --> 02:11:59,336
[screaming]

1758
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:04,216
Holy...!

1759
02:12:04,383 --> 02:12:06,593
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1760
02:12:07,344 --> 02:12:09,346
[overlapping gunfire]

1761
02:12:10,764 --> 02:12:11,973
[man] Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1762
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:14,476
- Get the...!
- [screaming continues]

1763
02:12:16,478 --> 02:12:17,938
[man] Damn it, son of a bitch!

1764
02:12:18,105 --> 02:12:19,648
What...? Fucking...

1765
02:12:19,815 --> 02:12:21,441
Goddamn it!

1766
02:12:22,776 --> 02:12:25,070
- What the fuck is going on?
- [screams]

1767
02:12:25,237 --> 02:12:27,197
You shot me!

1768
02:12:27,364 --> 02:12:30,450
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- [man] Sorry, Jessie!

1769
02:12:30,617 --> 02:12:34,746
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1770
02:12:46,675 --> 02:12:48,176
[whimpering]

1771
02:12:51,513 --> 02:12:53,014

[yelling]

1773
02:13:04,776 --> 02:13:05,902
[man] Aim low!

1774
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:10,073
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1775
02:13:11,032 --> 02:13:13,201
[screams] God! Oh, my God!

1776
02:13:13,368 --> 02:13:15,328
[man continues screaming]
Motherfucker!

1777
02:13:15,495 --> 02:13:17,330
[slow-motion gunshot]

1778
02:13:21,752 --> 02:13:23,754
[rap song playing]

1779
02:13:24,171 --> 02:13:25,338
Shit!

1780
02:13:26,548 --> 02:13:27,424
[screaming]

1781
02:14:22,312 --> 02:14:23,396
Shit.

1782
02:14:23,563 --> 02:14:24,606
[door squeaks open]

1783
02:14:33,323 --> 02:14:35,408
[overlapping gunshots]

1784
02:14:35,575 --> 02:14:36,993
[Stephen] Hold your fire!

1785
02:14:40,413 --> 02:14:41,915
Hold your fire!

1786
02:14:43,834 --> 02:14:45,710
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1787
02:14:46,711 --> 02:14:48,046
[gunfire stops]

1788
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:55,846
Django!

1789
02:14:56,012 --> 02:14:57,264
What?

1790
02:15:00,475 --> 02:15:02,102
We got your woman!

1791
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:06,022
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1792
02:15:06,189 --> 02:15:08,775
- [gasping]
- You don't stop all that carrying on,

1793
02:15:08,942 --> 02:15:11,987
- he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
- [gasping]

1794
02:15:12,153 --> 02:15:16,116
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1795
02:15:17,742 --> 02:15:18,952
Or...

1796
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:22,122
you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1797
02:15:23,248 --> 02:15:25,417
- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1798
02:15:25,584 --> 02:15:29,296
Honest lnjun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1799
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:35,010
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1800
02:15:36,469 --> 02:15:38,889
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1801
02:15:39,055 --> 02:15:41,766
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1802
02:15:41,933 --> 02:15:44,978
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1803
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:49,024
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1804
02:15:51,276 --> 02:15:55,030
Don't do it. [sniffling]
You give me up.

1805
02:15:55,196 --> 02:15:57,032
- [Stephen] Six!
- Just let me go.

1806
02:15:57,198 --> 02:15:58,742
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1807
02:15:58,909 --> 02:16:00,493
- [Hildi] Django.
- [Stephen] Eight!

1808
02:16:00,660 --> 02:16:03,163
- I love you.
- Nine!

1809
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:05,415
- [Django] Hold it!
- No.

1810
02:16:07,417 --> 02:16:08,501
<i>L</i> give UP-

1811
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:12,464
I can't hear you, nigger.

1812
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:15,133
I said I give up!

1813
02:16:25,435 --> 02:16:28,980
[up-tempo song plays]

1814
02:16:38,239 --> 02:16:40,784
No! [sobbing]

1815
02:16:41,952 --> 02:16:43,411
No!

1816
02:17:50,603 --> 02:17:53,606
[door opening]

[spurs clinking]

1818
02:18:14,669 --> 02:18:17,255
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1819
02:18:22,552 --> 02:18:24,679
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1820
02:18:25,638 --> 02:18:28,391
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1821
02:18:29,392 --> 02:18:31,603
We found your wanted posters...

1822
02:18:32,187 --> 02:18:34,397
and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1823
02:18:35,815 --> 02:18:37,442
I got to say...

1824
02:18:38,151 --> 02:18:41,446
I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1825
02:18:41,613 --> 02:18:44,657
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1826
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:48,328
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1827
02:18:50,371 --> 02:18:51,831
[sizzling]

1828
02:18:54,501 --> 02:18:56,419
[Django yells, muffled]

1829
02:18:56,586 --> 02:18:57,629
[grunting]

1830
02:18:57,796 --> 02:18:59,631
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

1831
02:18:59,798 --> 02:19:02,467
- [yelling]
- On three. One...

1832
02:19:02,634 --> 02:19:05,512
- [screaming]
- I got you. Two...

1833
02:19:05,678 --> 02:19:08,890
- [screaming]
- Calm down, now, here it comes.

1834
02:19:09,057 --> 02:19:11,643
- [screaming]
" [Stephen] Captain?

1835
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:13,561
Miss Lara want to see you.

1836
02:19:14,395 --> 02:19:18,316
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1837
02:19:18,483 --> 02:19:22,278
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1838
02:19:23,071 --> 02:19:25,907
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1839
02:19:26,074 --> 02:19:27,575
[Django moaning]

1840
02:19:27,742 --> 02:19:29,869
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1841
02:19:37,127 --> 02:19:38,920
How disappointing.

1842
02:19:45,426 --> 02:19:47,220
[hissing]

1843
02:19:47,387 --> 02:19:48,721
[chuckles]

1844
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:03,194
[Stephen] You leavin'.

1845
02:20:04,863 --> 02:20:07,907
This here what you take with you.

1846
02:20:11,286 --> 02:20:14,747
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

1847
02:20:14,914 --> 02:20:18,334
could talk about
for the last few hours.

1848
02:20:18,501 --> 02:20:22,213
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1849
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:25,091
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1850
02:20:25,258 --> 02:20:30,555
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1851
02:20:30,722 --> 02:20:36,269
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1852
02:20:37,854 --> 02:20:40,106
when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1853
02:20:40,273 --> 02:20:44,485
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1854
02:20:44,652 --> 02:20:46,237
Most of 'em.

1855
02:20:46,446 --> 02:20:49,616
[chuckles]
Well, more than most.

1856
02:20:50,366 --> 02:20:56,206
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1857
02:20:56,372 --> 02:21:00,376
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1858
02:21:01,419 --> 02:21:04,130
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1859
02:21:04,297 --> 02:21:07,592
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1860
02:21:07,759 --> 02:21:10,970
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1861
02:21:11,137 --> 02:21:13,264
We do that shit all the time.

1862
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:19,312
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1863
02:21:20,438 --> 02:21:23,149
Lo and behold,

1864
02:21:23,316 --> 02:21:28,154
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1865
02:21:28,321 --> 02:21:31,783
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1866
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:39,290
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1867
02:21:39,457 --> 02:21:43,002
henceforth, till the day you die,

1868
02:21:43,169 --> 02:21:46,297
all day, every day,

1869
02:21:46,464 --> 02:21:49,300
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1870
02:21:49,467 --> 02:21:54,097
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1871
02:21:54,264 --> 02:21:58,851
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1872
02:21:59,018 --> 02:22:01,938
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1873
02:22:02,105 --> 02:22:04,524
and say, "Get to work!"

1874
02:22:04,691 --> 02:22:07,110
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1875
02:22:07,277 --> 02:22:09,612
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1876
02:22:09,779 --> 02:22:13,449
Oh, they does that real good.

1877
02:22:13,616 --> 02:22:15,201
They gonna work ya.

1878
02:22:15,368 --> 02:22:20,373
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1879
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:23,126
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1880
02:22:23,293 --> 02:22:25,712

1881
02:22:25,878 --> 02:22:31,259
And that will be the story of you,

02:23:19,807 --> 02:23:21,267
Hey, white boy.

1886
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:24,979
I said, hey, white boy.

1887
02:23:25,146 --> 02:23:28,232
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1888
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:30,693
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1889
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:32,028
Do what, now?

1890
02:23:32,195 --> 02:23:37,992
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1891
02:23:38,159 --> 02:23:40,119
What the fuck are you talking about?

1892
02:23:40,286 --> 02:23:44,957
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1893
02:23:45,124 --> 02:23:47,960
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1894
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:50,630
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1895
02:23:50,797 --> 02:23:55,009
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1896
02:23:55,176 --> 02:23:56,594
You can't steal it.

1897
02:23:56,761 --> 02:23:58,429
You got to earn it, white boy.

1898
02:23:59,389 --> 02:24:01,391
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1899
02:24:01,557 --> 02:24:04,769
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1900
02:24:04,936 --> 02:24:07,063
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1901
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:09,565
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1902
02:24:09,732 --> 02:24:11,192
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1903
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:14,654
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1904
02:24:14,821 --> 02:24:16,406
the Bacall Gang.

1905
02:24:16,572 --> 02:24:19,826
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1906
02:24:19,992 --> 02:24:23,329
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1907
02:24:23,496 --> 02:24:26,749
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1908
02:24:26,916 --> 02:24:29,627
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1909
02:24:29,794 --> 02:24:31,212
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1911
02:24:33,673 --> 02:24:37,343
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1912
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:39,053
But it ain't got to be that way.

1913
02:24:39,220 --> 02:24:42,515
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1914
02:24:42,682 --> 02:24:43,842
What'd these jokers do again?

1915
02:24:43,933 --> 02:24:47,437
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1916

Innocent white people.

1917
02:24:51,941 --> 02:24:54,944
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1918
02:24:55,111 --> 02:24:56,279
Get it out.

- [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.
- [man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery."

Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

- [man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1924
02:25:10,835 --> 02:25:13,629
- [man 2] That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1925
02:25:15,047 --> 02:25:17,633
Yesterday, as a free man,

1926
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:22,346
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1927
02:25:22,513 --> 02:25:24,056
Dr. King Schultz.

1928
02:25:24,223 --> 02:25:28,978
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1929
02:25:29,145 --> 02:25:32,064
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1930
02:25:32,231 --> 02:25:35,735
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1931
02:25:35,902 --> 02:25:39,238
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1932
02:25:39,405 --> 02:25:43,576
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1933
02:25:45,578 --> 02:25:47,497
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1934
02:25:47,663 --> 02:25:50,458
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1935
02:25:50,625 --> 02:25:53,961
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1936
02:25:54,128 --> 02:25:57,423
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1937
02:25:57,590 --> 02:25:59,842
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1938
02:26:00,009 --> 02:26:01,761
[man 1] What's the deal?

1939
02:26:01,928 --> 02:26:05,389
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1940
02:26:05,556 --> 02:26:08,434
No, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1941
02:26:08,601 --> 02:26:12,104
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1942
02:26:12,271 --> 02:26:16,776
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1943
02:26:16,943 --> 02:26:18,819
This is a real handbill.

1944
02:26:18,986 --> 02:26:20,029
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1945
02:26:20,196 --> 02:26:22,281
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1946
02:26:22,448 --> 02:26:28,371
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1947
02:26:33,042 --> 02:26:35,836
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1948
02:26:42,176 --> 02:26:46,138
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1949
02:26:47,348 --> 02:26:49,976
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1950
02:26:50,685 --> 02:26:52,520
Is he a Candyland slave,

1951
02:26:52,687 --> 02:26:56,482
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1952
02:26:56,649 --> 02:27:00,319
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1953
02:27:00,486 --> 02:27:03,030
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1954
02:27:03,698 --> 02:27:07,868
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1955
02:27:08,035 --> 02:27:09,537
He weren't no slave.

1956
02:27:09,704 --> 02:27:13,541

- Damn sure.

- Who shot him?
- The German.

1960

like they were slavers but they wasn't.

- Bounty hunters.
