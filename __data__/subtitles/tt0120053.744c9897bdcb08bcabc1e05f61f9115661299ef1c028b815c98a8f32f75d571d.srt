1
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,140
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer...

2
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,100
in... um...

3
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,020
In Sumeria.

4
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,140
What happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

5
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,140
Jesus' disciples
performed miracles.

6
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,080
When Simon Magus
saw the miracles...

7
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:07,980
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,860
How did Peter respond...

9
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,340
John Rossi?

10
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,820
Stand up!

11
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,260
Answer, John Rossi.

12
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,620
That's not my name.

13
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,140
You and all
the other bastards...

14
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,740
lucky enough to be here...

15
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,180
children of sin,
spawn of the damned...

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,780
are all named for saints...

17
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,180
saints who are disciplined,
saints who are chaste.

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,420
You are named
for John Baptist Rossi...

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,460
a Capuchin priest who
gave away all his possessions.

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,180
A man who had nothing,
like you.

21
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,700
Now what is your name...

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,860
you ungrateful cur?

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,780
Your name, boy!

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,500
Have you lost your tongue?

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,340
What is your name?

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,460
All the girls...

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,060
will remain locked
in their dormitory...

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,300
and no food
will be served to any boy...

29
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,860
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,060
Food! Food! Food!
Food! Food! Food! Food!

31
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,140
Yes. Yes.

32
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,580
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

33
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,985
No.

34
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,380
Simon... Templar.

35
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,540
Agnes!

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,620
Agnes!

37
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,980
Agnes!

38
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,980
Agnes!

39
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,860
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

40
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,180
Won't happen,
'cause we're leaving tonight...

41
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,780
this hearty brotherhood,
on a crusade.

42
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,100
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love...

43
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,780
to bid you farewell.

44
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,220
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss.

45
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,340
Hey, watch this.

46
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,020
We've lost some girls!

47
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,460
The girls are missing!

48
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
There are girls missing!

49
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,700
Come on, boys!

50
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,620
Wait, John Rossi.
My kiss.

51
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,420
There he is! Get him!

52
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,500
Aah!

53
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,380
October 3.

54
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,620
Entering foyer
of Tretiak industries.

55
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,100
Heavy security on elevators.
Guards in uniform.

56
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,540
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate passkey.

57
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Maybe use stairs.

58
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,020
No traffic there.

59
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,900
October 4.

60
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,425
Personal tidbits.

61
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,940
Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.

62
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,940
It left Tretiak as sole owner
of a gas and oil empire.

63
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,180
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

64
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,020
Who are you?

65
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,420
Vehicle was
driven by younger son Ilya...

66
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:37,660
now 27.

67
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,340
Wife now lives in Geneva...

68
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,180
following assassination
attempt in 1996.

69
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,240
I am... Ivanovanovitch.

70
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,260
October 5.

71
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,340
Ilya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado...

72
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,460
with bandito buddies.

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,540
Gangster rap, coffee,
flirting with teenage girls.

74
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,900
Small firearms in coats.
Machine pistols in cars.

75
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,580
There were
three great empires...

76
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,340
that dominated the world both
culturally and militarily...

77
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,660
Rome, Constantinople,
and Russia.

78
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,540
All three have fallen.

79
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,940
Only one can be restored...

80
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,780
and only one man
can restore it...

81
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,580
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

82
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,300
Friends...
countrymen...

83
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,060
Russians!

84
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,660
You people
here in this room...

85
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,860
are the cream of Russia...

86
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,260
and the whole nation
is listening with us.

87
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,700
But why do you all
listen to me rave?

88
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,700
Set aside my oil company...

89
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,300
forget about
my best-selling book...

90
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,780
and all I am is a lunatic...

91
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,460
haunted by the fantasy
of an empire...

92
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,700
that reclaims her former might,
her former size.

93
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,660
All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of a Russia...

94
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,540
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth.

95
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,420
Not ridiculed, but revered.

96
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,220
No! More than revered!

97
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,660
Feared!

98
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,100
But who am I
to dazzle you with this dream?

99
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,340
All I've done is...

100
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,260
How does it look
for the leader's son...

101
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,780
to walk out
when the leader speaks?

102
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,220
You'd prefer
the leader's son...

103
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,580
to piss his pants on live TV?
Hmm?

104
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,420
And still the people
freeze to death!

105
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,580
I love this country.

106
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,820
I don't speak Russian.

107
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,420
In that case, stand up...

108
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,300
put your hands
behind your head...

109
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,020
and turn around slowly.

110
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,820
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

111
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,500
Listen,
if I give this to you...

112
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,980
you'll give it to your daddy.

113
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,500
What's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

114
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,980
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me $1 million.

115
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,940
If we go in partners,
we'll split 50-50.

116
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,340
Half a million hard currency.

117
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,940
Think of the drugs you could buy
with that much cake.

118
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,260
You'll be discoing
for a decade in Moscow, mate.

119
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,500
I don't need your small change.

120
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,060
That's your first problem.

121
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,500
Here is your second.

122
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,740
Microchip... please.

123
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,220
Freeze!

124
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,300
Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

125
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,660
Suck me... sideways.

126
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,500
Aah! Uhh!

127
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,340
Uh! My eyes! Ohh!

128
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,460
Give it up!

129
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,540
You got no place to go!

130
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,700
A goddamn button!

131
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,740
Back of the building!
Come on!

132
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,220
Where's the body?

133
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,500
No body.
Just some guy in rags.

134
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,220
As the bitter chill of winter...

135
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,940
descends on Moscow...

136
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,260
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric...

137
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,740
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

138
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,300
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

139
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,260
and leader
of his own political party...

140
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,140
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

141
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,300
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

142
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,060
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

143
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:37,820
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

144
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,260
What beautiful work.

145
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,480
Ah. Cloisonne.

146
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:51,580
It is old.

147
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,700
Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

148
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,660
Please.

149
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,180
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

150
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,020
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

151
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,945
until things change.

152
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,660
You are married
not even a year...

153
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,020
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

154
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,265
I am sorry.

155
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,740
It's not my business.

156
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,380
How come you know
so much about me?

157
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,620
It is a gift.

158
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

159
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,420
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

160
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,460
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

161
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,020
by the laying of hands.

162
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,945
Hmm.
He's the same build...

163
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,300
as the description
the Russians gave us...

164
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,900
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

165
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,060
No.

166
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,260
Could be faking it.

167
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,700
X- rays are clear.

168
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,220
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

169
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,940
You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

170
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,340
On the airplane, I had chicken.

171
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,460
Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

172
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Last year. Same eyes.

173
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,220
Different chin.

174
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,500
Halcyon Hotel, guv.

175
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,745
Stand up!

176
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,940
What is your name?!

177
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,420
Answer the question!

178
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,900
What is your name?! Hey!

179
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,500
Lou, the microchip arrived.

180
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,660
I put the dough in your account.

181
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,900
Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

182
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,500
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

183
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

184
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,340
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

185
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,580
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

186
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,780
- I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
- I heard that before.

187
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,180
Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

188
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,620
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

189
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,020
- Fuck you, Lou.
- See yourself.

190
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,660
Can't seem to break 50.

191
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,900
"One million U.S. dollars...

192
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,420
"nonrefundable...

193
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,225
"reserves you a quiet table...

194
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,460
"at a romantic little spot
in Berlin called Templehopf...

195
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,340
"which has
a cozy transit lounge.

196
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,820
"To get inside, you walk
through the metal detectors...

197
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,100
"and I walk through
the metal detectors.

198
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,060
"Since you know I'm not armed,
and I know you're not armed...

199
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,900
"we can both fall in love,
and nobody gets hurt. "

200
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,340
I can't see him.

201
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,780
Then look for him.

202
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,820
You have
a long and beautiful cane...

203
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,060
along with your beautiful eyes.

204
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,100
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

205
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,545
Who are you?

206
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,260
My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

207
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,460
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

208
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,540
Had the wine, women, songs...

209
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,180
then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

210
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,140
went to live in the forest...
in the nude.

211
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,580
Please leave.

212
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,940
I represent
the professional you hired.

213
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm his business manager.

214
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,740
I speak for him.

215
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,820
We don't deal
with underlings.

216
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,580
Come on, Father. Let's go.

217
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,900
Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

218
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,380
Ah. Youth.

219
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,740
Who runs this thief?

220
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,780
CIA? Ml-6? Libya?

221
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,580
He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

222
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:33,900
He's an independent contractor.

223
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,540
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

224
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,260
Oh, yes.

225
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,780
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that...

226
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,340
even with metal detectors...

227
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,660
even in this transit lounge.

228
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,220
Oh, it's so early.

229
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,180
You guys wanna get coffee
or something?

230
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,860
Sure.

231
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,625
Be quiet.

232
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,940
What is it
you request of my employer?

233
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,340
Do you know
what cold fusion is?

234
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,780
Of course.

235
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,940
It's the theory...

236
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,500
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

237
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,620
free energy forever.

238
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,900
Yes.

239
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,020
Kaffee?

240
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,140
Klein, Bitte.

241
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,740
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

242
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:25,540
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

243
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,660
have never been able
to duplicate it.

244
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,940
Until now.

245
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,620
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

246
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,940
We believe
that this good lady...

247
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,780
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

248
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,740
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

249
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,420
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

250
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,185
Your offer must inspire him.

251
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,740
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

252
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,460
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

253
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
She's cagey, difficult.

254
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,060
Maybe your agents are stupid.

255
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,900
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

256
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,105
Ridiculous.

257
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,740
Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

258
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,140
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

259
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,420
His deposit should go-

260
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,500
Hey. It is not for me.

261
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,980
It is for mother Russia.

262
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,745
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

263
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,420
Three million in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

264
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
Yes.

265
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,260
How long to get
your employer's agreement?

266
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,460
I'll ask.

267
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,820
Your offer has inspired her.

268
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,940
I'll do it.

269
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,740
Bank account number in Zurich.

270
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,500
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

271
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,260
Bye-bye.

272
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,820
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

273
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Too bad we have to kill him.

274
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,260
Yeah, too bad.

275
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,500
When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

276
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,940
announced in 1989...

277
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,060
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

278
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,220
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

279
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,620
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

280
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,380
and then condemned
as charlatans.

281
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,420
The protocols of cold fusion...

282
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,820
What are those? Drugs?

283
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

284
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,940
She's boring the life
out of me.

285
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
- They're for my heart.
- Oh.

286
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,980
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

287
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,345
- Who are you?
- Me?

288
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,820
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

289
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,460
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

290
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,340
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

291
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,420
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

292
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,540
Dr. Emma Russell.

293
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,580
Oops.

294
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,340
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

295
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm actually more interested...

296
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,660
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

297
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,740
so I thought we would
start with those.

298
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Any questions?

299
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,060
Please?

300
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,540
I have, Dr. Russell.

301
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,620
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

302
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,220
you know, the theory?

303
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,980
Yes. Oh, there it is.

304
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,860
This is the-the apparatus.

305
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,220
And very simply...

306
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,380
when positively charged
deuterons...

307
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,260
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

308
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,700
they cram together...

309
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,140
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

310
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,420
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

311
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,540
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

312
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,100
But I read somewhere...

313
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,820
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

314
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,500
so how do we know it works?

315
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,620
We don't.

316
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,780
Not yet.

317
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,660
But if you remember Einstein...

318
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

319
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,900
long before he could prove it.

320
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:47,025
I mean, he felt the truth.

321
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,700
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

322
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,900
about cold fusion...

323
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,300
because it's there.
It's in nature...

324
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,900
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

325
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,180
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

326
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,420
I mean, just imagine.

327
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,380
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

328
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,140
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

329
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,100
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

330
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,500
on a gallon of heavy water.

331
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,300
It would be the end
of pollution...

332
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,780
warmth for the whole world.

333
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,980
So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

334
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,620
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

335
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
They used very complex...

336
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,860
November 17, 11:30 a. m.

337
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,420
Entering flat
of Dr. Emma Russell.

338
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,660
High Street, Oxford.

339
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,580
No alarms on outer doors.
Strange.

340
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,180
No messages.

341
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,620
Shelley Monument.

342
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,700
Entering bathroom.

343
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,860
Books.

344
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,420
More books.

345
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,740
Walls covered
with reminder notes.

346
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,860
Poetry.

347
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,900
Ah. Dad.

348
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,660
"Stop and talk to Shelley
every day.

349
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,180
"How can I love
a man named Percy?"

350
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,820
"Isn't there
someone in the world...

351
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,820
"who can consume me like that. "

352
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,980
Magic. Romantic.

353
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,860
No recent applications.

354
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,860
"Cold fusion notes. "

355
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,940
"Although I pass the
Shelley Monument every day...

356
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:45,220
"its sadness strikes me
every time. "

357
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,580
"I feel a very personal loss
when I look at it.

358
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,580
"So much pain
and so much passion. "

359
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,300
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness...

360
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,780
"and in the shadow of death. "

361
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,180
"Luke 1; verse 79."

362
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,100
Tretiak's wrong.
She's not cagey.

363
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,060
She's not difficult.
She's just...

364
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,340
eccentric.

365
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,980
She's innocent.

366
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,420
Maybe it's in her head.

367
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,580
She needs a poet...
an artist...

368
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,940
someone who...

369
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,660
understands truth.

370
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,660
She needs Thomas More.

371
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,980
Do you like it?

372
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
What?

373
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,260
The sculpture. Do you like it?

374
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,060
Oh... yes.

375
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,940
What do you love about it?

376
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,380
The way it... glows.

377
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,180
And how the light...

378
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,740
holds him in silence...

379
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,780
taking care of him.

380
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,900
That's what I like about it.

381
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,780
Are you an artist?

382
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,140
No. I'm just a traveler
searching for purity.

383
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,740
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

384
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,620
Yes.

385
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,020
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

386
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,780
No, not really.

387
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,060
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home...

388
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,220
in Africa.

389
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,740
You should
experience the energy...

390
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,500
of where all life began.

391
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Sorry.
I'm not very good with people.

392
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,780
Me, neither.

393
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,860
"I see my angel
for the first time...

394
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
"know my purpose,
feel my birth... "

395
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,580
"hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly...

396
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,980
"the sweet strains
of our union... "

397
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,580
"Our love heats up
the cold universe...

398
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,340
"and gives my tired,
desperate hope... "

399
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,140
"purified
by our kisses...

400
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,860
"are eternally healed. "

401
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,705
Do you like it?

402
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,980
Who did you write it for?

403
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,420
You.

404
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,860
You're following me,
or it's destiny.

405
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,340
Either way, it's weird.

406
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,860
Very weird.

407
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,820
Destiny then.

408
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,020
This must look strange.

409
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
It's, uh...

410
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,900
something that I'm working on...

411
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,580
a formula for...

412
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,700
creating energy.

413
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,340
That you carry around
in your underwear?

414
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,180
Yeah, I do.

415
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,380
How did you do that?

416
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,380
Magic.

417
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,100
Give it back.

418
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,620
It looks like Sanskrit.

419
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,540
Give it back.

420
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

421
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,020
What else do you keep in there?

422
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,900
Nothing.

423
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,300
That's not true.

424
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,620
Can I get you
anything else?

425
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,100
Drink your wine.
Latour '57.

426
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,100
The Latour, sir,
is $400 a bottle.

427
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,300
Then we'll have two bottles.

428
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,180
There. You count it.

429
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,540
All these little tubes
and microbes and things.

430
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,900
Molecules?

431
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,980
Those, too.

432
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,580
Can I tell you something?

433
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,580
What? You must. Everything.

434
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,060
It's a secret.

435
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,220
What?

436
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,580
I'm done.

437
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,260
My energy research-
I'm finished.

438
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,580
I still have some sequencing
that I have to work out...

439
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,700
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

440
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,340
It's just been you against
the whole world, hasn't it?

441
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,940
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

442
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,620
The gift of faith.

443
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,580
To see...

444
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,260
Well...

445
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,780
to believe in something
that's all around us...

446
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,780
but hidden from our sight.

447
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,260
That's a beautiful thought.

448
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

449
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,380
I don't even know your name.

450
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,900
Well, my name is...

451
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,980
I don't want to tell you.

452
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,060
I don't want to do that.

453
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,500
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

454
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,900
What's your name?

455
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,340
- Emma.
- Emma.

456
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,020
Now I know
everything about you.

457
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,820
Your... genius.

458
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,500
You have a weak heart.

459
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,940
You have beautiful dreams,
great courage.

460
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,500
You're not afraid in this world.

461
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,420
You get that from your father.

462
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,100
You can't cook
to save your life...

463
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,540
and you love fish.

464
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,500
I do love fish.

465
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,700
That's weird.

466
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,300
I want to try that.

467
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,860
- No.
- Yes.

468
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,820
I don't want you to.
Drink your wine.

469
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,380
Yes, I do.

470
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,940
What's your name?

471
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,860
My name is Thomas More.

472
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,380
I was named after the saint...

473
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,100
who died for his faith.

474
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,020
OK.

475
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,620
Your work...

476
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,100
is very dangerous...
and alive...

477
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,420
and I love your poems.

478
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,540
They move me.

479
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,060
But that's not
who you really are.

480
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,380
You're running away from...

481
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,020
your past and your pain...

482
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,180
and yet you keep it
so close to you.

483
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,380
So you don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

484
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,300
because you're beautiful.

485
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,020
What are you doing?

486
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,820
Oh, my God,
you're bleeding. What happened?

487
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,020
Don't know. I was...

488
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,140
weeping, and I slipped.

489
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,500
I was thinking of you.
I don't know.

490
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,700
I live right down the street.

491
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,420
I could clean you up.

492
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,580
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

493
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,860
- I don't know.
- Wait.

494
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,740
I'm glad it stopped bleeding.

495
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,060
Don't need stitches.

496
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,460
We're gonna have
to disinfect it, though.

497
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,980
You really are an angel.

498
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,180
You are.

499
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,220
It's gonna hurt.

500
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,540
- Aah!
- Aah!

501
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,540
Oh, sorry.

502
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,500
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

503
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,380
Yeah.

504
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,260
I'm sorry. I was just joking.

505
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,260
I...

506
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,340
- I should go.
- Oh, no.

507
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,740
Yes. You-you... I...

508
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
Take off your pants.

509
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,900
Pardon?

510
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,460
I mean, your sweater.

511
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,780
There's blood on it.
I'll wash it.

512
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,900
Very domestic.

513
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,980
There's blood
on your blouse as well.

514
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,780
I'll wash it.

515
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,100
Do you have any wine?

516
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,940
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

517
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,420
How could I not?

518
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,620
You make me feel so good.

519
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,780
I wish you...

520
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,300
I wish you could understand.

521
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,860
I want you to know who I am.

522
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,420
Oh, my heart.

523
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,820
Don't disappear.
I'll be right back.

524
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,580
Calm it down.

525
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,140
Bring it round.

526
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,020
Too way high up, your street.

527
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,620
I can see...

528
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,140
like nothin' else...

529
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,580
in me, you're better
than I wanna be.

530
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,340
Don't think,
'cause I understand...

531
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,100
I care...

532
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,540
Don't think,
'cause I'm talking...

533
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,180
Oh, I can't do this.

534
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,420
She's so great.

535
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,820
I can't believe this.

536
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,300
I can't believe
this is happening.

537
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,905
I'm open...

538
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,820
to falling from grace.

539
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,140
Hi.

540
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,300
"To spider:

541
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,980
"Must fly. Have better offer. "

542
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,140
Greedy westerner.
Wants more money.

543
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,380
Who cares?

544
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,300
Can't spend hard currency
in hell.

545
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,020
Send this message-

546
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,260
"Fly, don't buzz off.

547
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,700
"I'll double your fee...

548
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,260
"or send my own boys
to take care of the woman. "

549
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,540
You OK?

550
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,060
Let's...
let's just lie here.

551
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,740
Can't we just
be like this tonight?

552
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,620
Is that what you want?

553
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,060
It's so magic.

554
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,620
It just feels so perfect.

555
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,860
It's 7:00 a. m.,
and here are the news headlines.

556
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,980
Thomas?

557
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,060
Lev Naumovitch,
it's here! Good man!

558
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,505
It's revolutionary, sir!

559
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,500
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas...

560
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,980
but I think the formula
is incomplete.

561
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,100
It will take months...

562
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,340
That won't do...

563
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,260
because now that the people are
nicely beginning to freeze...

564
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,860
Tretiak must sweep in
with a miracle to save them.

565
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,140
How high do you want it,
Mr. Tretiak?

566
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,540
To the top.
Good morning, Yuri.

567
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,820
Good morning.

568
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,780
Perhaps I
can confirm the validity...

569
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,420
of this formula more quickly
if I dispense...

570
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,300
with certain protocols.
But, Mr. Tretiak-

571
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,420
How long, Dr. Botvin,
since you received...

572
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,140
your last salary check
from Moscow University?

573
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,020
Ukrainian Independence Day.

574
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,740
Last August.

575
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,420
Ivan, he's on-line.

576
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,500
Do it.

577
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,900
To spider...

578
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,740
You've got the recipe.

579
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,980
"Where's my dough?"

580
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
To human fly...

581
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,460
Recipe incomplete.

582
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,420
The cake won't rise.

583
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,340
Hence, no dough.

584
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,740
I am not the baker...

585
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,300
"... but don't make me
the butcher. "

586
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,220
I like this guy.

587
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,140
No play, no pay.

588
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,660
I'm certain you kept
the cookbook.

589
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,020
Holland Park.

590
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,660
I'll check that for you.

591
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,700
Yes, that seems to be fine.
One moment. Aah!

592
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,260
He's keeping me on-line.

593
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,940
You wait here.

594
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,140
You, beside the car.

595
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,900
Now, turn around.
Step away from the vehicle.

596
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,060
He's armed!

597
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,700
Drive!

598
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,300
Go the other way. Go!

599
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,220
You're all I've got tonight.

600
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,100
You're all I've got tonight.

601
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,540
What about him?

602
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,380
What about this one?

603
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,180
Yeah. That-

604
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,380
We believe
they're all the same villain.

605
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,380
Oh, my God.

606
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,460
They're all him?

607
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,140
We believe so.

608
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,020
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

609
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,620
Then he fled the U.K.
out of Heathrow.

610
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,380
We've got a handful
of false identities...

611
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,780
used on visas,
passports, leases...

612
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,660
Nicholas Owen...

613
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:07,340
Louie Guanella...

614
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,540
Peter Damian...

615
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,100
Charles Borroneo.

616
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,580
Of course.

617
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,300
Thomas More.

618
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,340
All names of Catholic saints.

619
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,100
Can you access
Heathrow's passenger lists...

620
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,100
for the last eight hours?

621
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,300
I think it might be possible.

622
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,460
Good.

623
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,420
Go!

624
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,300
Yeah!

625
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,700
Yes!

626
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,460
See, my friends...

627
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,140
you back the biggest rats.

628
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,580
Hello.

629
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,940
Out, out.

630
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,345
Freeloaders, out.

631
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,980
I want to drink alone.

632
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,260
Close the curtain.

633
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,580
- What?
- What?

634
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,940
Don't look down.

635
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,820
You know who I am?

636
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,100
No.

637
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,740
I'm the thief
you tried to cheat.

638
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,620
This is your accountant.

639
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,300
Talk to him.

640
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,380
The phone goes
the other way, you moron.

641
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,460
Hello.

642
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,100
Tretiak speaking.

643
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,340
That money to Zurich,
send it now.

644
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,860
I said now.

645
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,540
Yeah.

646
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,180
Thank you.

647
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,900
You know what the hardest part
about being you is?

648
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,460
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

649
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,540
You son of the bitch.

650
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,620
There is an impostor.
Get him out.

651
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,140
Hey, hey, hey!

652
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,740
Take your hands off me,
you idiots!

653
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,060
Are you crazy? It's me.

654
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,220
Go, go!

655
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,545
Catch him, go!

656
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,460
Ilya, get the bastard!

657
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,660
Fifty million. I'm out.

658
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,060
Mr. Ferrer checking out.

659
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,620
OK.

660
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,500
I'll have one, too.

661
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,180
Emma.

662
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,060
Hi.

663
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,620
I'm... I'm overwhelmed.

664
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,460
You found me.

665
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,100
Wasn't very hard.

666
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,940
Two men with saint's names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

667
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:37,900
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African...

668
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,340
whereas Vincent Ferrer-

669
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,420
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

670
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,340
How could you do it?

671
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,700
Emma...

672
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,340
I- I had to.

673
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,860
I'm a thief.

674
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,820
I want my cards back.

675
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,780
You flew all this way
for your cards?

676
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,900
Yes, I did.

677
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,500
No.
It's because you're in love.

678
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,380
I rest my case.

679
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,180
Who are you?

680
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,260
No one has a clue,
least of all me.

681
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,940
And why would you
steal cold fusion?

682
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,180
It's free.
Why would you do that?

683
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,900
Eight million reasons.

684
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,540
Eight million.
Wow. That's all?

685
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,580
I would have
given them to you...

686
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,420
if you'd only asked.

687
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,900
You've got
to get away from me.

688
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,260
I'm not going until you tell me
why you lied to me.

689
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,780
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

690
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,260
You almost got me killed.
The guy says it doesn't work.

691
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,020
Well, screw him.

692
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,260
I don't think you'd enjoy that.

693
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,180
You're right.
I don't think I would.

694
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,540
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

695
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,540
What?

696
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,580
- They took my pills.
- No, they didn't.

697
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,620
I palmed them from your purse.

698
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,780
I need one or two.

699
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,860
I need...
I have a bad heart.

700
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,980
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

701
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:25,597
It's OK. I've got your pills.

702
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:28,366
OK, I've got two in my hand.

703
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:31,100
I'm gonna pass out.

704
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,940
Sit down on the floor.

705
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,580
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

706
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,380
That's right.
Eat two out of my hand.

707
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,820
That's right. OK?

708
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,220
While you're down there...

709
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,740
Get the pocketknife
out of my boot.

710
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,980
This formula makes
certain assumptions...

711
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,220
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes...

712
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,420
so testing at any level
becomes futile...

713
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,020
without further information,
Mr. Tretiak.

714
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,740
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.

715
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,180
Help is here.

716
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,060
The two came very quietly.

717
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,500
Oh.

718
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,220
And they left even more quietly.

719
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,260
Close the city.

720
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,300
Kill him, and bring her... alive.

721
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,700
Why are they after me?

722
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:02,860
Tretiak, the guy I work for...
he owns this city, cops and all.

723
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,020
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

724
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:09,060
What do you want from me?

725
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,340
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

726
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,820
So the formula works?

727
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,340
Oh, kiss me again.

728
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,025
- No.
- Make up your mind.

729
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:31,100
Oh, it's-I have to
figure out the order...

730
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,820
before the formula works,
and I'm not giving it to him.

731
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,860
- Tretiak will find you.
- No.

732
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,300
He found me,
and that's hard to do.

733
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:42,300
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

734
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,620
What do you need?

735
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,900
I need some time...

736
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,180
and I need...

737
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,260
I need a place to work...

738
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,860
and...

739
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,020
Where's everyone going?

740
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,300
To their country
relatives to cut firewood.

741
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,980
There's no heat in the city.

742
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,820
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

743
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,420
I don't know.

744
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,540
Two hours, maybe.
I don't know.

745
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,140
Should be enough time to get
our passports together...

746
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,020
and for us to get married.

747
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,660
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

748
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,940
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

749
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,020
- You're not Martin.
- No.

750
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,620
Who are you?

751
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,380
I don't have a name.

752
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,140
That's sad.

753
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,460
Will you have a name
when we get home?

754
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,340
I don't have a home.

755
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,060
When we get back...

756
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,300
you do the science,
I'll do the math.

757
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,020
We'll market your formula
around the world.

758
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,180
We'll make a fortune,
and then...

759
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,980
we'll see.

760
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,980
OK?

761
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,500
Emma!

762
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,340
No trouble, OK?

763
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,940
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

764
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,260
Ohh!

765
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,140
Spice room, sun room...

766
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,220
Shadow room, night...

767
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,340
I've got you.

768
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,100
Come on.

769
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,100
Here we go. Up.

770
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,020
We've gotta get you warm.

771
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,460
We're almost there.

772
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,740
Come on.

773
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,940
Come on.

774
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,140
You'll wait till Christ
comes to Moscow.

775
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,780
Elevator was made of mahogany.

776
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,900
Tenants used it
for firewood last winter.

777
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,460
We need your help.

778
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,180
He fell in the river,
and he's freezing.

779
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,860
- Need clothes.
- We're just people-

780
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:07,180
You're not people.
You're Americans.

781
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,340
Yes, but we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

782
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:45,580
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys her.

783
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,620
No heat for sale...

784
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,500
but these clothes
will make him warm.

785
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,260
I tell her, Mashenka,
go back to bed.

786
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,300
She's always puttering around.

787
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:08,780
It's here.
Built to escape Secret Police.

788
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,260
In you go.

789
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,660
You've got hypothermia.

790
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,100
We have to get
these wet clothes off...

791
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,540
keep you warm.

792
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,540
They must be in
one of these buildings.

793
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,180
Check every apartment.

794
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,100
How you doing? Talk to me.

795
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,860
Snug as a bug in a rug.

796
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,900
OK. We're gonna...

797
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,820
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature...

798
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,700
falls below 95 degrees.

799
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,820
Two kids
talking about foreigners.

800
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,020
Listen to me, tenants!

801
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,020
Show me where
the Americans are...

802
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,900
and you'll be paid
in American dollars.

803
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:36,220
Five hundred bucks reward.

804
01:10:36,255 --> 01:10:37,420
Daddy...

805
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,020
have you seen, by chance,
two Americans?

806
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,740
Just one American
and one polar bear.

807
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,380
Do we get 250?

808
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,460
We check upstairs.

809
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,820
What's your name?

810
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,500
Who are you really?

811
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,580
Simon.

812
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,820
Simon?

813
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,700
So you are named for a saint.

814
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,500
No, Simon the magician.

815
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,420
I did tricks...

816
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:42,900
tricks for Agnes...
and that's how I got things.

817
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,780
Priests took everything,
took Agnes.

818
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,820
Dogs too big.

819
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,820
Teeth. Teeth.

820
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,580
She fell.

821
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,940
I escaped.

822
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,460
I always escape.

823
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,180
I don't believe in magic
anymore.

824
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,060
I do.

825
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,220
I've never felt
like this before.

826
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,500
How?

827
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,340
I'm freezing.

828
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,460
These are here!

829
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,100
We gotta get out of here.
Are you OK?

830
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,220
They're coming.

831
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,780
Americans are here!

832
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,140
Hurry. Here, put this on.

833
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,860
Ilya!

834
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,180
Upstairs. Go!

835
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,020
Maybe we can jump.

836
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,580
Let's jump.

837
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,300
Come on.

838
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,100
Wait.

839
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,180
We need her alive, idiot.

840
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,300
Embassy's east of here.

841
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,660
You're late.
Where have you been?

842
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,060
I've been waiting two hours.

843
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,620
I've got some beautiful
paintings for you to buy.

844
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,140
In here. Come on.

845
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,100
Don't fret.
It's just my curator, Toli.

846
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,740
I am Alexa Frankievitch,
but being you're Americans...

847
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,580
you can call me Frankie.

848
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,620
OK, Frankie.
I've got money. We want-

849
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,500
I know. The icon
of the Virgin of the Damned.

850
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,900
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

851
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,620
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American Embassy.

852
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,620
Right.
I need $10,000 up-front.

853
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,905
No.

854
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,340
OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.

855
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,780
Shh.

856
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,500
Police.

857
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,500
No. Tretiak's goons.

858
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,420
Wait.

859
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,340
Sasha,
go east to the embassy.

860
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,300
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

861
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:44,540
You're in Russia, sir.
Everything is complicated.

862
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:45,620
But you know the way?

863
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,180
Like the face
of a Bulgari chronograph.

864
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,900
I remember. This way.

865
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,740
At last. Water main.

866
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,700
They shut it down
each afternoon in winter.

867
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,300
What time do they
turn it back on?

868
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,620
You have five minutes,
plus or minus.

869
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,740
Plus or minus?

870
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,105
That means several
minutes earlier or later.

871
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,180
Don't worry.
Third opening is your embassy.

872
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,460
Quick. Someone's coming.

873
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,500
Come on. Come on.

874
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,940
Here's the second one.

875
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,700
Embassy's next.

876
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,780
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah. Unless it's minus.

877
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,060
Damn.
It's sealed.

878
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,260
We'll have to go back.

879
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,460
Come on.

880
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,660
Hurry.

881
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,300
Up you go.

882
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,980
Yankee, go home!
Down with Yankee!

883
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,660
Embassy's only
about 100 yards away.

884
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,140
There's a car right above us.
Watch your head.

885
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,060
I'll create a diversion.

886
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,780
It should take you 10 seconds
to run to those gates.

887
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,700
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

888
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,260
OK. I can do that.

889
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,340
You can do it.

890
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:17,220
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

891
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,180
I'll find you. You found me.

892
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,820
Yeah, I did.

893
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,020
Aah!

894
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,460
I'm an American!
Open the gate!

895
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,940
Open the gate!
I'm an American!

896
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,740
Back off from the gate.

897
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:32,620
Back off. I said back off.

898
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,980
Stand back from the gate.

899
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,060
I said back off!

900
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,980
She outran you?

901
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,980
How humiliating.

902
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,820
One... shot left.

903
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,380
Can't come
all the way to Russia...

904
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,100
and not play Russian roulette.

905
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,300
Before you shoot me,
want to know where the money is?

906
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,540
Whose money?

907
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,140
Tretiak's, yours.

908
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,540
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

909
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,060
What are you saying?

910
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,220
I'm saying your father
stashed billions...

911
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,140
and I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

912
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,700
So... where are all those
hidden billions?

913
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:33,180
I know... but I don't think
I'm gonna tell you.

914
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:04,540
Joseph, what's the holdup?
I said get 'em inside!

915
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,460
You're worse
than all the others.

916
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,100
However, burns will heal.

917
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,700
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

918
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,980
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

919
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:17,260
Lucky? Look at me.

920
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,700
I am a damn devil.

921
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,220
Christ.

922
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:26,460
Yes?

923
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,500
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

924
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,900
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

925
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,140
but rather... impossible.

926
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,820
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion.

927
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,460
I invest millions...

928
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,460
and you can't make it work!

929
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:53,540
What are you doing
with my money?

930
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,780
Do you think it comes so easy?

931
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:00,940
No!

932
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,940
But, sir...

933
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:07,460
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

934
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,900
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite convincing.

935
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,420
It does?

936
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:21,820
Yes. It does.

937
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,820
Good man.

938
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,420
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

939
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,500
Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

940
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,220
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

941
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,940
From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

942
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,780
all of them loyal to us.

943
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:41,820
Make certain
they get the message-

944
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,620
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

945
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,260
Mr. President.

946
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,300
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

947
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:56,420
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

948
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,900
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

949
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,260
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

950
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,140
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

951
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,820
from a scientific viewpoint.

952
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:11,980
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

953
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:15,140
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

954
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,660
Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

955
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,260
let's dispense with the bad.

956
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,420
What is the price
of this marvel?

957
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:25,180
The cost of research
and development are there...

958
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:28,780
which is all
you are asked to defray.

959
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,300
Ten billion in hard currency?

960
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:41,260
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

961
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,380
Where are you heading?

962
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,700
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

963
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,700
Like the miracle of socialism...

964
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:03,940
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

965
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,100
But no matter.

966
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:09,260
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

967
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,700
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

968
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,500
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

969
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:19,020
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

970
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:22,340
Not now, old witch.
We're working.

971
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,780
Yes. Think of it.

972
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:29,420
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

973
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:33,420
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

974
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,460
You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

975
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,060
Any medical problems?

976
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,540
I have a heart condition.

977
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,020
Do you need me to arrange
any medication for you?

978
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,340
Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

979
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,020
That's strange.

980
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,100
Get a form from
table three down the corridor.

981
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,580
I'll be back in 10 minutes...

982
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,740
by your side,
all the way to the airport.

983
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,900
Thank you.

984
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,100
...Across the street
in central Moscow...

985
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:00,580
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

986
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:04,420
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

987
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,260
I'm told
that all American citizens...

988
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,820
have been asked to report
to the American embassy...

989
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,700
for immediate evacuation.

990
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,900
Excuse me. You look lost.

991
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,305
- No, I'm fine.
- May I help you?

992
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,900
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is August Christopher.

993
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:24,380
Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase-

994
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,860
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

995
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,420
"but do not give it yet. "

996
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,780
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

997
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,980
Are you coming with me?

998
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:41,380
No. But they are.

999
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:50,780
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1000
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:52,620
Find a quiet room.

1001
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,700
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1002
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,420
My number's on the back.

1003
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:01,100
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1004
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:02,900
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1005
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,940
or you'll never be safe.

1006
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,660
Be good at school.

1007
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,820
Wait.

1008
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:13,100
- Don't you trust me, darlin'?
- Trust who?

1009
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,620
That hurts, Emma.

1010
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,220
I'm serious.
What's your name?

1011
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,940
My name is August Christopher.

1012
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,860
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1013
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,820
I mean, Vincent Ferrer...

1014
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,980
I mean, Martin de Porres...

1015
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,940
Thomas More.

1016
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:34,900
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1017
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,660
You have to be a very good...

1018
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,100
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1019
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:44,620
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1020
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,860
Now, get to work.

1021
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:49,220
Who's that man?

1022
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,540
You're leaving
on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?

1023
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:54,460
Probably be your
last chance out of here.

1024
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,940
Better hurry. It's leaving.

1025
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,740
Your troops
will depose the president...

1026
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,620
and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.

1027
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:08,220
Moscow must be
ringed with tanks by evening.

1028
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:11,460
Don't worry.
The people will follow me.

1029
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,660
They will be crying
for revolution.

1030
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,180
Still, no one's
guessed the simple truth...

1031
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,220
of where the heating oil went.

1032
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,940
Who would believe
that a sea of oil...

1033
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:27,540
was hidden under
this very building?

1034
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,020
Yuri, I understand
your Nataly is to...

1035
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,540
Francis, you devil...

1036
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,820
I heard you came here,
and you didn't call me.

1037
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,100
- Hello, Dominic-
- Give me a ring, Charles.

1038
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,740
Lou,
I've heard on the grapevine...

1039
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,980
you're brokering a revolutionary
new energy source.

1040
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,020
If it's as good
as it's cracked up to be...

1041
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:52,180
I have friends who can double
your best offer...

1042
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:54,300
on deposit in Zurich...

1043
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,100
within one hour
of delivery and confirmation.

1044
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,020
I'll be waiting.

1045
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,180
The work could be here.

1046
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,060
This machine could work,
couldn't it?

1047
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,340
Who are you?

1048
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:29,420
A friend of Dr. Russell's.

1049
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,620
Dr. Russell?

1050
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,700
What's this equation?

1051
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:36,060
It's so simple.

1052
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:39,540
This is the key
to Dr. Russell's formula.

1053
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,860
Yes.

1054
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,780
The alarm. You had better go.

1055
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:48,700
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

1056
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,260
But Mr. Tretiak's rally
is tonight.

1057
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,900
Can you make it work?

1058
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,620
Make it work.

1059
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,380
What is wrong here?

1060
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,780
Uh, the alarm...

1061
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:08,220
Uh... uh...

1062
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,340
I tripped.

1063
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:22,220
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

1064
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:23,900
You are Nikolai Provovich-

1065
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,100
Petrovich.

1066
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,700
Tunnel built by KGB...

1067
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,140
Leads to machine room
in Kremlin.

1068
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:46,220
Do you know where
the president's quarters are?

1069
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,060
President Karpov is there.

1070
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:54,100
But there are many guards,
so I suggest-

1071
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,060
An alternate route?

1072
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,900
Money. Now.

1073
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,300
Oh, ye of little faith.

1074
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,500
Russia stands tonight...

1075
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,260
on the brink
of a second revolution.

1076
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,740
As the number of deaths
from freezing mounts...

1077
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:14,660
hundreds of thousands
of protesters...

1078
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,780
have taken to the streets.

1079
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,380
Even as
Russian President Karpov...

1080
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,580
is promising
a mysterious solution...

1081
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,460
to the crippling
heating-oil shortage...

1082
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,620
troops opposed
to the elected government...

1083
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,865
and led
by General Leo Sklarov...

1084
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,580
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

1085
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,500
Angry, frightened citizens...

1086
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,220
are gathering outside
the Kremlin in Red Square...

1087
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,020
but they're not braving
the bitter cold...

1088
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:38,060
for yet another political rally.

1089
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:41,420
They've been drawn here by
the promise of a revelation...

1090
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,820
whatever that may be...

1091
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:45,260
in what's become
a life-and-death struggle...

1092
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,180
for the future
of democracy in Russia.

1093
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,220
Mr. President?
I'm your friend.

1094
01:33:03,255 --> 01:33:04,980
What do you want?

1095
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:09,940
I want to help you
to destroy Tretiak.

1096
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,700
I need you to listen
for about 30 seconds.

1097
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:16,140
I'm all right. Stay outside.

1098
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,100
Please, continue.

1099
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:21,420
Tonight you'll stand trial
in Red Square before the world.

1100
01:33:21,455 --> 01:33:24,700
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

1101
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,220
Agree with this criminal?

1102
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:29,020
If you want
to destroy Tretiak... yes.

1103
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,620
Gruschev,
take Mr. Karpov downstairs.

1104
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:48,820
The wife stays here.

1105
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,220
Get your hands off!
What you are doing is illegal!

1106
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,140
The people won't stand for it!

1107
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:59,500
The people are too cold
to stop it. Who are you?

1108
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,860
Tretiak!
Tretiak! Tretiak!

1109
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:32,660
Friends...

1110
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,540
countrymen...

1111
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,660
Russians!

1112
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:50,100
You heard about this morning's
sensational events.

1113
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:53,140
Many shocking documents
were recovered...

1114
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,340
from the president's
secret files...

1115
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,905
locked within his private safe.

1116
01:34:57,940 --> 01:35:02,700
The documents which will be
published in today's papers...

1117
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:06,865
prove that the traitor Karpov...

1118
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,620
was about to steal
over 40 trillion...

1119
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:13,420
of our precious
Russian rubles...

1120
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:17,940
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

1121
01:35:17,975 --> 01:35:19,860
To add insult...

1122
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,740
millions of dollars
were to be paid...

1123
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:25,740
to this international criminal!

1124
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,380
And for what
was your president...

1125
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:38,385
hoping to bankrupt
our national treasury?

1126
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:43,360
What you see is a fairy tale
called cold fusion.

1127
01:35:43,395 --> 01:35:48,300
You pass electric current
into the machine...

1128
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:52,420
and there is supposed
to be a chemical reaction.

1129
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,980
Watch.

1130
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:57,500
It can't even light up
a tiny light bulb!

1131
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,900
Do you dare deny this,
Mr. Karpov?

1132
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:02,060
Absolutely not!

1133
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,305
I proudly admit it!

1134
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:07,340
But enough puny failure.

1135
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,420
Failure's in the past!

1136
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,580
Begging is behind us!

1137
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:16,220
The balance of power
is about to shift!

1138
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,740
Miracle one.

1139
01:36:54,940 --> 01:37:14,780
Karpov! Karpov!

1140
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,860
Ilya! Ilya!

1141
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,220
Go! Go!

1142
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,740
Go, go, go!

1143
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:31,500
I order all troops
loyal to mother Russia...

1144
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,860
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

1145
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,740
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

1146
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:45,020
There was a miscommunication
in the chain of command.

1147
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,580
Miracle two.

1148
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:55,740
The billionaire
industrialist and his son...

1149
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:58,220
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison...

1150
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:02,160
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1151
01:38:02,195 --> 01:38:06,060
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth...

1152
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,260
as millions of gallons
of heating oil...

1153
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:11,360
flowed from a storage depot
beneath Tretiak's mansion.

1154
01:38:11,395 --> 01:38:14,420
He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1155
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,220
He never had the chance.

1156
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,500
You'll tell us
if he makes contact?

1157
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,660
Yes.

1158
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:23,260
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1159
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:26,740
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1160
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:29,580
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1161
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:33,300
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint...

1162
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,420
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1163
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,665
Count yourself lucky.

1164
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:40,980
I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1165
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:43,260
We understand.
You have a life.

1166
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,940
We appreciate
your taking the time.

1167
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:46,420
No problem.

1168
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,580
She's in love with him.

1169
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,860
I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1170
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,060
It hasn't been safe.

1171
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:08,620
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1172
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:15,620
So... have you been busy?

1173
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:18,100
Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1174
01:40:18,135 --> 01:40:20,505
Thank God I have my cards back.

1175
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:24,020
You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1176
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,620
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1177
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,860
Oh, my God.

1178
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,300
That was you?

1179
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,620
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1180
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:37,140
I thought you were
some old biddy...

1181
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:40,420
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1182
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:43,260
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1183
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:44,380
I am?

1184
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:47,220
Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1185
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:54,500
- Emma.
- Yeah?

1186
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:56,220
My life is very strange.

1187
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:58,420
I just...

1188
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:04,300
I don't do anything normal.

1189
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,820
I'm-I can't even-

1190
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:09,180
I know. I know you.

1191
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:12,660
I know your life.

1192
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,220
- What do you want?
- I want you.

1193
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,220
For how long?

1194
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:19,180
It doesn't matter.

1195
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:27,460
Tell me you love me.

1196
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:30,900
I- I love you.

1197
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:33,060
Simon.

1198
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,580
I love you, Simon.

1199
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,740
Miracle three.

1200
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,220
Dear Simon...

1201
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:07,500
the pin is something
I've kept for years.

1202
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:10,820
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1203
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:13,300
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1204
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,700
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1205
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:17,780
something I loved.

1206
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:20,580
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1207
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,260
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1208
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,380
and so I hope you'll understand.

1209
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:28,860
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1210
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:32,100
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1211
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,900
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1212
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:38,620
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1213
01:42:38,655 --> 01:42:43,580
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1214
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:46,740
If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1215
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:49,020
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1216
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,700
will accomplish anything...
you're absolutely right.

1217
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,300
Simon, what are you doing here?

1218
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,700
There are police.

1219
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,140
They're everywhere.

1220
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:03,420
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1221
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:06,380
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

1222
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,300
You better go.

1223
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:25,940
How will I find you?

1224
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,620
I'll find you. You found me.

1225
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:59,620
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1226
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:04,020
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1227
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:08,300
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1228
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:12,060
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1229
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:14,980
No.

1230
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,740
Dr. Russell?

1231
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:28,220
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1232
01:44:28,255 --> 01:44:29,820
Thank you. Good morning.

1233
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,300
No.

1234
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:35,380
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1235
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:38,260
a difficult childhood.

1236
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,820
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1237
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,740
bastards, at best.

1238
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:47,700
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1239
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,380
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1240
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,980
I'm her biggest fan.

1241
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,705
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1242
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,660
Even though
some of you may feel...

1243
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:03,300
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1244
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:07,420
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1245
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,540
becoming a reality.

1246
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,940
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1247
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,860
Look at the time.
Got to go.

1248
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:17,380
...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1249
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:20,300
we can all work towards
making the-the...

1250
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:25,700
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1251
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,980
Quickly!

1252
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:51,780
We got him!

1253
01:45:51,815 --> 01:45:53,660
Hyah!

1254
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,020
Hands behind your back!

1255
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:59,060
Got you, you slippery-

1256
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:00,300
What's going on?

1257
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,500
Damn!

1258
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:16,020
Donations totaling
three billion dollars...

1259
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,540
were made today
to the Red Cross...

1260
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,660
the Salvation Army...

1261
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,980
and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

1262
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:22,660
The funds were wired
from the account...

1263
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,660
of jailed Russian tycoon
Ivan Tretiak.

1264
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,580
In other philanthropic news...

1265
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,860
a nonprofit
research foundation...

1266
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,860
has been established to develop
cold fusion technology...

1267
01:46:33,895 --> 01:46:36,060
funded with
an anonymous donation...

1268
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:39,980
and to be headed by Russian
physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.

1269
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,340
The E.J. Russell Foundation...

1270
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:44,260
is charged to develop
inexpensive...

1271
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,785
Light a candle.

1272
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:49,185
Lay flowers at the door...

1273
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:51,900
for those who're left behind...

1274
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:54,780
and the ones
who've gone before.

1275
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,940
Here it comes now...

1276
01:46:56,980 --> 01:47:00,100
sure as silence follows rain...

1277
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,980
the taste of you upon my lips...

1278
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,300
the fingers in my brain.

1279
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,580
Ever gentle...

1280
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:11,300
as it kills me where I lay...

1281
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,820
who am I to resist?

1282
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,220
Who are you to fail?

1283
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:20,180
Got to get you out of my mind...

1284
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:25,780
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1285
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:30,580
as I try to leave
the memory behind.

1286
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:36,580
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1287
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,620
I'm so sorry...

1288
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:53,300
for the way it had to go.

1289
01:47:53,335 --> 01:47:55,940
Now I feel your presence...

1290
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:58,700
in a way I could not know...

1291
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:00,780
and I wonder...

1292
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:04,260
do you ever feel the same?

1293
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,460
In the spilling darkness...

1294
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,740
do you ever hear my name?

1295
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:13,660
Got to get you out of my mind...

1296
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:19,100
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1297
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,385
as I...

1298
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:24,100
try to leave
the memory behind.

1299
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:29,740
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1300
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:41,060
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1301
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:51,900
Deep in the back
of your mind...

1302
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,460
And how could you dare...

1303
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,660
to come so close...

1304
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,900
when you're just a ghost to me?

1305
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:12,260
And I've got to get you
out of my mind...

1306
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:17,820
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1307
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,100
as I...

1308
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,660
try to leave
the memory behind.

1309
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,380
Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1310
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:39,460
Here in the back of your mind...

1311
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:57,220
It's just black-and-white...

1312
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:58,700
or color.

1313
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,140
Those postcards...

1314
01:50:05,180 --> 01:50:06,860
sent from heaven...

1315
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:12,780
says, "Make the most...

1316
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:15,460
"of never-never. "

1317
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:18,620
Horizon starts right here.

1318
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,820
The future's always near...

1319
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:24,980
and I...

1320
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:30,020
I know this time...

1321
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,220
is borrowed.

1322
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:36,300
I try to remember
and forget my sorrow...

1323
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,420
celluloid...

1324
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,100
monochrome...

1325
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,620
or color.

1326
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:51,700
Don't want to end in tears.

1327
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:00,900
I'll leave before
my fears are found.

1328
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,580
Scared to love...

1329
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,060
wasted knowledge...

1330
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:07,700
into the brink...

1331
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:13,160
these four walls...

1332
01:51:13,195 --> 01:51:15,140
are lost forever.

1333
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:17,220
I will never...

1334
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,420
be that clever.
