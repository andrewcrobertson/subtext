1
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,183
Yeah!

2
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,425
Mwah.

3
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:16,254
You know
the first thing I thought

4
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,048
when I saw you?

5
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:23,053
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

6
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:27,431
What if it's a her?

7
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:29,560
What would you call her?

8
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,687
Ragni, maybe.

9
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,272
Sorry?

10
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:35,898
Ragni.

11
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,193
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

12
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,529
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

13
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,240
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

14
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,492
You kidding me?

15
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:48,996
Texas is, like, a state, you know?
-I know.

16
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:52,039
There's about
three or four hours

17
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,374
till we reach the peak.

18
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,252
Ah, great.

19
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,218
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

20
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,762
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

21
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:09,223
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

22
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:11,809
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

23
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,395
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

24
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:16,439
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,399
to use your brother's band.

26
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,984
- Why not?
- Honey...

27
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:21,444
He's super, super good.

28
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,404
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

29
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,156
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

30
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:26,741
Yeah, I know this.

31
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:29,535
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

32
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:33,205
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

33
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,667
His singing is like shit.

34
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,881
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

35
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:43,592
Olaf!

36
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,385
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.

37
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,970
Wait for me.

38
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,931
Why are you so sensitive?

39
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,439
Told you I could get us here.

40
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,238
It's beautiful.

41
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,199
Thank you. I love you.

42
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,879
Elsa.

43
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,925
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

44
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,302
Look.

45
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:32,056
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

46
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:35,059
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

47
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,728
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

48
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,232
We have such good luck
in nature.

49
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:51,326
What do you see?

50
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,831
It's demented or something.

51
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:58,166
What?

52
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,379
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. -Yeah.

53
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,423
Demented?

54
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,966
I-I-I think we should leave it.

55
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,009
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

56
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,386
Come on...

57
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,848
Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.

58
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,350
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, kristoffer.

59
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,770
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

60
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:22,232
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

61
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,528
Oh, fuck.

62
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,030
Don't panic.

63
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,198
What do we do?

64
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,742
"If it's black, fight back.

65
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,744
If it's brown, lay down."

66
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:36,412
But is it black or is it brown?

67
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,747
I mean, it looks brown to me.

68
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,540
We're in appalachia.
It's black.

69
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,250
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

70
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,295
You're not a bear expert.

71
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,921
Whatever you do, don't...

72
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,007
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

73
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,928
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

74
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:53,387
Run!
Where do we go?

75
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,765
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

76
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,892
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

77
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:00,102
Run!

78
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,896
He's coming! Come on!

79
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,607
No! It's following...

80
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,031
Olaf! No!

81
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:13,283
God!

82
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:24,960
Help me!
Come on! Come on!

83
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,922
Olaf!

84
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,489
This is drugs.

85
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,866
This is your brain on drugs.

86
00:06:55,867 --> 00:07:00,538
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

87
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,790
The thrill can kill.

88
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:07,796
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

89
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,008
And pulling the trigger.

90
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:18,055
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

91
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:21,141
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

92
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,143
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

93
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,646
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

94
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,649
when his parachute
failed to open.

95
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:32,236
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

96
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,989
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

97
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,991
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

98
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,993
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

99
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:41,078
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

100
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,914
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

101
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:46,000
wrapped in
football-size packages

102
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:49,045
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

103
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,471
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

104
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,515
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

105
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:03,183
Nothing.

106
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,311
Here's the I.D.

107
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:07,062
I know who that is.

108
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,608
Full name:
Andrew c. Thornton ii.

109
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,861
Man was out of his mind.

110
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:17,781
- What's the "c" stand for?
- Hmm?

111
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:21,036
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

112
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:27,041
Thornton was one of Syd
white's guys out of Missouri.

113
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,085
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

114
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:33,047
Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.

115
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:37,217
And there's more of this
out there.

116
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,262
They dumped it somewhere.

117
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,390
Hey, reba,
you have a dog, right?

118
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,225
Had.

119
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,937
Border collie. Barry.

120
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:50,356
Sorry for your loss.

121
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,358
Border collie, huh?

122
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,443
That's a cool dog.

123
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:55,778
Did he play fetch and stuff?

124
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,155
He loved fetch.

125
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:00,407
What?

126
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,368
Nothing. I just...

127
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,288
That's just awesome.

128
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,766
Damn it, Gabe.

129
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,519
Hi, daveed.

130
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:32,272
Uh, mind if I order first?

131
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,275
This won't take long.

132
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,534
Damn, I just bought these.

133
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,708
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

134
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,086
Did you hear about Thornton?

135
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:54,962
It's a tough way to go.

136
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,172
He only had 30 kilos on him.

137
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,134
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

138
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,635
Chattahoochee.

139
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:02,928
Georgia?

140
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,763
There's an area
called blood mountain.

141
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,640
When the plane's going down,

142
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,642
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

143
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,227
And then we just go and get it.

144
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:13,647
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

145
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:15,482
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

146
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,859
Eddie's in mourning.

147
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,694
Joanie just died.

148
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:19,987
And he quit.

149
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,905
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

150
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,657
She's not here anymore.

151
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,826
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

152
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:28,037
Syd, I-I just don't...

153
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,246
Stop.

154
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,124
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

155
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,502
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

156
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:37,922
Grandpa Syd, watch.

157
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:41,217
Yeah, that's great.

158
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,972
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

159
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:49,642
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

160
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:53,228
Chicken's in the microwave.

161
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,106
Just hit "start."

162
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,025
Thought you were off tonight.

163
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,777
We talked about this, remember?

164
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,320
Me picking up some extra shifts?

165
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,863
You said you were okay with it.

166
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:04,573
I was okay with it
until I realized

167
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:06,533
why you want
those extra shifts...

168
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:10,872
So you could go and do overtime
with ray the pediatrician.

169
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,876
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

170
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,712
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

171
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,297
this weekend
to see his band play.

172
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:23,133
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

173
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,010
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

174
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,553
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

175
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:28,472
It's Nashville.

176
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,184
He's a good guy, deirdra.

177
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,602
Just...

178
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:34,978
Give him a chance.

179
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:37,147
Please don't do that.

180
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:38,483
Do what?

181
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,236
You know what.

182
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:45,281
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

183
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:50,078
Close my door.

184
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,586
That's enough for today.

185
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,673
Wait, what?

186
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,676
Hey, Eddie.

187
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,055
They spelled her name wrong, daveed.

188
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,432
It says "John."

189
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,768
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

190
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,937
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

191
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:19,106
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

192
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:21,108
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

193
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:23,277
I got seven more days of "John."

194
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,279
The chutist has been identified

195
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,072
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

196
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:29,408
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

197
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:33,245
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

198
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,832
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

199
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm so sad, man.

200
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,172
I'm so fucking sad.

201
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:45,008
Okay?

202
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,683
Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?

203
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,477
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

204
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,480
It's just plain.

205
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,743
I knew you'd be late.

206
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,953
It finally came in.
Check it out.

207
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:16,830
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

208
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:18,874
Like a thousand, but worth it.

209
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,709
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

210
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,794
My mom is gonna be home soon.

211
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:26,965
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

212
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,926
Why by lunch?

213
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,595
The light, Henry.

214
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,722
But I got to go pee.

215
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,140
Go outside.

216
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,017
Why do I skip school with you?

217
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,561
You're bossier than
the teachers.

218
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:41,146
Now, the adoption people...

219
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,315
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there...

220
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,525
Told me I was supposed to be
getting me a lab.

221
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:49,321
A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.

222
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,031
I don't know
if there was an error,

223
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:53,867
because the one I got
is just kind of...

224
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,702
Bob?
I don't know,

225
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,204
just kind of fancy.

226
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,915
Bob, captain says it's time to go.
-Got it.

227
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,418
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

228
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,295
Hey, reba.

229
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,548
You got plans for tonight?

230
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,176
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

231
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:13,972
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after rosette?

232
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,890
I have to go to Georgia

233
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:18,141
for the Thornton case,

234
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:19,851
and you said
you were good at dogs.

235
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,603
I said I had a dog.

236
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,398
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

237
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,108
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

238
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:27,567
talking at a bar last night.

239
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:30,445
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

240
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,239
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

241
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,200
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

242
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,452
I only had her for a day.

243
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,996
Please?

244
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:41,582
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

245
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:45,419
Just go.

246
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,130
We'll be fine.

247
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,424
Thanks.

248
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,427
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

249
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,304
I can. I know the way.

250
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,139
School's gonna call, you know.

251
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,141
You know what? Let 'em.

252
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:01,601
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

253
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,145
So's your dad.

254
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,938
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

255
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,523
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

256
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,275
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

257
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,943
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

258
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,278
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

259
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,612
Admit it.

260
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:14,615
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

261
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,273
Jesus! Fuck!

262
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:49,399
Coral, it's sari.

263
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,026
Is Dee Dee over there?

264
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,986
School just called.

265
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:54,321
No.

266
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,657
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

267
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,576
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

268
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,455
so can you please
just put him on?

269
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,500
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

270
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,836
What the hell is wrong with him?

271
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:11,672
Never mind.

272
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,301
50 cents.

273
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:06,059
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

274
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,894
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

275
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,272
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

276
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,441
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

277
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:14,902
Vest pocket. Come on.

278
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,157
Is that perfume?

279
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:22,033
That's none of your business.

280
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,369
Well, it smells really nice.

281
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,913
Yeah, well, it's European.

282
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:29,791
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

283
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,710
Is it too much?

284
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:32,794
Not at all.

285
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,087
Smells expensive.

286
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,757
Well, it is.

287
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,593
You want a sucker?

288
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,470
Sure.

289
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:42,762
I like the green one.

290
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,431
This is a red one.

291
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:47,018
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

292
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:50,813
Oh, shit. He's here.

293
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:02,950
Am I in the right place?

294
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,454
Oh! Right.

295
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,122
Told you it was big.

296
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,791
Oh, it's big.

297
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,918
What's that smell?

298
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,295
It's European.

299
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,840
Someone been smoking?

300
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,467
Um, he was.

301
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:21,801
- Can you believe it?
- What?

302
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,136
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

303
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:24,888
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

304
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:28,183
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

305
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:30,310
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

306
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,479
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

307
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,231
Just get out of here.

308
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,816
Get out.

309
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,945
Unbelievable.

310
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:42,239
You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,325
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

312
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,432
Hey, Henry!

313
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:12,310
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

314
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,854
Hold on.

315
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,067
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

316
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,485
Marking our territory.

317
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:22,362
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

318
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:26,033
I'm not shitting.

319
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,788
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

320
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,374
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

321
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,043
Hey, Henry.

322
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,930
Check it out.

323
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,976
It's drugs, I think.

324
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,603
It's drugs?

325
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:56,771
Remember that guy from assembly?

326
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,899
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

327
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,818
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

328
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,445
No.

329
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,739
This is definitely cocaine.

330
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,240
Yeah. Of course.

331
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,076
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

332
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:14,165
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

333
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,417
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

334
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,752
When I do it.

335
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:19,878
Oh, yeah?

336
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,962
With who?

337
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:22,422
With faulk.

338
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,757
After church.

339
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,759
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

340
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,385
Are you friends with faulk?

341
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,553
No. He's a pervert.

342
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:30,013
Then you wouldn't know.

343
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:31,264
Liar.

344
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:33,516
You're just mad
you're never invited.

345
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,560
I don't care I'm not invited.

346
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,813
Sounds like you care.

347
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,608
Do some, then.

348
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:43,902
What?

349
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,029
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

350
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,949
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

351
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,078
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

352
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,663
That wouldn't be good.

353
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:55,955
Fine.

354
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,458
Knife me.

355
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,928
Okay, so how do I do it?

356
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,097
You eat it.

357
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:13,139
How much?

358
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,810
Like a tablespoon's worth.

359
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,408
Son of a bitch!

360
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,495
Oh, what the hell?

361
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:37,248
Rookie.

362
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,917
You do it, then.

363
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,018
Ah, shit!

364
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,854
What the hell?

365
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:03,232
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

366
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,865
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

367
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,825
Let's sell drugs together.

368
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:17,162
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and faulk.

369
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,874
There's more.

370
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,047
Something got into it.

371
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,507
A deer, maybe.

372
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,718
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

373
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,219
It'd be like this.

374
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,014
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like... bang!

375
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:37,766
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

376
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,226
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

377
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,396
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

378
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:46,358
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

379
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,905
My throat's really runny.

380
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,993
Stop that.

381
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:10,757
Did it do the cocaine?

382
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:13,594
Don't move a muscle.

383
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,351
Listen to me.

384
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:24,604
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

385
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,731
Now we have trouble. You understand?
-Got it.

386
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:28,900
I'll take care of it.

387
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,069
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

388
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,404
Grandpa Syd!
Gabe, driving me nuts.

389
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:34,948
Little...

390
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,867
Fuck.

391
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:07,106
Joan loved this song.

392
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,236
She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

393
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,408
Um, Eddie, listen.

394
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,662
Uh, when joanie died,

395
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:25,291
I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

396
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,209
It's fine.

397
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,044
No, I could've did more.

398
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,170
It's fine.

399
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,255
I should've been there.

400
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,590
I didn't need you there.

401
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:34,924
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

402
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,509
It's against my constitution.

403
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,469
I'm more than a drug dealer.

404
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,763
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

405
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:42,223
We're friends, right?

406
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:43,308
No.

407
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,227
Fine.

408
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,563
I think he's happy she's dead.

409
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:50,023
He's not happy she died.

410
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:52,525
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

411
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,361
if we can call it that.

412
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,155
Sometimes...

413
00:24:57,156 --> 00:24:59,532
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

414
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,284
No, joanie died of cancer.

415
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,535
I know.

416
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,621
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

417
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,039
You can't give no one cancer.

418
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,707
Yes, you can. With stress.

419
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,751
Stop protecting him.

420
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:11,669
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

421
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,755
No!

422
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:23,848
Okay.

423
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,063
Okay, so we start...

424
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:32,065
- Did you notice my nails?
- Those are beautiful.

425
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:35,443
- Thank you. We start...
- Excuse me. Is the ranger in?

426
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:37,612
I'm wearing the stuff.

427
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,281
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

428
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:42,116
13, come through here?
My daughter...

429
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,160
You lost your daughter
in the park.

430
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,788
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

431
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,874
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

432
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,709
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

433
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,336
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

434
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,797
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

435
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,340
with the way things are at home.

436
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:58,675
She's not a runaway.

437
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,093
She just came to paint the...

438
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,594
Can someone just please point me

439
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,929
in the direction
of blood mountain?

440
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,973
This is blood mountain.

441
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,307
Sorry. I-I'm Peter.

442
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:07,892
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

443
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:10,770
We're about to head up there ourselves.

444
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,188
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

445
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:13,731
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

446
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:15,108
is a very important process.

447
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,651
We wouldn't want you distracted

448
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,611
by our little
damsel in distress here.

449
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:20,154
Nothing can distract me

450
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:22,782
from making sure
the entire biological community

451
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,575
is safe for all our friends.

452
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:26,202
Friends?

453
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:28,162
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

454
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:30,623
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

455
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,043
Well, I won't be a burden.

456
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,797
I'll get my hat.

457
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,299
Okay.

458
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,179
Shoes okay for hiking?

459
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,098
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

460
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:48,975
I have on boots.
Yep.

461
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,643
Come on, Eddie.

462
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,353
I'm done playing this game.

463
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:53,604
You-you wanted...

464
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,189
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

465
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,150
You still have
three more questions.

466
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,319
Listen.
What?

467
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,572
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

468
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:04,323
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

469
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:07,161
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

470
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:14,751
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

471
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,170
Park rangers are peace officers.

472
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:19,505
Which means we can shoot people.

473
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,966
Forest is a dangerous place.

474
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,218
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

475
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:25,595
"Gang of pubes"?

476
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:26,972
Teens. Delinquents.

477
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,517
They've been attacking hikers.

478
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:33,019
They hurt anyone?

479
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,314
They cut them with a knife.

480
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,691
Call themselves the doochamps.

481
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,569
Watch your back.

482
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:44,197
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

483
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,575
Out of nowhere.

484
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:01,507
Fuck is this?

485
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,593
He's afraid, buds.

486
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:07,386
Empty your pockets.

487
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:08,805
No.

488
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:11,391
Empty your pockets, please.

489
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,896
Since you asked so nicely.

490
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,691
You think this is a joke?

491
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:22,276
I do.

492
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,070
Get him, buds.

493
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,738
I'm shaking
a fucking knife, man. Come on.

494
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,573
Just stab him. -Come on, man.
It's a fucking knife!

495
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,159
Go on!

496
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,581
Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.

497
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,167
- Come on, rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

498
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,421
Give me this fucking board!

499
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,925
You're going down, man!

500
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:53,683
Submit! Submit!

501
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,102
What the...

502
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,605
Hold this!

503
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:02,067
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

504
00:29:14,454 --> 00:29:15,914
Oh, my.

505
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,846
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

506
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,473
Shit!

507
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:35,975
I love this road.

508
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,518
Ah, love it up there.

509
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,645
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

510
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:41,147
What? The falls.

511
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:42,523
The secret falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

512
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,150
or take the loop.
I love the loop.

513
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,860
Well, you can see
the top of the...

514
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:47,820
This is a more direct...

515
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,697
All right. We're going this way.

516
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:51,365
Well, crap.

517
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:53,951
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

518
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:56,037
Just distracting you completely.

519
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,538
She can hear you.

520
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,125
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

521
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,669
What's taking you so long?

522
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,631
What'd you do?

523
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,975
Please tell me
you found them like this.

524
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:19,018
They attacked me.

525
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,186
Are they dead?

526
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,562
Well, one might be.

527
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:24,066
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

528
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:29,153
Jesus chr... they're kids.

529
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:31,489
I loved this fucking Jersey, man.

530
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,949
Okay, they're fine.

531
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,076
Thank god.

532
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,703
No fucking way.

533
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,040
Daveed?

534
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:48,881
What happened?

535
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:49,966
Hey.

536
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,217
Wake up.

537
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,760
Where'd you find this?

538
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,847
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

539
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,391
You tried to fucking kill me.

540
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,851
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

541
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:03,020
I tell him that all the time.

542
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,939
Where did you find this?

543
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,732
Up on the mountain.

544
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:07,817
Where's the rest of it?

545
00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:09,694
I don't know.

546
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:13,364
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

547
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:14,907
What do you think I'll do
to just you

548
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:17,118
when you're already
on the floor?

549
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,161
Okay. Okay.

550
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,914
We stashed it under a gazebo.

551
00:31:21,915 --> 00:31:23,791
Going back for it later tonight.

552
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,751
A gazebo?

553
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,921
It's a pavilion-type structure.

554
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,715
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

555
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,551
I didn't.

556
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:35,428
Are my buds dead?

557
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,096
- Show us where.
- Oh, god.

558
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:39,265
You know,
I-I'm feeling kind of tired.

559
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,766
I think I should rest.

560
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,768
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

561
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,186
Eddie, go get the gun.

562
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:45,604
It's in the glove.

563
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:46,939
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

564
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,899
Yeah. Same.

565
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,944
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

566
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:54,822
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

567
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:56,616
Okay.

568
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,118
Okay.

569
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,286
All right, all right.

570
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:02,289
All right, I'm coming.

571
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,374
Relax.

572
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:15,302
It's getting real cold out.

573
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,861
Let's go.

574
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:36,989
So, where you guys from?

575
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,699
Shut up. Keep walking.

576
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,327
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

577
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:43,329
It better not be a long hike.

578
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,663
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

579
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:46,332
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

580
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,000
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

581
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,835
Well, it wasn't me.

582
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:51,337
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

583
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:52,838
Getting stabbed sucks.

584
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,299
Hey, shut the fuck up.

585
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:12,400
Yeah, reba, it's Bob.

586
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:15,277
I was wondering
how rosette is doing.

587
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:17,571
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

588
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,156
I...

589
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:22,869
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

590
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:26,623
Anyway, I...

591
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,584
Thanks again for helping out.

592
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,212
Bye.

593
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:35,840
Look at this.

594
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,216
Oh, no.

595
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:39,468
Look at this mess.

596
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,512
People don't have any respect.

597
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,472
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

598
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:44,765
I... let me pick that up.

599
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,059
- All right. Thank you, ranger.
- Dee Dee!

600
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,019
That is sticking.
I got some oil in the car.

601
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,229
Dee Dee! Henry!

602
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,730
'Cause if that stays open,

603
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,566
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

604
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,651
What kind of critters? Huh?

605
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:57,278
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

606
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,488
Chipmunks?
Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

607
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:01,115
Dee Dee!
Uh, skunks.

608
00:34:01,116 --> 00:34:02,575
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

609
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:04,410
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

610
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,411
Yeah, with their cute little outfit.
-I think they're cute.

611
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,871
Uh, skunks.

612
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,038
Skunks. Hmm.

613
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,165
Possums.
Possums.

614
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,332
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

615
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,418
Hey, possum.

616
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,587
Mrs. Mckinndry!

617
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:15,963
Henry?

618
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:17,756
Here! Hello?

619
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:19,008
Henry?

620
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,594
Up here!

621
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,597
Hey. Whoa.

622
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:26,557
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

623
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:27,641
No.

624
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:29,435
No, that's not safe at all.
No.

625
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,604
It's too high.
You got to come down.

626
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:32,688
Get down here.

627
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:35,483
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

628
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:37,318
No shit, Henry.
It's high.

629
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,861
But there was a bear.

630
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,196
A really terrible bear.

631
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,655
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

632
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,782
It was fucked!
Hey!

633
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,576
That's inappropriate.

634
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:48,954
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

635
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,414
It attacked you?

636
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:52,416
Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.

637
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,418
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

638
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,128
You must have done something
to upset it.

639
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,088
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

640
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:00,174
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

641
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:03,010
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

642
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:05,054
You have to listen to me!

643
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:06,931
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

644
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:08,474
The monster took her.

645
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:11,810
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

646
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,437
Get down here now.

647
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:15,981
A...

648
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:18,108
I...

649
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,819
Dee Dee!

650
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,132
Peter!

651
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,010
- No!
- Peter!

652
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:50,391
Oh! Oh, no!

653
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,226
It let me go! He ran off!

654
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:55,437
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

655
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:56,897
Is it gone?

656
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:58,817
Do you see it?

657
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,616
Yeah.

658
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:09,910
Why are you shooting at me?

659
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:11,120
Get your ass down!

660
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:12,538
This is your fault.

661
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,082
Right behind you. I saw it.

662
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:16,543
Stay down.

663
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,387
What?

664
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:46,489
Help me!

665
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,159
Help!

666
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:56,248
Ranger! Ranger!

667
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,625
Did it get you?

668
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,169
That asshole!

669
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,462
I'm gonna get him.

670
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,006
I'm gonna get that asshole.

671
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,593
I'll get help.

672
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,094
Where are you going?

673
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:10,429
God almighty.

674
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,599
Hey. What...

675
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,602
Where is it?

676
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:18,813
Hey!

677
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,025
What should I do?

678
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,526
Motherfucker!

679
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:25,945
Come back! Help us!

680
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,199
Oh, fuck!

681
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:36,789
There's something wrong with it.

682
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,374
Yeah, I told you there was.

683
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,584
Why is it acting like this?

684
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:42,628
Did you feed it cocaine?

685
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:45,005
No. But you're safe.

686
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,965
Bears can't climb trees.

687
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:48,258
Of course they can!

688
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,220
Then why are you up here?

689
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:18,665
It's okay. It's okay.

690
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:37,726
Okay.

691
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,201
No.

692
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,456
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

693
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,875
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

694
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,418
Climb.
Go, Henry!

695
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,711
Go!

696
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,839
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

697
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,717
Go up!

698
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,802
Henry, go!

699
00:39:13,803 --> 00:39:15,680
Oh, god.

700
00:39:17,474 --> 00:39:19,183
Go, Henry! No!

701
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:20,392
No!

702
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,437
Oh, god. Henry!

703
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:39,329
Oh, god.

704
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,832
Oh, shit.

705
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:48,546
No, no, no, no!

706
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,675
Get off of me! No, no!

707
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:56,012
Get off! Get off of me!

708
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:04,228
Henry, jump! Jump down!

709
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:06,314
Move, Henry!

710
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,030
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

711
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:17,616
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

712
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:19,952
Come on. Let's go.

713
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,913
Come on.

714
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:43,101
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

715
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:49,774
That was so messed up.

716
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,193
That little man
was an expert on bears

717
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:56,154
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

718
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:57,865
Wait. What did you say?

719
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,324
We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.

720
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:01,159
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

721
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,662
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

722
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:06,164
and now on that guy back there.

723
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,041
Did you hear him scream?

724
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,294
He's so dead.

725
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:12,796
I'd love to not remember that.

726
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:14,798
But it kind of seems like

727
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:17,343
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

728
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:21,513
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

729
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:23,515
Alive? Yeah.

730
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:25,184
It chased her that way.

731
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:28,021
We got to go. Let's go.

732
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,357
He get at you, too?

733
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:35,193
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

734
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,989
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

735
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,783
Keep him awake.

736
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,245
Yeah, I've been trying.

737
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:01,762
You piles of shit!

738
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:04,348
- You're the doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

739
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:06,017
We found it.

740
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:10,939
"It's not ours."

741
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:13,398
I'm a park ranger.

742
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,567
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

743
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:17,235
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

744
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:19,738
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

745
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,657
I'd have been
at yellowstone by now

746
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:22,741
if it weren't for you shits!

747
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,242
Buds.

748
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:27,120
There's someone outside.

749
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,915
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

750
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,124
Yeah.

751
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:35,045
Now, uh, open it
when I-I count to three.

752
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:37,047
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

753
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:38,548
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

754
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:39,967
He took a bite out of my ass!

755
00:42:39,968 --> 00:42:42,387
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

756
00:42:43,805 --> 00:42:46,099
Now, open it when I say so.

757
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:49,936
Now.

758
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,816
That's a fucking bear.

759
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,824
What the fuck?!

760
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:11,790
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

761
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:13,125
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

762
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,544
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

763
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:16,628
Where's the bear?!

764
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:18,380
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

765
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:22,175
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

766
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:24,429
Close the door.

767
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,516
Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.

768
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:37,442
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

769
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:07,721
He's up there.

770
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,182
He's up there.

771
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,007
I got it. I got it.

772
00:44:53,184 --> 00:44:54,893
Maybe the kid can help you.

773
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:57,062
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

774
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:58,897
- What game?
- 20 questions.

775
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:01,399
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

776
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,902
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

777
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:06,029
Like, "is it a spider?

778
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,073
Is it an arrow?"

779
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:10,451
What are you, new?

780
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:13,453
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

781
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:14,746
Everybody knows that.

782
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:16,540
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

783
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,125
Is that one of your questions?

784
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,835
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

785
00:45:19,836 --> 00:45:22,088
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

786
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,424
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

787
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:29,137
Is it bigger than a bread box?

788
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:31,596
- Yes.
- Whoo!

789
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:32,931
Yeah!

790
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:34,724
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

791
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:36,893
What? No.

792
00:45:36,894 --> 00:45:40,105
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

793
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:42,275
You have one question left.

794
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:41,041
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

795
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,667
You sure this is the way?

796
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:44,754
Pretty sure.

797
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:51,843
Dee Dee! It's okay.

798
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,512
It's mama.

799
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,726
Thank god.

800
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:01,686
Ew! What the heck?

801
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:03,980
It's paint. It's just red paint.

802
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:06,524
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

803
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:08,485
I'm a nurse, Henry.

804
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:10,196
Good point.

805
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,074
Come on.

806
00:47:17,411 --> 00:47:19,372
Oh, smart girl.

807
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:23,625
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

808
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:26,878
Mrs. Mckinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

809
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:28,546
What?

810
00:47:28,547 --> 00:47:30,715
Why do you ask?

811
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:33,218
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects...

812
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:36,471
For the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

813
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:39,891
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

814
00:47:39,892 --> 00:47:42,394
What if they never want
to do it again?

815
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:45,063
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

816
00:47:45,064 --> 00:47:47,941
But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry

817
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:50,193
because drugs...
Especially cocaine...

818
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:52,362
Are very, very bad.

819
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:54,114
What if they would
never find out?

820
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:55,740
Oh, Henry.

821
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:57,951
We always find out.

822
00:47:57,952 --> 00:47:59,828
Dee Dee!

823
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:26,604
Medic!

824
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:28,106
Just open it.

825
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:29,482
Yeah, open it. You think?

826
00:48:29,483 --> 00:48:31,609
Can you just push?
Harder. -

827
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,111
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

828
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:34,487
- All right. You go.
- Let me do it.

829
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:35,364
You go. Yeah.

830
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:36,782
Please, show me how it's done.

831
00:48:39,452 --> 00:48:41,077
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

832
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:43,163
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

833
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:45,206
What is that?

834
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:47,208
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

835
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:48,626
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

836
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:50,462
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

837
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:52,465
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

838
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:56,468
Oh, fuck.

839
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:57,844
Come on.

840
00:48:57,845 --> 00:48:59,471
God, I'm trying.

841
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:01,139
Come on, push.

842
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,474
I'm trying.

843
00:49:02,475 --> 00:49:04,602
You said they called in
a concussion.

844
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:08,189
They did.

845
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,027
Jesus.

846
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:15,695
This guy's been shot.

847
00:49:15,696 --> 00:49:17,365
Yeah. Obviously.

848
00:49:19,283 --> 00:49:21,034
Holy shit.

849
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:22,160
It's the ranger.

850
00:49:22,161 --> 00:49:23,495
Tom.

851
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:25,498
Come here. She's got a gun.

852
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,502
Tom! Hello?

853
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:34,547
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

854
00:49:34,548 --> 00:49:35,508
It's okay.

855
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:38,510
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

856
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:41,513
B... b...

857
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:42,681
"Buh"?

858
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,735
B... b...

859
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:08,373
Beth?

860
00:50:08,374 --> 00:50:11,544
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

861
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:42,491
Beth, we should go.

862
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:45,411
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

863
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,504
Bear.

864
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:58,257
Bear.

865
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,094
Let's go.

866
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:04,972
Tom, get up!

867
00:51:09,602 --> 00:51:11,479
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

868
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:18,944
Hang on. Push.

869
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,408
Oh, shit.

870
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:27,620
Sorry. Sorry.

871
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:35,335
Come on. Come on.

872
00:51:35,336 --> 00:51:36,628
Anybody else surprised by

873
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:38,171
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

874
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:39,757
Leave him!

875
00:51:57,608 --> 00:51:58,983
Our next story, the weather

876
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:00,902
at the top of the hour, but first...
-Go! Drive!

877
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:03,906
More of your favorite hits
here on 103.7 Bob fm.

878
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:07,408
- Tom, get in!
- Wait! Wait!

879
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:09,578
- Wait!
- Oh, god.

880
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:13,873
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

881
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:16,834
Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

882
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:19,421
What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?

883
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,758
What the hell
have you got a gun for?

884
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:25,176
Hey, move! Move!

885
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:26,261
Put that away!

886
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,393
Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!

887
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:35,853
Oh, shit!
Kill it!

888
00:52:35,854 --> 00:52:36,814
Not the tree!

889
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:38,481
- The big fucking bear!
- Shut up!

890
00:52:38,482 --> 00:52:39,941
Why is it chasing us?

891
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:43,570
Tom, try to shut
the fucking door!

892
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:45,905
Close the fucking door,
you dumb-ass!

893
00:52:45,906 --> 00:52:47,783
Guys, you got to stop
yelling at me!

894
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:53,372
Oh, shit.

895
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:57,876
Beth, speed up!

896
00:53:57,853 --> 00:54:00,772
I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.

897
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:04,985
Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

898
00:54:06,028 --> 00:54:09,280
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

899
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:10,782
And what a man you are.

900
00:54:10,783 --> 00:54:12,867
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

901
00:54:12,868 --> 00:54:14,118
Can you not?

902
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,287
I'm sorry. Just continue.

903
00:54:16,288 --> 00:54:18,289
Well, when my daddy died,

904
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,625
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

905
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:22,585
It was the coolest little thing.

906
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:24,754
It had all these
green scales on it.

907
00:54:24,755 --> 00:54:27,173
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

908
00:54:27,174 --> 00:54:28,841
I thought that was so awesome.

909
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:31,552
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

910
00:54:31,553 --> 00:54:33,262
but I practiced
conversation starters

911
00:54:33,263 --> 00:54:35,056
on that lizard every day.

912
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:38,227
And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.

913
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:41,145
That's my team, man.

914
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:44,566
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

915
00:54:45,317 --> 00:54:48,486
Those are my buds, man.

916
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:51,114
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

917
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:53,825
Well, you know what?

918
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:57,495
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

919
00:54:57,496 --> 00:54:59,539
but people...

920
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,126
People are good at hearing.

921
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:09,340
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

922
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:10,967
- Can we...
- It's okay.

923
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:13,094
Y'all are hugging.

924
00:55:13,095 --> 00:55:15,556
It's okay.

925
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,269
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

926
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:37,638
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

927
00:56:38,764 --> 00:56:41,099
I'm already angry with you.

928
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:46,271
It's gone.

929
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:48,606
What the actual...

930
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:50,107
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

931
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,651
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

932
00:56:51,652 --> 00:56:53,027
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

933
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:54,695
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

934
00:56:54,696 --> 00:56:56,072
It's just gone.

935
00:56:56,073 --> 00:56:58,241
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

936
00:56:58,242 --> 00:57:00,451
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

937
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:02,703
I'm-a give you one more chance.

938
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,330
Where's the ba...

939
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:07,292
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

940
00:57:08,919 --> 00:57:13,631
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

941
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:16,217
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

942
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:17,636
I ain't fucking around.

943
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:20,806
Just do it.

944
00:57:22,474 --> 00:57:24,142
Fuck.

945
00:57:25,018 --> 00:57:27,228
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

946
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:29,898
I'm coming down there.

947
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:52,336
I'm just trying to...

948
00:57:52,337 --> 00:57:54,463
Find a safe spot to hop down.

949
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:56,173
How did you get up there?

950
00:57:56,174 --> 00:57:58,509
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

951
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,011
I hurt my hip a little.

952
00:58:00,012 --> 00:58:01,721
I can try to catch you
if you want.

953
00:58:01,722 --> 00:58:05,309
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

954
00:58:06,518 --> 00:58:08,352
Let's, uh, see, uh...

955
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:09,646
Get it.

956
00:58:11,648 --> 00:58:14,150
Fuck!

957
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:15,527
Fuck!

958
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:18,529
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

959
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,365
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

960
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:22,909
I told you not to move.

961
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,995
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

962
00:58:25,996 --> 00:58:28,040
They're not even
next to each other.

963
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,376
Fuck you!

964
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:34,211
Come out of there!

965
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:35,796
Shit! Come on out!

966
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:37,716
No fucking way!

967
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:41,094
God! Goddamn it!

968
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:44,388
You two, on your bellies.

969
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:46,433
Now! And no more moving.

970
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:49,518
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

971
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:50,811
Can you grab them for me?

972
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:52,229
Can I grab his fingers?

973
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,899
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

974
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:56,944
Slow. Slow.

975
00:58:59,738 --> 00:59:00,905
Easy.

976
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:02,449
Ugh, god.

977
00:59:04,201 --> 00:59:05,910
All right.

978
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:07,536
Now, you get back on your belly.

979
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:09,414
I'll hold on to these.

980
00:59:15,462 --> 00:59:17,130
Now, where you at?

981
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:20,258
Shit.

982
00:59:21,593 --> 00:59:22,802
What?

983
00:59:22,803 --> 00:59:24,346
Oh, no. The river.

984
00:59:26,556 --> 00:59:28,432
Henry, look.

985
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:30,434
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

986
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:32,728
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

987
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:34,522
We're on the right track.

988
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:36,233
I can feel it.

989
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,292
Mama?

990
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,670
Fuck.

991
00:59:57,671 --> 00:59:59,505
Fuck, man.

992
00:59:59,506 --> 01:00:01,967
My fucking Jersey, man.

993
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,137
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

994
01:00:06,138 --> 01:00:07,805
Until that guy in the gazebo

995
01:00:07,806 --> 01:00:09,557
throws his weapon
into the woods.

996
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:11,517
Well, then we'll be here forever.

997
01:00:11,518 --> 01:00:14,020
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

998
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:15,896
We don't need to die
because of this.

999
01:00:15,897 --> 01:00:17,898
Eddie, I got this.

1000
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:19,150
Do you?

1001
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:21,986
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1002
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:23,654
You're all gonna get arrested.

1003
01:00:23,655 --> 01:00:25,948
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1004
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:28,701
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1005
01:00:28,702 --> 01:00:30,786
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1006
01:00:30,787 --> 01:00:32,496
and supervised shower time.

1007
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:34,999
Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1008
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,751
I've never even done coke.

1009
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:39,837
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1010
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:42,006
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1011
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:43,549
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1012
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,509
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1013
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,429
I like to shit in peace.

1014
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:55,145
Nobody move.

1015
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:57,897
It's a bear.

1016
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,565
Yeah.

1017
01:00:59,566 --> 01:01:01,317
No, no.

1018
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:04,196
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1019
01:01:26,885 --> 01:01:28,302
Oh, fuck.

1020
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:30,554
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1021
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:31,932
Just play dead.

1022
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:27,279
Oh, fuck.

1023
01:02:36,454 --> 01:02:37,621
Oh, man. You fucked.

1024
01:02:37,622 --> 01:02:38,747
Eddie, can you breathe?

1025
01:02:38,748 --> 01:02:40,708
What the fuck?

1026
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:42,294
I think that's a yes.

1027
01:02:43,128 --> 01:02:44,879
Can someone do something?

1028
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,297
Maybe your boy can do something.

1029
01:02:46,298 --> 01:02:50,134
Can you just, like... move it?

1030
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:53,054
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1031
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:58,350
Dee Dee!

1032
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:01,479
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1033
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:05,482
Oh, god.

1034
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:07,443
Look.

1035
01:03:07,444 --> 01:03:09,196
Hello.

1036
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,949
Is he okay?

1037
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,827
Help me, please.

1038
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:18,787
Does he have food?

1039
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:21,165
Her name was Elsa,

1040
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,585
and she was so beautiful.

1041
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,754
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1042
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:29,006
Were you attacked?

1043
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:30,759
Devil bear.

1044
01:03:31,718 --> 01:03:32,968
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1045
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:34,178
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1046
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:35,387
Have you seen her?

1047
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:36,931
You have?

1048
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:39,141
Was she alive?
Yes.

1049
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:40,684
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1050
01:03:40,685 --> 01:03:42,603
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1051
01:03:42,604 --> 01:03:43,646
I haven't...

1052
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:45,190
Henry!

1053
01:03:57,661 --> 01:04:01,373
I'll show you. Come.

1054
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:08,630
It's not moving.

1055
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,966
I think it died.

1056
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:14,051
It died on top of me?

1057
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:15,302
Check its pulse.

1058
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:17,888
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1059
01:04:17,889 --> 01:04:20,225
I'm not sure.

1060
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,395
Uh, hey, guy?

1061
01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:25,521
Detective.

1062
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:26,563
Can we call a truce

1063
01:04:26,564 --> 01:04:28,565
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1064
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:29,776
Yeah.

1065
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:35,532
Fuck.

1066
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:41,996
You okay?

1067
01:04:41,997 --> 01:04:44,249
What do you think?

1068
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:03,434
S-Still breathing.

1069
01:05:03,435 --> 01:05:05,769
We should go.

1070
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,147
He'll probably be all right.

1071
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:10,232
What the hell, man?

1072
01:05:10,233 --> 01:05:11,608
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1073
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:13,652
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1074
01:05:13,653 --> 01:05:14,945
"She."

1075
01:05:14,946 --> 01:05:16,280
What?

1076
01:05:16,281 --> 01:05:18,115
The bear is a girl.

1077
01:05:18,116 --> 01:05:19,658
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1078
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:22,746
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1079
01:05:24,914 --> 01:05:26,665
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1080
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,083
She's awake.

1081
01:05:28,084 --> 01:05:30,461
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1082
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:33,131
Okay.

1083
01:05:38,011 --> 01:05:39,011
Chill out. Just chill out!

1084
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:40,971
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1085
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:42,682
Stay back.

1086
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:48,312
What the hell?

1087
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:51,149
Okay. Okay.

1088
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:56,321
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1089
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,989
I will be goddamned.

1090
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,491
Should we shoot her?

1091
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:03,953
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1092
01:06:05,497 --> 01:06:07,832
What the fuck?

1093
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:23,180
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1094
01:06:23,181 --> 01:06:25,099
Eddie!
Daveed, help.

1095
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,726
What is this?

1096
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:29,186
No, no.

1097
01:06:29,187 --> 01:06:30,938
Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?

1098
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:32,689
I-I don't like this.

1099
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,108
Please stop.

1100
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:36,194
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1101
01:06:37,946 --> 01:06:40,155
Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!

1102
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:42,324
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1103
01:06:42,325 --> 01:06:43,450
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1104
01:06:43,451 --> 01:06:44,535
It's-it's playing with you.

1105
01:06:44,536 --> 01:06:46,036
I'd stay still if I were you.

1106
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:48,247
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1107
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:50,666
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1108
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:51,917
Daveed!

1109
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:53,710
All we've been through! Come on!

1110
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:55,045
Come on, help him!

1111
01:06:55,046 --> 01:06:57,047
Get lower. You're not listening!

1112
01:06:57,048 --> 01:06:59,383
Eddie.

1113
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:01,177
Oh, my god. He's gonna die.

1114
01:07:03,513 --> 01:07:04,721
No!

1115
01:07:04,722 --> 01:07:06,433
Hey, girl.

1116
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:16,818
There you go, girl.

1117
01:07:17,902 --> 01:07:19,571
There you go.

1118
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:23,073
There you go.

1119
01:07:23,074 --> 01:07:26,578
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1120
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:42,759
Go!

1121
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,680
Don't have to tell me twice.

1122
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:49,766
Come on!

1123
01:07:49,767 --> 01:07:50,851
Daveed!

1124
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:52,436
That bag's worth 14 million.

1125
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:55,439
We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.

1126
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,067
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1127
01:07:59,068 --> 01:08:00,777
I need that bag.

1128
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:02,863
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1129
01:08:02,864 --> 01:08:05,450
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1130
01:08:15,502 --> 01:08:17,462
Shot...

1131
01:08:19,214 --> 01:08:21,382
No. I didn't.

1132
01:08:25,512 --> 01:08:27,472
Run! Go, go!

1133
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:30,934
Oh, shit!

1134
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:46,823
Holy shit.

1135
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:48,951
Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.

1136
01:08:48,952 --> 01:08:50,160
Where's Gabe?

1137
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,411
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1138
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:53,121
Calm down.

1139
01:08:53,122 --> 01:08:55,207
He's safe at home watching TV.

1140
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,125
What?
How long has he been alone?

1141
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:58,710
You left him with me!

1142
01:08:58,711 --> 01:09:01,839
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1143
01:09:05,343 --> 01:09:08,303
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1144
01:09:08,304 --> 01:09:10,889
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1145
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,975
The bear ate most of it.

1146
01:09:12,976 --> 01:09:15,018
- What?
- The bear.

1147
01:09:15,019 --> 01:09:16,979
It fucking did cocaine.

1148
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,480
A fucking...

1149
01:09:18,481 --> 01:09:20,816
A bear did cocaine, dad!

1150
01:09:20,817 --> 01:09:21,858
Fuck this!

1151
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,987
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1152
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:26,905
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1153
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:29,908
Look at me. Look at me.

1154
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,702
I'm on the hook here.

1155
01:09:31,703 --> 01:09:36,540
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1156
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:38,417
And the people that I deal with,

1157
01:09:38,418 --> 01:09:40,919
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1158
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,838
And look at me.

1159
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:46,383
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1160
01:09:46,384 --> 01:09:49,886
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1161
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:51,805
You hear what I'm saying?

1162
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:54,766
It's you and Gabe.

1163
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:56,728
You understand?

1164
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:01,149
We don't have a choice.

1165
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,527
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1166
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:07,655
over at the pavilion structure.

1167
01:10:09,657 --> 01:10:10,908
Come on.

1168
01:10:14,162 --> 01:10:16,080
Come on, son. Come on.

1169
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:25,589
Who's there?

1170
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,591
Easy.
Stay away.

1171
01:10:27,592 --> 01:10:29,217
Where's the duffel?

1172
01:10:29,218 --> 01:10:30,927
I gave it to the bear.

1173
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:32,929
You gave it to the bear?

1174
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,058
Yeah. The bear.

1175
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:37,602
It loves coke.

1176
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:40,479
Wh-which way did it go?

1177
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,439
I'm not fucking around here.

1178
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,941
Syd white.

1179
01:10:44,942 --> 01:10:47,486
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1180
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:49,280
They all have.

1181
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:56,787
Reba.

1182
01:10:56,788 --> 01:10:59,373
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1183
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:00,624
I got you now.

1184
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,626
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1185
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:04,212
They're kind of shifty.

1186
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,051
What...

1187
01:11:11,052 --> 01:11:12,637
What are you doing?

1188
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:18,517
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1189
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:20,394
You shot him?

1190
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:21,520
I told you not to hurt him.

1191
01:11:21,521 --> 01:11:23,271
I don't work for you.

1192
01:11:23,272 --> 01:11:24,898
The department trusted you.

1193
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:28,610
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1194
01:11:28,611 --> 01:11:33,323
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1195
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:34,991
I know.

1196
01:11:34,992 --> 01:11:37,452
- I trusted you with rosette.
- I know.

1197
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:39,371
Who's rosette?

1198
01:11:39,372 --> 01:11:40,622
The dog in my car.

1199
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:42,165
You left a dog in the car?

1200
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,126
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1201
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,003
How is she?

1202
01:11:53,678 --> 01:11:55,721
She being a good girl?

1203
01:11:55,722 --> 01:11:58,306
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1204
01:11:58,307 --> 01:11:59,683
E-Enough.

1205
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:01,810
Tell me which way the bear went,

1206
01:12:01,811 --> 01:12:04,438
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1207
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:06,940
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1208
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:09,234
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1209
01:12:09,235 --> 01:12:11,111
but that's just me.

1210
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:12,863
Well, what do you guys say?

1211
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:15,199
What's so funny?

1212
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,703
Apex predator,

1213
01:12:19,704 --> 01:12:23,040
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1214
01:12:29,505 --> 01:12:31,631
Dead north, man.

1215
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:33,592
Yes, we will.

1216
01:12:33,593 --> 01:12:36,428
Dead... dead north.

1217
01:12:36,429 --> 01:12:38,097
Let's go.

1218
01:13:19,597 --> 01:13:22,224
The devil bear is in there.

1219
01:13:22,225 --> 01:13:24,768
You can't go in there.

1220
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:27,270
Do you have kids?

1221
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:28,772
We would have.

1222
01:13:28,773 --> 01:13:30,524
I have to go find mine.

1223
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:32,777
And his name would be Texas.

1224
01:13:33,611 --> 01:13:35,279
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1225
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:42,036
Here.

1226
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:44,287
Thank you.

1227
01:13:44,288 --> 01:13:46,957
Bye, lady and little man.

1228
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,751
Bye, you both.

1229
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:52,462
Okay.

1230
01:13:52,463 --> 01:13:54,715
Wait. What about me?

1231
01:14:15,444 --> 01:14:17,822
Watch where you step.

1232
01:14:19,574 --> 01:14:22,034
I got you. Stay close.

1233
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:26,664
What's that?

1234
01:14:31,377 --> 01:14:32,752
Don't move.

1235
01:14:32,753 --> 01:14:34,380
Stay still, Henry.

1236
01:14:40,636 --> 01:14:42,554
They look like polar bears.

1237
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:43,930
Henry?

1238
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:44,891
Dee Dee?

1239
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:46,349
Dee Dee?
Mama!

1240
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,143
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1241
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:50,353
No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. -Dee Dee!

1242
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:52,815
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1243
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:54,774
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1244
01:14:54,775 --> 01:14:56,109
Are you hurt?

1245
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:57,527
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1246
01:14:57,528 --> 01:14:58,945
That looks really deep.

1247
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:01,197
Here. Don't touch it.
Ow! Ow! Henry!

1248
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:02,657
Let's keep you warm.

1249
01:15:02,658 --> 01:15:04,200
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1250
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:05,493
You smart girl.

1251
01:15:05,494 --> 01:15:07,203
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1252
01:15:07,204 --> 01:15:08,580
We found you.

1253
01:15:08,581 --> 01:15:10,081
Put that on.

1254
01:15:10,082 --> 01:15:13,084
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1255
01:15:13,085 --> 01:15:14,586
Oh, my god.

1256
01:15:14,587 --> 01:15:16,046
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

1257
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:17,297
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1258
01:15:17,298 --> 01:15:18,340
Henry told me everything.

1259
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:19,883
Everything?

1260
01:15:19,884 --> 01:15:21,092
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1261
01:15:21,093 --> 01:15:22,761
You told her?
No.

1262
01:15:22,762 --> 01:15:24,721
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1263
01:15:24,722 --> 01:15:27,015
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1264
01:15:27,016 --> 01:15:30,936
Um, what was that?

1265
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:33,022
Cocaine bear's back.

1266
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:35,649
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1267
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,150
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1268
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:38,443
Go that way.

1269
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:39,695
Go ahead.

1270
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:43,531
It's okay. Come on.

1271
01:15:43,532 --> 01:15:45,618
Look. It's a way out.

1272
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:51,332
It's the falls.

1273
01:16:00,883 --> 01:16:03,343
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1274
01:16:03,344 --> 01:16:05,304
Oh, god.

1275
01:16:53,853 --> 01:16:56,188
This is it.

1276
01:16:59,483 --> 01:17:01,109
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1277
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:03,695
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1278
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:06,574
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1279
01:17:10,036 --> 01:17:12,079
What is that?

1280
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:15,123
Oh, fuck!

1281
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:17,376
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1282
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:21,380
Come on.

1283
01:17:26,844 --> 01:17:28,428
Eddie.

1284
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:30,514
Take this.

1285
01:17:35,311 --> 01:17:37,188
Fuck.

1286
01:17:43,277 --> 01:17:45,279
Thank you.

1287
01:17:53,954 --> 01:17:56,831
Goddamn bear.

1288
01:17:56,832 --> 01:17:58,417
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1289
01:18:07,885 --> 01:18:09,719
You got what you wanted?

1290
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,055
Let's go.

1291
01:18:14,225 --> 01:18:17,435
There's-there's a lot more
out there.

1292
01:18:17,436 --> 01:18:20,397
We got to keep looking, understand?

1293
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:24,400
We're not whole yet.

1294
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:26,362
I'm leaving, Syd.

1295
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:31,909
Go.

1296
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:58,435
Give me the bag.

1297
01:18:59,895 --> 01:19:02,230
When did you all get so soft?

1298
01:19:02,231 --> 01:19:05,359
All got sand in your pussies.

1299
01:19:08,154 --> 01:19:10,864
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1300
01:19:10,865 --> 01:19:12,907
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1301
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:14,618
Stay away from the bears.

1302
01:19:17,746 --> 01:19:19,956
This way.

1303
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:21,708
Come on. There's an opening.

1304
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:23,793
Henry, come here.

1305
01:19:23,794 --> 01:19:26,255
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1306
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:30,009
He has a gun.

1307
01:19:34,763 --> 01:19:36,222
No!

1308
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:37,683
Come on!

1309
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:40,268
The hell is this?

1310
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:42,770
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1311
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:44,689
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1312
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,316
I'm a mom.

1313
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:49,319
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1314
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,571
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1315
01:19:51,572 --> 01:19:54,991
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1316
01:19:54,992 --> 01:19:56,535
You understand?

1317
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:00,371
Go.

1318
01:20:00,372 --> 01:20:02,333
Come on. Help him out!
Yeah, yeah.

1319
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:08,463
It's stuck.

1320
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:09,590
Fuck!

1321
01:20:10,674 --> 01:20:12,509
Who are these guys?

1322
01:20:14,428 --> 01:20:15,887
We're going home.

1323
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:18,056
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1324
01:20:18,057 --> 01:20:19,600
Nobody's going anywhere!

1325
01:20:21,143 --> 01:20:23,061
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1326
01:20:23,062 --> 01:20:24,855
- Dad!
- Shut...

1327
01:20:26,232 --> 01:20:28,524
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1328
01:20:28,525 --> 01:20:30,193
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1329
01:20:30,194 --> 01:20:32,528
Fuck.

1330
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,364
Get back! Get... fuckers!

1331
01:20:34,365 --> 01:20:35,740
Stay away.

1332
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:36,824
Stay away.

1333
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:37,951
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1334
01:20:37,952 --> 01:20:39,285
Just give 'em the bag.

1335
01:20:39,286 --> 01:20:41,162
Shoot the fucking bears!

1336
01:20:41,163 --> 01:20:42,497
- Get over here.
- Dee Dee and Henry: Whoa!

1337
01:20:42,498 --> 01:20:44,207
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1338
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:46,209
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1339
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:48,170
The fuck's the matter with you?

1340
01:20:49,546 --> 01:20:52,048
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1341
01:20:52,049 --> 01:20:53,466
Get 'em off me!

1342
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:54,926
Fuck him.
Help me out!

1343
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,511
Ow. Eddie!

1344
01:20:56,512 --> 01:20:58,222
No.

1345
01:20:59,056 --> 01:21:00,432
Coward. Daveed!

1346
01:21:01,392 --> 01:21:02,768
Here, catch.

1347
01:21:05,229 --> 01:21:09,066
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1348
01:21:09,942 --> 01:21:11,150
Mama!

1349
01:21:11,151 --> 01:21:14,112
Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.

1350
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:15,321
Look around, dad.

1351
01:21:15,322 --> 01:21:17,365
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1352
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:19,742
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1353
01:21:19,743 --> 01:21:21,577
People are dead.

1354
01:21:21,578 --> 01:21:23,663
You are no son of mine.

1355
01:21:23,664 --> 01:21:24,914
Hey, you!

1356
01:21:24,915 --> 01:21:26,416
You did this.

1357
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:27,917
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1358
01:21:27,918 --> 01:21:30,253
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1359
01:21:30,254 --> 01:21:32,463
because you're
a piece of crap person

1360
01:21:32,464 --> 01:21:34,590
and a bad dad!

1361
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:35,925
Who the fuck are you?

1362
01:21:35,926 --> 01:21:38,094
I'm Henry,

1363
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:40,763
and I am so fucking tired!

1364
01:21:40,764 --> 01:21:41,932
Yeah, me, too.

1365
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:12,962
She's protecting the cubs.

1366
01:22:12,963 --> 01:22:14,047
Oh, shit!

1367
01:22:14,048 --> 01:22:15,506
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1368
01:22:15,507 --> 01:22:16,841
What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.

1369
01:22:16,842 --> 01:22:18,134
We're gonna be okay.

1370
01:22:18,135 --> 01:22:19,344
Here, here, here.

1371
01:22:19,345 --> 01:22:20,762
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1372
01:22:20,763 --> 01:22:22,347
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1373
01:22:22,348 --> 01:22:25,183
We're gonna be all right.

1374
01:22:25,184 --> 01:22:26,851
Ready?

1375
01:22:26,852 --> 01:22:30,105
Three, two, one. Jump!

1376
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:36,653
Oh, shit.

1377
01:22:47,081 --> 01:22:48,999
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1378
01:22:51,877 --> 01:22:53,796
Let's go!

1379
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:27,371
Come on. It's okay.

1380
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:31,208
Eddie. Help.
We made it.

1381
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:24,261
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1382
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:03,674
Oh, shit. He shot you.

1383
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:06,470
Help! Help!

1384
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,643
S-Six more days of John.

1385
01:25:13,644 --> 01:25:15,311
Okay.

1386
01:25:15,312 --> 01:25:17,188
Six more days...

1387
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:19,565
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1388
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:21,734
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1389
01:25:21,735 --> 01:25:23,569
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1390
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,948
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1391
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:29,534
Hey, hey, I...

1392
01:25:29,535 --> 01:25:31,702
I got my last question.

1393
01:25:31,703 --> 01:25:32,995
What?

1394
01:25:32,996 --> 01:25:34,497
It's 20 questions.

1395
01:25:34,498 --> 01:25:36,332
I got my last one.

1396
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:39,044
What? All right. Sure.

1397
01:25:41,255 --> 01:25:43,464
Is it joanie?

1398
01:25:43,465 --> 01:25:45,007
It's joanie, right?

1399
01:25:45,008 --> 01:25:46,677
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1400
01:25:47,427 --> 01:25:49,470
How'd you guess?

1401
01:25:49,471 --> 01:25:52,181
You're so fucking obvious.

1402
01:25:52,182 --> 01:25:54,141
I just didn't want to guess it

1403
01:25:54,142 --> 01:25:56,019
to have you crying on me
all day.

1404
01:26:05,696 --> 01:26:07,822
She's a nurse!

1405
01:26:07,823 --> 01:26:09,532
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1406
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:10,866
He's in shock.

1407
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:12,578
Put pressure on him.

1408
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:12,887
I've called backup.

1409
01:27:12,888 --> 01:27:15,432
Her name's rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1410
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,392
You should get going.

1411
01:27:18,393 --> 01:27:20,604
Take care of yourself.

1412
01:27:25,651 --> 01:27:28,904
Hi. Hi.

1413
01:27:30,197 --> 01:27:31,948
Rosette.

1414
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:44,627
Whose dog is this?

1415
01:27:44,628 --> 01:27:46,212
I think it's mine.

1416
01:27:46,213 --> 01:27:47,963
Mine and Gabe's.

1417
01:27:47,964 --> 01:27:49,298
Is it on cocaine?

1418
01:27:49,299 --> 01:27:51,218
No.

1419
01:27:52,636 --> 01:27:54,805
That's a good dog.

1420
01:27:56,973 --> 01:27:59,183
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1421
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:00,686
Yeah.

1422
01:28:04,398 --> 01:28:06,065
I knew you'd be okay.

1423
01:28:06,066 --> 01:28:08,484
You're the toughest person
I know.

1424
01:28:08,485 --> 01:28:11,445
I think you get that
from your mom.

1425
01:28:11,446 --> 01:28:12,822
I think you're right.

1426
01:28:12,823 --> 01:28:14,990
Thanks for coming to get me.

1427
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:17,243
I'm your mom. I love you.

1428
01:28:17,244 --> 01:28:19,912
You, too, Henry.

1429
01:28:19,913 --> 01:28:22,415
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray
on you too soon.

1430
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:25,168
No. You deserve to be happy.

1431
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,045
Henry, let's walk over here.

1432
01:28:28,046 --> 01:28:30,423
Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.

1433
01:28:30,424 --> 01:28:31,841
I also don't want to look.

1434
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:33,551
Don't look.

1435
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:35,845
Let's just cruise on by.

1436
01:28:35,846 --> 01:28:38,431
Oh, here come the po-po.

1437
01:28:38,432 --> 01:28:39,807
Hey, mom.

1438
01:28:39,808 --> 01:28:42,059
I want to go to Nashville
with you and ray.

1439
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,146
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1440
01:28:45,147 --> 01:28:46,522
Rehab?

1441
01:28:46,523 --> 01:28:48,232
We're cokeheads now.

1442
01:28:48,233 --> 01:28:49,692
You know?

1443
01:28:49,693 --> 01:28:51,235
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1444
01:28:51,236 --> 01:28:52,653
Mrs. Mckinndry.

1445
01:28:52,654 --> 01:28:54,990
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1446
01:29:10,714 --> 01:29:12,214
Rodney, are you getting it?

1447
01:29:12,215 --> 01:29:14,258
I swear to god, Carol.

1448
01:29:14,259 --> 01:29:15,843
Well, then zoom in.

1449
01:29:15,844 --> 01:29:18,054
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1450
01:29:19,264 --> 01:29:20,765
Oh, they're so cute.

1451
01:29:20,766 --> 01:29:22,349
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1452
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:23,559
Wait.

1453
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,227
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1454
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:28,522
Oh, shit.

1455
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:05,601
Hey.

1456
01:30:05,602 --> 01:30:07,896
Oh, hold up. Hold up. Hey.

1457
01:30:52,023 --> 01:30:54,109
Daddy!

1458
01:30:58,822 --> 01:31:01,323
Is that for me?
Hey.

1459
01:31:01,324 --> 01:31:03,617
Yeah, what do you think?

1460
01:31:06,162 --> 01:31:07,162
What's it eating?

1461
01:31:11,459 --> 01:31:12,710
Oh, my god.

1462
01:31:12,711 --> 01:31:14,712
They're weren't gonna
put 'em back on.
