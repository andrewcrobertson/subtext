1
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,159
Mum!

2
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:41,094
Mum!

3
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,557
Mummy!

4
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:50,270
Mum!

5
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:53,773
Mum!

6
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:57,027
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,807
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

8
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:12,227
"straight into
the huge black pot.

9
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:16,504
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:22,613
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

11
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:25,198
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:27,701
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,893
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,291
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,834
It's very late.

16
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:38,777
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:45,510
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact -

18
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:50,580
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:03,839
What have you done?

20
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:05,674
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:08,051
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:11,221
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,453
Please don't!

24
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,477
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,105
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,690
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:22,941
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,277
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,195
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,780
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

31
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,782
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

32
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:34,017
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

33
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,782
Don't do that!

34
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:53,953
Ready?

35
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:57,832
Come on.

36
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:03,940
Quick. You're late already.

37
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:05,734
What have you got in there?

38
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,258
See you later, alligator.

39
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:19,414
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

40
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,582
What?

41
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:22,542
One with your milk in it.

42
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,419
I don't want milk.

43
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:27,320
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

44
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:33,929
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

45
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:36,371
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

46
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,391
Do you want a cuppa?

47
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:41,459
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

48
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,629
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

49
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,215
Right?

50
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:52,906
Amelia?

51
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,681
Your son's school
is on the phone.

52
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,289
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,707
Did he hurt anyone?

54
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,149
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

55
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,255
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

56
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,590
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

57
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,300
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

58
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:16,471
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

59
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,764
Monitor?

60
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,724
He'll be separated
from the other children.

61
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:22,561
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

62
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:23,937
Samuel won't cope with this.

63
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,397
He already feels so different.

64
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:28,275
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

65
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:29,401
Mrs Fanning,

66
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,862
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

67
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:35,740
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

68
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,993
What he needs
is some understanding.

69
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:40,704
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

70
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:43,206
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

71
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,833
I think I'll just find
another school.

72
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:47,335
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

73
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,379
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

74
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:51,172
that sees my son
as a human being

75
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,174
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

76
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,177
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

77
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,638
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

78
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,872
His name is Samuel.

79
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,984
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

80
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,153
You can play
on that swing you like

81
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,071
for as long as you like, OK?

82
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:18,116
Mrs Bruen hates me.

83
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,766
No, she doesn't.

84
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,227
Just need a break, that's all.

85
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,523
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

86
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,778
I'll tell her later.

87
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:36,908
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

88
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:40,388
Sam, don't bother the lady.

89
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:42,015
No, no, no. That's alright.

90
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,892
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

91
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,518
My dad's in the cemetery.

92
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,728
Oh. That's...

93
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,731
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

94
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:52,442
Samuel.

95
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm sorry. He just...

96
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:56,738
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

97
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:59,866
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

98
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,660
We have to go.

99
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,893
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

100
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,957
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

101
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,625
Right in front of
his own installation.

102
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,627
Lost all these sales.

103
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,671
You're not listening.

104
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,422
I am. I am.

105
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:17,550
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

106
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,552
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

107
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:22,138
Mum! Mum!

108
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,997
I'm gonna smash its head!

109
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,336
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

110
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,652
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

111
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:38,845
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

112
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:43,141
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

113
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,247
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

114
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,542
Mum! Mum!

115
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,127
She wants to have
a princess party.

116
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:54,379
Mum! Mum!

117
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,880
That's OK.

118
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,133
We don't have to come.

119
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,093
You can still come.

120
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:01,219
Mum!

121
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,430
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

122
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,515
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

123
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,875
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

124
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,940
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

125
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,233
this year, anyway.

126
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:17,592
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

127
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:21,322
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

128
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,324
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

129
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,534
and I end up feeling awful.

130
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,078
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

131
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,039
We'll be fine.

132
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,206
We'll be absolutely fine.

133
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,981
Mum! Look at me!

134
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,280
Mama!

135
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,640
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

136
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:49,642
You look tired, little one.

137
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,978
Have you been in the wars today?

138
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,396
A few wars.

139
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,066
He's had a big day, that's all.

140
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,692
He's just exhausted.

141
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,527
Poor little sweetheart.

142
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,945
Bugsy.

143
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,697
Come here, little girl. Hello.

144
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:05,325
You look tired too, love.

145
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:06,743
You OK?

146
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,976
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

147
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,873
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

148
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:14,626
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

149
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,234
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

150
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,234
You can choose one tonight.

151
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,719
Where did you get this?

152
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,244
On the shelf.

153
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:17,605
"If it's in a word
or it's in a look,

154
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,423
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

155
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:26,865
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

156
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,868
"then you can make friends
with a special one -

157
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,434
"a friend of you and me."

158
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:41,296
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

159
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,009
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -

160
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:49,554
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

161
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:52,599
"That's when you'll know
he's around.

162
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,957
"You'll see him if you look.

163
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:01,566
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

164
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,526
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

165
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,426
But you said I could choose.

166
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,702
"This is what he wears on top.

167
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,894
"He's funny, don't you think?

168
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:20,232
"See him
in your room at night..."

169
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,445
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

170
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,842
Mum?

171
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,660
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

172
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:33,746
Mummy?

173
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,458
Mummy?!

174
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,771
"How sweetly they sung,

175
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,522
"telling of the happiness
and loveliness

176
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,691
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

177
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:46,258
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

178
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:58,599
It's that time of
night again.

179
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,267
Time...

180
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,728
If that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

181
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:04,128
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

182
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,643
Do you...

183
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,082
Mum!

184
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,917
- It's in my room!
- What is?

185
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,710
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

186
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:54,424
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

187
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,176
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

188
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,178
It's just a book.

189
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:01,556
It can't hurt you.

190
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,308
You've had a big day.

191
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:06,959
You're just exhausted.

192
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:11,714
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

193
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:17,405
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

194
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,972
I'm gonna protect you.

195
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,795
Mum, it's 9:00.

196
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,993
He's not running a fever
anymore.

197
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:50,373
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

198
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:52,231
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

199
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,461
Sorry. What was that?

200
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:59,006
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

201
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

202
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:05,285
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

203
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:10,541
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

204
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,903
88. Number 88.

205
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,822
Two fat ladies.

206
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:24,448
Good, Elaine!

207
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:27,099
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

208
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:31,914
Number 11.

209
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,666
Who has number 11?

210
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,751
Legs 11.

211
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,610
Hey? See what else we've got.

212
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:42,925
5 billion.

213
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:45,367
Anyone got 5 billion?

214
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:59,214
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

215
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,905
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

216
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,658
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

217
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,893
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

218
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,375
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

219
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,795
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

220
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,653
Why don't you go home?

221
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:26,218
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

222
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:27,136
I can cover for you.

223
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,787
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

224
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,476
I'll give you my pay.

225
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,394
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,688
You've got a sick boy.

227
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,565
Life's too short.

228
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,466
You're so sweet, Robbie.

229
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,988
- You should go.
- Yeah.

230
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:49,223
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

231
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:43,379
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

232
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:44,630
Rung you a million times.

233
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,673
What happened?

234
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:47,758
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

235
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:50,928
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

236
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,180
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

237
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,223
I'm so sorry.

238
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,683
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

239
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,601
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

240
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,061
It's not rubbish. It's real!

241
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,211
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

242
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,609
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

243
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,528
You got them for me
on the internet.

244
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:08,992
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

245
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:14,160
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

246
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:17,788
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

247
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,623
Well, I'm not scared.

248
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,752
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

249
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:24,420
That's enough.

250
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:27,006
You will be
when it eats your insides.

251
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,840
I've decided

252
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,717
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

253
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:31,450
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

254
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:37,664
Samuel.

255
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:51,155
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

256
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,824
life is not always as it seems.

257
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:57,077
It can be a wondrous thing.

258
00:21:57,101 --> 00:22:01,521
But it can also be
very treacherous.

259
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:12,885
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

260
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,911
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

261
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:22,019
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

262
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,127
Samuel.

263
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,324
I was just
putting something back.

264
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:36,742
All your father's things
are down there.

265
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:37,785
He's my father.

266
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,935
You don't own him!

267
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,897
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

268
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,694
Can I come in?

269
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,133
Hey, matey. This is for you.

270
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,928
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

271
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:57,452
I'm not sick.

272
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,392
Oh. I-I thought...

273
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,060
No, he's not, actually.

274
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:06,146
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

275
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,189
You said that's not true.

276
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,732
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

277
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:09,900
who still believe in monsters?

278
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,068
I hate you!

279
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,611
She won't let me have
a birthday party

280
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:15,679
and she won't let me have a dad!

281
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,545
Don't eat it.

282
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,477
The Babadook did it, Mum.

283
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:48,707
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

284
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,250
The Babadook did it!

285
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:52,044
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

286
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,713
Ladies and gentlemen,

287
00:24:54,737 --> 00:24:56,799
girls and boys,

288
00:24:56,823 --> 00:25:02,262
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

289
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:05,349
Life is not always as it seems.

290
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:09,478
It can be a wondrous thing.

291
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:13,524
But it can also be
very treacherous.

292
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,859
In this DVD,

293
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:20,489
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

294
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:26,143
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

295
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,293
Do you think this is funny?

296
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,589
Oh, no. No. No!

297
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,301
Give it to me!

298
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:03,513
Do you wanna die?

299
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,565
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

300
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,277
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

301
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:24,094
Don't let it in!

302
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:38,376
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

303
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,283
I've already got this doll, Mum.

304
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,618
Now she's got a twin.

305
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:53,850
They can go shopping together.

306
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:01,084
Off you go.

307
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,485
He's just really tired.

308
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:10,825
Go and play right now.

309
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,978
Claire tells me you're a writer.

310
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:22,689
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

311
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,192
What kind of writing did you do?

312
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:29,154
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

313
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:31,573
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

314
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,033
It must be difficult.

315
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:36,495
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

316
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:39,248
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

317
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:41,940
and they find it very hard.

318
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:45,462
How's Richard's merger going?

319
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:49,716
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

320
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,511
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

321
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:53,679
Tell me about it!

322
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,014
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

323
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,641
That's a real tragedy.

324
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,978
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

325
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,063
You must have so much
to talk about

326
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,754
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

327
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:19,871
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

328
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:21,354
I'm not hurting anybody.

329
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,734
Bye.

330
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,738
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

331
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,639
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

332
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:39,683
She never comes to our house.

333
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,185
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

334
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,062
'cause it's too depressing.

335
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:47,065
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

336
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,609
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

337
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:52,821
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

338
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:55,240
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

339
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:57,826
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

340
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,286
Isn't it time you moved on?

341
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,829
I have moved on.

342
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:04,291
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

343
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:06,418
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

344
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:09,212
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

345
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,256
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

346
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,924
I do have a dad!

347
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:15,802
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

348
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:18,889
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

349
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,140
I do!

350
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,850
I want to know how you are.

351
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,560
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

352
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,771
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

353
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:28,398
I can't believe
you just said that.

354
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,942
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

355
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:33,445
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

356
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:34,946
That's not true!

357
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,156
And your mum doesn't want you.

358
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,515
No-one wants you.

359
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,796
What did you do?!

360
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,488
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

361
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:56,718
Is she alright?

362
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:59,346
Stay here
and look after the children

363
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,431
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

364
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:06,520
Mummy!
She wouldn't believe me!

365
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:09,022
Mummy! Mummy!

366
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:10,941
Mummy!

367
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:14,968
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

368
00:32:16,554 --> 00:32:18,847
There is no Babadook!

369
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,851
Get out!

370
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:28,166
- Get out!
- Samuel?

371
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,419
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

372
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:33,319
Get out! Get out! Get out!

373
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:53,733
Please help me!

374
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,925
There's something wrong
with my son.

375
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:11,001
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

376
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,878
That's when the brain overheats.

377
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,212
It always looks worse
than it is.

378
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:16,089
I've never seen
anything like this.

379
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:18,175
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

380
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,968
All his other results
are normal.

381
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:24,139
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

382
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:25,891
Very committed to
the monster theory.

383
00:33:25,915 --> 00:33:27,290
That's an understatement.

384
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:31,021
All children see monsters.

385
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:32,795
Not like this.

386
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,193
And it's getting worse.

387
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,904
He's becoming aggressive.

388
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:40,489
He could see a psychiatrist.

389
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:42,115
I can refer you.

390
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:43,700
Takes a few weeks to get in.

391
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:44,933
That'd be great.

392
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:50,165
But can you just give me
something for now,

393
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:52,649
just to make him sleep?

394
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:55,401
Um, just until...

395
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:58,863
...just until
we get an appointment.

396
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,219
Please?

397
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:07,015
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

398
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,433
and when we go home tonight,

399
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:10,435
this whole nightmare
will start up again

400
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:11,686
and I am really...

401
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,587
...I'm really not coping.

402
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,446
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

403
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,865
Just until the tests come back.

404
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,745
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

405
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,770
It's really bad.

406
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:42,551
These can make children
feel foggy.

407
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,803
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

408
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:48,014
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

409
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:51,624
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

410
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:56,106
Why don't people
like me?

411
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,191
Why do you say that?

412
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:02,135
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

413
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:07,348
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

414
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:15,000
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

415
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:16,399
and not worry.

416
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:19,671
I don't want you to die.

417
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:22,799
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

418
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:27,076
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

419
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:34,811
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

420
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,147
I've got the day off tomorrow.

421
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,190
Maybe we could do something,

422
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:42,569
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

423
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:44,279
I think so

424
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,156
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

425
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,201
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

426
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:52,037
Then I won't mention it.

427
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:56,374
I promise to protect you.

428
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,107
Come on.

429
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,536
Come on.

430
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,522
Can you stay here with me?

431
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,441
Yes.

432
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:23,777
I love you, Mum.

433
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:25,593
Me too.

434
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:30,296
Her nose
is broken in two places.

435
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,130
She may need surgery.

436
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:32,507
I'll pay for everything.

437
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,259
You can't even pay
your own bills.

438
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:35,635
Look, I really have to go.

439
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:39,430
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

440
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:40,807
What?

441
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:42,851
A book turned up
at our place.

442
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:46,479
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

443
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:48,273
and put it on our doorstep.

444
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:51,693
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

445
00:39:51,717 --> 00:39:54,654
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

446
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:56,906
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

447
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,765
I have to go.

448
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:20,202
Claire!

449
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,456
Hello?

450
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:29,606
Mmm, Babadook...

451
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,716
...dook... dook.

452
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,036
Hi.

453
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,998
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

454
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:48,333
Can you tell us what happened?

455
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:51,317
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

456
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:55,381
And?

457
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:58,551
And it contained violent
and graphic images

458
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,595
of my child and me
being murdered.

459
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:02,597
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

460
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:04,849
I burnt it.

461
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:07,560
You burnt it?

462
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,686
Yes.

463
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,212
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

464
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:16,861
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

465
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:18,154
What's he been saying?

466
00:41:18,178 --> 00:41:21,824
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

467
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,660
How do you know
it's the same person?

468
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:26,120
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

469
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:27,872
The book you burnt?

470
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:30,064
Yes.

471
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:47,540
OK.

472
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:51,127
Don't worry about it.

473
00:42:00,804 --> 00:42:02,907
Did you get your things done?

474
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:05,076
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

475
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,869
That's why she shakes like this.

476
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,621
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

477
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:09,872
that goes through your head.

478
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:12,458
Oh, it's alright, love.

479
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:17,463
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

480
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:20,133
He sees things as they are,
that one.

481
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:21,843
Oskar was the same.

482
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:23,553
He always spoke his mind.

483
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:26,454
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

484
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:33,938
Hey, Bugsy.

485
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:36,983
Hey.

486
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:39,383
Hey!

487
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:56,233
Eugh!

488
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,451
Don't come in here.

489
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,276
I don't want to buy anything.

490
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,362
Are you Amelia Vanick?

491
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:05,404
Yes.

492
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:07,990
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

493
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:09,784
from the Department of
Community Services.

494
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:11,828
My son's only been
away for two days.

495
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:15,373
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

496
00:44:15,397 --> 00:44:17,583
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

497
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:19,688
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

498
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:24,257
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

499
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:25,842
at the moment.

500
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:29,827
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

501
00:44:32,455 --> 00:44:34,809
Hello, Samuel.

502
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:38,836
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

503
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:41,858
How are you?

504
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:45,570
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

505
00:44:45,594 --> 00:44:49,657
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

506
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:51,534
He had a fit yesterday.

507
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,954
I'm really tired, actually.

508
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:56,687
That's no good.

509
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,711
May I have a glass of water,
please?

510
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:06,071
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

511
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:14,932
It's a real mess.

512
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:17,351
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

513
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,895
I normally have
the house sprayed.

514
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,771
I did actually already
have it sprayed

515
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:23,608
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

516
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:25,299
and that's why I...

517
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:32,783
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

518
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:35,286
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

519
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,580
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

520
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:39,772
We've caught you
at a bad time.

521
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,752
I'll leave you with this.

522
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:45,379
We're required
to come back in a week

523
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:47,173
to talk through your options.

524
00:45:47,197 --> 00:45:49,406
Here's my card.

525
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:55,371
Mum,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

526
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:17,411
What was
that noise I heard?

527
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:20,289
I didn't hear any noise.

528
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:22,583
Wind howling,
doors slamming.

529
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:25,567
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

530
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:29,840
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

531
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:31,842
Are you sick?

532
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:33,158
Oh, no, Granny.

533
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:36,847
It's only 6:00.

534
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,600
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

535
00:46:39,624 --> 00:46:41,060
No.

536
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:44,128
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

537
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,301
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

538
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:08,254
Where's its mother,
Skip?

539
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:09,839
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

540
00:47:09,863 --> 00:47:11,882
Are you off now, Dad?

541
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:13,592
Yep.
Soon as I fuel up.

542
00:47:13,616 --> 00:47:15,553
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

543
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:17,818
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

544
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:21,600
"And the Prince
and the Princess

545
00:47:21,624 --> 00:47:24,562
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

546
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:27,087
"for the rest of their days."

547
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:13,546
Babadook...

548
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,531
...dook... dook.

549
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,462
What are we doing?

550
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,297
We're going downstairs.

551
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:58,697
- Why?
- Because we are.

552
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:20,446
Iris, Iris, Iris.

553
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,304
No.

554
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:13,707
Glass and mirror attachment.

555
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,709
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

556
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:17,253
for a streak-free shine.

557
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,629
As part of
your steaming special,

558
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:20,464
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

559
00:51:20,488 --> 00:51:23,991
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

560
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:28,764
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

561
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:30,122
That's just what I need.

562
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:33,394
I can't help it if I'm sick.

563
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:34,835
What do you expect me to do?

564
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:37,629
You do that!

565
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:56,857
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

566
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:01,319
I need to eat something.

567
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,161
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

568
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:14,226
You said to have them with food.

569
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,188
I'm really hungry, Mum.

570
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:22,318
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

571
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,278
Don't you ever stop?

572
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:27,906
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

573
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,410
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

574
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:35,687
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

575
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:10,866
I'm so sorry.

576
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,059
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

577
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:18,916
I've had absolutely no sleep.

578
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,316
I didn't know what I was saying.

579
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:25,070
I'll cook you something. Hey?

580
00:53:26,406 --> 00:53:27,716
What would you like?

581
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,699
I'm not hungry anymore.

582
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:38,644
We really need to get
out of this house.

583
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:41,128
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

584
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,843
Do you want to go to Wally's?

585
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,490
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

586
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:55,225
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

587
00:53:57,603 --> 00:54:00,749
Give it back!

588
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:04,837
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

589
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:06,797
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

590
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:08,238
Sit down, please.

591
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:15,681
Where are we going?

592
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:18,790
I just want to drive
for a little while.

593
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:32,823
Aarggh!

594
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:34,848
Mummy! Mummy!

595
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:39,436
Babadook.

596
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,759
You ran straight into me!

597
00:54:51,783 --> 00:54:56,161
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

598
00:54:57,455 --> 00:55:00,017
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

599
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:01,977
You could've killed someone!

600
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:04,730
Hey!

601
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:05,773
Hey, what are you doing?

602
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:07,756
Hey! Crazy bitch!

603
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,932
Hi, sweetheart.

604
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:26,650
Mum?

605
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,570
I can call Aunty Claire.

606
00:55:33,491 --> 00:55:36,534
I can call
and she can come over.

607
00:55:39,956 --> 00:55:41,391
Mum?

608
00:55:41,415 --> 00:55:46,002
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

609
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:50,757
Mum. Mum, look at me.

610
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:19,619
It's nice and warm in here.

611
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,375
I don't want you to go away.

612
00:56:27,545 --> 00:56:29,754
I'm not going anywhere.

613
00:56:42,143 --> 00:56:43,560
Mum?

614
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:55,447
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

615
00:56:56,782 --> 00:56:58,927
I can call Mrs Roach.

616
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:02,787
I don't want you to call anyone.

617
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,251
I just need to sleep.

618
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:14,549
- Mum...
- Leave it!

619
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:47,957
There's something
in the house.

620
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,516
There's someone in the house!

621
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:01,550
Mrs Roach...

622
00:59:01,574 --> 00:59:03,658
...can we come and stay
the night?

623
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,063
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

624
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:17,482
Has someone
broken into the house?

625
00:59:17,506 --> 00:59:20,569
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

626
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:22,487
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

627
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:24,781
Oh, I was so worried.

628
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:26,324
I told him not to call anyone.

629
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:28,243
He asked
if you could stay the night.

630
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:31,079
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

631
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:33,104
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

632
00:59:34,648 --> 00:59:36,209
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

633
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:37,794
Yes. Talk soon.

634
00:59:37,818 --> 00:59:39,360
No worries. Talk soon.

635
00:59:41,947 --> 00:59:44,468
I told you not to call anyone

636
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:46,451
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

637
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,806
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

638
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,017
An old lady who can hardly walk?

639
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:53,583
Do you want to make her sick?

640
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:57,629
Get that bloody thing off!

641
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:06,865
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

642
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:08,389
in front of our neighbours?

643
01:00:13,104 --> 01:00:14,687
Is this what I have to do?

644
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:27,469
I'm sorry, Mummy.

645
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:29,721
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

646
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,723
What'd you say?

647
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:33,391
I said the Babadook...

648
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:35,018
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

649
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:38,855
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

650
01:00:38,879 --> 01:00:41,399
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

651
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:45,112
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

652
01:00:45,136 --> 01:00:46,696
Alright, Samuel?

653
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,241
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

654
01:00:49,265 --> 01:00:50,807
Nothing!

655
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:30,448
I feel sick.

656
01:01:30,472 --> 01:01:34,828
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

657
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:36,454
Mum, I don't think I need...

658
01:01:36,478 --> 01:01:39,522
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

659
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:05,214
Good boy.

660
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:29,238
Mum!

661
01:02:46,423 --> 01:02:49,967
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

662
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:54,514
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

663
01:02:55,766 --> 01:02:57,058
Hey.

664
01:02:58,227 --> 01:02:59,769
Hey!

665
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,417
Here we go.

666
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:30,466
There's more
where that came from.

667
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:49,045
Aarggh!

668
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:50,319
What's the secret?

669
01:03:52,906 --> 01:03:54,592
...letter of Max's, didn't you?

670
01:03:54,616 --> 01:03:56,136
No, not for a minute.

671
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,013
Don't lie.
You called me a Jezebel. Why?

672
01:03:58,037 --> 01:04:00,223
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

673
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:01,706
With fresh meat.

674
01:04:04,043 --> 01:04:06,938
Only five...

675
01:04:06,962 --> 01:04:09,380
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

676
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:13,653
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

677
01:04:13,677 --> 01:04:15,238
to stab her son.

678
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:17,407
His body was found
in their basement.

679
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:20,160
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

680
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:24,414
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

681
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:26,374
Little is known about the tragedy

682
01:04:26,398 --> 01:04:30,337
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

683
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:32,779
He had just turned seven.

684
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:48,753
Samuel?

685
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,592
Wake up, Mummy.

686
01:04:57,554 --> 01:05:00,807
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

687
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:08,105
Don't go down there.

688
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,529
It's not safe.

689
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,569
Ohh... I thought you were dead.

690
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:58,239
I thought you were dead.

691
01:06:12,713 --> 01:06:14,755
We're gonna be together.

692
01:06:17,384 --> 01:06:19,760
You just need to bring me
the boy.

693
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:44,637
You mean Samuel?

694
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:46,954
You can bring me the boy.

695
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,208
You can bring me the boy.

696
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:54,856
You can bring me the boy.

697
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,274
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

698
01:06:56,298 --> 01:06:58,485
I think it's going to rain.

699
01:06:58,509 --> 01:06:59,926
No.

700
01:08:31,852 --> 01:08:34,979
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

701
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,368
Oh, no.

702
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,709
No! No!

703
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,260
Bugsy!

704
01:10:58,039 --> 01:10:59,790
Samuel!

705
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:06,714
Samuel.

706
01:11:08,508 --> 01:11:12,720
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

707
01:11:15,307 --> 01:11:17,766
You don't want him to die,
do you?

708
01:11:21,772 --> 01:11:23,541
Samuel.

709
01:11:23,565 --> 01:11:26,609
Are you listening to me?

710
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:32,967
Let me in, you little shit!

711
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:35,428
Let me in!

712
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:36,721
Let me in!

713
01:11:36,745 --> 01:11:38,264
Let me in!

714
01:11:38,288 --> 01:11:41,248
Let me in!

715
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:05,792
You little pig!

716
01:12:05,816 --> 01:12:09,629
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

717
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:11,798
You don't know how many times

718
01:12:11,822 --> 01:12:15,718
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

719
01:12:15,742 --> 01:12:17,470
I just want you to be happy.

720
01:12:17,494 --> 01:12:20,621
"I just
want you to be happy."

721
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:25,478
Sometimes...

722
01:12:25,502 --> 01:12:29,315
...I just wanna smash
your head against a brick wall

723
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:32,568
until your fucking brains
pop out.

724
01:12:32,592 --> 01:12:34,654
You're not my mother.

725
01:12:34,678 --> 01:12:36,239
What did you say?

726
01:12:36,263 --> 01:12:38,866
I said
you're not my mother!

727
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:42,434
I am your mother!

728
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:48,065
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

729
01:12:51,444 --> 01:12:52,797
Get away!

730
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:54,738
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

731
01:13:43,747 --> 01:13:46,726
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

732
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,895
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

733
01:13:48,919 --> 01:13:51,898
I'm OK.

734
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:57,820
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

735
01:13:57,844 --> 01:14:02,116
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

736
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,243
But I just wanted you to know

737
01:14:04,267 --> 01:14:07,330
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

738
01:14:07,354 --> 01:14:09,396
I love you both.

739
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:14,443
Samuel.

740
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,989
I'm sorry.

741
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,804
I understand you're scared.

742
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:27,808
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

743
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:30,918
I haven't been good at all.

744
01:14:33,713 --> 01:14:37,216
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

745
01:14:41,471 --> 01:14:44,223
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

746
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:49,580
We're going to
stay there tonight.

747
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:52,523
Do you want that?

748
01:14:56,987 --> 01:15:00,072
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

749
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:13,252
I want you to meet your dad.

750
01:15:15,046 --> 01:15:17,589
It's beautiful there.

751
01:15:19,217 --> 01:15:21,802
You'll be happy.

752
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:30,102
Sorry, Mummy!

753
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:20,671
Mum!

754
01:16:20,695 --> 01:16:23,340
Mum!

755
01:16:23,364 --> 01:16:25,574
I'm not leaving you.

756
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:31,413
Mum? Mum?

757
01:16:38,338 --> 01:16:41,298
You said
we'd protect each other.

758
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:49,431
I know you don't love me.

759
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:53,079
The Babadook won't let you.

760
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:55,437
But I love you, Mum.

761
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:59,233
And I always will.

762
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:12,913
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

763
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,814
I don't want you to go away.

764
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:21,398
No! No! No!

765
01:17:21,422 --> 01:17:23,590
Mummy!

766
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:15,161
Mummy!

767
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:17,246
Mummy!

768
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,206
Mummy!

769
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,667
Mummy! Mummy!

770
01:18:21,691 --> 01:18:23,836
Mummy!

771
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,444
Mummy!

772
01:19:03,316 --> 01:19:04,710
What is it?

773
01:19:04,734 --> 01:19:06,568
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

774
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,308
What do you want?

775
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:43,647
What do you want?

776
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:23,247
No.

777
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:26,273
Keep breathing.

778
01:20:29,527 --> 01:20:32,696
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

779
01:20:37,076 --> 01:20:39,119
No.

780
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:45,311
I think it's gonna rain.

781
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:47,335
Stop!

782
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:37,803
You are nothing.

783
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:51,525
You're nothing!

784
01:22:00,952 --> 01:22:03,495
This is my house!

785
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:11,002
You are trespassing in my house!

786
01:22:20,638 --> 01:22:25,475
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

787
01:22:34,235 --> 01:22:36,403
No!

788
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:21,406
Mummy, don't!

789
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,664
Don't!

790
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:18,333
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

791
01:25:18,357 --> 01:25:20,335
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

792
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:22,170
What time's the party?

793
01:25:22,194 --> 01:25:23,505
Any time after three is fine.

794
01:25:23,529 --> 01:25:25,424
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

795
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:27,009
Bye.

796
01:25:27,033 --> 01:25:28,802
Bye, Sam.

797
01:25:28,826 --> 01:25:31,179
That school's
a good choice.

798
01:25:31,203 --> 01:25:33,348
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

799
01:25:33,372 --> 01:25:35,058
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

800
01:25:35,082 --> 01:25:36,768
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

801
01:25:36,792 --> 01:25:38,812
It's time to get back.

802
01:25:38,836 --> 01:25:42,255
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

803
01:25:43,591 --> 01:25:45,402
Are you having a party?

804
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:47,154
It's Sam's birthday today.

805
01:25:47,178 --> 01:25:50,490
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

806
01:25:50,514 --> 01:25:51,992
That's not true.

807
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:54,620
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

808
01:25:54,644 --> 01:25:56,936
That's unusual.

809
01:25:59,357 --> 01:26:02,753
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

810
01:26:02,777 --> 01:26:06,029
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

811
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:10,218
Sam's just like his dad was.

812
01:26:10,242 --> 01:26:12,346
Always speaks his mind.

813
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:16,683
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

814
01:26:16,707 --> 01:26:21,503
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

815
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:25,882
I'll take that for you.

816
01:26:45,403 --> 01:26:46,755
Good shot.

817
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:49,049
Look, there's another one!

818
01:26:49,073 --> 01:26:51,157
Where's your bowl?

819
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,330
Wow. You've got a lot today.

820
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:00,977
Am I ever gonna see it?

821
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:04,420
One day, when you're bigger.

822
01:27:10,136 --> 01:27:14,264
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

823
01:27:58,893 --> 01:28:01,079
It's alright.

824
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:02,789
It's alright.

825
01:28:02,813 --> 01:28:04,856
It's alright.

826
01:28:39,308 --> 01:28:40,994
How was it?

827
01:28:41,018 --> 01:28:43,519
It was pretty quiet today.

828
01:28:45,564 --> 01:28:47,148
Come here.

829
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,738
It's getting much better, Mum.

830
01:28:57,618 --> 01:28:58,970
Wait!

831
01:28:58,994 --> 01:29:01,120
I have a new trick.

832
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:07,562
Life is not always as it seems.

833
01:29:07,586 --> 01:29:10,546
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

834
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:18,596
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

835
01:29:28,107 --> 01:29:31,317
Abracadabra!

836
01:29:33,821 --> 01:29:35,613
How did you do that?

837
01:29:40,911 --> 01:29:42,681
Come here, you.

838
01:29:42,705 --> 01:29:43,913
Come here.

839
01:29:54,383 --> 01:29:56,968
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
