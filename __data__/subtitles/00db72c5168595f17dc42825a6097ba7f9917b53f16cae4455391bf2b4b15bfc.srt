Come in if you dare.

6
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,201
The living.

7
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,724
The dead.

8
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,856
Can they coexist?

9
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,032
That's what
we're here to find out.

10
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,688
<i>My name is Lydia Deetz,
and welcome to Ghost House.</i>

11
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,390
Joining us in the attic tonight

12
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:40,045
are Emmet and Jody Welch,
from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.

13
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,266
- Along with their dog, Taco.

14
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,746
And we're gonna hear about how

15
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,793
their dream home
became a ghost house.

16
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,798
I've been a psychic mediator
for over 15 years.

17
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,496
But nothing
could have prepared me

18
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,367
for what I encountered
when I visited

19
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,629
the Welch farm.

20
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,153
- Here's a preview.

21
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,286
Be warned,

22
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,374
it's intense.

23
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,945
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna
find behind this door,</i>

24
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:13,340
<i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>

25
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,142
I feel a dark presence.

26
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,057
- We need to leave! Now!

27
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:42,238
Emmet, are you ready to hear
about your paranormal visitors?

28
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:43,326
Bring it on.

29
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,980
How about you, Jody?

30
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,590
Haven't slept a wink

31
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,158
since we moved
into that darned house.

32
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:52,466
Taco was so freaked out,
he goes to the bathroom

33
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,990
in his doggy bed every night.

34
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,122
It's been a living nightmare.

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,475
Confronting the unknown.
Conquering your fears.

36
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,433
There's nothing harder.

37
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,826
But don't worry.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,306
I'll be right by your...

39
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,658
What the...

40
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:11,876
No.

41
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,966
- No, no.

42
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,098
What's going on?

43
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,579
- I don't know.
- Go!

44
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,537
No. No.

45
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,496
- Uh...
- You're doing great.

46
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,672
I'm...

47
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,239
- Need a break?

48
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,198
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's take a break.

49
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,201
Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!

50
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,768
- Bravo.

51
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,814
I need five. Make it happen.

52
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,730
Okay, everybody, that's lunch!

53
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,613
I told him
he needed to wear contacts.

54
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,659
But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician
wouldn't listen.

55
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,400
Oh, can you
give it a rest, Nadia?

56
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,315
I'm having a really shitty day.

57
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,796
- Hmm?

58
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,495
What happened out there?

59
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,411
You okay?

60
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,152
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,241
It's these double taping days,

62
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,548
- it can get to me.
- Oh, God.

63
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,941
Kills me to see you
feeling like this.

64
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,508
Because when
you're feeling like this,

65
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:19,553
it just makes me
feel what you're feeling.

66
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:20,989
So in a weird way it's like,

67
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,773
when you're hurting,
it's hurting me.

68
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,123
- I don't know.
- God, I'm sorry.

69
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,995
I... I don't mean to make you
feel like that.

70
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,301
Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.

71
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,216
If anything, it just shows
how connected we are.

72
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,699
It's like we got the same
stupid little heart.

73
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
No. You don't need these.

74
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,538
Oh.

75
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,454
I have one job, and that is

76
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,500
to make sure that you do not
drown your talents

77
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,197
at the bottom
of a bottle of pills, Lydia.

78
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,721
Please...

79
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,375
just to get through today.

80
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:05,250
Okay. But...

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,991
this is the last time

82
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,689
that I ever dig pills
out of a trash can for you.

83
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,039
Do you understand?
Or a toilet or sink.

84
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,563
Here.

85
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,220
Okay? You got this.

86
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,395
- All right?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:26,141
- Is that mine?
- Don't move.

88
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,143
Who's texting me?

89
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,797
Your stupid stepmother.

90
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,321
She's got texting diarrhea.

91
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,411
I have to go.

92
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,152
Lydia...

93
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,980
we still have
a segment to finish.

94
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,601
<i>Tell us about</i>

95
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,473
<i>the inspiration
for The Human Canvas.</i>

96
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,822
<i>I am my own canvas.</i>

97
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,302
<i>I am my art.</i>

98
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
<i>As we know,
art imitates the living.</i>

99
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,177
<i>It feeds me.</i>

100
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,614
<i>And I was not getting
enough nourishment</i>

101
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,616
<i>from the sculpture alone.</i>

102
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,445
<i>So, I decided
to broaden my tastes</i>

103
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,578
<i>and it turns out
I am insatiably...</i>

104
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,753
Delia!

105
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,363
Where have you been?

106
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,104
I think I've cried all
the water out of my body.

107
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,758
What happened to Dad?

108
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,195
<i>- I'm desolee, Le Tigre!
</i>

109
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,589
He is the Picasso
of graffiti artists.

110
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,939
He was tagging me like
the walls of the Paris Métro.

111
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,897
<i>But now he's having
a petite tantrum</i>

112
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,551
because I had to cancel
the performance.

113
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,031
What happened?

114
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,207
What? Oh.

115
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,906
Your father's left me.

116
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,342
He's divorcing you?

117
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,736
What a horrible thought.

118
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,998
No! He's dead!

119
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,566
What?

120
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,176
Daddy's passed away.

121
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:48,919
How?

122
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,705
He was returning

123
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,228
from his bird-watching
expedition

124
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:54,664
to the Funafuti Atoll...

125
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,233
<i>...when his plane
went down</i>

126
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,669
<i>in the South Pacific.</i>

127
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,849
A plane crash?

128
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,420
<i>That was
his worst nightmare.</i>

129
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:14,902
Actually,
he survived the crash.

130
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,078
- He drowned?
- Almost.

131
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,559
But not quite, no.
According to survivors,

132
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,777
Daddy clung onto a wing.

133
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,867
- Over here!
- Come on!

134
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,174
Hey, swim over!
Swim over!

135
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,349
Hey!

136
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,004
So, how did he die?

137
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,701
A shark jumped out of the water

138
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,702
<i>- and got him!
</i>

139
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,139
Just like that.

140
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,621
I just spoke to him
on Saturday.

141
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,014
He was so excited,

142
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,146
he thanked me
for the binoculars,

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,453
he said he had observed
the mating rituals

144
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,194
of the Tuamotu sandpiper.

145
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,196
Yes, he flew halfway
around the world

146
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,763
to watch birds
do it on a beach.

147
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:50,894
And it killed him!

148
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,506
We need to tell Astrid.

149
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,248
Oh. Must we?

150
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,989
She's already
such a morbid little thing.

151
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,425
That's if I can even reach her.

152
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,645
We're barely on speaking terms.

153
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,994
Oh, it would kill Charles
to know

154
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,431
I had to cancel my show.

155
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>

156
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,044
What'd he say?

157
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,531
Did you see that?

158
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,167
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>

159
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,344
Where am I?

160
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,913
Down the hall,
second door on the right.

161
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,654
Take a number.

162
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,177
Someone will help you.

163
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:58,832
Eventually.

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,575

181
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:45,563
You're not supposed
to be back here.

182
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,697
Don't make me tell you twice.

183
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,877
Where is Beetlejuice?

184
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:20,076
- Ugh.

185
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,746
Ghost House!

186
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,878
When you're all
on your third kid

187
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,880
and second divorce,

188
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,272
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

189
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,107
Perfect.

190
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,244
- Leave me alone.

191
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,781
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

192
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,304
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

193
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,479
- I've never hosted anything

194
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,177
without Charles standing there.

195
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,092
Watching me. In awe.

196
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>It's Astrid.</i>

197
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,399
<i>- Please don't leave a message.
- She won't pick up.</i>

198
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,575
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

199
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,838
Might be easier coming from

200
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,449
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

201
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,147
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

202
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,584
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

203
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,412
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

204
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,241
In fact,

205
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,764
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

206
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,071
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

207
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,030
You did? When?

208
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,901
Forty years ago.

209
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:49,296
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

210
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

211
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,342
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

212
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,040
Enough!
I'll handle this.

213
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:57,608
Astrid!

214
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:00,785
Astrid!

215
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:02,831
Astrid!

216
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,966
Stop torturing your mother.

217
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,968
I know I usually find it funny,

218
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,534
and only fair
after the way she treated me

219
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,927
- when she was your age.

220
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,537
But not today!

221
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,324
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

222
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,716
You've lost your grandpa.

223
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,502
And I've lost my...

224
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,025
horny handyman.

225
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,245
Charles.

226
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,638
Charles!

227
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,120
Oh, Charles!

228
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,691
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

229
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,867
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

230
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,043
We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

231
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,653
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

232
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,090
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

233
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:45,482
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

234
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,049
Grandpa loved that place.

235
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,659
Yes, and we are going
to honor him

236
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,705
with a Grief Collective.

237
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,663
A "Grief Collective"?

238
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:57,973
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

239
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,453
What does loss look like?

240
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:02,325
Is it just tears? A headstone?

241
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:03,848
Wilting gladioli?

242
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,243
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

243
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,986
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

244
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,118
I can't go.

245
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,902
I'm our school rep

246
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,686
for our Student Environmental
Conference next week.

247
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,384
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

248
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,603
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

249
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,997
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

250
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,912
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

251
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,696
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

252
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,091
Well, you're free
to reject your inheritance

253
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,311
when you're living high
off a tree hugger's salary.

254
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,230
What? No! No!

255
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:41,408
Jesus! Okay,
people already know

256
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,192
that Lydia Deetz is my mom.

257
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,195
Okay, can you stop being
a freak for, like, one second?

258
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,719
- Go back.
- Why?

259
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,330
All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

260
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,071
more time with ghosts
than your own daughter.

261
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,757
Jesus, Bob.

262
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,585
Can't you see
I'm concentrating here?

263
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,805
You know, Bob,

264
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,199
long distance relationships
can be difficult.

265
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,939
Especially when
one of you is dead

266
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,506
and the other's ignoring you
for 30 years.

267
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,986
But Lydia and I,

268
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,901
we have a definite
psychic connection.

269
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,511
<i>I just need
these people out of my house.</i>

270
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,253
Please hold! Afterlife
Call Center, please hold.

271
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,516
<i>How much
for a premium bio exorcism?</i>

272
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,952
And I'll tell ya something,

273
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,650
she definitely saw me
that last time.

274
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,522
I felt a little tingle.

275
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:53,915
<i>The money back
guarantee one.</i>

276
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,917
I'm putting your call
through now.

277
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,136
<i>I've just died,
and she's already remarried.</i>

278
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,007
Sell him the honeymoon package.

279
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,487
I'll kill the new husband,
and I'll possess the ex-wife.

280
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,097
I'll make her
do some unseemly things,

281
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,664
- and then I'll post the pics.

282
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,100
<i>Can I pay
in installments?</i>

283
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,063
I'm needed upstairs.

284
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,370
- Bob, hold down the fort.

285
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,728
<i>Ou je suis?</i>

286
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,077
- Where am I?
-Take a number,

287
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:27,166
- take a seat.

288
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,613
I'm more of a dog person.

289
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,137
You! Room 515. Now.

290
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,144
- Come on.
- Come on.

291
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:50,493
Hey,
easy with the suit.

292
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,494
Don't "Detective" me,

293
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,930
you walking disaster.

294
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,497
- We got reports.
- Another protestor.

295
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:55,890
<i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>

296
00:19:56,064 --> 00:20:00,024
Wolf Jackson,
Afterlife Crime Unit.

297
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,201
Let me take a wild stab.

298
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:03,724
Actor.

299
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:06,117
Not just any actor.

300
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,425
I've done it all.
For six movies and a reboot,

301
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,732
I became Frank Hardballer.

302
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,125
Doing my own stunts
was non-negotiable.

303
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,953
- You know why?
- Authenticity.

304
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,520
Correct.

305
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,957
A vice cop doesn't
get to a perp's door

306
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:23,396
and then call for some hambone
stunt man to break it down.

307
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,136
Neither did I.

308
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,834
You gotta keep it real.

309
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,488
Looks like you got a little
too real there, bud.

310
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,187
Who knew it was a live grenade?

311
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,189
Your name came up

312
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,670
on this case I'm investigating.

313
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,893
Recognize this puss?

314
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,723
Never seen that chick
before in my life.

315
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:47,942
Or afterlife.

316
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,688
-Any idea

317
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,516
why my suspect wrote your name

318
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,431
in this schmo's goo?

319
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:02,261
Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,
but could be a super-fan.

320
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,001
You know,
guys like you and me...

321
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,134
- ...we drive the gals crazy.

322
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,092
She collected
all her body parts.

323
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,444
My hunch
is she's out for revenge.

324
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:14,838
<i>And you seem to be numero uno
on her hit list.</i>

325
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,100
Well, wouldn't be
the first woman

326
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,450
who wanted to kill me.

327
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,495
And kinda hard
to kill a dead guy.

328
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:20,801
This gal can.

329
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:22,585
She's a soul sucker.

330
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,326
Oh, yeah,
you could say that again.

331
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,461
My advice, lay low.

332
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,377
She gets her hands on you
and you're dead-dead.

333
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:34,249
And there's no coming back
from that, Mr. Juice.

334
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,511
Roger that.

I won't see Charles again.

346
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,307
Be comforted in the knowledge

347
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,701
that he's in
a far better place.

348
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,138
Angels are guiding him
towards everlasting light

349
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,749
and may his soul fly through
the heavenly gates,

350
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,664
like the birds
that he so adored

351
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,449
and soar over
the Fields of Elysium

352
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,189
to the glory that is thine.

353
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,191
What?

354
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,158
I haven't been to a funeral
since Dad's.

355
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,378
Death is hard.

356
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:02,990
Yeah, sometimes
I think life is harder.

357
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,253
I know.

358
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,171
Listen, if you wanna talk
to that therapist again...

359
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,346
There you go again.

360
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,696
You just sidestep

361
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,002
every possible
conversation about him.

362
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:16,960
Astrid...

363
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,398
I loved your father,

364
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,704
but our relationship was over

365
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,619
a long time
before the accident.

366
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,014
I still don't understand
why you can't see him.

367
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:32,802
- Why not?
- I wish I knew.

368
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,196
But this ability

369
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,111
didn't exactly
come with instructions.

370
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,462
It all started
when I was your age.

371
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,333
It's ironic, isn't it?

372
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:43,813
You can apparently
see any random ghost

373
00:23:43,987 --> 00:23:45,467
for your shitty TV show,

374
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,468
but the one ghost
that actually matters to me

375
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:47,991
you can't see at all.

376
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,796
We are closed!

377
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,625
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Charles Deetz.

378
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,757
I'm feeling
a little lightheaded.

379
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,019
Where am I?

380
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,717
Damn newbies.

381
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,023
You wait! In waiting room!

382
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:22,939
All right.

383
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,159
- Unbelievable.

384
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,517
Hey...

385
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,997
- who's there?

386
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:35,055
- My ex-wife is back.
- Hmm?

387
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,231
Well, I know
what you're thinking...

388
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:40,713
"When was the Juice
ever tied down?

389
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:44,151
What kind of woman could ever
keep him satisfied?" Well...

390
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,128
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

391
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:01,114
Now she's back,

392
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:02,419
and she's pissed.

393
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,668
Hey.

394
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,716
Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

395
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,109
In here, too.

396
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,548
Listen, if you ever
need to process

397
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,550
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

398
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,818
Emotions processed. Thanks.

399
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,516
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

400
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,301
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

401
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:02,653
Death is so, like...

402
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,746
It's, like, tragic,
you know?

403
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,966
I mean, if you ever wanna,
you know, cry or just,

404
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,533
kind of rage against
some of these feelings

405
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,404
that you have going on
in there,

406
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,710
I want you to know

407
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,017
that I could be that...

408
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:21,150
kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

409
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:24,719
- I'm good.
- You know,

410
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:25,720
times like this
can bring a family

411
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,896
weirdly closer together.

412
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,463
On the way over here,

413
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,117
I wrote a poem
for your grandpa.

414
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,510
Oh, did you? How does it go?

415
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,253
It's, it's, it's...

416
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,951
it starts...

417
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,692
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

418
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,478
And then acceptance.

419
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,654
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

420
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,351
but it's quite beautiful.

421
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,179
Cut the crap, Rory.

422
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,225
All right? I'm not falling
for your New Age,

423
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,096
overly emotional,
trauma bonding,

424
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,619
yoga retreat bullshit.

425
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,317
I see you.

426
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,493
Because, like you,

427
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,496
my mom is a very broken person.

428
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,324
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

429
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,717
You just exploit her.

430
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:07,849
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

431
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:08,981
that's on her.

432
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,644
I'm so sorry
for your loss. I'm sorry.

433
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,125
I know, I know. Thank you.

434
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:26,302
Oh, if it isn't
little Jane Butterfield.

435
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,869
Littler Jane?

436
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,262
Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee
now.

437
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:30,567
We hyphenated.

438
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:31,742
Is that Maxie Dean?

439
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,136
No.

440
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,572
No one's here yet.

441
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,620
Sample from
my hubby's microbrewery.

442
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:43,102
"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

443
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,453
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

444
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,542
It's a mourning shroud.

445
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:51,501
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

446
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,287
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

447
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,159
To a new life
with a new family.

448
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,682
I can't wait to show it.

449
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,293
Buyers are already lining up.

450
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,034
Thanks to you, Lydia,

451
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,210
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

452
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,864
Ghosts aren't real.

453
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,214
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

454
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,780
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

455
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,695
Okay, honey, in we go.

456
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,873
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

457
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:15,917
What?

458
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,484
We're gathered here today

459
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,009
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

460
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:22,228
Now, I only had the pleasure

461
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:23,925
of meeting Charles a few times.

462
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,232
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

463
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,887
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

464
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:32,194
Yeah, but he also...

465
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:34,327
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

466
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,504
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

467
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,332
Lydia,

468
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:40,550
now, I know
we had always agreed

469
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,638
to take
our relationship slowly.

470
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,249
But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:46,121
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

472
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,123
Will you marry me on Halloween?

473
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,516
- Good Lord!
- Uh...

474
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,127
That's... That's in two days!

475
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,607
Yes, I know.

476
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:54,521
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

477
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,088
The church is available.

478
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,393
The Lord's sanctuary
welcomes all who seek

479
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,134
salvation
and everlasting glory.

480
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,181
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

481
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,661
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

482
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:08,535
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

483
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,842
because as we stand here,

484
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,844
- surrounded by death...

485
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,325
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

486
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:17,761
Because I want to spend

487
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,849
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

488
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:21,678
And you, Delia.

489
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:24,986
And you too.

490
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,727
And you. Again.

491
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:28,511
What do you say?

492
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,384
Rory, I... Come on,

493
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,603
I can't commit to this
right now.

494
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,738
Oh.

495
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,740
All right.

496
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,353
This is too much loss.

497
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:45,746
What do you mean?

498
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,313
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

499
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,836
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

500
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,403
which you know about.
And now the death of...

501
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,494
- us.
- No! No, I...

502
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,322
Come on, I didn't mean that.

503
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,888
Thought you wanted to take
life's great big bungee jump

504
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:58,977
right beside me.

505
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,891
No safety nets, right?

506
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,415
- But I guess,

507
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,373
the only thing
bungee jumping today is love.

508
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,985
- And that cord just snapped.

509
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,943
Come on. Rory...

510
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:11,163
- I love you.
- And I love you.

511
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,167
Oh.

512
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,559
What are we waiting for?

513
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,998
Okay, I guess.

514
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,567
Oh, my God.

515
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:29,790
She said "yes"!

516
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
She said "yes"!

517
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,883

- Sorry!

532
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,797
Whoa.

533
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:07,801
Are you okay?

534
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,940
Are you okay?
What happened?

535
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,987
Yeah. I'll live.

536
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,511
Uh, what are you reading?

537
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,384
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

538
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,125
- One of those.
-"One of those"?

539
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,735
What does that mean?

540
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,780
Nothing.
I've read it three times.

541
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,218
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

542
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,915
"Pain and suffering
are always inevitable."

543
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:35,916
Yes.

544
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,831
Yeah, I...

545
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,182
I can't believe you're quoting
Dostoevsky. That's...

546
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:42,749
Where have you been
all my life?

547
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,495
So, how long have
you been in Winter River?

548
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:50,844
My whole life.

549
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,541
I've never seen you
around before.

550
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,195
Yeah, this is just
a temporary layover

551
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,675
for my grandpa's funeral.

552
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,504
Until my mom's janky fiance

553
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,984
turned it into
a de facto engagement party.

554
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,377
Yeah, he announced
their wedding date.

555
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,338
Wow. That's different.

556
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:07,687
Oh, yeah.
If you knew my mom,

557
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,167
that's actually
pretty on-brand for her.

558
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,170
Is your dad
in the picture or...

559
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,520
No.

560
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,262
Yeah, he was a free spirit.

561
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,047
Defender of hopeless causes.

562
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,354
When they split,
he went to Brazil.

563
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,877
He was trying
to save the rainforest.

564
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,706
But my mom grew up here.

565
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,360
That old house on the hill.

566
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,753
Wait. The Ghost House?

567
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,234
Is your mom Lydia Deetz?

568
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,062
Unfortunately.

569
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,759
She's a legend.

570
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,848
Well, yeah, if you believe
in supernatural bullshit.

571
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:40,763
You don't?

572
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,027
- No.
- Mmm-hmm.

573
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,681
I only believe in things
that I can see.

574
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,466
You know, science. Facts.

575
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,470
Oh.

576
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,472
- Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

577
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,952
Back to the insanity.

578
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,216
I'm sorry about your fence,
by the way.

579
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,826
You can tell your parents
my mom will pay for that.

580
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,176
Nah, that's okay. It's...
They won't even notice.

581
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:07,747
Uh... Well, listen,
I'll be here tomorrow,

582
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:11,446
if you want a break
from the insanity.

583
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,134
Witness confirmed our suspect

584
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,179
as the soul sucker
from Lost and Found.

585
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,224
Wanna hear
the weird part, chief?

586
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:51,704
Hit me.

587
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:52,748
After she turned the owner

588
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,837
into a human pancake,

589
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,665
she stole a wedding dress
from the conveyor.

590
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,364
Of course.
This stapled sicko...

591
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,800
has her twisted heart set

592
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:04,456
on a romantic reunion
with Mr. Juice.

593
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,066
She won't stop killing,

594
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,069
until she walks him
back down the aisle.

595
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:15,249
Cases like this make me wonder
why I even became a cop.

596
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,732
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

597
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:21,647
Thank you, Janet.

598
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,171
You keep me real.

599
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,390
Should we take
this Beetlejuice

600
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:26,739
into protective custody?

601
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,088
See if you can find him.

602
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,568
He's probably laying low.

603
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,787
Scared out of his mind.

604
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,665
A little higher, boys.

605
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,667
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

606
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,328
Bob.

607
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,503
Like lookin' in a mirror.

608
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,158
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

609
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,943
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

610
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,120
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

611
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:02,992
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

612
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,832
Now's my chance.

613
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:30,455
What?

614
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,108
- Why?

615
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,633
No! No! No!

616
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,330
Delia, what's wrong?

617
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:37,897
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

618
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,551
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

619
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,857
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

620
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,685
- Why?
- For the Collective.

621
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,774
We cannot sincerely celebrate

622
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,342
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

623
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,344
Not until we release the horror

624
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:51,954
that they inflicted upon us.

625
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,392
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

626
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,090
He bought this house
without telling me.

627
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,138
Oh, my God!

628
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,923
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

629
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:05,533
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

630
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,405
It was Delia.

631
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,928
Oh, Delia.

632
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm good.

633
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,366
Ignore her.

634
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,063
That was very
thoughtful of you.

635
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,239
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

636
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,721
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

637
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:20,809
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

638
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,637
our grief and our trauma.

639
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,943
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

640
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,553
and we gotta
finish those shows.

641
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:26,859
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

642
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,556
to give us a hand.

643
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,690
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

644
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,431
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

645
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,303
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

646
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,610
How convenient.

647
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,637
Ew.

648
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,078
Oh.

649
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,949
God, I thought I lost those.

650
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:46,912
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

651
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,567
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

652
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:52,091
<i>My water broke during
Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

653
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:54,920
Dad's favorite movie.

654
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,008
Yeah.

655
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,139
Can I keep this?

656
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,838
Yeah.

657
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:01,753
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

658
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,190
Did Grandpa make that?

659
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:07,019
No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

660
00:43:07,193 --> 00:43:09,630
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

661
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,119
Oh, I found that on the floor.

662
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,339
- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

663
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:24,993
Not ever!

664
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,300
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

665
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:29,781
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

666
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,260
- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

667
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:33,262
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

668
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,916
Do you understand me?

669
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,265
Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

670
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:53,369
Oh, my God, it's you!

671
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,589
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

672
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,896
It's breathing exercises.

673
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,637
Try seeing ghosts every day.

674
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,117
Astrid!

675
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,206
- Let her be.

676
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,860
God, she hates me.

677
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:10,560
Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

678
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,432
You blamed me
for your mother's.

679
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,129
She's not dead.

680
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:17,176
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

681
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,351
There's a difference.

682
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,918
You weren't very nice.

683
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:22,485
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

684
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,313
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

685
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:27,403
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

686
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:28,753
we have gotten closer.

687
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:30,537
No, I started liking you
before that.

688
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:36,848
Again with
the creepy breathing!

689
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,719
It works!

690
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,765
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

691
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,288
Of course you did.

692
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,203
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

693
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:46,292
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

694
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,163
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

695
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,643
in a skiing accident,

696
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,732
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

697
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,429
and we connected.

698
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,344
Yeah.

699
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,520
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

700
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,392
Okay, but this isn't about him.

701
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,263
Astrid found this in the attic.

702
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,135
Ew. So?

703
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:05,267
So?

704
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,574
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

705
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:09,010
Like he's lurking somewhere,

706
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:10,577
just out of reach.

707
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:11,883
But lately,

708
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm seeing him again.

709
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,930
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

710
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,410
But now this?

711
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,499
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

712
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:22,502
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

713
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,025
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

714
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,158
who tormented me
all those years ago?

715
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,726
It's time to find her.

716
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:52,358
- Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,534
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

719
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,883
Okay. Have fun.

720
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:02,107
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

721
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,283
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

722
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:17,600
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

723
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,688
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

724
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,691
No, I troll old record stores.

725
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,693
I don't trust
what I can't touch.

726
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,049
<i>Handbook for
the Recently Deceased.</i>

727
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:33,399
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

728
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:36,010
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly.

729
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:37,707
Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

730
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:38,839
my mom would write.

731
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,668
What's the deal
with your parents?

732
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:44,062
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

733
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,804
in the kitchen stress-baking.

734
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:49,197
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

735
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:50,851
but then he had an accident,

736
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:53,854
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

737
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:56,335
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

738
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,774
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

739
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,124
traveling, with a famous mom.

740
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:05,039
Not really.

741
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:06,867
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

742
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:07,955
We used to have this big plan

743
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,435
where we were gonna visit

744
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,132
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

745
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:14,309
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

746
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:17,486
yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

747
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:19,358
What happened?

748
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,535
A boat accident.

749
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,232
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

750
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:25,668
and they never found his body.

751
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:30,412
You really miss him.

752
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,025
Yeah.

753
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,461
You know,
I at least would have liked

754
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:37,115
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

755
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:38,551
But can't your mom,

756
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:40,161
I don't know, like,

757
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:42,642
contact him or...

758
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:43,948
She claims
she can't even see him.

759
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,906
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

760
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,822
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

761
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,652
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

762
00:47:52,826 --> 00:47:55,873
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

763
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,005
Because my dad,
he would go all out

764
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,833
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

765
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,574
- Yeah, I think I was

766
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,881
<i>in second grade when I went
as Munch's The Scream.</i>

767
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,709
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

768
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,059
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

769
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,451
so I don't know,

770
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:11,149
probably be
my least favorite now.

771
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:12,367
Well, what time's the wedding?

772
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,674
Midnight. The witching hour.

773
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:16,589
Future stepdad's lame idea.

774
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:20,985
Well, why don't you
come over...

775
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,074
earlier?

776
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,990
Uh, we could,

777
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:30,037
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

778
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:34,912
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

779
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:36,957
no pressure.

780
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:43,703
What is up
with these creepy birds?

781
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:45,923
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

782
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,925
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

783
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,883
you love in SoHo.

784
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:52,233
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

785
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:53,931
Should be here later today.

786
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:55,454
Ooh, great. Thanks.

787
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:58,587
And a, uh,

788
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,894
little bird may have
chirped our big news

789
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:03,070
to a few news outlets.

790
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:05,420
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

791
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:07,205
Could be great press
for the show.

792
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,903
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

793
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:13,298
but can we just keep it
small and private?

794
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,691
Yeah. Well, sure.

795
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:16,866
It's your big day.

796
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:18,651
Night. Whatever.

797
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,481
<i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>

798
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,222
<i>all through me. All through me!</i>

799
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,011
Lydia?

800
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:34,754
I want you out of my life!

801
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:35,929
Do you hear me?

802
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:37,583
Lydia?

803
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,891
Who are you yelling at?

804
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,198
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

805
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:45,721
- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

806
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:47,462
He said that I was holding
something back

807
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,943
and until I faced it,
you and I wouldn't evolve.

808
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,467
- Mmm.
- Okay, well, he was right.

809
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,774
And I'm going to tell you now.

810
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:55,949
And, fair warning,

811
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:58,647
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

812
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:01,041
Are you okay with that?

813
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:02,608
Of course. I'd love to.

814
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:04,305
Let's break through
this barrier together.

815
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,133
Okay, just give me a sec.

816
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,530
When I was a teenager,

817
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,881
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

818
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,578
and tried to force me
to marry him,

819
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:19,799
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

820
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,323
I believed he was gone forever,

821
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,630
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

822
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:27,328
And now, he is actually back.

823
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:30,940
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

824
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,380
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

825
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:36,903
Don't say his name!

826
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,774
If you say his name
three times,

827
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:40,298
he will appear.

828
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,564
Okay. So this...

829
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:48,567
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

830
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,134
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

831
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:51,657
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

832
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,834
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

833
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:58,664
I know this
is a big step for you.

834
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,405
But in the words
of Dr. Glickman,

835
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:02,494
I'm gonna give you
the push you need.

836
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,150
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

837
00:51:14,462 --> 00:51:15,811
What just happened?

838
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:17,335
We're in the model.

839
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:19,598
That's not possible.

840
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:24,777
What the hell?

841
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,300
I told you not to say his name!

842
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,785
<i>Lydia Deetz,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

843
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,526
<i>Don't ever
say that name.</i>

844
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,268
<i>Not ever!
We need to leave, now.</i>

845
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,096
<i>Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>

846
00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:43,100
- Is that...
- Beetlejuice!

847
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:49,280
First of all,
I want you two kids to know,

848
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:51,195
this is a safe space. Okay?

849
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:52,674
Feel free
to express yourselves.

850
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:54,676
Don't be afraid. I sense
there's an enabler here,

851
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,721
but we'll get to that.

852
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,026
Look, dig deep

853
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,158
and spill your guts.

854
00:51:58,332 --> 00:51:59,551
Okay? Who wants to go first?

855
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,074
- Huh?

856
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:02,597
All right, I will.

857
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,429
There you go. See?
I'm willing to do the work.

858
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,039
You two kids
need to get in touch

859
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,650
with your inner child.

860
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:13,217
Mine'll be along
in just a jiffy.

861
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:31,104
Everybody says
he's got my eyes.

862
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,933
- Personally, I don't see it.

863
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,543
- Scram, kid.

864
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:39,808
You're just my unpacked trauma.

865
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:41,332
You're just my unpacked trauma.

866
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,290
You're a figment
of my imagination.

867
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:44,770
Really?

868
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:46,163
Is this a figment
of your imagination?

869
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,909
Leg man.

870
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,694
Just like his old man.

871
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,660
That was you stalking me.

872
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,140
Hey, if stalking means

873
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:08,663
trying to remarry
the love of my life,

874
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:11,057
well, I'm guilty as charged.
Come here!

875
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:12,798
Home, home, home!

876
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:31,730
<i>♪ Wherever you go
Whatever you do ♪</i>

877
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:37,257
<i>♪ I will be right here
Waiting for you ♪</i>

878
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:40,739
What happened?

879
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,741
I just had the wildest dream.

880
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,571
Yeah, I think
we should lay off the pills.

881
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,494
Snakes?

882
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:58,583
Actually, asps.

883
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:00,149
Aren't they beautiful?

884
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:01,673
Wedding gift for Rory?

885
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:04,589
Too late.
They've been defanged.

886
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:06,808
Guaranteed harmless,
and they're for me.

887
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:08,897
In Ancient Egypt,

888
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:10,421
a queen would perform
a ceremony

889
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:12,249
at the tomb of her pharaoh
using snakes,

890
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,425
the symbol of undying love.

891
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:15,904
- Are you sure about that?
- Mmm-hmm.

892
00:54:16,078 --> 00:54:17,254
We read that
they were a constant threat

893
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,342
to Ra in the underworld

894
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:19,691
and represented total chaos.

895
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:20,953
Okay, see,
that's why schools need

896
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:22,650
more art and less reading.

897
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,478
You got your wish,
we're leaving.

898
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:25,653
So go pack up your things,

899
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:26,828
I'm driving you back to school.

900
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:28,265
Wait, what happened?

901
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:30,441
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

902
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:32,617
I will pay
for a fleet of movers

903
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,662
to take everything
back to Manhattan,

904
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:36,055
except that model.

905
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:38,231
We need to chop it up
and burn it.

906
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:39,711
Oh.

907
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,800
You're calling off the wedding?

908
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,935
What did that
cheese ball do now?

909
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,285
It's not Rory.

910
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:49,373
It's Beetlejuice.

911
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:50,548
He's here.

912
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:52,201
In the model. I saw him.

913
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,378
Rory saw him, too,
but he thinks it's a dream.

914
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:55,770
Wait,
we can't leave yet.

915
00:54:57,555 --> 00:55:00,471
I have plans tomorrow
with this boy that I met.

916
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:04,649
How did you have time
to meet a boy?

917
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,433
You had time to get married.

918
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:08,827
She doesn't
mean it. It's just karma.

919
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,219
Whatever. I was biking

920
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,960
and then I kinda crashed
into his fence

921
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:13,832
and we started talking,

922
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:14,920
and then he invited me over
to his place for Halloween.

923
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:18,576
Can I go, Mom?

924
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,055
Mmm-mmm.

925
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,230
Please?

926
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:26,888
I will not allow
that menace to humanity

927
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,934
to upheave our family again.

928
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:32,241
No one goes in there,
no one calls his name!

929
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,156
We're gonna be fine, right?

930
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,637
Mom, come on!
I'm gonna be late.

931
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:51,348
Trick or treat!

932
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,005
Are you sure
this is the right address?

933
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:58,790
Yeah.

934
00:55:58,964 --> 00:56:00,531
- 125 Jefferson Lane.

935
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:02,402
Don't judge... all right?

936
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:03,969
His dad just got
into an accident at work,

937
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:05,362
and they're going through
a rough patch.

938
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:06,711
Trick or treat!

939
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:07,842
He's cute.

940
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,454
What are you doing?

941
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,803
I was gonna go
say "hey" to his parents.

942
00:56:11,977 --> 00:56:13,761
Seriously?
This isn't a playdate.

943
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:14,849
I mean,
we're not six years old.

944
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:15,981
Nothing's gonna happen.

945
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,157
All right, okay. You're right.

946
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:21,247
Have fun,
and I'll pick you up at 10:00.

947
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:22,683
Not a second later.

948
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:27,732
Come on, quick!

949
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:31,388
Trick or treat!

950
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,191
I, uh,
raided the basement.

951
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:54,454
I forgot we even
had half this stuff.

952
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:55,716
Yeah, you really went all out.

953
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,588
Yeah.

954
00:56:57,762 --> 00:56:59,546
I like the James Dean costume,
by the way.

955
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,721
Thank you. But yeah,

956
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,331
my parents think
I look more like

957
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,159
<i>Richie from Happy Days.</i>

958
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,248
- Mmm?
- Your costume looks great.

959
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,947
Who are you supposed to be?

960
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,122
Marie Curie.

961
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:13,821
Two-time Nobel Prize-winning
French physicist

962
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:15,562
- and feminist icon.
- Oh, she was, uh,

963
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,912
she discovered radiation.
Right?

964
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:19,218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

965
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:20,306
Yeah, her work was killing her.

966
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,612
She didn't even realize it.

967
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,701
Yeah, well,
for someone who is dying

968
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,920
of radiation poisoning,

969
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:29,533
uh, you look beautiful.

970
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:33,101
I brought some candy.
Or a lot of... I...

971
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:34,538
It's probably
too much actually.

972
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,235
But, uh, we can, I don't know,

973
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:38,237
maybe binge on whatever's
left over, if you want?

974
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,282
Or we could start
handing it out now,

975
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,849
if that's...

976
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,547
- what you wanna do.
- Yeah.

977
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,288
Uh, I have a confession, actually.

978
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:50,771
I'd rather stay up here
with you.

979
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:56,298
Okay. Yeah.

980
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:58,213
That works, too.

981
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,639
Please don't freak out.

982
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:33,771
What are you?

983
00:58:34,772 --> 00:58:35,729
Don't you know?

984
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:39,864
Astrid, really,
you don't have to be scared.

985
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:43,084
You're a ghost.

986
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:48,742
My mom was telling the truth.
Shit!

987
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,352
When my mom and dad
used to fight,

988
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,093
I used to steal
one of my dad's six-packs

989
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,095
and go hide out
in the tree fort.

990
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:55,270
And one day,

991
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:57,751
I slipped

992
00:58:57,925 --> 00:58:58,883
and fell.

993
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:01,450
How long ago did that happen?

994
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,714
23 years, 5 months and 14 days.

995
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,324
But who's counting?

996
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:06,717
I've been stuck in this house
for 23 years.

997
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:09,633
I can't go any further
than that tree.

998
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,810
And I've just spent my time
watching the world go by.

999
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:14,420
But then you came along,

1000
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:15,769
and you could see me.

1001
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:19,381
And I've been on my own
for so long,

1002
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,558
it was like a grenade
had gone off in my head.

1003
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:22,776
It was amazing.

1004
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:24,648
You're amazing.

1005
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:26,345
- I should go.
- Astrid, I know.

1006
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:27,738
I know it's insane.

1007
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:31,002
But I really like you,

1008
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:32,786
and I want us to be together.

1009
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,789
How?

1010
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:38,139
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

1011
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:40,620
Well, uh,

1012
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:42,491
what if I told you

1013
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,276
that I'd found a way
to come back.

1014
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,279
To be human again.

1015
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,411
Um, it's all in this book.

1016
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,283
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

1017
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,545
It's kind of complicated,

1018
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,852
but, uh, I can only do it

1019
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:58,682
with the help
of a living person.

1020
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:01,728
And you could literally
give me my life back.

1021
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,383
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

1022
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,907
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

1023
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:08,474
Yeah, well, I...

1024
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,998
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

1025
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:12,521
to stay away.

1026
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,349
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

1027
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:18,571
You'd get to see your dad.

1028
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:20,399
Again.

1029
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,676
I have the first
official open house

1030
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,243
a week from Sunday,

1031
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,027
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

1032
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:41,333
Where's Rory?

1033
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:43,074
Supermarket.

1034
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,076
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

1035
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,426
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

1036
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,775
Even Halloween.

1037
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:51,430
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

1038
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:54,172
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

1039
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:55,347
No, Delia.

1040
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:57,218
Where are you going?

1041
01:00:57,392 --> 01:00:58,785
Cemetery.

1042
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,874
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

1043
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,835
I need to skedaddle, too.

1044
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,575
I'm co-chaperoning

1045
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,230
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

1046
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:11,493
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

1047
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,583
We agreed nothing Disney.

1048
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,411
The closest
we ever got to Disney

1049
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:20,328
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

1050
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,156
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

1051
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,593
- Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

1052
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,073
Isn't that genius?

1053
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,075
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

1054
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:29,947
I'm going as...

1055
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:34,516
"reverse mortgage."

1056
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,518
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

1057
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,173
Where is Astrid?

1058
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:41,654
On a date. Her first.

1059
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,091
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

1060
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:45,745
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

1061
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:47,921
Don't mention that street.

1062
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:49,009
I have a listing that's kept me

1063
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,185
from a perfect sales record.

1064
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,100
Oh, it's my own fault.

1065
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:55,537
The place had been
on the market for years...

1066
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,018
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

1067
01:01:58,192 --> 01:01:59,498
it would be
a feather in my cap.

1068
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:00,760
Murder House?

1069
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:02,457
Which house?

1070
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,286
125.

1071
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,027
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

1072
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:08,768
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

1073
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:11,815
- Jeremy Frazier?

1074
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,947
I didn't get his last name.

1075
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,733
Oh, no, it can't be him.

1076
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,910
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

1077
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:23,304
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

1078
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,306
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

1079
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,394
When they tried to get him out,

1080
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:28,353
he fell, broke his neck,

1081
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,094
died instantly.

1082
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:38,015
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

1083
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,278
Draw a door with some chalk?

1084
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:41,714
Oh, and knock three times?

1085
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,020
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

1086
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:44,151
So lame.

1087
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:56,816
- Or maybe it's not so lame.

1088
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,731
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

1089
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,646
I can. But since
you're still alive,

1090
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,909
you have to read
that incantation first.

1091
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:08,828
<i>"De mundo
vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

1092
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:26,715
Astrid!

1093
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:34,245
Jeremy, is that you?

1094
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:43,123
<i>"Ut liber iterum
ambulet alius."</i>

1095
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,909
Okay.

1096
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,606
I think that worked.

1097
01:03:48,346 --> 01:03:49,390
Astrid!

1098
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:53,830
Let's go see your dad.

1099
01:03:57,311 --> 01:03:59,139
Astrid! No!

1100
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,581
Okay.

1101
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:19,638
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

1102
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:21,901
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

1103
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:24,469
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

1104
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,645
Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

1105
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:29,387
Merry Christmas.

1106
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:30,779
Merry Christmas.

1107
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:33,565
Thanks.

1108
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,219
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

1109
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:45,272
Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

1110
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:48,362
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

1111
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:50,582
That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

1112
01:04:56,849 --> 01:04:58,198
Whoa, dude.

1113
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,205
Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

1114
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:09,383
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

1115
01:05:10,123 --> 01:05:11,559
No, I haven't.

1116
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:13,648
And I won't ever.

1117
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:15,781
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

1118
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,263
Oh. Oh, that's good.

1119
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:23,006
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

1120
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,703
Kings of Commerce,

1121
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:26,226
Knights of Nasdaq,

1122
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,535
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

1123
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:33,103
You are no more, my king.

1124
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,279
But with the blessing
of the angels

1125
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:37,020
- of undying love...

1126
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:40,719
I, your surviving queen,

1127
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,982
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

1128
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:50,468
Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

1129
01:05:52,078 --> 01:05:53,732
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

1130
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,255
Just pre-wedding jitters.

1131
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:57,040
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

1132
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:58,780
but don't come up

1133
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,304
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

1134
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:01,435
Sure.

1135
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,136
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

1136
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,051
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

1137
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:09,487
Here we are.

1138
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:10,967
- Apples...
Thank you!

1139
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,969
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

1140
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:14,535
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

1141
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:19,976
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1142
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:23,544
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

1143
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,272
The Juice is loose.

1144
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,145
I need you to tell me
what this means.

1145
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:01,800
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

1146
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:04,237
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

1147
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:06,283
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

1148
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:07,980
He gets to come back,

1149
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:09,460
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

1150
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,331
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

1151
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,680
- Soul Train?
- That's right.

1152
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:15,161
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

1153
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:16,902
No, she can't
get on that train.

1154
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,599
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

1155
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:20,123
Well, I can get you in,

1156
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:22,299
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

1157
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:24,518
Of course there is.
What do you want?

1158
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:26,433
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

1159
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,653
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

1160
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,481
She's kinda clingy.

1161
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:31,482
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

1162
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:32,918
You want me to marry you!

1163
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:34,572
I thought you'd never ask.

1164
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:36,313
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

1165
01:07:36,487 --> 01:07:38,141
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

1166
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:39,577
Yikes!

1167
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:43,276
Okay, fine.

1168
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,148
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

1169
01:07:45,322 --> 01:07:46,453
I'm gonna need that in writing.

1170
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,064
- Give me that.
- Ow.

1171
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,195
And here we go.

1172
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:53,634
I'm gonna make you so happy.

1173
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:56,289
Jesus! What's the plan
on getting in?

1174
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:03,905
Yeah.

1175
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,432
Well, can't exactly
go through the front door.

1176
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>We need
a demon possession.</i>

1177
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:24,404
<i>Our case worker's
on strike</i>

1178
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,536
<i>and the waiting room's...</i>

01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,015

01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,626
<i>these people
are still in my house.</i>

1181
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:34,675
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1182
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:37,243
You never saw us.

1183
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,071
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

1184
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,075
Bob, you and the boys
stand guard.

1185
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:44,903
Nobody gets through.

1186
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:47,906
Let's go, honey.

1187
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,623
-Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

1188
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:11,147
Whoa, whoa.

1189
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:12,452
One each.

1190
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:13,671
Honor system.

1191
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:15,368
Yeah, right. Asshole.

1192
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,458
- Huh?

1193
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:23,594
Okay, everyone,

1194
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:24,725
strawberries get first pick
this time.

1195
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,771
No crowding.

1196
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,001
Hands on your head, asswipe!

1197
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,613
Or I'll spray-paint the wall
with your brains!

1198
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:43,875
<i>10-31 reporting.</i>

1199
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:45,398
Oh, no, dude.

1200
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,748
That was way too forced.

1201
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,924
Remember, throw it away.

1202
01:09:50,098 --> 01:09:51,839
Underplay it.

1203
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:53,928
- You gotta keep it real.

1204
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:55,016
<i>-Warning.
- Olga,</i>

1205
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,366
what the hell is going on?

1206
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:59,020
We got a code 6-9-9 violation.

1207
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,674
You mean to tell me

1208
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:02,981
a live one illegally
broke into the Afterlife?

1209
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:04,939
<i>...6-9-9 violation.</i>

1210
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:07,594
Time to call the Ghoul Squad.

1211
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:13,600
I need a hard target search
for two suspects.

1212
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:14,862
Scumbag...

1213
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,430
goes by the name
of Beetlejuice.

1214
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:19,258
And a female Fleshbag.

1215
01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,739
One Lydia Deetz.

1216
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:25,743
Kick down every door.
Leave no gravestone unturned.

1217
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:30,138
Hell, sift through the sands
of Titan if you have to!

1218
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,315
Men...

1219
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:34,404
this is what
you've been training

1220
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:36,014
your entire deaths for.

1221
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:38,277
And remember...

1222
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,061
Gotta keep it real!

1223
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:41,672
Yes!

1224
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,900
What the hell?

1225
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,947
Where am... What?

1226
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:59,080
No. No. No!

1227
01:11:00,647 --> 01:11:02,301
No!

1228
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:04,390
No!

1229
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:06,174
- Excuse me!

1230
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:07,959
What if a mistake's been made?

1231
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,004
Because I'm not
supposed to be here.

1232
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:17,751
Seriously?

1233
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:20,450
No. I have global entry.

1234
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,582
Is there a line for that?

1235
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:28,153
<i>The 8:35 to the Great Beyond</i>

1236
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:29,546
<i>is on time.</i>

1237
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,374
Next.

1238
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:33,985
Stand on the marks and look
directly into the camera.

1239
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:36,901
Say "cheese."

1240
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,644
Whoa!

1241
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:41,775
Are you okay?

1242
01:11:43,734 --> 01:11:46,127
No. I feel strange.

1243
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,826
I feel amazing. Go figure.

1244
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,436
- What just happened?
- Well, it's real simple.

1245
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,961
You remember the chant
that I got you to recite?

1246
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:58,662
Uh, you agreed
to swap your life for mine.

1247
01:11:59,576 --> 01:12:01,055
What?

1248
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:03,144
I needed your life so that
I could walk free again.

1249
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:06,626
She's got a seat
on the Soul Train.

1250
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,628
One-way to the Great Beyond.

1251
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:10,978
If you hustle,
you can make the 8:35.

1252
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:12,458
- Wait, no! Wait!
- Thank you very much.

1253
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:14,808
I never agreed to this!

1254
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,420
Uh, how do I cross back over?

1255
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:19,987
Get this stamped first.
Window 11.

1256
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,947
The transfer
isn't permanent till then.

1257
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:29,388
Dad?

1258
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:30,737
- Astrid?
- Dad?

1259
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:32,870
Dad! Help me!

1260
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:34,306
Dad!

1261
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,308
Astrid!

1262
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:56,197
Soon, my beloved.

1263
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,503
Soon.

1264
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:17,697
<i>Warning, violation code 6-9-9.</i>

1265
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:19,220
All clear. Let's go.

1266
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,221
We're like Bonnie and Clyde,
you and me.

1267
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,527
Without the bullet holes.

1268
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:22,659
Do you even know
where we're going?

1269
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,138
You go right down the hallway,

1270
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:25,749
three rights through
the ninth door...

1271
01:13:25,923 --> 01:13:26,880
<i>Violation code 6-9-9.</i>

1272
01:13:27,054 --> 01:13:28,012
...and right to the Soul Train.

1273
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:29,579
Where are you going?

1274
01:13:29,753 --> 01:13:30,928
I'm gonna go to
the little boy's room first.

1275
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:01,915
This is the 8:35...

1276
01:14:02,089 --> 01:14:03,569
to the Great Beyond!

1277
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:06,572
All aboard

1278
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:08,705
the Soul Train!

1279
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:18,584
No. No!

1280
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:20,804
No!

1281
01:14:21,935 --> 01:14:23,459
Yeah! Whoo!

1282
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,593
Astrid!

1283
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:28,899
Astrid!

1284
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,380
No! No, no!

1285
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,469
No, no!

1286
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:34,600
Please, no!

1287
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:46,046
Hey,
shake your thing, mama.

1288
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,308
Hey!

1289
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,536
Astrid!

1290
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:08,982
Shoot!

1291
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:11,419
Freeze!

1292
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:13,378
There.

1293
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,644
By the way, I saw Dad.

1294
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:31,091
Hey, where are we?

1295
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:32,353
I don't know.

1296
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:36,967
Hey, that's Saturn.

1297
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:40,013
Right? So we must be
on one of its moons.

1298
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,798
I swear,
the Afterlife is so random!

1299
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,909
Sandworm! Run!

1300
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,527
Take my hand!

1301
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,361
Here! Come on!

1302
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:54,435
Marie Curie.

1303
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,524
After the radiation poisoning.

1304
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,091
Right?

1305
01:16:58,265 --> 01:16:59,440
- Learned from the best.

1306
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:02,139
We made a great kid.

1307
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:05,011
Yeah, we did.

1308
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:07,666
Come here!

1309
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,410
I know you can't see me,

1310
01:17:12,584 --> 01:17:15,282
but I check in on you both
all the time.

1311
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:16,457
And I don't want
to be the reason

1312
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,329
that drove you two apart.

1313
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:19,460
You need each other.

1314
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,115
You make each other better.

1315
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,161
Always have.

1316
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:26,859
<i>-Alert!</i>

1317
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:28,252
<i>We have a 6-9-9 violation.</i>

1318
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:30,123
We gotta get back
to Winter River.

1319
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:31,995
You can't leave until
Astrid gets her life back.

1320
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:34,650
<i>- Warning! Intruder detected!
- Let's go.</i>

1321
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,437
The Ghoul patrol found
the breach and sealed it.

1322
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,570
Any sign of Mr. Beetlejuice?
Or the Fleshbag?

1323
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:44,137
Still looking.

1324
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,878
But we did find something
that might help.

1325
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:00,023
Hmm.

1326
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:10,076
-"Bob"?
- Mmm?

1327
01:18:12,818 --> 01:18:14,733
Let me tell ya
how this is gonna go.

1328
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:17,780
Your shriveled lips
will start flappin',

1329
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,956
or I'll crack
your itty-bitty skull

1330
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,958
like a goddamn walnut.

1331
01:18:22,132 --> 01:18:23,263
Where's Beetlejuice?

1332
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:39,976
- Rory?
- Father...

1333
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,065
I'm seeing these shrunken
head people everywhere.

1334
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,719
Well, be not afraid,

1335
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:45,851
for thine eyes
will see strange things.

1336
01:18:46,025 --> 01:18:47,679
Are you filled
with fear and trembling?

1337
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:50,290
Yes! I'm shitting my pants.

1338
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:52,379
- Ah.
- What are you doing here?

1339
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:53,598
I'm searching
for the lost lambs

1340
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,078
to bring back into the light.

1341
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:57,558
Why don't I give you a ride
to the church?

1342
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:05,915
Trick or treat!

1343
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:09,005
Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

1344
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,441
I... Come right back, I just...

1345
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,225
Excuse me. Just...

1346
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:15,446
Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,
late for a wedding.

1347
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,970
Hi, yes, one question,
how do I get out of here?

1348
01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:19,537
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

1349
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:21,931
I'm on a break.
Take a number. Take a seat.

1350
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:23,497
No, you see, those asps,

1351
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:24,803
they were defanged.
I paid extra for that.

1352
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:26,936
Honey, you're dead, okay?

1353
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,981
Now take a number and sit down.

1354
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:36,859
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

1355
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:38,338
Did that line
used to work for you?

1356
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:40,297
I'm not dead!

1357
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:43,343
You know what?

1358
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:44,997
My husband's here.
Charles Deetz.

1359
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:46,738
Yes, he can fix this.

1360
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:47,913
You call him, he can fix this,
he can fix anything.

1361
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:49,567
Not anymore he can't.

1362
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,091
No, wait! Wait, I know people!

1363
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:55,660
Oh! I know people!
I am people! Why's...

1364
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:58,837
No.

1365
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:00,839
Beetlejuice. Oh, no.

1366
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,583
Beetlejuice.

1367
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:08,934
- Right here.

1368
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:10,806
I get it. Now that you're dead,

1369
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,546
you wanna hang out with me.

1370
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,244
Would you help me
find Charles, please?

1371
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:16,202
And then the VIP lounge.

1372
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:17,813
- Sure.
- Okay.

1373
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:20,467
Just after you help me
find my runaway bride.

1374
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:23,557
Ugh.

1375
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:35,265
Hmm?

1376
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:38,834
- Where is he?

1377
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,403
Tell me.

1378
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:17,437
<i>Stay behind
the line until called.</i>

1379
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,315
Don't stamp that passport!

1380
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,104
You're too late, man.

1381
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:33,845
I think it was Dostoevsky
who said...

1382
01:21:35,629 --> 01:21:36,630
"Later, fucker!"

1383
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,418
This way. Follow me.

1384
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:48,381
Next!

1385
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:51,254
<i>Warning! Intruder detected.</i>

1386
01:21:52,342 --> 01:21:54,083
This way.

1387
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:56,389
<i>This is
a code 6-9-9. We have...</i>

1388
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:58,000
Okay, this is as far as I go.

1389
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:00,611
- Okay.
- I love you.

1390
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:02,047
I love you too, sweetheart.

1391
01:22:03,396 --> 01:22:05,311
Have an amazing life.

1392
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:06,530
You take care of each other.

1393
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:07,923
Yeah.

1394
01:22:08,097 --> 01:22:09,402
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1395
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:32,948
Thank you for saving my life.

1396
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:39,215
I'm so sorry I never believed
that you saw ghosts and...

1397
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:40,956
I don't know,
I'm just sorry for all of it.

1398
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:44,960
Astrid, I...

1399
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,874
Lydia!
Come on, you're late!

1400
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:48,572
Oh, my God! My wedding!

1401
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:50,226
We're about to start.

1402
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,879
Wait, Mom, with everything
that's happened tonight,

1403
01:22:52,054 --> 01:22:53,229
you know you don't
have to do this, right?

1404
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:54,970
I know,
but if I don't do it now,

1405
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,102
I'm never gonna do it.

1406
01:22:57,276 --> 01:22:59,148
But are you sure about this?

1407
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:02,716
Rory loves me,
and that's gotta be enough.

1408
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,544
Quickly, my dear!
Come! Come!

1409
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:05,850
Oh.

1410
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:10,028
And the lost lamb
is welcome into thy house

1411
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:11,812
- with open arms.
- Oh, my God!

1412
01:23:13,814 --> 01:23:14,946
I thought you got cold feet.

1413
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,426
Oh, no, blame me.

1414
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,080
She just saved me
from my date from hell.

1415
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,472
Who are all these people?

1416
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:21,474
This is just
a couple influencers.

1417
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:23,215
Nobody under
five million followers,

1418
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:25,565
and I think we have
a Netflix executive in there.

1419
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:26,784
We doing this?

1420
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,655
Yeah. Where's your dress?

1421
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:30,179
All that matters
is that I'm here, now.

1422
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:31,789
So let's just skip
straight to the vows.

1423
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,138
Wait, where's Delia?

1424
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:34,357
- Yo!

1425
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:36,837
- Right here.

1426
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,361
She was helpin' me calm down
before the wedding.

1427
01:23:38,535 --> 01:23:39,927
I was feeling a little jittery.

1428
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:42,104
- All, right, beat it.
- You.

1429
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:44,584
You're that thing...

1430
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:46,195
from my dream.

1431
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:48,110
Well, I'm really
more nightmare material,

1432
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:49,720
but, thanks.

1433
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,461
- You're...
- Uh-uh.

1434
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:53,593
Part of the deal

1435
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:55,073
is you can never,
ever say my name, ever!

1436
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:56,553
What deal?

1437
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:57,945
The deal she made to save you.

1438
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,208
By the way,
you can call me "Dad."

1439
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:00,687
Lydia.

1440
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:02,776
You agreed to marry him?

1441
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,041
I was desperate,
and it was my only option.

1442
01:24:06,215 --> 01:24:07,564
Lydia. What's going on here?

1443
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,741
- Wow.

1444
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:12,699
Awkward.

1445
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:14,745
You haven't made much progress
since our last session,

1446
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:17,443
so I'm gonna suggest
some drug therapy.

1447
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:19,837
Don't be afraid to share.
When you're ready.

1448
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:28,367
I always thought
your whole act was bullshit.

1449
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,761
I never believed in ghosts,
spirits, or any of it.

1450
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:33,024
What? All this time?

1451
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:35,157
Why the hell
did you wanna get married?

1452
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:36,549
- Money!

1453
01:24:36,723 --> 01:24:37,855
I knew I could make more
as your husband

1454
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:39,378
than I could as your manager.

1455
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,512
And I never
had a dead fiancee.

1456
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:44,253
I just went
to that survivor's retreat,

1457
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:47,082
so that I could meet
weak women and exploit them!

1458
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:50,259
And I hit the codependent
lottery when I met you.

1459
01:24:50,433 --> 01:24:52,087
How 'bout a little
physical therapy?

1460
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:01,748
We'd like to thank you all

1461
01:25:01,922 --> 01:25:03,620
for coming to this
very special occasion,

1462
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:06,144
but right now
we'd like a little privacy.

1463
01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:34,172

you've violated code 6-9-9!

1507
01:30:10,927 --> 01:30:12,276
- Freeze!

1508
01:30:13,886 --> 01:30:14,887
Book 'em, Danno!

1509
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:18,587
Beetlejuice!

1510
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:24,157
What the...

1511
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,550
I'm back.

1512
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:31,948
Sweetheart!

1513
01:30:32,122 --> 01:30:33,297
You look fantastic!

1514
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:35,168
You look so...

1515
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:37,606
- put together.
- He's mine.

1516
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,912
It's me, not you.
You know, honey,

1517
01:30:40,086 --> 01:30:42,567
I've been goin' through
a lotta changes lately.

1518
01:30:42,741 --> 01:30:44,395
Kind of a mid-afterlife
crisis, I guess.

1519
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:47,659
Your soul belongs to me,
my love.

1520
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,574
For eternity.

1521
01:30:49,748 --> 01:30:50,880
You don't wanna
spend your eternity with me.

1522
01:30:51,054 --> 01:30:52,098
I'm a lone wolf.

1523
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,709
You need a soulmate.

1524
01:30:53,883 --> 01:30:56,494
Somebody who really sees you.
For instance.

1525
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:05,068
I need something
to draw with. Quick!

1526
01:31:39,102 --> 01:31:40,103
<i>Olé.</i>

1527
01:31:52,332 --> 01:31:53,682
- Let's go!
- Hey!

1528
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,336
We had a deal.

1529
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,990
She doesn't have to marry you.

1530
01:31:58,164 --> 01:31:59,992
- What?
- You violated code 6-9-9.

1531
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:02,604
Yeah, you illegally brought
my mom into the Afterlife.

1532
01:32:02,778 --> 01:32:05,041
According to that book,
that contract is null and void.

1533
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:11,177
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us,

1534
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:13,440
but the 600-year age gap

1535
01:32:13,615 --> 01:32:15,225
was a little bit much for me.

1536
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:16,618
- Beetle...
- Ah!

1537
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:18,228
- Beetlejuice.

1538
01:32:22,885 --> 01:32:23,842
Beetlejuice.

1539
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:32,982
-Hey!
- Beetlejuice.

1540
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:45,081
Shoulda got married in Vegas.

1541
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,004
Looks like
we're a little late, boys.

1542
01:32:57,136 --> 01:32:59,182
Tape off the crime scene,
call in forensics,

1543
01:32:59,356 --> 01:33:01,967
and keep
the goddamn media away.

1544
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:05,231
Little lady, you just
popped his Beetlejuice.

1545
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:06,711
Say your goodbyes,

1546
01:33:06,885 --> 01:33:08,583
you can take a selfie now,
if you like,

1547
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:09,975
but make it quick.

1548
01:33:11,803 --> 01:33:13,500
Sister, you're comin' with me.

1549
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,372
What? Delia, what did you do?

1550
01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:16,895
I fell for a scam,

1551
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:19,811
and I'm counting on you
to claim a refund.

1552
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:21,508
Those snakes were actually
poisonous, weren't they?

1553
01:33:21,683 --> 01:33:24,816
Yeah. So, I died
of embarrassment.

1554
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:27,036
Your work's gonna
go up in value.

1555
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,733
- Oh! Oh, well, then.
- Mmm-hmm.

1556
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:30,909
Delia...

1557
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,607
- I'll miss you.
- No, you won't.

1558
01:33:32,781 --> 01:33:34,609
I'll find Charles
and we'll haunt you both,

1559
01:33:34,783 --> 01:33:36,698
until you beg us to move on!

1560
01:33:36,872 --> 01:33:38,787
Nice work
for a couple of Fleshbags.

1561
01:33:38,961 --> 01:33:40,658
Don't come knockin'
until it's your time,

1562
01:33:40,832 --> 01:33:42,529
and in the meantime, remember,

1563
01:33:42,704 --> 01:33:44,357
you gotta keep it real.

1564
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:45,837
Come on, beautiful,

1565
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:47,839
we got a date
with the commissioner.

1566
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:34,756
Charles!

1567
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,672
Delia!

1568
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:41,414
I can't believe you're here!

1569
01:34:44,374 --> 01:34:45,636
Oh, Charles.

1570
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,464
I'm so happy
to see you!

1571
01:34:48,378 --> 01:34:49,596
Oh, Charles,

1572
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:50,989
look what happened to me!

1573
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,733
This is the 10:13,

1574
01:34:55,907 --> 01:34:57,692
to the Great Beyond!

1575
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:59,650
All aboard

1576
01:34:59,824 --> 01:35:01,434
the Soul Train!

1577
01:35:12,184 --> 01:35:14,360
I wanna thank
all you Ghosties out there,

1578
01:35:14,534 --> 01:35:17,189
for all your support
over the years,

1579
01:35:17,363 --> 01:35:20,410
but this is my last show.

1580
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:24,022
I have spent so much time
talking to the dead,

1581
01:35:24,196 --> 01:35:26,242
it's time I started living.

1582
01:35:29,201 --> 01:35:32,422
<i>I wanna make memories
with the people I love</i>

1583
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:34,990
<i>rather than be
haunted by them later.</i>

1584
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:52,241
Oh, my God.
What is that?

1585
01:37:16,265 --> 01:37:17,832
- Mommy!

1586
01:37:28,364 --> 01:37:29,887
