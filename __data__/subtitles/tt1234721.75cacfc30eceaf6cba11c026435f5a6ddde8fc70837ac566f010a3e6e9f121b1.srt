1
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,075
Mah, mah, mah, mah...

2
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,532
mah, mah, mah, mah, mah.

3
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,601
And we're on

4
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:18,574
in four, three, two, one.

5
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:24,080
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

6
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,074
could be made completely safe,

7
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,075
and what if I told you
that this could be accomplished

8
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,748
without risking the life of one
single law enforcement officer?

9
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,078
How do I know this?

10
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,575
Because it's happening right now

11
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:42,537
in every country in the world
but this one.

12
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,789
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to “The Novak Element."

13
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,245
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

14
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,116
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe,

15
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,242
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

16
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,121
General Monroe, welcome back.

17
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,957
- Good to see you, Pat.
- Uh, thank you

18
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,906
for this unprecedented
access to your operation.

19
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,749
Could you walk us through

20
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,574
what we're seeing here?

21
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,954
Well, this is a, uh,
a routine operation.

22
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,949
We found that random patrols

23
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,744
helped the local population

24
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,741
to feel safer and to trust us.

25
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,743
It's amazing.

26
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,415
And what are these colored dots

27
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,909
that we're seeing here, General?

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,249
These are our assets
on the ground.

29
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,246
Uh, in green,
we got the ED-2093.

30
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,291
They're the big boys,
they secure the perimeter.

31
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,124
Purple are the smaller EM-2083.

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,740
They sweep and mop up.

33
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,788
And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.

34
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,583
It is great to see
American machines

35
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,250
helping to promote peace
and freedom abroad.

36
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,615
All right, you guys, this is
just standard op, all right?

37
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,953
There's no opposition expected.

38
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,575
I'm gonna set your
markers to code red.

39
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,375
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

40
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,574
No red assets
have ever been lost.

41
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,702
- Okay.
- Okay?

42
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,123
That make you feel better?

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,036
But, listen,

44
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,684
you keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.

45
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,948
- Okay.
- Okay?

46
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,539
Okay, enjoy the show.

47
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,700
All right, let's go.

48
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,244
May peace be upon you.

49
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,574
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

50
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,375
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

51
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,166
No one will be harmed.

52
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,913
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,742
for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.

54
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,948
No one will be harmed.

55
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,415
As-salaamu alaikum.

56
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,660
- May peace be upon you.
- Scott, get me a shot of this.

57
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,912
Your cooperation is appreciated.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,698
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

59
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:01,792
As-salaamu alaikum.

60
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,749
May peace be upon you.

61
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,907
Incredible.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,287
In... credible!

63
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:19,285
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

64
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,369
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

65
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,948
Uh, General, you care

66
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,414
to comment on this?

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,458
Well, Pat, we had
Vietnam, we had Iraq,

68
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,075
we had Afghanistan...

69
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,703
Never again.

70
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:36,750
From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.

71
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,198
We can accomplish our objectives

72
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:40,750
without any loss
to American lives,

73
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,744
and I think
the honest people over there

74
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,619
really appreciate it.

75
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,081
A-And why wouldn't they?

76
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,750
For the first time
in their lives,

77
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,744
they get to watch
their children grow up

78
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:55,157
in an environment
of safety and security.

79
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,077
Navid!

80
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,578
Get away from the window!

81
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,658
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,582
Come here! Come here right now!

83
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,167
Arash!

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,786
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

85
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,618
But he's just a kid.

86
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,197
<i>Say eh'.!</i>

87
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,105
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

88
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,427
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

89
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,909
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

91
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,833
Navid!

92
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,083
Shut the door!

93
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,915
We're not here to kill any of them.

94
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,833
Got it?

95
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:31,625
The goal is to die on television.

96
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:32,622
Let's go!

97
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,624
Kelly,

98
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,457
can you hear me out there?

99
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,744
Loud and clear, Pat.

100
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,574
I'm here in sunny Tehran

101
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,788
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

102
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,955
As you can see behind me,
they're working

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,790
in collaboration
with the robots,

104
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:52,286
and obviously their safety is
everyone's top priority.

105
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,865
Don't make a move before I say...

106
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,082
I wanna make sure they're recording.

107
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,197
Yes!

108
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,458
Yes! Yes!

109
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,583
We're ready.

110
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,309
You'll notice children
in the streets as well.

111
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,200
This is everyday life happening
in perfect harmony...

112
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,536
Oh, my God!

113
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,184
Oh, great.
Here, come here, come here.

114
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,744
Stay put, stay put, stay put.

115
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,449
It's fine, don't worry,
my guy's got it.

116
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,893
Navid! It's dangerous here!

117
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:53,622
Come away! Come...

118
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,078
Navid, where are you going?

119
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,657
Navid!

120
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,078
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

121
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,657
What are you looking for? Navid!

122
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,165
Navid! Navid! What are you...

123
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,625
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

124
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,707
Navid!

125
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,368
Oh!

126
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,369
Oh, my God!

127
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,619
Drop your weapon.

128
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,040
No, no!

129
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,741
- No!
- Kelly?

130
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,115
Kelly, are you all right?

131
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,207
- Kelly!
- We're okay, Pat, our robots

132
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,750
- have just repelled some suicide bombers.
- Hold on, Kelly.

133
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,467
But, uh...

134
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,416
I'm sorry, Kelly, but
for security reasons,

135
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,288
the Pentagon's going to
cut our feed to Tehran,

136
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,452
but please be careful.

137
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,790
Yeah, I'll continue to stand by.

138
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:56,456
Now you see how fundamental
these robots are

139
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,583
to our foreign policy.

140
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,244
So then tell me,

141
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,952
why can't we use these machines
here at home?!

142
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,702
Why is America so robophobic?

143
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:13,740
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars,

144
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,746
an entrepreneur
and true American

145
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,243
whose product just saved
my colleague's life,

146
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,244
and on the other,

147
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,916
Hubert Dreyfus...

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,369
a man with both feet
planted firmly in the past,

149
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,873
whose bill prohibits the use
of drones on US. soil.

150
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,871
The American people support
the Dreyfus Act

151
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,576
because they haven't experienced
this technology

152
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,864
and they fear
what they don't understand.

153
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,781
We at “The Novak Element“
support Mr. Sellars' efforts

154
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:51,239
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

155
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,199
After all...

156
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:57,707
what's more important than the
safety of the American people?

157
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,574
- Hey, Murphy.
- Hey.

158
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,249
How's Jack?

159
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,082
We don't know yet.

160
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,915
...Murphy.
- Rick.

161
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,033
...How's it going?
—Good.

162
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,749
What the hell are
they doing here?

163
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,740
Six in the morgue,

164
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,866
Lewis in the hospital.

165
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,744
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

166
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,741
We got a lead
on Antoine Vallon, we took it.

167
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,115
What lead?

168
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,241
Not in front of them.

169
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,581
This is bullshit.

170
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,823
Yeah?

171
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,351
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

172
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,240
Vallon's our case.

173
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,456
Yeah, two years

174
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,199
without no arrest, no nothing?

175
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,623
You've got to be dumb or dirty.

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,072
You got something on us,
or is this personal?

177
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,074
No, it's nothing personal...

178
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,408
Although I don't like you
as a person.

179
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,078
Okay, you two, out.

180
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,539
No problem.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,911
Maybe if you hadn't gone
off the reservation,

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,582
your partner would
still be standing.

183
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,540
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

184
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,954
Okay, Alex.

185
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,582
Just you and me now.

186
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,416
80, me and Jack, we've been
doing some street buys.

187
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,249
We get a line on some guns.

188
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,618
We meet up with
this low-level G called Jerry

189
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,412
who ends up having a piece
he's not supposed to have.

190
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,411
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry?

191
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,453
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

192
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,244
Two crates?
No disrespect, J,

193
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,700
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

194
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,226
Yo, what's it matter
where it comes from?

195
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,450
Why it matters—— we don't want

196
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,873
no dirty guns, Jerry.

197
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,226
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,610
Yo, look, they're clean,
all right?

199
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,578
- You gonna buy this shit or not?
- Hey, hey,

200
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,768
why you acting so nervous, man?

201
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,328
You fishing on us, Jerry?

202
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,124
What'd you say?

203
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,351
- You think he fishing, D?
- I think he's fishing on us.

204
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,851
Yo, what the hell are
they talking about, man?

205
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,286
Hey, let me see your phone.

206
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,726
- Let me see your phone.
- I'm not showing you

207
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,366
- my phone, man!
- You recording this?

208
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,415
- What?
- I think you're a goddamn cop.

209
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,741
What the hell
are you talking about, man?!

210
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,790
- Don't even try that!
- Hey, put your gun down!

211
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,578
We're not cops, all right?

212
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,434
- We work for Antoine Vallon.
- Put your phones on the table!

213
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,119
What?
Hey, hey, hey, shut up, shut up.

214
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,115
What'd you say?

215
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,332
Ends up he works for Vallon.

216
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,954
Before the meet we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

217
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,575
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

218
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,416
Not out on the street.

219
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,616
Intake papers blank,
no signatures.

220
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,458
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

221
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,745
How do you think that happened?

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,457
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

223
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,200
These guys'll shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

224
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,078
We need backup.

225
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,620
We call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station,

226
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,036
he's gonna disappear.

227
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,707
It's gonna be all right.

228
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,643
We told Vallon
we were gun buyers,

229
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:59,284
and he bought it.

230
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,249
What do you two need
with that much product?

231
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,744
You plotting a coup?

232
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,240
Man, don't trip.

233
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,457
We ain't gonna bust
a single shot in your town.

234
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,423
We got some problems back home
with Chicago PD.

235
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,866
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

236
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,949
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

237
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,867
What do you got for me?

238
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,574
Really?

239
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,268
We were
just about to close the deal,

240
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,372
but someone tipped him off.

241
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,749
Gentlemen,
I got to deal with this.

242
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,035
—Two minutes.

243
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:35,283
Make sure you kill 'em both!

244
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,411
I got two handguns,

245
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,332
one automatic.

246
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,453
We gotta get out of here.

247
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,744
I'm gonna take the automatic.

248
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,074
You sure about this?

249
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,907
You ready?

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,411
Move.

251
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,074
Lewis?

252
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,783
Lewis!

253
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,624
Officer down!

254
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,117
Officer down... 331 Hamilton.

255
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,615
This is Detective Alex Murphy

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,616
in need
of immediate medical assistance.

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,583
331 Hamilton Road.

258
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,616
Jack.

259
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,615
Jack, come on.

260
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,120
Jack, can you hear me?

261
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,866
Jack, stay with me.

262
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,991
Jack.

263
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,976
Alex, you
don't do something like this...

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,518
- Come on, Jack!
- ...unless you bring it

265
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,032
to me first.

266
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,707
Vallon's connected.

267
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,783
I'm warning you, don't
make any more moves

268
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,078
until I vet this.

269
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,643
If officers are supplying him
with guns...

270
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,580
That's up to IAD.

271
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,783
I'll handle it.

272
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,005
I don't care how sophisticated

273
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,833
these machines are,
Mr. Sellars.

274
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,577
A machine does not know
what it feels like to be human.

275
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,455
It can't understand
the value of human life.

276
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,915
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,163
To, to, to legislate
over life and death,

278
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:19,331
we need people who understand
right from wrong.

279
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,619
What do your machines feel?

280
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,458
Well, uh, they feel no anger.

281
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,283
They feel no prejudice.

282
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,082
They feel no fatigue,

283
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,121
which makes them ideal
for law enforcement.

284
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,156
Putting these machines
on the streets

285
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,330
will save
countless American lives.

286
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,059
- You're evading the question.
- No, I'm not.

287
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,619
Yes, you're evading
the question.

288
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,746
I asked, what do
these machines feel?

289
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,163
If one of them...
killed a child,

290
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,659
what would it feel?

291
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,949
- Nothing.
- And that's the problem.

292
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,621
That's why 72% of Americans
will not stand

293
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,661
for a robot pulling the trigger.

294
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,893
The world's
most valuable market,

295
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,749
and we can't touch it.

296
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,449
With a domestic expansion,

297
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:17,160
we'd clear $600 billion
per annum.

298
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,000
In other words, every second
that law is in existence,

299
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,165
we are hemorrhaging money.

300
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,991
What do you want me to do?

301
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,268
We've thrown cash at senators
at both sides of the aisle.

302
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,828
Nobody's budging.

303
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,893
They don't want to vote
against their constituents,

304
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,989
so, unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

305
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,618
Now, to that effect,
my team have come up

306
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,496
with a pretty aggressive
new campaign.

307
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,287
Wow factor off the charts.

308
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,614
We need to give Americans
a product they can love,

309
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,244
a figure they can rally behind.

310
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,655
Sir, I have dissected this bill.

311
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,994
There are no loopholes.

312
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,241
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

313
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,664
Forget machines.

314
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,578
You saw the polls.

315
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,910
Americans don't want a machine.

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,074
They want a product
with a conscience.

317
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:07,331
They want something
that knows...

318
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,202
...what it feels like
to be human.

319
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,245
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

320
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,619
You're not you

321
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,450
because of your legs,
your arms, your hands.

322
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,290
You're you
because of your brain.

323
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,284
It's your, your brain's capacity
to process information

324
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,207
that makes you who you are.

325
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,615
Relax and just do

326
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,699
what you've always done.

327
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,290
I've never played with these.

328
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,787
The music doesn't come
from your fingers, Michael,

329
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,619
it comes from your mind.

330
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,832
All you have to do
is let it out.

331
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,791
Please.

332
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,290
Oh, my God.

333
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,165
No, it's okay. Easy.

334
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,698
His emotions are peaking.

335
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,934
The readings are
getting clouded.

336
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,244
It's okay.

337
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,664
Relax.

338
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,829
If you get too emotional,
it'll change

339
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,119
the chemistry in your brain.

340
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,199
It'll throw the system out.

341
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,619
You're doing great.

342
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,699
Come on.

343
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,780
I need emotion to play.

344
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,242
"Concierto de
Aranjuez, “ second movement.

345
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,121
Beautiful piece.

346
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,573
Dennett, when you have a moment.

347
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:17,953
Thank you.

348
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,518
We agreed on this

349
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,124
a long time ago, Raymond.

350
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,823
I, I, I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

351
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,325
My, my work here is driven

352
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,458
by its own questions.

353
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,657
And your work is brilliant,

354
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,783
but your ideas
are being underutilized.

355
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,617
Look, I think I found a way

356
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,952
to put real revenue stream
behind your research and save

357
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:42,580
thousands of lives
in the process.

358
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,331
You're not keeping up your end,

359
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,914
leaving me exposed like that.

360
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,559
Detective Murphy's just
a little impulsive.

361
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,744
So put him on the payroll.

362
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,289
Why are we talking about this?

363
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,768
It won't work, and now
that his partner got hit,

364
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:04,657
he's never gonna let it go.

365
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,783
What is that?

366
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,115
Lewis's hospital.

367
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,573
Alex is dropping
by this afternoon,

368
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,704
in case you want
to send flowers.

369
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,573
Yeah.

370
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,953
I kill a cop,

371
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,283
looking over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

372
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,782
That's not good for business.

373
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,288
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

374
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

375
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,455
Gonna have 'em in bracelets
within a month, man.

376
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,580
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

377
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,749
Cameras off?

378
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,286
Clear.

379
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,476
You were right.

380
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,333
We should've had backup.

381
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,994
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,996
You're not really
sleeping, are you?

383
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,166
Asshole.

384
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,449
Sergeant Thomas Fry, NYPD.

385
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,450
Paralyzed from the waist down.

386
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:13,581
He has let himself go
a little since the accident.

387
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,782
Pass.

388
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,582
Yeah, yeah, fair enough.

389
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,908
Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.

390
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,289
Severe cere... cerebellar...

391
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,999
Cerebellar ataxia.

392
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,615
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

393
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,787
He scored through the roof

394
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,954
with our urban demos.

395
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,643
Let's keep this one in mind;
I like this guy.

396
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,748
Very good, sir, leaved

397
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,830
the best for last.

398
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,246
I give you Sergeant Jack
Freeman, masculinity incarnate.

399
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,246
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

400
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,825
now confined to a wheelchair.

401
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:50,156
I... think I can
seethe appeal.

402
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,453
No.

403
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:52,907
What? Why?

404
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,101
Well, check
the psych evaluation.

405
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,492
He's far too unstable.

406
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,457
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

407
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,749
Have you any idea what we'd
be putting him through?

408
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,790
The psychological
strain requires

409
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,457
someone emotionally balanced.

410
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,624
We have to be scientific.

411
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,120
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

412
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,411
He's right.

413
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,242
Okay, keep looking.

414
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
David, what did I say?

415
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,956
Not until you're finished.

416
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:17,952
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

417
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,658
Hi, Dad.

418
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,408
Hey.

419
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Hey, little monkey.

420
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,911
How's the game, buddy?

421
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,000
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

422
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,456
Oh, yeah?

423
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:33,953
- That's fantastic.
- Hey, D,

424
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,624
why don't you head upstairs,

425
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,574
start getting ready for bed?

426
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,453
But he just got home.

427
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,449
I'll be up in a second.

428
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,618
Tuck you in, okay?

429
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,785
All right?

430
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,494
Now give your mom a kiss.

431
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,490
Good night, baby.

432
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,616
Too slow, boy.

433
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,375
You're just too slow.

434
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,578
How's Jack holding up?

435
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,125
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

436
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,118
It's my fault.

437
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,118
He shouldn't even

438
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,245
have been there.

439
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,166
Here.

440
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,329
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

441
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,119
It'll stop.

442
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,157
It's gonna wake up David.

443
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,662
He suffered fourth-degree burns

444
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:16,783
over 80% of his body.

445
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:20,160
Lower spine has been severed.

446
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:23,956
If he survives,
he'll be paralyzed

447
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:27,538
from the waist down
and confined to a wheelchair.

448
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:33,326
Mrs. Murphy...

449
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:37,281
we, we don't have to do this.

450
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,159
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

451
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,116
Please continue.

452
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,996
Vestibulocochlear,

453
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:52,164
optical nerves
have been critically damaged.

454
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,909
He'll be blind in one eye,

455
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,458
most likely deaf.

456
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,222
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

457
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,782
are the leaders in this field.

458
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:05,119
In my opinion, this is the only
chance your husband has.

459
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,666
I'd seriously consider
their offer.

460
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,786
I'm sorry, Doctor.

461
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,663
I need time to think.

462
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:15,998
I'm afraid,
Mrs. Murphy,

463
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,867
time is one thing
you don't have.

464
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,957
You say you can save him,

465
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,074
but what does that mean?

466
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,118
What kind of life will he have?

511

You were in an explosion, Alex.

512
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,954
Y-You're in a hospital.

513
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,950

517
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:56,622

both your wife and your son.

00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,582
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.

- Visual input unstable.

525
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,289

527
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,324
- Should we purge it?
- Not yet.

528
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,950
Unlock vertebrae.

529
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,453
Go ahead, Kim.

530
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,704
Unlock upper, lower extremities.

531
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,287
What kind of suit is this?

532
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:50,617
It's not a suit, Alex, it's...

533
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,707
it-it's you.

534
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,957
This was the only option.

00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,157

All of us... to make
you whole again.

Full body unlock.

538
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,283
I want you to walk now, Alex.

539
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,366
You can do that.

540
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,995
This seems so real.

541
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,161
Alex, it's, it's very important

542
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,748
you understand
what is happening.

543
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,119
This is real.

544
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,744
It's not a dream,

545
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,494
it's not drugs or anesthetics.

546
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,617
I know I'm dreaming
because I can feel all of this.

547
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,780
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

548
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:49,782
It's called phantom
limb sensation.

549
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,499
What do you mean "amputees"?

550
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,893
- What the hell did you do to me?
- Alex, you need to relax.

551
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,476
Take this off me now.
I need to get out of this thing.

552
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
You need to relax.

553
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,948
Alex, Dr. Norton
saved your life.

554
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,684
What did you do to me?!
What have you done to me?!

555
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,618
Your body was beyond
biological repair!

556
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,824
Alex... hey!

557
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,907
Shut him down.

558
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,286
Uh, no! Let him run!

559
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,703
Let him run!

560
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,537
Where am I?!

561
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,532
Alex, please.

562
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,991
Stop.

563
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,366
Alex, you have to stop.

564
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,624
Please.

565
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,458
Alex.

566
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,283
Please stop.

567
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:14,036
Stay where you are and,
and we'll come and pick you up.

568
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,617
Okay, Kim.

569
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,746
Shut him down.

570
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:21,536
Alex... you can't
run from this.

571
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,494
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.

572
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,783
Show me.

573
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,199
Kim.

574
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,866
No.

575
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,241
No.

576
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:04,577
Holy Christ.
Holy Christ.

577
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,957
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

578
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,823
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

579
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,786
That's not even my brain.

580
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,788
We had to repair
the damaged areas,

581
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,582
but we didn't interfere
with your emotion

582
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,782
or your intellect.

583
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,784
Do you un... you
understand me, Alex?

584
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:39,581
You're, you're in control.

585
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,578
I'm in control?

586
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,658
Yes.

587
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,283
Okay.

588
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:53,326
If I'm in control...

589
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,449
then I want to die.

590
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,245
Just unplug whatever it is
keeping me alive

591
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,496
and end this nightmare.

592
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,616
Now, say I did that,
which, as a doctor,

593
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:08,997
would almost be impossible
for me, but, but say I did.

594
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,830
What, what, what do
I say to your wife?

595
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,494
What does she say to your son?

596
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,866
That it didn't work,
that you tried.

597
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,161
Something went wrong.

598
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:27,083
You did everything
you could, but...

599
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,290
I died.

600
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,332
So, after all
they've been through,

601
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,664
all the pain,

602
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:34,999
all their hope restored,

603
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,618
we would just rip that away?

604
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,949
Your wife loves you, Alex.

605
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,074
She signed
the consent forms herself.

606
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,034
Otherwise, y-you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

607
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,789
She loves you,

608
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,038
and she gave you
a second chance.

609
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,286
I need you

610
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,749
to take it.

611
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,875
I don't want to see myself
like this again.

612
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,744
Ever.

613
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,824
And the same goes for my family.

614
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:26,782
Just put me back in.

615
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,036
Zoom in.

616
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,448
Stop.

617
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,741
Zoom in.

618
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,366
Stop.

619
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,623
Accept the connection.

620
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,454
It's so good to finally see you.

621
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,533
I was gonna say the same thing.

622
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,454
I'm sorry.

623
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,079
I know how I must look to you.

624
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,909
I think you look beautiful.

625
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:15,083
Are they treating you okay,
baby?

626
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:17,784
So far. Dr. Norton,

627
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,993
he seems like a nice guy.

628
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,116
Does David know you're calling?

629
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,125
He misses you.

630
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,412
...I can go get him. I just...
—No.

631
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,413
I don't want him to
see me like this.

632
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,491
Not yet.

633
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,616
Sure.

634
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,166
We're gonna get
through this, baby.

635
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,533
We're gonna make it like it was.

636
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,328
When are you coming home?

637
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,995
Well, they still got some tests,

638
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,207
but they're saying it's
going really well.

639
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,290
The minute they let me.

640
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:12,659
I gotta go.

641
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,578
I love you.

642
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,658
End the connection.

643
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,906
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

644
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,659
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

645
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:45,956
Releasing proteins, fats,

646
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,124
minerals and carbs.

647
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,616
Energy inflow

648
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,333
is at 1,320 kilocalories.

649
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:00,447
Now starting
anti-inflammatory corticoids,

650
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:04,080
hormones
and antibiotic protocols.

651
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,955
Standard daily intake.

652
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:12,660
Release antidepressants.

653
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,783
Let's give him a nice dream.

654
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:26,893
All right,

655
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,018
here's what you're dealing with.

656
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:30,454
Modified M2 battle rifle.

657
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,120
.50-caliber Beowulf ammunition
at 30-round clips.

658
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,991
Three shot bursts or full auto.

659
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,494
Heavy-duty.

660
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,081
TSR 66.

661
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,783
Cartridge-driven taser pistol.

662
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,124
Each projectile releases
up to 200,000 volts.

663
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,664
It can stun,

664
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:48,124
it can kill,
and it's nasty shit.

665
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:50,540
Your armor, state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

666
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,786
.50-caliber or larger

667
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,616
can penetrate and kill.

668
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:57,531
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

669
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,666
If you sense you need a weapon
or are threatened...

670
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,911
...the visor goes down

671
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,226
and the system makes
the weapons available.

672
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,411
But you got to remember,

673
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,990
it's not the weapons that count.

674
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,661
It's who's handling them,

675
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:13,079
or in your case, what.

676
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,453
You think you can do this?

677
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,119
Oh, just stick to your job.

678
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,581
Just stick to my job?

679
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,283
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

680
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,125
Rio, Congo, you name it,
I was there.

681
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,619
Our machines run perfectly.

682
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,574
You ask me, sticking organics
into the system

683
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,125
is a huge step backwards.

684
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,851
I don't care how well
you designed this thing.

685
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:30,956
Without my sign-off,

686
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,619
it better start learning Chinese

687
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,206
'cause it ain't never
going home.

688
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,620
It's nice to meet you, too.

689
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,499
Let's do this...

690
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,832
Tin Man.

691
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,574
Quality control,

692
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,500
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

693
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,162
Rendering scenario one now.

694
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,078
Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

695
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,408
I like a little music
while I'm working.

696
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,657
All right.

697
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:11,873
All right, let's, uh,

698
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,286
let the games begin.

699
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,498
Let's rock and roll.

700
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,665
Commence scenario.

701
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:52,784
Lagging on the corners.

702
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,957
Ah, no, there, did you see that?

703
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,953
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

704
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,165
New product's afraid.

705
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:02,908
2.3 seconds behind.

706
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,783
Great.

707
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:13,956
Drop the weapon!

708
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,824
- Let the kid go.
- Oh, well,

709
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:16,471
Drop the gun.

710
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:18,059
He's worried that the
kid is gonna get hurt.

711
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,573
...Let the kid go.
—Too bad.

712
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,082
Well, there you have it.
5.6 seconds behind.

713
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,703
Scenario failure.

714
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,829
I wouldn't buy
that for a dollar.

715
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,411
Let's do it again.

716
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,867
Your funeral.

717
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,953
Detective Alex Murphy.

718
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,790

00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,956
"no longer a suspect

725
00:42:56,042 --> 00:42:57,077
due to lack of evidence."

726
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,290
"Detroit Free Press."

727
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,290
Unfortunately,
Murphy's investigation

728
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:07,288
into Antoine Vallon wasn't
authorized in the first place.

729
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:10,993
Look, Detective Murphy
was simply overzealous, okay?

730
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,490
We have absolutely no evidence

731
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,411
linking Vallon to the attempt
on his life.

732
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,457
All I'm gonna say
is my partner's a great cop,

733
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,119
and I won't rest until the men

734
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,241
who tried to kill him
are brought to justice.

735
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:23,953
What's that?

736
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:25,123
What's wrong with him?

737
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,328
No, nothing, nothing.

738
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,784
Watch the procedural bars

739
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:31,625
on the 208.

740
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,824
A machine assesses the threat

741
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,619
and acts, all right?

742
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,286
That's it.

743
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,375
It's two steps.

744
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,074
N-Now watch Alex.

745
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:43,080
The software assesses
the threat,

746
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,124
...just like the robot.
—Yeah.

747
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,290
And it sends the information
to the brain.

748
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,078
Alex's brain receives
the information

749
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,784
and decides what to do with it
based on his emotional...

750
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:52,782
- Right.
- Cognitive abilities,

751
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:53,917
like any man would.

752
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,081
-Right.
—Then the brain

753
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,955
relates this to the AI module,

754
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,407
- Yeah.
- And, uh...

755
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,082
Like, you know, a year later.

756
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,453
And our computers
finish the job.

757
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:05,905
Raymond, you-you wanted
a man inside a machine,

758
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,832
and that's what you've got,

759
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,999
but the human element
will always be present...

760
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,786
Fear, instinct, bias,

761
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,158
compassion-— they will always
interfere with the system.

762
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,623
Okay, but, Dennett...

763
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,117
I've got to give
the American people

764
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,490
something they can root for.

765
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,115
Something aspirational, right?

766
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,740
They have to believe
in this thing.

767
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,119
"Pretty good," that's not...

768
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,245
I don't know how to sell "okay."

769
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,290
We, you and I, have
got a release date,

770
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,684
and we've got to make it, okay?
So I don't care how you do it.

771
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,184
I'm asking you,
come on, can you help me?

772
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,246
Just get him to do that.

773
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,074
...Get him to do that.
—That is a machine.

774
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,643
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

775
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,157
No, that's a man
inside a machine!

776
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:41,768
- Right there!
- Right! And his life depends on it.

777
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,329
And the future
of Omnicorp depends on it.

778
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:47,120
So get your ass back to China,
and get it fixed.

779
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,537
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it.

780
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,624
It tastes like...

781
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,699
peanut butter.

782
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,908
I can't get it out of my mouth.

783
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,287
And you don't
like peanut butter?

784
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,999
No.

785
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,116
You like peanut butter, Kim?

786
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,208
I love it.

787
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,911
Mm.

788
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,619
Okay.

789
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,333
I'm gonna put you to
sleep now, Alex, okay?

790
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,324
Okay.

791
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,449
Now, put him under, Kim.

792
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,954
What are you planning to do?

793
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:41,784
Consciousness...

794
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,578
is nothing more...

795
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:46,284
than the processing
of information.

796
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,992
I'm gonna fix him,

797
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,207
and he won't know
the difference.

798
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,744
...Raymond?
—Yeah?

799
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,621
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

800
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,994
Yeah?

801
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:13,867
We call this Combat Mode.

802
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,791
It really put the fear of
God into the prisoners.

803
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,115
Yeah, that's okay.

804
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:19,908
And get a load of this.

805
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,616
What's that?

806
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,115
He transforms.

807
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,494
Kids love it.

808
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,956
Really?

809
00:46:26,042 --> 00:46:27,658
Focus group numbers
through the roof.

810
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:29,018
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

811
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:30,624
That's really embarrassing.

812
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,453
What is this?

813
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:35,245
You know what, people really
don't know what they want

814
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,290
until you show it to them
most of the time.

815
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:39,408
Make him more, uh...

816
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,582
tactical.

817
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,374
Make him look, uh...

818
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:47,491
Let's go with black.

819
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,162
Yeah.

820
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:27,625
...Alex. —He looks like
a billion dollars.

821
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,412
2.6 billion.

822
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,787
Raymond Sellars.

823
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,643
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

824
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,627
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

825
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,949
Well, we funded this program

826
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,575
to give men like you
a second chance.

827
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,749
You just do your best today.

828
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,744
...Shall we?
—Let's.

829
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,449
Mr. Sellars,
we're ready for you.

830
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,328
...Okay. Great.
—Chief Technician Shuman.

831
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,119
Morning, folks.

832
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,790
Okay,
so this is how it's gonna be.

833
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:02,162
We're going toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

834
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,624
I hit you, you go
back to the drawing board.

835
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:05,789
You hit me,

836
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,411
you get a ticket back home.

837
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,618
My guys are gonna be shooting
.47-caliber rounds.

838
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:13,580
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

839
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:16,864
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

840
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,748
Alex, listen to me.

841
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,793
The EM-2083
will try to maneuver you

842
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:37,999
so Mattox can get a clear shot.

843
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,457
Do not let that happen.

844
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,790
If Mattox hits you,

845
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:45,409
everything but your life support
will shut down.

846
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,740
You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.

847
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:49,453
I don't know about that.

848
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,574
I've been through a lot.

849
00:48:55,542 --> 00:48:57,328
All right.

850
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,824
I say we go on three.

851
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,540
Three.

852
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,539
How's it going down there?

853
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:31,285
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

854
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,165
Wow.

855
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,574
Dr. Norton,

856
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,908
how-how is he doing this?

857
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,413
His software is faster,

858
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,581
His hardware is stronger.

859
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,119
<i>He's</i> a better machine.

860
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,909
But you said
humans hesitate.

861
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,991
Only when they're
making decisions.

862
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,786
He's not making decisions?

863
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,661
Well, yes and no.

864
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,829
In his everyday life,

865
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,448
man rules over machine.

866
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,745
Alex makes his own decisions.

867
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:34,915
Now, when he engages in battle,

868
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,412
the visor comes down,
and the software

869
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,741
takes over, and, uh,
the-the machine does everything.

870
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,415
Alex is, uh,

871
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,741
he's a passenger,
just along for the ride.

872
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,559
But if the machine
is in control,

873
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,244
then how is Murphy accountable?

874
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:51,351
Who's pulling the trigger?

875
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,740
When the machine fights,

876
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,291
the system releases a signal
into Alex's brain,

877
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:56,657
making him think he's doing

878
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,282
what our computers
are actually doing.

879
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,954
I mean, Alex believes,
right now, he is in control,

880
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:03,158
but he's not.
It-It's the illusion

881
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,578
of free will.

882
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:15,373
Crap.

883
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,124
So you've circumvented the law

884
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,412
by creating a machine
that thinks it's a man,

885
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,615
but that's illegal.

886
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,824
- The...
- No... no, no, no.

887
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:47,121
It's a machine
that thinks it's Alex Murphy,

888
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:50,405
and in my book, that's legal.

889
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:53,748
Well done.

890
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,949
Well done.

891
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,323
Hey, Doctor,
what happens if I tase

892
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:04,496
an exoskeleton
with a little asshole inside?

893
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,161
I, uh,

894
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:08,954
I think we're all curious
to find out.

895
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,407
Go ahead.

896
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,447
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

897
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,829
She's been waiting four months.

898
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:55,955
I'm sure hers is, too.

899
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:59,283
You're gonna do fine.

900
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,908
I love your sign, D.

901
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,787
Hey...

902
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,491
...there's nothing
to be nervous about.

903
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,369
Thank you, Dennett.

904
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,958
It's been a privilege.

905
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,498
Hi, Dad.

906
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,665
You know I missed you, buddy.

907
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,787
Me, too.

908
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,366
Want to feel it?

909
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:27,625
What is it?

910
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,699
It's okay, sweetie.

911
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:43,534
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

912
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,658
You did?

913
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,824
-How'd they do?
—I don't know.

914
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:53,450
I've been waiting to
watch them with you.

915
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:56,034
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

916
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:59,203
But I-I can't tonight.

917
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,665
You know, 'cause Daddy's suit
needs some...

918
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,375
some special handling.

919
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,574
Do you understand?

920
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:40,657
Thanks for coming, Jack.

921
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,707
Heard you went home already.
I know Clara

922
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,164
must be thrilled
to have you back.

923
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:45,999
I saw Clara.

924
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,116
And David.

925
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,658
That ain't my home right now.

926
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,208
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

927
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,994
I'm sorry, Alex.

928
00:56:58,125 --> 00:56:59,661
Starting tomorrow,

929
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,208
I'm gonna take down Vallon
and his whole damn crew.

930
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,324
I was waiting
to hear you say that.

931
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:10,033
Least I know you're
the right color now.

932
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,207
Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today

933
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,620
certainly have not
stopped people from showing up.

934
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,075
We're expecting people
from every corner of the city

935
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,208
here in Detroit to come out
and show their support

936
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,823
for Detective Alex Murphy.

937
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,494
You know, a lot of questions

938
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,662
on people's minds today is:
What will he look like?

939
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,491
Is he a changed man?

940
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,832
Rumor has it he is
in the building,

941
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:03,998
preparing to come out.

942
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,994
Alex...

943
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,992
we're gonna upload
the entire DPD database

944
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,832
into your brain.

945
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:13,534
That means you'll have
instantaneous access

946
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:17,331
to criminal records plus
an archive of CCTV footage

947
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:19,324
from 2011 to the present.

948
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,782
All right.

949
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,491
Hit me.

950
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,831
Okay.

951
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,499
Kim, it's all yours.

952
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:29,663
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

953
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,208
Your system draws connections
automatically.

954
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:34,453
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes and give you

955
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,164
their exact locations
whenever available.

956
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:41,535
I got evidence
to make 138... no, no...

957
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,534
166 arrests.

958
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:47,830
His emotions are stable.

959
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:49,032
This is incredible.

960
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,518
You will notice

961
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:53,000
his family is here
in the building as well.

962
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,643
The mayor is
standing onstage behind me.

963
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,329
Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.

964
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:58,828
They seem like great friends,

965
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,203
obviously echoing
the partnership

966
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:01,949
that they've brought together.

967
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,329
How much longer
will this take?

968
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,559
Well, the feed from
the database is almost done,

969
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:09,166
so we're approaching
present day.

970
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,823
634 pending arrests.

971
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,791
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

972
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,036
He's on top of her.

973
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,999
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

974
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,523
...I got to do something...!
—Alex...

975
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,159
Alex, ca-calm down.

976
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,954
Take a breath; R-relax.

977
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:29,122
Kim, what are the readings?

978
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:30,828
I haven't seen him

979
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,080
- at levels like this.
- He's gonna shoot 'em. -Alex.

980
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,455
Alex, Alex, r-relax.

981
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:38,124
Relax.

982
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,661
Alex...

983
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,661
- What is this?
- This just a computer glitch?

984
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,458
No, that's his own crime scene.

985
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:45,582
- Alex.
- He's spiking

986
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,034
...all over the place.
—Alex!

987
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,434
- Alex!
- The system is crashing, Doctor.

988
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,166
Alex, can you hear me?
Alex? Alex?

989
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,393
I'm not sure
he can handle this.

990
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,518
I gotta do something.

991
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:56,158
He's emotionally ovefloaded.

992
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,498
Unlock me!

993
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,457
Alex, stop! Stop!

994
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,203
He's having a seizure!

995
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:03,290
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

996
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,036
...Get me a live feed.
—I can't do it.

997
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:06,351
...Dr. Norton's with the patient.
—Do it now!

998
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,332
Jesus Christ!

999
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,893
...Dr. Norton... Dr. Norton...
- What?!

1000
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:11,624
The press is waiting.
We have to get him

1001
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,995
- up there now.
- What do you want me to do?!

1002
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,833
I don't know... fix him!
Do what you have to do.

1003
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:20,531
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

1004
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:24,035
We're running out of time.

1005
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,374
Okay.

1006
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,992
Everybody out.

1007
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,786
Out!

1008
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,242
Mayor Durant is about to take
to the stage and introduce

1009
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,825
Detroit's newest weapon
in the war on crime.

1010
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,076
I'm, I'm actually getting word
that he's ready to go right now.

1011
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,832
Heart rate rising.

1012
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,448
He might start spiking, Doctor.

1013
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,534
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

1014
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,101
But you'll be taking
away his emotions.

1015
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,725
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

1016
01:00:51,792 --> 01:00:53,282
Doctor, you'll be taking away

1017
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,366
- his ability to feel anything.
- Now, please.

1018
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,828
Pull the footage.

1019
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:04,033
Put it on a loop.

1020
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,199
Dopamine level's at 20%.

1021
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,791
More.

1022
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,204
Dopamine level's
at ten percent.

1023
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,949
More.

1024
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,164
Dopamine level's

1025
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,490
...at five percent.
—Lower...

1026
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,995
...You're flattening him out.
—Lower.

1027
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,950
Two percent.

1028
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:24,033
Hold it there.

1029
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,541
Alex...

1030
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,658
Alex, how do you feel?

1031
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,453
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

1032
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:42,453
Well, today

1033
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:47,207
I'm not here to talk
about crime prevention.

1034
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:50,830
I am here to give you the cure!

1035
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:51,998
That's right!

1036
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,664
Hi, Dad.

1037
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,911
Dad?

1038
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,491
Ladies and gentlemen,

1039
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,957
the revolution begins right now

1040
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:17,660
with Detective Alex Murphy.

1041
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:35,042
Detective.

1042
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:52,784
He looks like a zombie.

1043
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:55,287
I think he's accessing
criminal data.

1044
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,912
Thomas King,
you are under arrest.

1045
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:25,201
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

1046
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:29,281
wanted for rape,
arson, and murder.

1047
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:33,539
This man has torn apart
American families.

1048
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:38,207
On the loose for six years.

1049
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:43,248
And where was
this criminal mastermind hiding?

1050
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:51,120
Right in front
of the police headquarters.

1051
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:56,032
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

1052
01:03:56,167 --> 01:04:00,035
These two officers
are completely unaware

1053
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:04,161
of the monster in their midst.

1054
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,208
And then, in 60 seconds...

1055
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:12,327
I repeat, just 60 seconds...

1056
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:15,990
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

1057
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,991
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

1058
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,662
one will be provided for you.

1059
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:23,663
This, my friends, is the future

1060
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,367
of American justice.

1061
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,207
How many like Thomas King

1062
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,494
will pay for their crimes

1063
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:33,664
now that RoboCop is here?

1064
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,448
Yes, let's not shy away

1065
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,658
from what this means, people.

1066
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,823
Men weren't up to the task,

1067
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,624
but Alex Murphy...

1068
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:49,576
A robot cop... was.

1069
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:50,994
We can't take him
off the street.

1070
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,289
This, this is what I'm saying.

1071
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,867
He's a hit,
a big, fat, stinking hit.

1072
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,116
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

1073
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,790
Hey, we all knew
there would be issues.

1074
01:04:58,875 --> 01:04:59,785
Uh, it's inevitable.

1075
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,161
Dennett, you're my guy.

1076
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,809
I just need you to
get a handle on this.

1077
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,323
I know, but I need more time.

1078
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:07,000
Scientifically,
w-w-we're in uncharted water.

1079
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,226
We need to take him back to
the lab and do more tests.

1080
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,866
I mean, it was like something

1081
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,786
was interfering with our system,

1082
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,458
something beyond
chemistry or physics.

1083
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,499
Like what, his soul?

1084
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,995
Hey, look, this train
has already left the station.

1085
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,366
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

1086
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,912
<i>“</i> Sorry, I released
a defective product,"

1087
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,161
so, no matter what we do,

1088
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:28,033
we just need to keep him
on the streets.

1089
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,331
Uh, what about the interviews?

1090
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,664
Cancel 'em.

1091
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:34,365
Cancel all of 'em... everything.

1092
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,868
In fact, Dennett, let's, uh,

1093
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,994
let's keep the wife
at a distance for now as well.

1094
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,994
I'd like to see him.

1095
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,994
Can you arrange that?

1096
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,994
Look, I won't lie to you.

1097
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:52,156
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

1098
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,457
I looked in his eyes
and I couldn't see my husband,

1099
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,829
and then he just shoots
a man in front of our son.

1100
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,830
That's not sedation.

1101
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:03,496
He's responding to drugs
differently now.

1102
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:07,659
We both knew, from day one...

1103
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:09,783
there would be complications.

1104
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,992
Just give me a little more time.

1105
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,541
I promise...

1106
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:22,658
you'll have your husband back.

1107
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,655
This goes for every
squad in every department.

1108
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,783
Detective Murphy
will have full access

1109
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,457
to all investigations...

1110
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:35,330
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.

1111
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,499
If he requests
to take over a case,

1112
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,494
the case will be handed to him.

1113
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,491
No arguments, no complaints.

1114
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,823
This is bullshit.

1115
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:44,658
I said no complaints,
and I mean it.

1116
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,827
Now...

1117
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:48,659
Good morning, Chief Dean.

1118
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,661
Good morning, officers.

1119
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:53,534
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

1120
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:54,953
John Biggs is target number one.

1121
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:56,282
I'll be taking over this case.

1122
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:58,992
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

1123
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,666
should be ready
to move in on my request.

1124
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,912
I wish you all a very good day.

1125
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,160
Murphy...

1126
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,332
you okay, man?

1127
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,119
I'm fine, Sergeant.

1128
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,119
Can't wait to get back to work.

1129
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,059
Lake and Daniels are in there
shitting their pants.

1130
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,541
Excuse me, I have casework.

1131
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,333
Brother.

1132
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,782
So what's this do?

1133
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,620
Don't shoot, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot!

1134
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,824
Walter Karrel, look at me.

1135
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,328
You have two options.

1136
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,498
Option one:

1137
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:32,416
I shoot you with 50,000 volts,

1138
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,822
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1139
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,325
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control,

1140
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,328
and then I arrest you.

1141
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:41,873
Option two: You tell me

1142
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,332
where John Biggs' drug lab
is located,

1143
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,000
and then I arrest you.

1144
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,871
You have two seconds to decide.

1145
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,494
Totally justifiable.

1146
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,832
We are going to make
a lot of money.

1147
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:05,701
Nothing, no fear,
no increase in heart rate,

1148
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:09,280
no traces of anger whatsoever.

1149
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,366
Congratulations, Doctor.

1150
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,540
You did it.

1151
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,574
Yes, I did.

1152
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,869
I told you, sir.

1153
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,456
Norton clearly never had

1154
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:28,953
control of the product.

1155
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:31,534
I agree,
that's why I called you here.

1156
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,864
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1157
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,867
Okay, I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head...

1158
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,458
plus full surveillance
of the lab and...

1159
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,829
You're gonna have full access
to everything.

1160
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:46,865
If anything comes up,
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1161
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,067
He brought peace

1162
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,659
to this country's
most violent city.

1163
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,953
He showed us all

1164
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:57,703
that Detroit and America

1165
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:58,993
can have a brighter future...

1166
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,874
A future of economic growth,

1167
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,161
freedom, and happiness.

1168
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,161
On tonight's show,

1169
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,322
a visionary and true patriot:

1170
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:11,365
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1171
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,198
- Hello, Pat.
- Raymond.

1172
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,664
Thanks for having me.

1173
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:18,375
You must be doing a
victory lap about now.

1174
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,491
- Well...
- Two weeks ago,

1175
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,995
Omni's stock went
through the roof,

1176
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:25,495
and the Senate
has finally agreed

1177
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,824
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1178
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:30,791
Well, look, I mean,
the tide is definitely turning.

1179
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,832
I, I just feel certain
that, soon,

1180
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,328
we'll be keeping
all Americans safe.

1181
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:35,498
I certainly hope so,

1182
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,665
but I think
our next guest will have

1183
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,790
a different point of view.

1184
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:39,990
Mm-hmm.

1185
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,665
Hubert Dreyfus.

1186
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,787
Senator, thank you
for joining us.

1187
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,206
Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.

1188
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,200
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1189
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,870
The American public is divided

1190
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,490
on the Dreyfus Act.

1191
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:57,491
Our polls at NovakElement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1192
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,493
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,

1193
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:05,118
but this bill is not
about Alex Murphy.

1194
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,996
It's about whether America
is willing to give robots

1195
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,268
the authority over human lives.

1196
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,784
No, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

1197
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,458
This, uh, sea change
we're witnessing...

1198
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:17,409
And it is a sea change... shows
that Americans don't really care

1199
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,208
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1200
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,199
What they care about
is efficiency

1201
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:23,619
and they care about safety.

1202
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,164
You're clouding the issue.

1203
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:28,000
This is clearly an attempt
to sway public opinion

1204
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,620
- with a marketing stunt.
- No, what's clear is

1205
01:12:30,708 --> 01:12:32,449
that with just one system
in place,

1206
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:33,998
we've cut crime by 80%.

1207
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,620
Just imagine if we put,
I don't know,

1208
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,059
let's say
a hundred systems in place.

1209
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,996
And then I want you
to ask yourself,

1210
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,619
why are you holding us back?

1211
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:43,934
- Is that your plan?
- Thank you, Senator.

1212
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,824
- And thank you, Raymond.
- Thank you, Pat.

1213
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:49,205
Well, there you have it.

1214
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,199
Who could argue with that?

1215
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,950
Which begs the question:

1216
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,165
<i>Has the US. Senate</i>

1217
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:59,743
become pro-crime?

1218
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,661
Yeah, hi.

1219
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,491
No, no, $5,000.

1220
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,165
Yeah, call me tomorrow.

1221
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:16,000
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1222
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,833
Vallon's waiting for you inside.

1223
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,494
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1224
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,184
- I'm out here making money.
- Yeah, no, I know.

1225
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,434
Where are my trip wires?

1226
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,994
I gotta do this myself?

1227
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,448
What took you so long?

1228
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:27,768
What the hell
is all this shit?

1229
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:28,792
I can't move any product

1230
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,617
with this thing on the streets.

1231
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,039
What are you doing
to protect me?

1232
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:35,204
Relax, the guy's
a walking zombie.

1233
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,664
Tell me your phones are off.

1234
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:37,657
He's not going after you.

1235
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,157
We covered our tracks.

1236
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,617
He can't manufacture evidence
out of thin air.

1237
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,665
If he does, I'm ready for him.

1238
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,074
Well?

1239
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,448
I've been getting calls.

1240
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:00,374
From whom?

1241
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,956
Well, Clara.

1242
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,828
You need to let her
see her husband.

1243
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:06,158
She has rights.

1244
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:07,498
That's not your decision.

1245
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,449
That's Legal's call.

1246
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:11,533
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1247
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:14,034
before she turns up
on television.

1248
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:16,158
Well, she can try.

1249
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:19,038
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1250
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,699
- I'd hop to it.
- Alex.

1251
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,541
Alex, Alex!

1252
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,624
Alex.

1253
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,540
You need to come home.

1254
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,203
Clara, please stand aside.

1255
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,449
- You need to speak to your son.
- Right now,

1256
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:35,828
I see three crimes in progress.

1257
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:37,494
- My objective...
- Alex, listen to me.

1258
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,995
I know you're in there.

1259
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,204
David won't show
his face at school.

1260
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,991
He's having nightmares.

1261
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,457
He's falling apart.

1262
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:51,158
I'm falling apart.

1263
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,333
Please.

1264
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,665
I can't do this on my own.

1265
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,953
He's been scared

1266
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,708
ever since that night.

1267
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,658
Come on, brother...!

1268
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:12,268
What do you
think she's gonna do?

1269
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:15,250
Hm. What's he gonna do?

1270
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,074
Are you okay? David...?

1271
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,992
He's supposed
to be watching this.

1272
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:07,823
Instead he's accessing
images of Clara and David

1273
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:11,285
arriving at school,
over and over again.

1274
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,958
Somehow he's overriding

1275
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,324
the system's priorities.

1276
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:27,328
Want me to shut him down?

1277
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,323
No.

1278
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,041
Not yet.

1279
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:33,158
I want to see what happens.

1280
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:55,074
What's he doing at his house?

1281
01:16:56,958 --> 01:16:58,824
Look, he's disobeying protocol.

1282
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,369
You have to shut him down.

1283
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,697
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1284
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,616
Adrian, give me an image

1285
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,665
of his brain.

1286
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:10,618
He's undoing what we did to him.

1287
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,040
His dopamine levels are
coming back to normal.

1288
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,579
How is that even possible?

1289
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,617
I haven't the faintest idea.

1290
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:21,198
Alex.

1291
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,162
Alex, please return
to the station.

1292
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,455
I want to run some tests.

1293
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:55,283
Well, this should
be interesting.

1294
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:13,343
And your phone on the table!

1295
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,351
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1296
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,661
- Wh at?
- Whoa!

1297
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,832
What'd you say?

1298
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,874
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1299
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,824
My hand, man!

1300
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,143
...Where's Antoine Vallon?
- You broke

1301
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,453
my hand, man!

1302
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:56,159
I know you remember me, Jerry.

1303
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,619
Where's Vallon?

1304
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,226
Aah!
Wait, wait, man, wait, man!

1305
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,351
If I tell you where Vallon is,

1306
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:05,161
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1307
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:06,782
Your wife left you

1308
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:09,833
in 2019 after filing charges
for domestic abuse,

1309
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,999
and you don't have a kid.

1310
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:13,448
But I do.

1311
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,323
I'm not asking again!

1312
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,458
Look, I swear, man,

1313
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,684
I don't know
where Vallon is, okay?

1314
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:20,699
The only guy I talk to is
his driver Marcus.

1315
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,164
That's it, man, that's it!

1316
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,662
Does he have a phone number?

1317
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,581
We have a problem.

1318
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,749
Alex is breaking protocol.

1319
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,036
What's he doing?

1320
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:47,534
He's off solving his own murder.

1321
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:50,455
Oh, that is genius.

1322
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:52,533
Why didn't I think of that?

1323
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:01,119
How long till he gets here?

1324
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:03,370
All right.

1325
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,161
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

1326
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,833
What happened?

1327
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:11,330
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

1328
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:14,075
Shit.

1329
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:23,207
All right, everyone, listen up!

1330
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,539
He's coming.

1331
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:28,865
He leaves alive, you don't.

1332
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,286
How do we stop him?

1333
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,658
.50-caliber and above.

1334
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,206
Aim for the head.

1335
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:48,115
This one's set!

1336
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,664
Go! Go!

1337
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:54,203
Come on. Come on!

1338
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:57,542
Ready to go!

1339
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,494
They're all set.

1340
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:29,165
Finish it!

1341
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,707
Freak! Die!

1342
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:35,369
Watch out.

1343
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,706
Need me to call a doctor?

1344
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,165
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

1345
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:42,874
What's going on?
What the hell you doing here?

1346
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,360
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

1347
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:46,074
Nah, Daniels, bad cop, RoboCop.

1348
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,499
I've recovered 26 guns

1349
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:51,664
from Vallon's warehouse.

1350
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,990
13 serial numbers

1351
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,665
match weapons missing
from Evidence,

1352
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,059
and I got your prints
all over them.

1353
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,824
This is bullshit.

1354
01:24:57,917 --> 01:24:58,952
I also have

1355
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,040
CCTV footage of you and Vallon

1356
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:02,498
the same day he
tried to kill me.

1357
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:04,165
So put him on the payroll.

1358
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:06,143
- ...Why we talking about this?
- It won't work.

1359
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,226
Now that his partner got hit,
he's never gonna let it go.

1360
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,832
- What is that?
- Lewis's hospital.

1361
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,448
Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.

1362
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,059
If I kill a cop, I'm looking
over my shoulder.

1363
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:14,363
I kill a cop,
I'm looking over...

1364
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:15,817
You know what they do to cops

1365
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,832
in prison, man?
Being locked up

1366
01:25:17,917 --> 01:25:19,373
with the same dudes
you put in there?

1367
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,351
I kill a cop,
I'm looking over my shoulder

1368
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,160
the rest of my life.

1369
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,250
If I kill a cop...

1370
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,994
How long you think
before he gives you up?

1371
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,283
Don't shoot me.

1372
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:32,208
Okay?

1373
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:34,704
I swear to Christ, it was Dean.

1374
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,369
She helped pull those guns.

1375
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:39,450
Just don't shoot me.

1376
01:25:39,542 --> 01:25:41,249
Thank you for your cooperation.

1377
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,415
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1378
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,791
Now, I know why
we couldn't get an arrest.

1379
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:59,663
'Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1380
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:01,999
Alex, I can explain.

1381
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,365
You tipped him off today.

1382
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,581
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

1383
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,449
You tried to kill me twice.

1384
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,658
I trusted you,

1385
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,206
and you destroyed my family.

1386
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,665
Confess.

1387
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,661
Now, in front of everyone.

1388
01:26:14,792 --> 01:26:15,657
Confess!

1389
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:26,542
What happened?

1390
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,768
Tin Man is down.

1391
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:28,827
Had to be done.

1392
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:29,952
Why?

1393
01:26:30,042 --> 01:26:31,373
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1394
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,956
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

1395
01:26:33,042 --> 01:26:35,625
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 News.

1396
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,995
- We got anything on her?
- Well, she's, uh,

1397
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,763
the Chief of the Detroit
Police Department.

1398
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,200
What do you think?

1399
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:47,158
You know what?

1400
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:50,865
This might actually tip
this thing right into the net.

1401
01:26:57,667 --> 01:27:00,500
Alex, I don't know
if you can hear me,

1402
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:04,497
but tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers

1403
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,662
inside the Detroit
Police Department.

1404
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,287
And in so doing, you shed light

1405
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:12,117
on an invaluable truth.

1406
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,619
Even the police,

1407
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,324
the men and women

1408
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:18,330
who swore to keep us safe,

1409
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:20,540
they can be bribed.

1410
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:23,242
They... can be bought.

1411
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,162
Machines, however,

1412
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:29,659
are corruption-free.

1413
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,538
Americans could be living
in a country

1414
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:35,989
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1415
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,996
but incorruptible.

1416
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,040
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done,

1417
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:43,204
and for all that you are.

1418
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:46,655
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1419
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:49,495
Our doctors are
working ceaselessly

1420
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:52,496
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1421
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,199
Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt

1422
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,290
on Detective Alex Murphy's life

1423
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:00,662
will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?

1424
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,536
At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern

1425
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:05,125
is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.

1426
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:07,495
How many times
does Detective Murphy

1427
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,500
have to give his life
for his country?

1428
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:14,163
I sincerely hope

1429
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,158
the Senate makes
the right vote tomorrow,

1430
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,991
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices

1431
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,825
will not have been in vain.

1432
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:27,290
Senator Dreyfus is my friend.

1433
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,493
He has been
my mentor and my strength

1434
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,494
in times of difficulty
on this floor.

1435
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,996
But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio

1436
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,371
and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.

1437
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,491
So I vote yes.

1438
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:43,491
The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.

1439
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,291
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

1440
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,831
Yeah, I spoke to
the Senate liaison,

1441
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,665
and it looks like
it's in the bag.

1442
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:52,162
But we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1443
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:56,533
We're here live
at DPD headquarters

1444
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,999
where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.

1445
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,494
What the hell?

1446
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:03,450
Omnicorp has denied me
and my son

1447
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:05,158
access to Alex for weeks.

1448
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:08,455
I demand to know why.

1449
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:10,704
This treatment is inhuman,

1450
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:13,825
and somebody needs
to be held accountable.

1451
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,199
- Thank you.
- Oh, we're fucked.

1452
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:18,828
No, we only need 12 votes.

1453
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,184
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1454
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,434
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1455
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,789
We... I mean,

1456
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,434
those two should not
be allowed contact.

1457
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:27,120
If-if she starts putting ideas
in his head...

1458
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:28,369
Bring her in.

1459
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,601
I'll handle the explanation.

1460
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:30,706
And what about Alex?

1461
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,323
You know, unfortunately,

1462
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:33,873
we can't just keep him on ice.

1463
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,619
The shooting
at the station

1464
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,164
spooked some of the politicians.

1465
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,659
They're our clients;
We have to take care of them.

1466
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,033
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1467
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:45,285
but when a man
is investigating city politics,

1468
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,831
they get nervous.

1469
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,995
All right, first off,
it's not a man, okay?

1470
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,699
It's property of Omnicorp.

1471
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:53,495
And politics are the
least of your concern.

1472
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,199
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1473
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:56,494
How long till it realizes

1474
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,893
you haven't been
on the level with it?

1475
01:29:57,917 --> 01:29:59,624
If that happens,
every journalist

1476
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,308
in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1477
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:03,707
I mean, we-we created a hero.

1478
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:07,291
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1479
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,492
What's bigger than a hero?

1480
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,830
A dead hero.

1481
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,616
Get me Dr. Norton.

1482
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,914
What is this, Raymond?

1483
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,241
You have Mattox spying on me

1484
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,620
and now this bullshit
about a "critical condition"?

1485
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,741
You know and I know

1486
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:50,119
Alex is fine!

1487
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,456
Calm down.

1488
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,618
What... Dennett.

1489
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,976
Your work is so good, I don't...

1490
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,351
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1491
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:56,456
You saw the woman on TV!

1492
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,245
This has to stop!

1493
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,536
You're right.

1494
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,283
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1495
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:08,250
What kind of life have we really
given Alex Murphy?

1496
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,949
He's never gonna be
a normal man,

1497
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:11,828
a father, a husband.

1498
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:14,120
By the time we put
the other units on the street,

1499
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,582
he's just... Dennett...

1500
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,666
Let's face it.

1501
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:23,580
We failed him.

1502
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,328
We failed Alex Murphy.

1503
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:27,297
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1504
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:29,116
because that's
what we're talking about.

1505
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,742
The work you've done with him
is gonna be studied for decades.

1506
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,949
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1507
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:37,121
No policeman
is ever going to die

1508
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,448
in the line of duty again

1509
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,874
because of you.

1510
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:44,366
Think about that.

1511
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:54,409
I want that family

1512
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,413
taken care of
beyond their wildest dreams.

1513
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,615
We owe them that.

1514
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,164
I agree.

1515
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:02,499
I want full funding

1516
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,115
for ten years.

1517
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,245
New staff, all my own people.

1518
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,119
Fantastic.

1519
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,661
Deal.

1520
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:21,124
Hey, what's going on?

1521
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,285
Security's here.

1522
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,623
They're clearing everyone out.

1523
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,286
They're not waking him up.

1524
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,457
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1525
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,184
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1526
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:31,996
The voting period has ended.

1527
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,165
The clerks have
tabulated the results.

1528
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:37,125
The yeas are 63.

1529
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,957
The nays are 22.

1530
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,825
A majority of senators
have voted in the affirmative.

1531
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:44,575
The Dreyfus Act
has been repealed

1532
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:45,956
by Congress.

1533
01:32:52,042 --> 01:32:54,158
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1534
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:55,327
This is Mattox.

1535
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:57,074
<i>Bennett's on board.</i>

1536
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:59,158
It's about time.

1537
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,574
Call it.

1538
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:07,123
Get it done.

1539
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,199
My pleasure.

1540
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:18,865
Mrs. Murphy...

1541
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,494
You can come here
as much as you want.

1542
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,956
You can threaten me.

1543
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,518
You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1544
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,309
But I am not gonna stop
till I see my husband.

1545
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,619
Do you understand that?

1546
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:30,038
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1547
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,786
Is Alex okay?

1548
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,786
He has important information
to share with you.

1549
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:37,329
Will you accompany me?

1550
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,832
David.

1551
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:41,958
We gotta go.

1552
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,164
Can you grab your coat?

1553
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,823
Hey.

1554
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:47,434
I'm in the elevator,
on my way down.

1555
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:48,994
I need access to the lab.

1556
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,309
That's insane;
They're still here.

1557
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,744
Distract them.

1558
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,449
Okay.

1559
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
|cannot...!

1560
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:58,120
There's a lady in here
going hysterical.

1561
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,268
She will not let us in;
She's got the code for the door.

1562
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,476
I repeat:
She will not let us in.

1563
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,851
Lady, you need to let us
in there now.

1564
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,286
We have to get in there.

1565
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,976
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1566
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,786
Do you want to be responsible
for the deaths

1567
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,934
of everyone in this building?

1568
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:09,958
Hey! Stop!

1569
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:15,167
Don't shoot.

1570
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,575
Step outside.

1571
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,411
Unlock the transmitter!

1572
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,707
Transmitter unlocked.

1573
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,617
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1574
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,411
Right away, sir.

1575
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:42,074
Wake him up!

1576
01:34:42,167 --> 01:34:45,489
Alex! Alex!

1577
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:46,625
Alex, it's Dr. Norton.

1578
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:48,745
You have to wake up!

1579
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:50,449
Alex, can you hear me?

1580
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:52,907
These men are here to kill us.

1581
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,456
They're here to kill us,

1582
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:56,328
for Christ sakes!

1583
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,786
Mrs. Murphy, last night,

1584
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,661
Alex had a psychotic break.

1585
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,749
He killed an unarmed colleague

1586
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,074
and later suffered a seizure.

1587
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,750
We did everything...

1588
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,619
Everything... we could,

1589
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,028
but the doctors
couldn't save him.

1590
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:17,790
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1591
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,908
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1592
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,412
You shut me down.

1593
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,116
I was about to get a confession.

1594
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,618
Mattox shut you down.

1595
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:28,914
I've removed your transmitter,

1596
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,616
so he won't do it again.

1597
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:33,788
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1598
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:36,367
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1599
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,415
He wants you dead, Alex.

1600
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,116
You understand?

1601
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,768
Sorry. If there's anything

1602
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:43,954
we can do for you and
David, we'll do it.

1603
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:46,659
I want nothing from you.

1604
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:48,328
I understand.

1605
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,870
You stay out of our lives.

1606
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,824
You and your company.

1607
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,824
If that's what
you think is best.

1608
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:57,665
There's one more thing.

1609
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:59,999
I think it would be to
the benefit of everyone,

1610
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,365
especially David,

1611
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,790
if we kept this matter private.

1612
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,833
We don't want to damage
Alex's legacy.

1613
01:36:08,042 --> 01:36:09,783
Alex.

1614
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:10,998
Alex!

1615
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,331
I can fix this!

1616
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:13,573
You lied to me.

1617
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:15,453
You lied to my wife.

1618
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:17,393
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1619
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:18,601
You want me to
trust you, Doctor?

1620
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:20,741
Alex, I can go to the press!

1621
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:24,121
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1622
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,996
Alex!

1623
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:30,083
Listen to me, please!

1624
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:31,407
Alex!

1625
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,491
Alex...!

1626
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:46,199
What the hell...?

1627
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,559
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1628
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,268
and for Christ sakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1629
01:36:57,292 --> 01:36:58,157
Roger that.

1630
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:01,159
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1631
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:03,624
Look at this city.

1632
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,287
So beautiful.

1633
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:10,742
It's become so peaceful.

1634
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:16,325
I wish...

1635
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,790
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1636
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,331
I have very sad news.

1637
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:21,573
Despite our best efforts

1638
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:23,749
to save him,

1639
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,291
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1640
01:37:26,417 --> 01:37:27,623
Alex Murphy was...

1641
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,286
Mr. Sellars.

1642
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:31,283
- What is it?
- Mattox just called.

1643
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:33,533
We need to you to come
with us now.

1644
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:41,559
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1645
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:42,663
What are you talking about?

1646
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:44,028
We have
a security situation here.

1647
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:45,601
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1648
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,726
Sir, there's a car
outside that's...

1649
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:47,911
That area is locked down.

1650
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,120
- Now go.
- What's happening?

1651
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,119
I said go!

1652
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,412
I want to talk to Mr. Sellars.

1653
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:57,282
Mr. Sellars.

1654
01:37:57,417 --> 01:37:59,657
- How close is that helicopter?
- About ten minutes, sir.

1655
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:18,619
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1656
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,661
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1657
01:38:20,792 --> 01:38:21,832
- Yes.
- It's an emergency.

1658
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:22,957
Stand by.

1659
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,081
Mr. Sellars.

1660
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:25,657
Apparently there's
a Clara Murphy

1661
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:26,998
in the lobby.

1662
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:28,581
Uh, Raymond, if she sees him,

1663
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:30,476
- we are dead in the water.
- What do you want to do?

1664
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,161
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1665
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:33,453
Yes, sir.

1666
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,454
Norton said they may be

1667
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:39,953
using drones for protection.

1668
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:42,415
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1669
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,241
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed.

1670
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:46,370
...Clear?
—Clear. —Clear.

1671
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,123
Hold it right there!

1672
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,268
...coming your way.

1673
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,292
Don't move!

1674
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:10,124
This is private property.

1675
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,208
You are not authorized
to be here!

1676
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,018
I'd put those guns down now

1677
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:19,373
if I were you.

1678
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,786
Stand down. Stand down.

1679
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:22,908
All right, man,
we're good We're good!

1680
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:24,792
Let's go! Back it up!

1681
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,250
Head to the lower level.

1682
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:12,374
Hold up! Hold up!
—Ram it!

1683
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:14,167
Gun it!

1684
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:17,536
Go, go, go, now!

1685
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:33,948
Alex, run!

1686
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:36,871
Omnicorp Security!

1687
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,518
- Drop your weapons!
- Drop your weapon.

1688
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:41,330
Keep your hands above your head,

1689
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:42,948
and no one will be harmed.

1690
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:59,073
What's going on?

1691
01:41:59,167 --> 01:42:01,408
Mrs. Murphy, I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1692
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,300
The organic part
of your husband Alex is dead.

1693
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:06,325
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1694
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:07,768
and he's shooting up
the building.

1695
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:09,282
So we've got to get you
and your son

1696
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:10,456
out of here right away.

1697
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:13,330
I've got to take this call.

1698
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,101
He just left the lobby,
and he's headed our way.

1699
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:16,615
Roger that, sir.

1700
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,956
Don't shoot.

1701
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,289
My robot. You just flank.

1702
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:21,366
...Got it.
—Tin Man!

1703
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:25,448
Tin Man?

1704
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:28,291
Tin Man.

1705
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,615
Oh, there it is.

1706
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,741
You look like crap.

1707
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,448
What's the matter?

1708
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:36,828
Can't shoot?

1709
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,164
Huh?

1710
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:40,829
What were you thinking?

1711
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,414
This isn't a drill.

1712
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,500
You're a robot.

1713
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,786
I'm a red asset.

1714
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:45,956
Wrote that myself.

1715
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:47,824
What do you think?

1716
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:50,996
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1717
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:53,116
Pull it.

1718
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:54,414
You can run.

1719
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Go on.

1720
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:57,073
Run.

1721
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,456
Run!

1722
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,448
There you go.

1723
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:00,664
Run.

1724
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:02,533
Run. Run!

1725
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,635
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

1726
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:11,663
Aren't you lucky I didn't have
my gun set to "kill"?

1727
01:43:13,542 --> 01:43:15,624
Hey, listen...

1728
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:18,166
this isn't personal.

1729
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,158
Well, maybe a little.

1730
01:43:20,292 --> 01:43:23,739
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1731
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,822
Helicopter's approaching.

1732
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:38,164
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1733
01:43:38,292 --> 01:43:39,623
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy,

1734
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,366
you and your son
can get on first.

1735
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:47,954
Officer down.

1736
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:49,123
Mechanical room.

1737
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,911
Omnicorp Building.

1738
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,116
Roger that. EMS on the way.

1739
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:55,287
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1740
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:57,412
Nonfatal.

1741
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,662
Go. Go.

1742
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:03,415
Omni-LZ Helo One
on approach to deck.

1743
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,207
What's that?

1744
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,309
- He's got a gun.
- What?

1745
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:15,373
Pull up! Pull up!

1746
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:21,292
What the hell's he doing?

1747
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:22,623
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1748
01:44:27,667 --> 01:44:29,203
Alex?

1749
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:30,202
Dad?

1750
01:44:33,292 --> 01:44:35,875
Clara, David.

1751
01:44:35,958 --> 01:44:38,575
No, wait-wait-wait. Wait.

1752
01:44:38,667 --> 01:44:40,032
Get out of the way.

1753
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:42,036
- Alex, put down the gun.
- Clara,

1754
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,605
take David
and get out of the way now!

1755
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:46,744
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1756
01:44:46,833 --> 01:44:48,619
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1757
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:53,248
Are you here to cuff me?

1758
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,911
All right.

1759
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:57,204
Go ahead, cuff me.

1760
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:59,374
You can't.

1761
01:44:59,458 --> 01:45:00,789
You're not programmed that way.

1762
01:45:00,917 --> 01:45:02,203
If you go against the program,

1763
01:45:02,292 --> 01:45:04,124
the entire system
shuts down, so...

1764
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,036
You don't even have a warrant.

1765
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:08,018
- We'll overlook this little...
- Get down on the ground and put

1766
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:10,143
- your hands behind your back.
- I-I'm just from Marketing.

1767
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:11,287
- Now!
- Okay, yep, yep, yep.

1768
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:12,573
Yep.

1769
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:14,059
Alex, we need
to work together here.

1770
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,074
Because I'm the only one

1771
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:18,750
with the technology
to keep you alive.

1772
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,908
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1773
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:28,198
All right.

1774
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,124
Weapon.

1775
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:31,869
Alex, honestly,

1776
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,414
I mean you no harm.

1777
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:34,703
If I wanted to,

1778
01:45:34,792 --> 01:45:36,374
I could have killed you
along time ago.

1779
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:38,018
I just aim this right
at your head and blow it off.

1780
01:45:38,042 --> 01:45:39,248
Sellars, please!

1781
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,536
Don't!

1782
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:41,976
I mean, if I wanted to,
I could just

1783
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,241
aim this at your little family,

1784
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:46,082
and I could just kill them too.

1785
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:47,893
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it,

1786
01:45:47,917 --> 01:45:49,783
because, let's face it...

1787
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:51,874
you're a robot.

1788
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:54,666
Do you understand that?

1789
01:45:58,167 --> 01:45:59,202
Alex...

1790
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,286
Dad!

1791
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,573
Baby.

1792
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,790
Hey...

1793
01:46:16,917 --> 01:46:20,205
Hey... everything's
gonna be all right.

1794
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,291
Everything's gonna be all right.

1795
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,578
How are you feeling, Alex?

1796
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:19,457
I'm ready.

1797
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:58,366
He's ready.

1798
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,081
There's still no word

1799
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:37,081
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

1800
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:40,535
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1801
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,208
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

1802
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:46,455
But we have obtained
exclusive video

1803
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,073
taken by cell phone

1804
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,449
that shows the people of Detroit

1805
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:52,745
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

1806
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:55,242
sooner than they think.

1807
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:58,697
The real tragedy here is that

1808
01:48:58,792 --> 01:49:03,116
our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1809
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:06,743
Now, I have no doubt
he was manipulated

1810
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,912
by our biased media

1811
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:12,205
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

1812
01:49:12,292 --> 01:49:16,411
I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.

1813
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:20,285
But I do believe
my research program is sound.

1814
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:23,165
What I did With it...

1815
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,207
...was wrong.

1816
01:49:26,292 --> 01:49:28,124
The fact that
this mother

1817
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:32,073
Is not serving time
in some Federal penitentiary

1818
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:36,156
is a huge, hot, heaping pile
of horse!

1819
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,457
Now I know some of you may think

1820
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:46,371
that this kind
of thinking is dangerous

1821
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:48,620
and these machines violate

1822
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,411
your civil liberties.

1823
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:54,365
Some of you even believe that
the use of these drones overseas

1824
01:49:54,458 --> 01:49:56,870
makes us the same kind

1825
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,790
of bullying imperialists

1826
01:49:58,917 --> 01:50:02,239
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1827
01:50:02,375 --> 01:50:05,208
To you, I say,

1828
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:08,743
stop whining!

1829
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:11,913
America is now,

1830
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,583
and always will be,

1831
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:18,576
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1832
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:25,700
I'm Pat Novak.

1833
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,908
Good night.
