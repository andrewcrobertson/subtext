1
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:46,976
On your feet!

2
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,481
You were alone?

3
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:23,709
Spy, you were alone?

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,333
I like to be alone.

5
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,375
What did you come here for?

6
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,709
You got a lot of nice stuff.

7
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,166
Other people's stuff.

8
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,000
"To the victor
belongs the spoils."

9
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,417
"To the victor"?

10
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,875
Berlin's in rubble.

11
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,709
The Führer's in hiding.

12
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,625
You lost.

13
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,542
What? What? Hey!

14
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,792
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

15
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Doctor.

16
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,184
Looks like
they're leaving

17
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,500
without you guys.

18
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,917
Tell us your story, or die.

19
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,041
Story. Um...

20
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,792
Okay, okay.

21
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,709
Well...

22
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,250
it all started

23
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,000
once upon a time,
when this village

24
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:42,709
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together

25
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,875
and follow this sweaty
little pied piper

26
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,709
named Adolf...

27
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,500
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

28
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,166
Oh, my!

29
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,959
Get off of me!

30
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,518
There's one reason

31
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,041
you're still alive, birdwatcher.

32
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,125
Who sent you?

33
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,458
What was your mission?

34
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,625
Please, Colonel, no.
I beg you.

35
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,083
My name is Basil Shaw.

36
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,333
I'm a professor at Oxford.

37
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,834
An archeologist.

38
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,417
There you are.

39
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,542
I have a daughter. I beg you.

40
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,917
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

41
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,208
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

42
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,792
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

43
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>We were told
that the Lance of Longinus</i>

44
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,917
could be found at the fortress.

45
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,250
We were looking for it.

46
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
Why?

47
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,333
Because of its power?

48
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,166
It has no power.

49
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,458
My friend and I
were trying to save history.

50
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,625
It's a fake.

51
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,267
Twelfth century.

52
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,500
Thirteenth century.

53
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,792
Ramesses II.

54
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,917
None of this stuff is fake.

55
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,375
I gotta stop this train.

56
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,834
Too many Nazis.

57
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:03,917
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

58
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,792
What the hell?

59
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,083
Indy?

60
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,166
Baz?

61
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
You're alive!

62
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,208
So far.

63
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,291
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

64
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,417
What sort of a man
hides in a hedge

65
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
while his friend
is facing death?

66
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,500
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

67
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,709
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

68
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,792
Did you at least find the Lance?

69
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
"At least"?

70
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,518
Well, have you got it?

71
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,375
- It's a fake.
- What?

72
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,375
A reproduction.

73
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,583
Indy?

74
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,834
The Antikythera.

75
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,667
Archimedes' Dial.

76
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,208
Bring it.

77
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:45,041
Hurry up, Baz.

78
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,333
Give me that.

79
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,625
Come on.

80
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,875
Get up, Baz.

81
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,250
Follow me.

82
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,208
Towards the gun?

83
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,667
Away from the Nazis!

84
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,041
Those are Nazis!

85
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,583
Get down! Down! Down!

86
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,000
This way. Come on!

87
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,583
I can't do that!

88
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,667
You wanna stop
for a little lie-down?

89
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,250
Easy.

90
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,166
Tunnel!

91
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,559
Got you! No!

92
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,166
Indy!

93
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,458
Get the gun!

94
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,041
Shoot him!

95
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,041
Not me!

96
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,166
S-Sorry.

97
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
To the victor go the spoils.

98
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,959
Indy!

99
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,750
Hey!

100
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,166
- Here!
- They can't hear you, Baz.

101
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,083
We gotta jump!

102
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,583
What about my dicky knee?

103
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,291
Ahh!

104
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:49,542
Baz!

105
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Baz!

106
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,375
Baz!

107
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,375
- Indy!
- Baz!

108
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,291
Go! Move! Move it!

109
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,792
Bit rum to go home
empty-handed after all that.

110
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,583
"Empty-handed"?

111
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,875
Not exactly.

112
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,000
Archimedes' Dial.

113
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,208
Well, half of it.

114
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,583
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

115
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,250
<i>Roll up, roll up
for the Magical Mystery Tour</i>

116
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,166
<i>Step right this way</i>

117
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,041
<i>Roll up</i>

118
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,959
<i>Roll up for the Mystery Tour</i>

119

<i>Roll up for the Mystery Tour</i>

121
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,458
<i>- Roll up

122
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,875
<i>Roll up for the...</i>

123
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,583
Larry! Turn it down!

124
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,875
Turn it down!

125
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,875
Hey, Larry!

126
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:37,083
<i>The Magical Mystery Tour

127
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,333

00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:46,500
<i>Roll up
Roll up for the Mystery Tour</i>

129
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,583
Larry!

130
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,083
Larry!

131
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,709
- Hi, Mr. Jones.
- Where's Larry?

132
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,121
- Who is this guy?
- It's the old guy next door.

133
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,875
Larry, it's 8:00
in the morning.

134
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,417
- "It's 8:00 in the morning."
- We talked about this, Larry.

135
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,625
Yeah, but that was

136
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,166
- a workday, Mr. Jones.
- This is a workday too, Larry!

137
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,709
Turn on the news.

138
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,917
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

139
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,583
Moon day?

140
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:27,834
<i>And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear</i>

141
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:35,375
<i>Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare</i>

142
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:42,000

146
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,041
Thanks.

147
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,250
All you really need to remember

148
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,000
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized

149
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:27,125
by this complex
blue-line pattern.

150
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,291
Okay?

151
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,750
I assigned pages 131 through 171

152
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,542
in Winford for today.

153
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,208
Anybody do the reading?

154
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Anyone?

155
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,333
This is on the test.

156
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,709
Okay.

157
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,917
Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.

158
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,417
In 213 BC,

159
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,583
Roman forces led by Marcellus

160
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,583
laid siege
to the city of Syracuse.

161
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,458
"Syracuse."

162
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,500
Not the Syracuse
in New York, Tonya.

163
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,250
The one in Sicily.

164
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,417
Amongst the defenders
of the city

165
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:13,667
was its most famous resident,
who was...

166
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,583
Come on, guys.
This is on the final.

167
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,875
Archimedes.

168
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,792
Archimedes.

169
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,291
Archimedes, who was a...

170
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,583
A mathematician.

171
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,917
A mathematician.

172
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,667
But more than that, an inventor,

173
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:31,333
a brilliant engineer

174
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,917
who conceived of a way

175
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,792
to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun

176
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,709
on concave mirrors and focus it

177
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,542
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

178
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:45,208
Who devised giant iron claws

179
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,959
that could snatch hostiles
from the sea.

180
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,417
But how do we know
it really happened?

181
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:58,542
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence

182
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:02,041
- is there of these inventions?
- The Antikythera.

183
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,583
- The Antikythera.
- For starters.

184
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,750
They're here!
They're downtown!

185
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,041
The astronauts.

186
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:13,625
<i>Giant parade</i>
<i>this morning will be seen</i>

187
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,417

two and a half million people</i>

188
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,834
<i>lining the sidewalks...</i>

189
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,291
He's coming.
He's come. See?

190
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,875
Oh, here he comes.

191
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,875
Hide the cake.

192
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,667
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

193
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,959
For over a decade now,
our colleague Dr. Jones

194
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,625
has been a loyal servant
of Hunter.

195
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,625
A token of our gratitude.

196
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,750
Wow.

197
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:56,166
Thanks for putting up with me.

198
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,709
Here.

199
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,434
<i>Astronauts</i>
<i>Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,</i>

200
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,333
<i>and Buzz Aldrin will not be
able to avoid the spotlight.</i>

201
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,417
<i>At 11:00 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time,</i>

202
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,208
<i>a grateful nation
will pay homage</i>

203
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,000
<i>with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago,</i>

204
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,667
<i>climaxed by a dinner
in Los Angeles...</i>

205
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:35,166
What would the ancients say?

206
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,417
<i>Neil, Buzz, and Mike...</i>

207
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,333
If they knew
we walked on the moon?

208
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,041
Speaking as an ancient,

209
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,667
going to the moon
is like going to Reno.

210
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,125
Middle of nowhere

211
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,834
and no blackjack.

212
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,500
You don't recognize me, do you?

213
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,875
Whatever I did, I apologize.

214
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:57,875
It's Helena.

215
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,500
Helena Shaw.

216
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,625
Wombat?

217
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,333
Wow, I haven't
heard that in a while.

218
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,625
- You got tall.
- I did.

219
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:09,083
It's fair to say.

220
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,291
I'm celebrating.

221
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,625
- I'm retiring.
- Oh.

222
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,925
Wow. Well, in that case,
what are we drinking?

223
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,792
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

224
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,434
Put that away.

225
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,000
I was asking how you broke
your ankle.

226
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,226
- None of your business.
- Are you Mr. Schmidt?

227
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,375
"Doctor" Schmidt.
He's in there.

228
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,041
And he don't eat anything
on wheels,

229
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,333
so put it on a table.

230
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,559
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>

231
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,750
<i>I always imagined</i>

232
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:56,625
<i>that one day
man would walk on the moon.</i>

233
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,291
<i>And by golly...</i>

234
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,625
Quite a celebration
out there, hmm?

235
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,542
The man you're servin',

236
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,000
he's the one who put
those astronauts on the moon.

237
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,406
Built the rockets they rode in.

238
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,875
Congratulations.

239
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,125
Where are you from?

240
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,125
The Bronx, sir.

241
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,166
No, no. I mean originally,
your people.

242
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,333
Do you know?

243
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,667
I was born
by Yankee Stadium, sir.

244
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,083
And you fought for your country?

245
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,458
320th Battalion.

246
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,000
Set up balloons to stop
the planes bombing Normandy.

247
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,333
And are you enjoying
your victory?

248
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,566
Will there be
anything else?

249
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,000
You didn't win the war.

250
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,792
Hitler lost it.

251
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,500
Yeah.

252
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,208
My field agent, she found Shaw.

253
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,417
Yeah, I'm comin'.

254
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,583
Let's go, Hauke.

255
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,166
Where are we here?

256
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,750
Oxford. In the garden.

257
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,333
He was an original.

258
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,166
I just graduated.

259
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,333
In Archeology.

260
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,458
Archeology. Wow.

261
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,166
Apple didn't fall far.

262
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,041
Well, now I'm researching
a doctorate.

263
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,770
What's your subject?

264
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,041
The Archimedes Dial.

265
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:47,125
The Antikythera.

266
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,417
What do you know about that?

267
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,291
Well, for starters,

268
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,834
in 1902, Greek sponge divers
found a wrecked Roman warship,

269
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,375
huge, off the coast of Greece.

270
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,709
Below deck, sealed in wax,

271
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,417
was a clock-like mechanism,

272
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,375
finely tooled, purpose unknown.

273
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,417
Nothing approximating
its complexity

274
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
appears in the world
for 1,000 years.

275
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,792
- You've done your homework.
- Well, not me.

276
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,375
Dad. He had
all these journals,

277
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,000
reams of notes about it.

278
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,000
He was obsessed till the end.

279
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,834
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

280
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:28,375
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

281
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,333
Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.

282
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,959
And it was only half the Dial.

283
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,226
- Archimedes...
- Archimedes broke the Dial...

284
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,935
- disassembled it.
- In two, and then hid

285
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,101
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

286
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,333
I know. Look.

287
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,417
You don't remember the last
time I saw you, do you?

288
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,083
Remember what?

289
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,166
These are the Alps.

290
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,208
Yeah, I see.

291
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,125
And this is the route
that your train took

292
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,250
from the Nazi stronghold

293
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,333
- in '44.
- Right.

294
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,291
It went through
this mountain pass,

295
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,000
and then here.

296
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,000
Here, it's the only river
on the route.

297
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,625
- Right.
- Under a bridge.

298
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,166
It's down there.
It's got to be.

299
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,750
- And nobody knows except us.
- "Us"?

300
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,542
Well, I mean, you.

301
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,250
And me. So, yeah.

302
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,250
- Us.
- Us.

303
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,750
And what were you
thinking exactly?

304
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,291
Well, that maybe...

305
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,667
we could go there.

306
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:21,875
And?

307
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,125
And find it. And...

308
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,667
And I'd become...

309
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,458
famous.

310
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,917
Oh, well, not famous.
Renowned. Feted.

311
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,291
A feted archeologist.

312
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,166
And you, a final triumph!

313
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,375
Indiana Jones!

314
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,500
Out with a bang!
Back in the saddle!

315
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm not selling this, am I?

316
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,709
Wombat...

317
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,667
why are you chasing the thing

318
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,500
that drove your father crazy?

319
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,875
Wouldn't you?

320
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,125
I got it.

321
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,328
Parade's comin' soon.

322
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,250
So, what we got?

323
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,375
She's in there, third floor,
with an old guy.

324
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,667
Who is he, a Russian?

325
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,750
No, a professor.
Dr. Henry Jones.

326
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:33,834
Klaber!

327
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,417
Klaber, get back here!
You're not an agent!

328
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,875
God damn it! Go.

329
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,625
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

330
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,542
This way.

331
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,750
Basil became obsessed
by this German theory.

332
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,709
Conjecture, really.

333
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,875
Archimedes had figured out

334
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,959
that the movements
of the moon and planets

335
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,041
weren't perfect.

336
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,792
There were irregularities
in their rotations.

337
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,250
He thought these
irregularities might

338
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:04,792
explain fluctuations
in temperature, tides.

339
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,208
Storms, even.

340
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:12,458
So, he set about building
a device to predict them.

341
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,959
But then, he stumbled upon

342
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,083
a method to predict even larger

343
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:19,834
disturbances.

344
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,125
Larger disturbances?

345
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,000
Your father
thought this thing could

346
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,959
predict fissures in time.

347
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,679
Hauke, if you don't...

348
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,083
Found 'em.

349
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,709
Hello.

350
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,959
Are you looking for...

351
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,291
Dr. Jones?

352
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,250
Excuse me, can I help you?

353
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:11,834
No, thank you.

354
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,625
Just a routine investigation,
ma'am.

355
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,208
Are you the police?

356
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,709
It'll just be a few moments.

357
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,583
- Professor Plimpton.
- Ma'am.

358
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:21,726
- Professor Plimpton!
- Ma'am!

359
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,375
Drop your weapon.

360
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,810
What the hell are you doin'?

361
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:29,959
Um...

362
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,208
What the doctor tells me,
Miss Mason.

363
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,291
Mandy?

364
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,959
Yeah, no witnesses.

365
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,417
Jesus. What the hell?

366
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,142
Your father wrote
so many letters

367
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,041
about the Dial,
I stopped reading 'em.

368
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,166
You really don't remember

369
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,875
the last time
I was at your house?

370
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,709
I took that from him then.

371
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,933
I thought he'd stopped
thinking about it.

372
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,059
But your father was convinced

373
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:07,083
this thing was real
and dangerous.

374
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,208
Do not shoot.

375
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,041
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

376
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,333
the Grafikos...

377
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,559
The tablet containing directions

378
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,667
to the rest of the Dial.

379
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,074
And if they found the Grafikos,

380
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,643
they might acquire
the other half of the Dial

381
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,667
and put the two together.

382
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,573
I knew you wouldn't destroy it.

383
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,000
How did you know
he asked me to destroy it?

384
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,917
- What?
- You do remember that night.

385
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,583
I was 12 years old, Indy.

386
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,147
You knew we didn't drop it
in a river.

387
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,834
- Baz didn't tell you that.
- See, listen.

388
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,237
- I didn't...
- No, he never lied.

389
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:41,959
- No...
- What was all that crap

390
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,083
- about the map?
- You...

391
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,530
No, you've had
too many whiskeys.

392
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,226
What are you doing, Wombat?

393
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,583
Stay where you are.

394
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,792
Don't move.

395
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,101
- Who are these people?
- We need to get out of here.

396
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,125
Are they with you?

397
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,458
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

398
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:56,667
Miss Shaw, stop!

399
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,333
Helena!

400
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,125
Stop!

401
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,083
Sorry.

402
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:13,166
- Helena!
- Dr. Jones. It's over.

403
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,542
Who are you people?

404
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,792
What do you want?

405
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,625
Stop!

406
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:21,709
Helena Shaw!

407
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,309
She's on the roof.
Find another way up.

408
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,417
Dr. Jones!

409
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,275
Dr. Jones,
we're not gonna hurt you.

410
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,083
Move.
We gotta follow 'em.

411
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,291
Go. Hurry up.

412
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:23,834
Fan out!

413
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,226
All right, let's go.
Move, move, move! Pack it up!

414
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,393
Come on,
get everything.

415
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:40,542
Found her!

416
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:11,250
<i>- Operator.</i>
- I need the police.

417
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,709
Hunter College.
People are dead.

418
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,017
- Please...
- Hang up, fella.

419
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:21,959
Stand up.

420
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,500
Okay, okay.

421
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,291
She's gone. You blew it,

422
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,709
you trigger-happy cracker.

423
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,333
- She had it in her hand.
- We got the professor.

424
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,159
Here's the file on Jones.

425
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,208
Yes.

426
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,500
Who are you?

427
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,125
That's my question.

428
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,083
You're CIA.

429
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, not me, man.

430
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,166
I don't take government jobs.

431
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,417
Okay.

432
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,875
How are you acquainted
with Miss Shaw?

433
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,500
She's my goddaughter.

434
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,875
I haven't seen her in 18 years.

435
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,184
Why did you meet with her today?

436
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,208
To give her the Dial?

437
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,041
Lady, it's an ancient
hunk of gears.

438
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,041
Half a hunk.

439
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,792
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

440
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:02,709
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

441
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,072
Where do you think you're going?

442
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,583
I got a parade going on.

443
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,208
And a demonstration
coming down here.

444
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,417
Hey! Hey, hey!

445
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,125
- Hey...
- Shut up.

446
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,709
I can't go this way.
Gotta go back.

447
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,458
Hell no!
What is wrong with you, man?

448
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,250
Damn it! Let's go on foot.

449
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:22,542
You heard her.

450
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,351
What the hell
were you thinking?

451
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,726
- Walk! Come on.
- What is your problem?

452
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,810
You don't look
when you're backin' up?

453
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:29,434
- Take care of that guy.
- Who's gonna pay for that?

454
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:30,583
Easy, fella. Easy.

455
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:31,667
Keep movin'.

456
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,500
Can't you see my cab?
It's yellow.

457
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,226
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man.

458
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,250
I don't...

459
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,417
Peace now!
Peace now!

460
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,667
Stop the war!
Stop the fighting!

461
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,583
- Where are we going, Mason?
- This way.

462
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,208
- Hell no, we won't go.
- Shut up.

463
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,101
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no!

464
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,667
- Hell no, we won't go!
<i>- </i>Hell no, we won't go!

465
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,750
We won't go!

466
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,291
- Hell no, we won't go!
<i>- </i>Hell no, we won't go!

467
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,291
- Hell no...
- Shut up!

468
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,458
Hell yeah!

469
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,625
Hell no, we won't go!

470
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,583
Hell no, we won't go!

471
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,125
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

472
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,458
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

473
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:12,542
Hell no...

474
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:16,500
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

475
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,750
Hey!

476
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,208
Officer! Help me!

477
00:43:27,959 --> 00:43:29,601
Officer,
there was a shooting...

478
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,585
- All right, all right.
- This morning at Hunter.

479
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,375
People are dead. God damn it.

480
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,166
Some rogue maniacs
broke in and...

481
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,875
Sir, you need to calm it down.

482
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,250
Please listen to me.

483
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:40,542
There was a shooting
this morning, and the...

484
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:44,125
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

485
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,375
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

486
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,458
Whoa!

487
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:01,875
- Watch out!
- What's he doin'?

488
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,041
Whoa!

489
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,625
Hyah! Hyah!

490
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,917
- Move, out the way!
- Whoa, whoa!

491
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,583
Hyah!

492
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,500
- Watch out!
- Hyah!

493
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,333
Whoa. Whoa.

494
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:04,583
Move! Quickly!

495
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,291
Hyah!

496
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,291
Move! Move!

497
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,208
Go, go, go!

498
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:37,709
Hyah!

499
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:49,792
Hyah!

500
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,959
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

501
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,542
- It's a horse.
- Come on.

502
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,875
- Hey, mister.
- Move! Out of the way!

503
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,000
- Hold my horse.
- Move! Move!

504
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:04,142
<i>Transfer is available</i>

505
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,250
<i>for IND Queens Boulevard.</i>

506
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:18,667
<i>Next stop, 59th,
Lexington Avenue.</i>

507
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,834
- Subway is faster.
- Oh!

508
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,083
People tend
to romanticize science,

509
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,125
when it is, in fact, quite cold.

510
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,811
So, what's next,
Dr. Schmidt?

511
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,000
Mars?

512
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,250
No, we've conquered space.

513
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,792
I'm moving to the next frontier.

514
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,667
What's beyond space?

515
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,208
You might wanna
get that suit pressed,

516
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,291
Dr. Schmidt.

517
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,542
We leave for the airport
in an hour.

518
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,059
He's gonna meet the President.

519
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:52,723
If the President objects
to a few creases,

520
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,083
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

521
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,917
- Can I use that?
- No.

522
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,375
Yes.

523
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,500
Baxter.

524
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:06,792
It's for you, Doctor.

525
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,667
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

526
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,041
I'm expecting
a delivery shortly.

527
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,208
Speak.

528
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,891
<i>Your goons made a mess.</i>

529
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,125
<i>Did they?</i>

530
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,709
Miss Shaw met
with a professor. Jones.

531
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,083
She acquired the device
from him.

532
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,083
<i>Then we lost her.</i>

533
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,417
<i>Dr. Jones got away as well.</i>

534
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,000
<i>Is that so?</i>

535
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,500
<i>Most unfortunate.</i>

536
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,333
I gotta clean things
up here, Doctor.

537
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:38,417
<i>And as a representative</i>

538
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,959
<i>of the United States government,</i>

539
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,750
<i>I urge you to cooperate.</i>

540
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,125
<i>Get on that plane
to Los Angeles,</i>

541
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,521
and get your medal
from the President.

542
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:54,000
Hello?

543
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,709
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

544
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,125
To Morocco.

545
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,375
Yes, sir.

546
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,601
<i>The university murders</i>

547
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,583

<i>Police are searching</i>

549
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,083
<i>for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.</i>

550
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,250
<i>A colleague told ABC that
Jones recently lost his son</i>

551
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:13,417
<i>and was in the middle
of a divorce.</i>

552
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:18,834
This guy,
he looks like you.

553
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:22,166
Nah. No.

554
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,125
- It is you.
- No, no, no. Hey.

555
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,893
- Go home, pal. You're drunk.
- This is the guy!

556
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,250
- Hey!
- It's the killer!

557
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:33,333
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

558
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,917
Bridge traffic.

559
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:48,000
Boy, am I glad
to see you, Sallah.

560
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,834
I wish I could say the same,
old friend.

561
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:56,041
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

562
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:02,125
Your goddaughter, Helena,

563
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,959
was arrested in Tangier
last year

564
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,875
for auctioning contraband.

565
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,417
There's more.

566
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:15,875
She was bailed out
by Aziz Rahim.

567
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:19,583
Aziz Rahim is the son
of Big Rahim,

568
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,417
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

569
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:27,625
Big Rahim
owns the Hotel Atlantique

570
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:30,375
in Tangier, and this week,

571
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:34,667
the hotel is hosting
its annual auction

572
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,709
of stolen antiquities.

573
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,375
All the big players
are already there.

574
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,333
Alia, Jabari.

575
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,750
This is the great man
who brought our family

576
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:46,667
to America during the war.

577
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:49,208
Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?

578
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,750
1956.

579
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,583
Very impressive, Jabari.

580
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,166
My grandchildren watch
too much TV,

581
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,875
but they know their history.

582
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:03,208
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

583
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,250
I need a ride
to the airport, Sallah.

584
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,834
If you run, the police will
assume that you're guilty.

585
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:11,875
Without Helena or the Dial,

586
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:13,875
I'm gonna get framed for murder.

587
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,667
Have you thought
about calling Marion?

588
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,083
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

589
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,518
<i>Welcome to New York's</i>

590
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,834
<i>John F. Kennedy
International Airport.</i>

591
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,959
<i>The upper level is
for Pan American Airlines...</i>

592
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,959
I took something else
from your apartment.

593
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,333
It was under the bed.

594
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:41,583
Thanks, Sallah.

595
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,667
I also brought my passport.

596
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:48,917
I could help you.

597
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,083
In Tangier?

598
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:51,792
Wherever chance takes us.

599
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:53,792
Indy, I...

600
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:56,166
I miss the desert.

601
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,041
I miss the sea.

602
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,375
And I miss waking up
every morning

603
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:02,959
wondering what
wonderful adventure

604
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,667
the new day will bring to us.

605
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,625
This is not
an adventure, Sallah.

606
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,667
Those days have come and gone.

607
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:12,875
Perhaps.

608
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,375
Perhaps not.

609
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:21,250
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

610
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,166
Champagne?

611
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:36,417
We've got four more hours
to Tangier.

612
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,583
Your scotch, sir.

613
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,208
Thanks.

614
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,500
<i>Basil. Come on, Baz!</i>

615
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,417
<i>- Open the door!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

616
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,083
<i>- Stay out, Indy!</i>
- Open the door.

617
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,166
The Germans were right, Indy.

618
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,667
- Huh? What?
- It's too big. It's too much.

619
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:08,500
Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!

620
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,583
- Give me...
- No.

621
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:10,667
What are you doing?

622
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,017
You've listened
to nothing that I said.

623
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,834
I don't understand it, Baz!

624
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:16,166
Well, I was trying to
explain it to you downstairs.

625
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,500
You've just ignored everything.

626
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,863
You're terrifying your daughter.

627
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,834
Indy, Archimedes

628
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,208
discovered
a temporal meteorology.

629
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:28,041
Archimedes was
a mathematician, Baz,

630
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:29,417
not a magician.

631
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,041
He could predict
fissures in time.

632
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,750
Fissures in time?

633
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,166
- Baz, you can't prove that!
- Well, not yet.

634
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,208
Proving it
is what makes it science!

635
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,709
Oh, Baz.

636
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,959
I never should've
given you the thing.

637
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,166
It... It belongs in a museum.

638
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,792
Give it to me. Please.

639
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,750
If I give you this,

640
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,417
it must be destroyed.

641
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:14,000
I will.

642
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:18,041
I'll destroy it, Baz.

643
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,542
Promise.

644
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,208
I'm sorry about this.

645
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:30,583
It's all my fault.

646
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,250
- Are you gonna be here?
- Yes, sir.

647
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,417
Okay. I've gotta catch
an airplane.

648
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:39,375
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

649
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,792
Some things should stay buried.

650
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:41,875
I know, Baz.

651
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,226
It's vital
that you destroy it.

652
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,726
- I will, Baz.
- Do you understand?

653
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,434
- I'll destroy it. Yes.
- Say you will, Indy.

654
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:47,458
I will... Yes.

655
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:49,166
You promised me.
Remember that.

656
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,291
I will... I promise.

657
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:51,417
There's a reason,

658
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,083
a reason that Archimedes
broke it in two.

659
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,959
I know, Baz.

660
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,250
- Indy.
- Ah.

661
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,291
Thanks, Wombat.

662
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,417
He's gonna be all right
in a few days.

663
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,917
I'll call you as soon as I land.

664
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,434
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

665
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,917
<i>we are 20 minutes
from landing in Tangier.</i>

666
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,101
- Stop drinking!
- What are you doing?

667
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,792
No more champagne!
How many more...

668
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:52,959
I'm staying.

669
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,500
Go home. Go home!

670
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,083
Rahim.

671
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,500
Miss Shaw, she's here.

672
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,917
Forged in bronze.

673
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,041
Nearly complete.

674
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,834
It is an astrological clock.

675
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:24,625
Dating third century BC

676
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:28,709
and built by Archimedes himself.

677
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,226
All right,
let's start at 20,000.

678
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,417
20,000, thank you very much.

679
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:34,959
30. 30.

680
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,792
Gauges green, power full,

681
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,291
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

682
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:41,875
What next?

683
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:43,250
Louis, help him! He's so cute.

684
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,375
- Pull back on the yoke.
- I did, man. I'm airborne.

685
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,458
Yeah, he's airborne.

686
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:47,893
- Can I have a sip?
- Do I pick up the flaps?

687
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:49,917
Don't touch the flaps
under 400 feet.

688
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,750
Decrease your pitch
to get to 120.

689
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:52,917
All right.

690
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,750
- Private auction, old timer.
- I've gotta get in there.

691
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,417
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

692
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,351
And, uh,
what is the current bid?

693
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,375
- The bid is 50,000.
- Then I bid 55.

694
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,000
Who'll give me 60?

695
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,625
- 60.
- 60. 65?

696
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:11,101
65. 70?

697
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,458
- 75.
- 75. 80?

698
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:13,542
- 80.
- 85.

699
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:14,834
How about 90?

700
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,875
- This auction is private.
- This auction's over.

701
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,625
<i>Au contraire,</i> it's hardly begun.

702
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,166
- 100.
- 100,000.

703
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,875
I like the hat, by the way.

704
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,434
Makes you look
at least two years younger.

705
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,685
Thanks.

706
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:32,768
- 110, bravo.
- I told you that

707
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:34,872
- this auction is over.
- Excuse me, who is this man?

708
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,434
- I'm her godfather.
- He's mildly related.

709
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:38,375
And she's up past her bedtime.

710
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:39,893
- Come on, Wombat.
- I wouldn't do that.

711
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:41,559
You want to explain it
to the cops at the bar?

712
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:42,917
The ones I paid off?

713
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,041
You're out of your depth,
Jonesy.

714
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,685
- "Jonesy"?
- He thinks I'm a criminal.

715
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:48,458
He's the one wanted for murder.

716
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,667
Nice big picture
in the <i>New York Herald.</i> 130?

717
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:52,417
I didn't kill anyone.

718
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,559
No entry,
it's a private auction.

719
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:54,863
And you know it,
Helena.

720
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:58,500
But whoever did
was looking for this.

721
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,041
What you've got here
is Pandora's Box.

722
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,500
No, actually.

723
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,834
It's my box.

724
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,458
You.

725
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,291
Have we met?

726
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:13,583
No.

727
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,107
My memory
is a little fuzzy,

728
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,875
but your face rings a bell.

729
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,500
Are you still a Nazi?

730
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,792
You're confused.
My name is Schmidt.

731
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,542
Professor Schmidt
of Alabama University.

732
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,542
Professor Schmidt. How nice
to meet you in person.

733
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,166
150.

734
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,476
After our conversation,
Miss Shaw,

735
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I thought we'd come to
an agreement about the Dial.

736
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:37,601
Funny. The last time

737
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,017
I saw the other guy
who looks like you,

738
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,792
he was also after this.

739
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,055
Your numbers were light,
Professor Schmidt.

740
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:45,043
But good news is, you're here
now. The bid is 160.

741
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,976
You don't seem
to understand, Miss Shaw.

742
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,291
This relic is my property.

743
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,875
- It's not yours. You stole it.
- Then you stole it.

744
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,685
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

745
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:53,750
The bid is 160.

746
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:54,834
- 160.
- 170?

747
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:55,976
You should've
stayed in New York.

748
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,059
- 170?
- You should've stayed

749
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,875
- out of Poland.
- 170. Anyone? Anyone?

750
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,333
Going, going...

751
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:02,709
Gone!

752
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,333
Stay away!

753
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,083
Get the Dial.

754
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:12,750
Stay away!

755
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,083
Oh, hello, Claude.

756
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,646
You should not
have come back, Helena.

757
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,917
Get back.

758
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,625
Teddy!

759
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,166
Rahim says you stay.

760
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:14,959
Thank you.

761
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,500
See you in the past,
Dr. Jones.

762
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:57,542
It's my cab!

763
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,291
Tell them to back off.

764
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,138
I just told them to shoot you.

765
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,125
All right, guys.

766
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,875
Put the guns down.

767
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,250
Put 'em down.

768
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,208
All right.

769
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,166
That's better.

770
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:24,667
Oh, dear.

771
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,875
Rahim.

772
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:38,458
You're in pajamas.

773
01:00:38,959 --> 01:00:40,625
I was sleeping, Helena.

774
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:41,851
Mm-hmm.
- Peacefully.

775
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:42,875
Oh.

776
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:44,792
My father woke me.

777
01:00:44,959 --> 01:00:47,583
He told me you'd
returned to our hotel.

778
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,333
Then he handed me this scimitar

779
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,333
and told me to come home
with your head.

780
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:56,083
Huh.

781
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,458
Does it have to be that bit?

782
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:08,041
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

783
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,333
Rahim,

784
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,667
I had an item to sell.

785
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,709
Excuse me. The item
she's talking about

786
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,851
- actually belongs to me.
- No.

787
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,226
You do not need to intrude
in this conversation.

788
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,434
And some very bad people,
worse people...

789
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,726
You do not need to get
involved with my business.

790
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,267
- Have run off with it.
- Is this your new man?

791
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,000
- No. No, no, no, no.
- It's complicated.

792
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,834
What exactly
do you owe this guy?

793
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,083
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

794
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,917
I presume you sold the ring.

795
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:30,851
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

796
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:31,917
I'll do it!

797
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,142
What are you... Hey!

798
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,917
You just got me killed!

799
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,667
Well, I'm not the one that's
engaged to a mobster!

800
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,750
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

801
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:48,125
I'm not a grave robber.

802
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,333
Your father and I
did important work together.

803
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,643
Don't tell me
all your escapades were noble,

804
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:56,291
selfless quests.
You did it for the buzz!

805
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,041
Oh, good work, Teddy!

806
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:03,208
- Move over, kid.
- Hey!

807
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:15,792
- Helena!
- Back up! Back up!

808
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:34,709
Not this way!

809
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,518
You don't know where you're
going, Indy! Listen to him.

810
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,062
- He knows this town!
- I know Tangier!

811
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,417
There he is!

812
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:50,667
Faster. Go faster!

813
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,750
Ten minutes
to the airport, boss.

814
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,142
I'm not sure
Professor Schmidt

815
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,526
is an actual professor,
by the way.

816
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:58,893
- He's a Nazi!
- Turn left!

817
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:00,458
Turn left! Turn left!

818
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:01,709
- Oh, no!
- No!

819
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,375
Helena! Don't do this!

820
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,875
- Hey, this way!
- That way!

821
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:29,834
No!

822
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:32,291
Helena!

823
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,458
No!

824
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,583
What the hell?

825
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,500
Helena!

826
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,333
Hey! Hey!

827
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,517
What the hell?

828
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,250
Come on!

829
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,875
Come on. Come on!

830
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,625
You think he'd be proud of this?

831
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:47,542
Who?

832
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:50,000
Your father!

833
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:53,125
His only daughter selling
her soul for bail money!

834
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,810
Sounds quite cool
when you put it like that.

835
01:04:54,834 --> 01:04:56,458
And it's not all bail money.

836
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:57,834
Some of it's gambling debt

837
01:04:57,917 --> 01:04:59,059
- and some...
- Thank you, Teddy.

838
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:00,875
Helena! No!

839
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:01,959
Helena!

840
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,542
How did you end up like this?

841
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:07,041
Well, you mean resourceful?

842
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,542
Daring? Beautiful?
Self-sufficient?

843
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,959
Whoa!

844
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,333
Hold on!

845
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:40,417
Go this way!

846
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:50,792
There he is.

847
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,101
Stop!

848
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,917
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop!

849
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:10,250
Aah!

850
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:19,792
On the left!

851
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:21,917
Take the wheel, Teddy!

852
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,166
What are you doing?

853
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,875
Getting what's mine.

854
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:28,834
Helena!

855
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,166
Damn it! You crazy?

856
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,125
Hey! Helena!

857
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,750
- Take the gun!
- Miss Shaw.

858
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,834
Let go, Miss Shaw!

859
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,667
Let go.

860
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,125
Come on! Give me the Dial!

861
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:16,917
Helena!

862
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,750
Damn.

863
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,726
Turn back! They went that way!

864
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,750
He's gone!

865
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:30,667
- Move over!
- Hey!

866
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,041
I didn't come here to
rescue you from your fiancé!

867
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,125
Rescue me?

868
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,917
I just want the Dial back.

869
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,000
Put your hands
above your head.

870
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,643
Not the smoothest
break-up I ever had.

871
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,976
If your father
was still alive...

872
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,101
Well, he's not, Indy.

873
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,685
Hey, something's wrong
with the engine.

874
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:13,976
If only there'd been
someone there for me,

875
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,500
some father figure, someone

876
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,709
specifically anointed
for the job.

877
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:19,195
You have no idea
about the kind...

878
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,309
Don't beat yourself up about it.

879
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,375
I mean,
what even is a godfather?

880
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,417
Anyway, family never
was your strong suit.

881
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,417
- What is the time, by the way?
- It's...

882
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:29,583
Hey, no fair.

883
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,333
Give me that back.

884
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:32,625
That was my father's watch!

885
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,041
Give it back to him.

886
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,059
You're gonna have
to leave town with me.

887
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,583
Rahim will be
looking for you too.

888
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,059
They'll go to
Tangier airport first,

889
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,142
so we'll need to catch a train

890
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,446
and get a plane from Casablanca.

891
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,417
Whoa. What was that?

892
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,417
Ah.

893
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,500
Damn.

894
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah.

895
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,208
I know, sir.

896
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:04,417
Yes...

897
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:06,667
Copy.

898
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,041
They pulled the plug.

899
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,500
You got them scared.

900
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,075
Because they don't understand.

901
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,709
No. Because your associates

902
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:19,125
killed three American civilians

903
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:21,542
and blew up
a nationally televised parade.

904
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:22,875
Because you stood up

905
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,667
the President
of the United States,

906
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,000
ran to Morocco,

907
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,583
and created an incident that
required military extraction!

908
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,476
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

909
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,917
They want you to vanish.

910
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,208
We have half the Dial now.

911
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:37,935
They were just trying
to keep you happy,

912
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:40,375
letting you chase that thing.

913
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:41,583
They never cared about it.

914
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:42,810
They will, Miss Mason,

915
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:44,458
when they understand
what it can do.

916
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:45,865
You put them
on the moon.

917
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,709
They got what they wanted.

918
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,917
All right, buckle up.
We're landing in Spain.

919
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:53,542
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

920
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:55,166
I'm not going back to Alabama!

921
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,583
All we need is a vessel to
take us to the Mediterranean.

922
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,726
The Grafikos
will take us to the other...

923
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,834
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

924
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,041
Let go of me, Schmidt.

925
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,834
I'm asking you personally.

926
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,166
You're a piece of work, Doc.

927
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:09,750
Hey!

928
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,250
Schmidt...

929
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:41,792
My name is Voller.

930
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:45,959
Jürgen Voller.

931
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,041
That's a Sea Stallion.

932
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,625
American helicopter.

933
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,333
Did you know
the Wright Brothers?

934
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:07,250
- What?
- The Wright Brothers.

935
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:08,500
Orville and Wilbur.

936
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:10,917
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

937
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,625
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

938
01:11:12,792 --> 01:11:15,208
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

939
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,917
And the Wright Brothers were
born during the Civil War.

940
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,208
Oh, I thought maybe you went
to school with them.

941
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,083
Oh, come on, Indy.
That was funny.

942
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,542
- "Funny"?
- Mm-hmm.

943
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,500
I'm stuck in Tangier

944
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,917
with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

945
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,291
I'm wanted for murder.

946
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,417
Nazis have
half of Archimedes' Dial

947
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,000
and your father's notebooks.

948
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,375
I have a copy.

949
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,667
Dad's notebooks.
I made a copy.

950
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,667
Where?

951
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,709
You memorized five notebooks?

952
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,083
Seven. And of course not.

953
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,875
Half of them were
as dull as ditchwater.

954
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,166
Just the really important bits.

955
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:52,041
Like what?

956
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,660
The location of the Grafikos.

957
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,500
Nobody knows
where the Grafikos is.

958
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:57,000
- Dad did.
- No, he didn't.

959
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:58,366
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

960
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,125
- Yes, he did.
- What's a Grafikos?

961
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,726
It's directions
to the rest of the Dial.

962
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,309
Ask her if she knows
what language it's in.

963
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,333
Ah! It isn't in a language.
It's in a code.

964
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,709
What code?

965
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,333
Archimedes used two codes.

966
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,041
Linear B and Polybius Square.

967
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,834
So, even if you find
the Grafikos,

968
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,542
without me, you can't read it.

969
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,417
Please.

970
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,417
Dad taught me Polybius
when I was nine.

971
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,303
Used to leave little notes
around the house.

972
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,333
"Tidy your room."

973
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:21,709
"Stay away from my brandy."

974
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:23,875
What if it's Linear B?

975
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:26,208
50 quid it's Polybius.

976
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,375
Give me that.

977
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,458
Hey.

978
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,083
That won't work.

979
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,531
Moroccan chewing gum's made
from the sap of the Manilkara.

980
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:34,959
Heat resistant.

981
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:37,667
Try and start it.

982
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:43,750
- Start it.
- I am.

983
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:47,417
Huh? Huh?

984
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,709
- Huh?
- It won't hold.

985
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,792
It'll get us
to the train station.

986
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:53,083
"Us"?

987
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,490
- You goin' home?
- No.

988
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,458
I'm going to Casablanca.

989
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:58,375
Then I'm gonna hop a plane
to the Aegean.

990
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,458
Just like you.

991
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,559
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

992
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,667
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

993
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:06,917
Archimedes was
surrounded by Romans.

994
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:08,834
Where else would it be?

995
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

996
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,406
And you don't have coordinates.

997
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:13,000
And you don't have a boat.

998
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,333
I've got an old friend
in Greece.

999
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,875
An expert diver.

1000
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,875
With a big, beautiful boat

1001
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,083
that'll get us there
before they will.

1002
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:27,000
You need me,

1003
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:28,375
and you know it.

1004
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,792
Renny!

1005
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:22,917
Indy?

1006
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,792
Indy!

1007
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,208
So, that's the expert diver?

1008
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,583
Spain's greatest frogman.

1009
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,375
Hey!

1010
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,625
So, Spain's greatest frogman
has a shit boat

1011
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,000
and only one good frog leg?

1012
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,208
Stop it.

1013
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,267
You got
a different boat.

1014
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,500
Stop it.

1015
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:04,834
We're going here.

1016
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,917
Where they found the first
part of the Antikythera.

1017
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,000
But...

1018
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,625
we're going deeper.

1019
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,208
Dad tracked down
the old sponge diver

1020
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,917
who found the Dial.

1021
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,250
He told him

1022
01:15:20,417 --> 01:15:23,375
that the wrecked Roman ship
broke up under the sea

1023
01:15:23,542 --> 01:15:24,667
70 feet below.

1024
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:27,792
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1025
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:30,125
That's where they found it.

1026
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:34,792
But he said that most
of the ship had broken off

1027
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:36,709
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1028
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,250
Too deep for sponge divers.

1029
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:43,166
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship

1030
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:46,709
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1031
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:53,792
They weren't taking
half a Dial for a joyride.

1032
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,208
They had the Grafikos...

1033
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,250
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1034
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:09,166
Your dad was a genius.

1035
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:10,834
Yeah.

1036
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,291
He was.

1037
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,326
Seven of spades.

1038
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:38,542
How do you do that?

1039
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:40,125
Wow.

1040
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,417
Do it again.

1041
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,291
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1042
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:55,917
Seven of spades!

1043
01:16:58,041 --> 01:16:59,083
She's magic.

1044
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,417
Trick deck.

1045
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:01,583
No.

1046
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,166
I force the card.

1047
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,667
I offer the mark,

1048
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:07,000
you,

1049
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:08,166
the feeling of a choice,

1050
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,542
but ultimately, I make you
pick the card I want.

1051
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:13,834
"The mark."

1052
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,792
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1053
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:20,709
I have to check the lines.

1054
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,834
Good night.

1055
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:34,083
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1056
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,792
Dates?

1057
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,250
What dates?

1058
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,166
These dates.

1059
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,333
Written over and over again
in this letter.

1060
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:49,625
August 20th, 1969.

1061
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,333
That's three days from now.

1062
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,750
And the same date in 1939.

1063
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:56,333
Two weeks before
Hitler invades Poland.

1064
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,750
Wait.

1065
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,875
Now you believe the Dial
has magical powers?

1066
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,208
I don't believe in magic,
Wombat.

1067
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,458
But a few times in my life,
I've seen things.

1068
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:15,333
Things I can't explain.

1069
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:19,041
And I've come to believe
it's not so much

1070
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,333
what you believe.

1071
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,750
It's how hard you believe it.

1072
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,208
I've seen things too, Indy.

1073
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,709
The only thing
worth believing in, ever,

1074
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,542
is cash.

1075
01:18:35,834 --> 01:18:36,917
Right.

1076
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:44,029
What if you could
go back in time?

1077
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,208
What would you do?

1078
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,000
Witness the Trojan War?

1079
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,625
Check in on Cleopatra?

1080
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,375
I'd stop my son from enlisting.

1081
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:03,250
Did he sign up to please you?

1082
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:06,542
No, he signed up to piss me off.

1083
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,750
How would you have stopped him?

1084
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,465
I'd tell him
he was gonna die.

1085
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,375
I'd tell him
that his mother would...

1086
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,834
find no end to her grief.

1087
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:35,417
And that his father would be...

1088
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,166
helpless to console her.

1089
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,959
And that the loss would put
an end to their marriage.

1090
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,208
You're still wearing the ring.

1091
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:22,208
Mm.

1092
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,291
Promising.

1093
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,458
More promising.

1094
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,333
Hello.

1095
01:20:44,542 --> 01:20:46,542
Get your gear on.
They're waiting.

1096
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,250
Hey.

1097
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,250
Come here.

1098
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,458
Okay.

1099
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:57,601
I'm gonna show you something.

1100
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,625
Gosh, this looks important.

1101
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:03,792
Around the rope...

1102
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:06,000
Now, we are going deep.

1103
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:09,000
Descend fast, and breathe
through these hoses.

1104
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:10,208
Okay?

1105
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,000
Ah, stay separate.

1106
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,125
No crisscross. All right?

1107
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,500
We cannot stay long.

1108
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:19,000
I have a method that
usually prevents the bends.

1109
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,125
- Usually?
- Yeah.

1110
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,417
I call it "the bounce."

1111
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:23,583
You know, fast down,

1112
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,667
three minutes on the bottom,
and then up.

1113
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:26,875
Three minutes!

1114
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,875
No one more second.

1115
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:31,792
- Three minutes.
- Yeah, that's right.

1116
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:33,799
- Where is my lighter?
- I don't know, <i>capitán.</i>

1117
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,959
We have to go.

1118
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,750
Uh, quick question.

1119
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,250
What's that?

1120
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:42,792
- They're sharks?
- No.

1121
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:45,250
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1122
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,625
- Eels?
- Anguilas.

1123
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:49,709
Most are small.

1124
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,458
Sometimes they are big.
Two meters.

1125
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,667
But if you see them, stay still.

1126
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:57,083
They bite you,
they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1127
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,667
They look like snakes.

1128
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,375
No, they don't.

1129
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,625
Private Brandy
reporting for duty.

1130
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,125
You're not coming, Teddy?

1131
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,000
I can't swim.

1132
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,291
Lucky him.

1133
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:08,750
Everyone can swim.

1134
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,500
Reach and pull.
Reach and pull.

1135
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,685
All right.
You stay here

1136
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:17,000
with Hector and watch our lines.

1137
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,917
It is time, <i>camarada.</i>

1138
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,291
Two minutes?

1139
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:25,542
Hey.

1140
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:58,537
<i>Hurry up!</i>

1141
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,959
Helena!

1142
01:27:23,709 --> 01:27:24,709
Come on.

1143
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,417
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

1144
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,458
That's it.

1145
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:53,034
Who are these people?

1146
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,250
Nazis.

1147
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,792
First, you return my Dial,
Dr. Jones,

1148
01:27:58,959 --> 01:28:02,083
and now,
you bring me the Grafikos.

1149
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,166
I'm very happy you're not
wasting in retirement.

1150
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:07,917
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1151
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:09,208
Where are your sponsors?

1152
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:10,959
I'm on my own now.

1153
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:12,834
Things move forward,
Dr. Jones.

1154
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:13,917
And sometimes...

1155
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,583
they go backward.

1156
01:28:20,834 --> 01:28:23,083
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1157
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,500
What language is that?

1158
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:53,250
It's not a language.

1159
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,625
It's a code.

1160
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,458
Polybius.

1161
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,583
You owe me 50 quid.

1162
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:03,709
Not familiar
with Polybius cipher?

1163
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:04,875
No.

1164
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:07,041
But it appears you are.

1165
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:12,625
Read it, please.

1166
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,750
No.

1167
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,500
Indy...

1168
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,917
Feeling helpful now?

1169
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:45,166
I am.

1170
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:49,583
I know this stuff backwards.

1171
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:50,834
No!

1172
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:53,417
Sorry, Indy.

1173
01:29:53,834 --> 01:29:55,208
I don't do noble death.

1174
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:56,959
Just

1175
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,542
cold, hard maths.

1176
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,923
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1177
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:03,959
One hundred grand. Cash.

1178
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:05,125
Helena...

1179
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:06,792
Take it or leave it.

1180
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:09,333
You have a deal.

1181
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,667
He'll never pay you.

1182
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:27,601
I think
you will find this is worth

1183
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,083
more than your asking price.

1184
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:40,083
- Teddy.
- Helena,

1185
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,417
don't do this.

1186
01:30:46,834 --> 01:30:48,250
Let's see what we've got here.

1187
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:51,792
"My <i>Makhana..."</i>

1188
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,291
that's "machine"...

1189
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:58,083
"lies with me,
in the city I left.

1190
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,667
"Where wolves teach men to walk.

1191
01:31:00,834 --> 01:31:04,959
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1192
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:09,500
Only one thing
lies anywhere forever.

1193
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:12,375
The dead. So, if the Dial lies
with him, then...

1194
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,750
then this is directions
to his tomb.

1195
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,583
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1196
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,792
Undiscovered for two millennia.

1197
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:25,959
"The city I left."

1198
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,625
Archimedes lived two places
his entire life,

1199
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:30,041
so he only left one.

1200
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:32,917
Anyone? At the back?

1201
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:35,333
Come on, Indy.
Everyone knows this.

1202
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,333
- Even this clown.
- Alexandria.

1203
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,834
Full marks.

1204
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,500
Now, "wolf"
in Greek is <i>"lycos."</i>

1205
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:44,917
Root of the word
<i>"lycaeum"</i> or "school."

1206
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:47,709
And the Doric
for "walking" is...

1207
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:49,959
<i>"peripatio."</i>

1208
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:54,000
Which also happens to be
the word for...

1209
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:56,583
Aw.

1210
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,208
I thought you were
a bright spark.

1211
01:32:03,792 --> 01:32:06,917
<i>"Peripatio"</i> means "walking,"

1212
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,500
but it also means "counting."

1213
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:12,792
So, "Where wolves
teach men to walk"

1214
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:15,834
- could be...
- The School of Mathematics.

1215
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:18,750
Is correct.

1216
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:20,458
Now, the next bit is easy.

1217
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,375
"Beneath one of nine"?

1218
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:25,875
There are nine Muses.

1219
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,166
The <i>Museon.</i>

1220
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:29,792
The Greek word for the
Great Library of Alexandria.

1221
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:31,000
Which, as we all know,

1222
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,750
has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1223
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:34,917
May I?

1224
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,208
Thank you.

1225
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:41,125
The nine Muses,
in reverse order,

1226
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,083
are Calliope,

1227
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:45,834
Urania,

1228
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:48,458
Polymnia,

1229
01:32:49,417 --> 01:32:50,959
- Erato...
- Polymnia.

1230
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,542
And Meli whasisname,

1231
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:54,917
that other one,

1232
01:32:55,667 --> 01:32:56,667
Thalia,

1233
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:58,625
Euteroe,

1234
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:00,875
but the first is...

1235
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,125
Clio.

1236
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,166
The Muse of history and time.

1237
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,542
That Archimedes,

1238
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:08,017
- what a clever bugger.
- The entrance

1239
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:10,166
to the tomb is by
the School of Mathematics,

1240
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:12,041
under a statue of Clio,

1241
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:14,959
in the ruins of the Great
Library of Alexandria.

1242
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,417
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1243
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:18,792
Teddy!

1244
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:30,291
The Grafikos, get it!

1245
01:33:57,959 --> 01:34:00,667
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1246
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:03,458
When you're
in a tight spot, dynamite.

1247
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,750
My friend was just murdered.

1248
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,250
Sorry.

1249
01:34:13,417 --> 01:34:15,166
You told them everything.

1250
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:17,959
Word for word.

1251
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:20,500
But Archimedes
didn't make it that easy.

1252
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:23,208
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1253
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,291
Go!

1254
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:37,870
So, what do you see?

1255
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,208
Polybius square.

1256
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,875
Made of?

1257
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:45,625
Wax and wood.

1258
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,500
Anything else?

1259
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:52,959
It's heavy.

1260
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,125
Too heavy.

1261
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,375
Give me that.

1262
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:42,291
This is solid gold?

1263
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:43,667
Ancient gold.

1264
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,166
From the Nile.

1265
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:48,834
Hold it, Teddy.

1266
01:36:00,375 --> 01:36:01,458
Sell this thing

1267
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,291
and we are out of the hole
and then some.

1268
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:04,375
I have just the customer.

1269
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:05,917
Cranky, old Duchess
in Gibraltar...

1270
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,959
This is going in a museum.

1271
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:12,125
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1272
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
What does it say?

1273
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:25,000
"Search where Dionysius

1274
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:28,542
"hears each whisper

1275
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,417
"like a hurricane."

1276
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:35,709
The Ear.

1277
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:38,208
The cave of Dionysius.

1278
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,041
Where is that?

1279
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,542
In Sicily.

1280
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:46,125
- How much fuel have we got?
- It's full.

1281
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:56,125
They're heading west.

1282
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Not east.

1283
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:29,583
- I want the papaya.
- How much is it?

1284
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:34,041
Take this.

1285
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:38,959
Look at that kid
with the straw hat.

1286
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:41,041
This way.

1287
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:45,625
Hey.

1288
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:49,125
What do you think?

1289
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,208
What are we doing?

1290
01:37:57,834 --> 01:37:59,500
Waiting for closing time
at the caves.

1291
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:01,166
It's crawling with tourists.

1292
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,750
Okay, so he's, like,
running the show now?

1293
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:06,542
He's not running
the show, Teddy.

1294
01:38:07,917 --> 01:38:11,041
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1295
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:12,792
We are.

1296
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,250
Most assuredly.

1297
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:20,083
You know he's never gonna
let us sell any of that stuff.

1298
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:23,250
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1299
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:24,434
Helena,
get over here!

1300
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:25,458
Give me a hand!

1301
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,500
Oh, you splurged.

1302
01:38:33,834 --> 01:38:34,875
Here's your backpack.

1303
01:38:34,959 --> 01:38:36,000
Where's the kid?

1304
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:51,601
Hey, watch it!

1305
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:52,875
What's wrong
with you?

1306
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:22,583
Hello.

1307
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Hey.

1308
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,000
Let me go!

1309
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,333
Let me go!

1310
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:41,875
Get off me! Let me go!

1311
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,208
Hey, hey, hey!

1312
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,125
Helena!

1313
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:00,959
They've got Teddy.

1314
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,667
They took him
up the hill somewhere.

1315
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:15,542
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1316
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,976
What are they
gonna do to him?

1317
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,667
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1318
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:31,500
They're not gonna hurt him.

1319
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:32,834
They're gonna use him

1320
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:35,834
to get the other half
of the Dial.

1321
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:36,959
We gotta get there first.

1322
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:54,208
Colonizing queens
built many cities in Sicily.

1323
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:55,875
- The temple...
- Let's go.

1324
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:59,083
Is the oldest
of the Greek temples.

1325
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:01,542
The cave's over there.

1326
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:13,667
Could we go
a little faster, please?

1327
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:24,375
The Ear of Dionysius.

1328
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:33,083
Wow.

1329
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:49,000
"Search where Dionysius hears

1330
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:50,792
"each whisper
like a hurricane."

1331
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
That's some echo.

1332
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,333
Keep making noise till we
find out where it's loudest.

1333
01:42:14,792 --> 01:42:15,959
Stop.

1334
01:42:23,542 --> 01:42:24,667
This is it.

1335
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:31,125
Greek pediment.

1336
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:32,792
An entrance.

1337
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,208
Used to be.

1338
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,500
A crescent.

1339
01:42:42,375 --> 01:42:43,458
Just like on the Grafikos.

1340
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:52,917
I think there's
an opening up there.

1341
01:42:59,542 --> 01:43:00,542
You okay up there?

1342
01:43:01,709 --> 01:43:02,875
Yes.

1343
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:06,417
You're not moving.

1344
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:10,125
I'm thinking.

1345
01:43:12,959 --> 01:43:13,959
About?

1346
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:18,041
About what the hell I'm doing
up here, 40 feet in the air,

1347
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:19,959
with crap shoulders,

1348
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:21,917
crumbling vertebrae,

1349
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,583
a plate in one leg,
screws in the other.

1350
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,000
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1351
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:27,750
No, you don't get it.

1352
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:29,834
You're half my age.

1353
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:33,542
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1354
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:34,959
No. Fair enough.

1355
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,542
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1356
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:39,917
And I'm just guessing,

1357
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,800
but I don't think
you've been shot nine times,

1358
01:43:41,834 --> 01:43:44,291
including once by your father.

1359
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,375
Dad shot you?

1360
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:49,250
Don't talk to me.

1361
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:50,617
Just go ahead.
I'll follow you.

1362
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,917
No, no, no. We are close.
We are close.

1363
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:03,083
Look around you.

1364
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:04,810
- We are close.
- The Cave of Dionysius.

1365
01:44:04,917 --> 01:44:07,792
No, no, no. The cave
is closed for renovation.

1366
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:09,792
Oh.

1367
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:10,959
Let me ask again.

1368
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:12,959
Where is the Cave of Dionysius?

1369
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,750
What's the matter?
You worried about the kid?

1370
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:37,709
Are you sure
they won't hurt him?

1371
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,083
He'll be fine.

1372
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:40,291
He's smart.

1373
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,542
Where'd you find him?

1374
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:47,375
He, uh... He tried to steal
my purse outside a casino

1375
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:49,917
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1376
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:51,917
I hit him repeatedly
with my car door,

1377
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:54,625
but he didn't let go
and neither did I.

1378
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:56,333
So, been together ever since.

1379
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,417
Thought you were
all about the money.

1380
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:01,542
I am.

1381
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:06,458
Nobody memorizes every page

1382
01:45:06,542 --> 01:45:08,667
of their dead father's notebooks

1383
01:45:08,834 --> 01:45:09,917
for the money.

1384
01:45:16,542 --> 01:45:18,000
<i>Herr</i> Voller!

1385
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,542
They went that way.

1386
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:41,667
Why?

1387
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,709
Come on, come on.

1388
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,375
Let's go.

1389
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:56,083
Oh, my...

1390
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:00,625
Oh, my God!

1391
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:02,792
Oh, my God!

1392
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,375
- Oh, God!
- No, no.

1393
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:06,667
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1394
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:12,834
Are they off me? Get 'em off!

1395
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:14,583
- No, no. Wait.
- Get 'em off!

1396
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:28,750
What is that?

1397
01:46:31,709 --> 01:46:33,208
Methane.

1398
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:35,458
Don't breathe.

1399
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:36,625
Don't breathe?

1400
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:41,709
We've gotta get outta here.

1401
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:51,542
Athena.

1402
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:54,583
Goddess of war.

1403
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,709
And reason.

1404
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,375
"Under the moon...

1405
01:47:06,667 --> 01:47:08,667
"life lies at her feet."

1406
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,750
Water displacement.

1407
01:47:18,542 --> 01:47:19,875
Get in the pool!

1408
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:22,041
Why?
Help me open the door.

1409
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:23,834
Well, they didn't
get out the doors!

1410
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:24,917
Get in the pool!

1411
01:47:25,959 --> 01:47:27,834
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1412
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,125
Help me.

1413
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:33,875
Archimedes was fascinated

1414
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:37,333
by water displacement!

1415
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:52,208
Whoa!

1416
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:20,667
Hey! Get back here! Klaber!

1417
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:36,041
You don't need to do that.

1418
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,166
Hey!

1419
01:49:04,542 --> 01:49:06,291
Give me that!

1420
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,792
No!

1421
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:16,625
Leave them.

1422
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:18,959
I said leave them.

1423
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:44,959
Reach and pull.

1424
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:46,709
Reach and pull.

1425
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:49,041
Reach and pull.

1426
01:50:17,458 --> 01:50:19,000
Archimedes' tomb.

1427
01:50:47,959 --> 01:50:49,250
Grab that corner.

1428
01:51:35,583 --> 01:51:36,583
Indy.

1429
01:51:38,875 --> 01:51:40,250
This frieze...

1430
01:51:42,917 --> 01:51:44,166
It's a phoenix.

1431
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:45,333
A common icon.

1432
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,083
No. Look,
it isn't.

1433
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:50,417
This phoenix has propellers.

1434
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,750
What's this doing here?

1435
01:52:09,542 --> 01:52:12,542
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years,

1436
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:14,667
much less watches.

1437
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:18,417
Archimedes used it.

1438
01:52:21,959 --> 01:52:23,333
Dad was right.

1439
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It works.

1440
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:26,709
Of course it works,
Miss Shaw.

1441
01:52:29,417 --> 01:52:30,709
Mathematics works.

1442
01:52:31,834 --> 01:52:34,834
As it conquered space,
it will conquer time.

1443
01:52:42,709 --> 01:52:44,625
You've already
lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1444
01:52:44,792 --> 01:52:45,792
Your wife is gone.

1445
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:47,792
Do you really
want to lose your godchild?

1446
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:51,959
For what?

1447
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:54,542
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1448
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:06,875
Thank you.

1449
01:53:45,583 --> 01:53:46,959
History's greatest moment.

1450
01:53:54,083 --> 01:53:55,375
Its end.

1451
01:54:03,041 --> 01:54:04,081
Throw me the gun!

1452
01:54:14,417 --> 01:54:16,667
- Get him outta here.
- Teddy.

1453
01:54:17,709 --> 01:54:18,834
Teddy! Teddy!

1454
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,041
Come on! Go!

1455
01:54:20,125 --> 01:54:21,125
This way. Come on.

1456
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:26,750
Go!

1457
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:31,333
Indy!

1458
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:34,500
Go!

1459
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:35,959
Go!

1460
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:37,208
Stop!

1461
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:42,000
Now what?

1462
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:44,625
Bring him.

1463
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:53,709
Helena, come on!

1464
01:54:53,875 --> 01:54:55,166
Teddy, we can't just leave him.

1465
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,583
We're not! Follow me!

1466
01:54:58,542 --> 01:54:59,542
Come on!

1467
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,542
Come on.

1468
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:20,709
Teddy. Come on.
We've got a car.

1469
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:26,583
Ah, crap.

1470
01:55:32,792 --> 01:55:33,834
Stay there.

1471
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:53,709
Hop on.

1472
01:55:57,333 --> 01:56:00,291
The first hemisphere
sets the destination.

1473
01:56:01,792 --> 01:56:05,375
The second calculates
the location of the fissure

1474
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:08,458
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1475
01:56:09,041 --> 01:56:11,917
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude,

1476
01:56:12,959 --> 01:56:14,834
and transmit waypoints
to the pilots.

1477
01:56:26,959 --> 01:56:28,458
Shortcut.

1478
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:35,709
You got coordinates for 37.07.

1479
01:56:35,792 --> 01:56:37,125
So, who is it?

1480
01:56:37,875 --> 01:56:39,125
Churchill?

1481
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,500
Ike?

1482
01:56:43,834 --> 01:56:46,333
Who are you gonna kill
to win the war?

1483
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:50,041
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes,

1484
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:52,083
we shall fly
into the eye of this storm

1485
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:55,125
and cross into Sicilian airspace

1486
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:58,792
on August 20th, 1939.

1487
01:56:59,542 --> 01:57:01,375
We will head north
over friendly skies

1488
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,083
with enough fuel
to reach Munich.

1489
01:57:04,375 --> 01:57:06,000
My quarry will be waiting for me

1490
01:57:06,542 --> 01:57:09,000
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz

1491
01:57:09,375 --> 01:57:11,583
for an update on his V-1 rocket.

1492
01:57:18,583 --> 01:57:22,583
What kind of Nazi
kills the Führer?

1493
01:57:24,208 --> 01:57:26,875
The kind that believes
in victory, Dr. Jones.

1494
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:35,959
Hitler lit a fire that could
have burned 1,000 years.

1495
01:57:36,125 --> 01:57:37,625
I saw every mistake.

1496
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:39,709
Every blunder.

1497
01:57:39,875 --> 01:57:41,542
And I will correct them all.

1498
01:57:41,709 --> 01:57:44,333
History is a long list
of losses, Dr. Jones.

1499
01:57:45,375 --> 01:57:46,625
It's just a question of whose.

1500
01:57:59,291 --> 01:58:00,583
Stop!

1501
01:59:13,291 --> 01:59:14,291
Teddy.

1502
01:59:16,125 --> 01:59:17,485
You think you can fly
one of those?

1503
01:59:19,125 --> 01:59:20,125
A Nord?

1504
01:59:22,834 --> 01:59:23,834
Sure.

1505
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:25,709
It's not a ringing response.

1506
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:27,542
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1507
01:59:27,709 --> 01:59:29,250
You've never flown any plane.

1508
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:32,250
I'll get it started.

1509
01:59:32,417 --> 01:59:33,667
No, Teddy.

1510
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:35,834
Crap.

1511
02:00:03,208 --> 02:00:04,935
Fasten
your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1512
02:00:04,959 --> 02:00:06,250
There might be some turbulence.

1513
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,750
You're German, Voller.

1514
02:00:09,917 --> 02:00:11,917
Don't try and be funny.

1515
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:37,125
Come on, big talker.

1516
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:52,959
Okay.

1517
02:01:09,792 --> 02:01:11,375
Okay. Okay.

1518
02:01:11,542 --> 02:01:14,083
Gauges green. Power full.

1519
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,250
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1520
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,417
Okay, wings down.

1521
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,500
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1522
02:02:00,959 --> 02:02:02,041
Rotate.

1523
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,709
Continental drift.

1524
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,333
Continental drift!

1525
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:29,667
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1526
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,667
He couldn't have!

1527
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,667
It hadn't been observed yet.

1528
02:03:35,667 --> 02:03:37,500
You're off target.

1529
02:03:37,959 --> 02:03:39,834
Your coordinates
are based on markers

1530
02:03:40,583 --> 02:03:43,792
that have been moving
for 2,000 years!

1531
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:46,792
You could be off
by 10 degrees, by...

1532
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:06,083
<i>Herr</i> Voller...

1533
02:04:06,166 --> 02:04:08,208
Your calculations are wrong!

1534
02:04:09,458 --> 02:04:11,218
- <i>Herr </i>Voller...
<i>- </i>Will you shut up?

1535
02:04:11,291 --> 02:04:12,291
I'm thinking!

1536
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,320
Hold the flight path!

1537
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:29,375
I don't know
where we're going, Jürgen.

1538
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:32,750
But it sure as hell

1539
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,625
ain't 1939!

1540
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,726
That's Sicily.

1541
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:20,959
1939.

1542
02:06:22,709 --> 02:06:24,166
I did it.

1543
02:06:24,333 --> 02:06:25,834
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1544
02:06:34,667 --> 02:06:36,709
Yesterday
belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1545
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:03,750
Those are Roman triremes.

1546
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,208
Keep it in the air!

1547
02:08:04,542 --> 02:08:05,917
Amazing.

1548
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:13,583
Whoa!

1549
02:08:14,875 --> 02:08:15,875
Open the door!

1550
02:08:20,834 --> 02:08:21,834
What are you doing?

1551
02:08:22,792 --> 02:08:24,500
What are you doing, you idiots?

1552
02:08:24,667 --> 02:08:26,458
They think we're a monster!

1553
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Aah!

1554
02:08:32,959 --> 02:08:34,458
You have
to turn around.

1555
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:36,542
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1556
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:39,000
214 BC.

1557
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:40,375
You got the wrong war.

1558
02:09:12,208 --> 02:09:13,291
Boss!

1559
02:09:51,333 --> 02:09:52,893
Get out of the way!

1560
02:09:58,709 --> 02:10:00,834
How do you like that,
you savages?

1561
02:10:03,875 --> 02:10:06,625
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1562
02:10:16,667 --> 02:10:18,750
What are you doing here?

1563
02:10:18,917 --> 02:10:20,458
Rescuing you!

1564
02:10:31,083 --> 02:10:32,875
Get him off!

1565
02:10:34,291 --> 02:10:35,375
Indy!

1566
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,208
Parachute!

1567
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,166
I got a parachute!

1568
02:10:47,667 --> 02:10:49,083
Hang on!

1569
02:10:52,083 --> 02:10:53,166
Let go!

1570
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:56,875
Give me the parachute!

1571
02:11:02,959 --> 02:11:05,083
Grab it. Hang on!

1572
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:08,375
Indy!

1573
02:12:01,125 --> 02:12:03,583
Hey,
those are my friends.

1574
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,792
Those are my friends.
We need to help them!

1575
02:12:06,959 --> 02:12:08,542
Those are my friends!

1576
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,059
He's trying to land.

1577
02:13:30,083 --> 02:13:32,041
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1578
02:13:32,792 --> 02:13:34,834
Get up. Yeah.

1579
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,291
We need to get you
out of here. Okay.

1580
02:13:39,208 --> 02:13:40,500
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1581
02:13:41,375 --> 02:13:42,625
Sit up. You need to help me.

1582
02:13:42,792 --> 02:13:44,667
I know it hurts,
but we gotta get you back.

1583
02:13:44,834 --> 02:13:47,542
This is incredible, Wombat.

1584
02:13:48,083 --> 02:13:50,041
Incredible.

1585
02:13:51,583 --> 02:13:53,291
Yeah, it very well is.

1586
02:13:53,458 --> 02:13:55,041
But we have to
get you out of here.

1587
02:13:57,166 --> 02:13:58,291
My God.

1588
02:13:59,959 --> 02:14:01,834
We're witnessing history.

1589
02:14:08,959 --> 02:14:10,750
Reverse these numbers.

1590
02:14:10,917 --> 02:14:12,000
They'll get you home.

1591
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:14,667
What?

1592
02:14:17,583 --> 02:14:18,792
I'm going to stay.

1593
02:14:19,542 --> 02:14:21,542
No. You're not serious.

1594
02:14:24,375 --> 02:14:25,417
Wow, you are serious.

1595
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,125
Indy, you've been shot.

1596
02:14:31,208 --> 02:14:32,208
You're bleeding.

1597
02:14:32,583 --> 02:14:34,125
You can't stay here.

1598
02:14:34,208 --> 02:14:35,208
Yes, I can.

1599
02:14:35,875 --> 02:14:36,917
But for what? For...

1600
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,542
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1601
02:14:41,583 --> 02:14:43,709
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1602
02:14:44,834 --> 02:14:46,667
Studied it.

1603
02:14:46,834 --> 02:14:48,875
- All my life.
- Yeah.

1604
02:14:49,041 --> 02:14:52,041
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1605
02:14:52,125 --> 02:14:53,125
And die.

1606
02:14:53,875 --> 02:14:55,500
Please, get up.

1607
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,417
Helena!

1608
02:14:58,750 --> 02:14:59,750
I did it!

1609
02:14:59,917 --> 02:15:02,250
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1610
02:15:02,417 --> 02:15:04,041
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.
Get up.

1611
02:15:04,125 --> 02:15:05,643
I need to get you
into that plane, okay?

1612
02:15:05,667 --> 02:15:06,667
- We need to.
- No. No.

1613
02:15:06,834 --> 02:15:09,166
Get up. You can... We can!

1614
02:15:28,583 --> 02:15:29,583
It's him.

1615
02:15:38,542 --> 02:15:40,583
He's asking how far we've come.

1616
02:16:17,208 --> 02:16:19,041
That dial
is a forced deck.

1617
02:16:19,125 --> 02:16:20,583
It doesn't take us
anywhere but here.

1618
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:22,041
He built it to get help.

1619
02:16:22,208 --> 02:16:24,750
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy,

1620
02:16:24,834 --> 02:16:26,017
so I think we've helped enough.

1621
02:16:30,542 --> 02:16:31,583
Helena...

1622
02:16:32,792 --> 02:16:33,851
He can't
keep that, by the way.

1623
02:16:33,875 --> 02:16:34,935
He needs to build his own one.

1624
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:36,625
Helena, we need to go!

1625
02:16:37,083 --> 02:16:39,208
Indy, the window is closing!

1626
02:16:39,375 --> 02:16:40,500
We cannot get stuck here!

1627
02:16:46,208 --> 02:16:48,166
No, no, no!
Do not say yes!

1628
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:56,166
Helena...

1629
02:17:05,333 --> 02:17:06,667
This is your time.

1630
02:17:08,792 --> 02:17:10,101
He needs to be in his.

1631
02:17:10,125 --> 02:17:12,417
His work is not done.
He needs to go home.

1632
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,166
There is medicine at home.

1633
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:16,125
He cannot die here. He can't.

1634
02:17:17,792 --> 02:17:20,625
Helena, get on the plane.

1635
02:17:23,208 --> 02:17:24,291
I'll be all right.

1636
02:17:26,125 --> 02:17:27,458
No, you won't.

1637
02:17:30,458 --> 02:17:32,208
I need to do this.

1638
02:17:33,291 --> 02:17:34,291
Me too.

1639
02:18:28,792 --> 02:18:29,792
Good morning.

1640
02:18:34,667 --> 02:18:36,041
How's the shoulder?

1641
02:18:38,709 --> 02:18:41,208
Better than my jaw.

1642
02:18:44,834 --> 02:18:45,834
Right.

1643
02:18:47,834 --> 02:18:49,333
You should've
let me stay.

1644
02:18:50,208 --> 02:18:51,417
I couldn't do that.

1645
02:19:00,458 --> 02:19:01,458
Why not?

1646
02:19:03,333 --> 02:19:05,875
Well, for starters, you'd have
changed the course of history.

1647
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:12,000
That's supposed to be
a bad thing?

1648
02:19:16,125 --> 02:19:17,917
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1649
02:19:21,709 --> 02:19:22,709
Here.

1650
02:19:27,834 --> 02:19:28,959
For who?

1651
02:19:56,291 --> 02:19:57,875
Marion.

1652
02:19:59,125 --> 02:20:00,166
Hey.

1653
02:20:19,458 --> 02:20:20,458
Teddy.

1654
02:20:22,083 --> 02:20:23,083
Marion.

1655
02:20:25,792 --> 02:20:26,792
What are you doing?

1656
02:20:28,333 --> 02:20:29,500
Putting groceries away.

1657
02:20:31,792 --> 02:20:34,500
There wasn't a scrap of food
in this place.

1658
02:20:35,417 --> 02:20:37,417
No. Really.

1659
02:20:42,208 --> 02:20:44,417
Someone told me you were back.

1660
02:20:51,875 --> 02:20:53,500
Are you back, Indy?

1661
02:20:55,125 --> 02:20:56,834
It was explosives,

1662
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,166
and Indy was running,
Marion was running,

1663
02:20:59,333 --> 02:21:02,000
and suddenly the plane exploded.

1664
02:21:05,709 --> 02:21:07,750
Indy, you're up and about.

1665
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:10,333
Yes, I am.

1666
02:21:11,458 --> 02:21:12,458
Yes.

1667
02:21:13,083 --> 02:21:15,125
Why don't we go
and get some ice cream, kids?

1668
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:16,651
But Marion
just bought some.

1669
02:21:16,709 --> 02:21:17,935
Oh,
I know a better place.

1670
02:21:17,959 --> 02:21:20,166
You can never have too much
ice cream, can you?

1671
02:21:23,875 --> 02:21:24,875
See you later.

1672
02:21:28,458 --> 02:21:31,375
<i>A British</i>
<i>tar is a soaring soul</i>

1673
02:21:31,542 --> 02:21:34,375
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

1674
02:21:34,542 --> 02:21:36,375
<i>His energetic fist</i>

1675
02:21:36,542 --> 02:21:38,959
<i>Should be ready to resist...</i>

1676
02:21:40,875 --> 02:21:42,166
That looks bad.

1677
02:21:43,667 --> 02:21:44,917
Does it hurt?

1678
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,917
Everything hurts.

1679
02:21:51,792 --> 02:21:53,417
I know how that feels.

1680
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,125
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1681
02:22:10,709 --> 02:22:11,709
Here.

1682
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:13,750
It doesn't hurt here.

1683
02:22:22,041 --> 02:22:23,583
And here.

1684
02:22:47,166 --> 02:22:49,542
Jabari, Alia,
slow down!

1685
02:22:49,709 --> 02:22:51,834
Helena! Hurry up!

1686
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,667
<i>I scream, you scream...</i>

1687
02:22:54,834 --> 02:22:56,959
Everybody, slow down.

1688
02:22:57,125 --> 02:22:59,267
<i>- I scream, you scream</i>
- KIDS: <i>I scream, I scream</i>

1689
02:22:59,291 --> 02:23:01,000
<i>We all scream for ice cream!</i>

1690
02:23:01,166 --> 02:23:03,250
Slow down.
