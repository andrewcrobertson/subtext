1
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,737
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,282
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,744
Through wind and darkness, I summon thee.

4
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,163
Speak!

5
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,917
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,047
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,925
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,095
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,683
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,895
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,275
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:18,322
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,451
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,496
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,583
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,127
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,130
Snow White!

18
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,416
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,210
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:18,007
<i>We are standing by a wishing well</i>

21
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,136
<i>Make a wish into the well</i>

22
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,847
<i>That's all you have to do</i>

23
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,017
<i>And if you hear it echoing</i>

24
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,520
<i>Your wish will soon come true</i>

25
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,359
<i>I'm wishing</i>

26
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,195
<i>For the one I love</i>

27
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,657
<i>To find me</i>

28
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,368
<i>Today</i>

29
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,038
<i>I'm hoping</i>

30
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>And I'm dreaming of</i>

31
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,586
<i>The nice things</i>

32
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,547
<i>He'll say</i>

33
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,356
<i>I'm wishing</i>

34
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>For the one I love</i>

35
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,737
<i>To find me</i>

36
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,574
- <i>Today</i>
- <i>Today</i>

37
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,244
- Oh!
- Hello.

38
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,413
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,582
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,210
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,922
<i>Now that I've found you</i>

42
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,301
<i>Hear what I have to say</i>

43
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,805
<i>One song</i>

44
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,475
<i>I have but one song</i>

45
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,939
<i>One song only for you</i>

46
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:05,072
<i>One heart tenderly beating</i>

47
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,993
<i>Ever entreating</i>

48
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,497
<i>Constant and true</i>

49
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,084
<i>One love</i>

50
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,963
<i>That has possessed me</i>

51
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,467
<i>One love</i>

52
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:29,138
<i>Thrilling me through</i>

53
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,641
<i>One song</i>

54
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:37,021
<i>My heart keeps singing</i>

55
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,649
<i>Of one love</i>

56
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:46,655
<i>Only for you</i>

57
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,672
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,009
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,637
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,847
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,726
And there, my faithful huntsman,

62
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,187
you will kill her!

63
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,815
But, Your Majesty, the little princess!

64
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,399
Silence!

65
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,695
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,324
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,494
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,247
you do not fail,

69
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,544
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,056
<i>One song
I have but one song</i>

71
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,781
Hello there.

72
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,741
What's the matter?

73
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,536
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,205
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,749
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,215
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,718
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,928
That's better.

79
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,473
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,311
There they are!

81
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,064
Can you fly?

82
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,943
Goodbye. Goodbye!

83
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,078
I can't. I can't do it.

84
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:03,167
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,044
I don't understand!

86
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,755
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,132
- But who?
- The queen.

88
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,258
- The queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,761
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,847
In the woods! Anywhere! Never come back!

91
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,809
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,022
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,058
Oh!

94
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,230
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,983
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,117
But you don't know what I've been through.

98
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,912
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,003
What do you do when things go wrong?

101
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,591
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,582
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

103
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,086
<i>Life is just like a bright, sunny day</i>

104
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,506
<i>Your cares fade away</i>

105
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,175
<i>And your heart is young</i>

106
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,516
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

107
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>All the world seems to waken anew</i>

108
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,356
<i>Rejoicing with you</i>

109
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,693
<i>As the song is sung</i>

110
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,363
<i>There's no use in grumbling</i>

111
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,034
<i>When raindrops come tumbling</i>

112
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,664
<i>Remember you're the one</i>

113
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:16,670
<i>Who can fill the world with sunshine</i>

114
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,382
<i>When you smile and you sing</i>

115
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,220
<i>Everything is in tune and it's spring</i>

116
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,639
<i>And life flows along</i>

117
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:33,896
<i>With a smile and a song</i>

118
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,487
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,947
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,867
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,205
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,042
I can't sleep in the ground like you

123
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,045
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,716
And I'm sure no nest would
possibly be big enough for me.

125
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,386
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,013
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,807
You do?

128
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,311
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,316
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,861
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,711
I like it here.

132
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,475
It's dark inside.

133
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,155
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,201
Hello?

135
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,329
May I come in?

136
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,437
Oh!

137
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,942
What a cute little chair!

138
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,031
Why, there's seven little chairs!

139
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,617
Must be seven little children.

140
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,246
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

141
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,252
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

142
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,300
And a shoe!

143
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,350
And just look at that fireplace.

144
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,310
It's covered with dust.

145
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,112
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

146
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,073
My, my, my!

147
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,409
What a pile of dirty dishes!

148
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,122
And just look at that broom!

149
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,752
Why, they've never swept this room.

150
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,213
You'd think their mother would...

151
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,758
Maybe they have no mother.

152
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,678
Then they're orphans.

153
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,139
That's too bad.

154
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,975
I know!

155
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,602
We'll clean the house and surprise them.

156
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,646
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

157
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,780
Now, you wash the dishes.

158
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,116
You tidy up the room.

159
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,077
You clean the fireplace.

160
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,163
And I will use the broom.

161
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,547
<i>Just whistle while you work</i>

162
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>And cheerfully together
We can tidy up the place</i>

163
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,890
<i>So, hum a merry tune</i>

164
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:27,022
<i>It won't take long when there's a song
To help you set the pace</i>

165
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,357
<i>And as you sweep the room</i>

166
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,568
<i>Imagine that the broom</i>

167
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,865
<i>Is someone that you love and soon
You'll find you're dancing to the tune</i>

168
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,827
Oh! No, no, no. Put them in the tub.

169
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,371
<i>When hearts are high
The time will fly</i>

170
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,707
<i>So, whistle while you work</i>

171
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,052
Not under the rug.

172
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>So, whistle while you work</i>

173
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,294
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

174
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,546
<i>In our mine the whole day through</i>

175
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:43,259
<i>To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Is what we like to do</i>

176
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,512
<i>It ain't no trick to get rich quick</i>

177
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,806
<i>If ya dig, dig, dig
With a shovel or a pick</i>

178
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,560
<i>In a mine</i>

179
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:57,232
- <i>Where a million diamonds</i>
- <i>Shine</i>

180
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

181
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,735
<i>From early morn 'til night</i>

182
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,449
<i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Up everything in sight</i>

183
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,077
<i>We dig up diamonds by the score</i>

184
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,287
<i>A thousand rubies
Sometimes more</i>

185
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,623
<i>Though we don't know what we dig 'em for</i>

186
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,959
<i>We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig</i>

187
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,782
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

188
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,411
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

189
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,039
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

190
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,541
<i>Heigh-ho</i>

191
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,962
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

192
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,051
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

193
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,721
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

194
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,143
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

195
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:27,280
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

196
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:31,659
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, hum</i>

197
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:36,539
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

198
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,002
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

199
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

200
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,345
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

201
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,974
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

202
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:03,817
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

203
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,413
Let's see what's upstairs.

204
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,231
Oh, what adorable little beds!

205
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,528
And look, they have their names
carved on them.

206
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,573
Doc, Happy,

207
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,074
Sneezy, Dopey.

208
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,202
What funny names for children!

209
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,998
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

210
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,002
I'm a little sleepy myself.

211
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,343
Oh! Oh!

212
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,077
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

213
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:43,249
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

214
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,338
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

215
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,967
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

216
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:57,764
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

217
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,694
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

218
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:16,407
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go</i>

219
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,037
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

220
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:25,625
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

221
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,712
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...</i>

222
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:30,964
Look!

223
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,969
Our house! The lit's light.
The light's lit.

224
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,476
Jiminy Crickets!

225
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,062
- The door is open.
- The chimney's smoking.

226
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,647
- Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.

227
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,315
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.

228
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,817
Or a dragon.

229
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,362
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.

230
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,865
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

231
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,660
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.

232
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,787
- What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.

233
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,623
Yes. We'll squeak up. Sneak up.

234
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,167
Come on, hen. Men. Follow me.

235
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,427
Careful, men. Search every cook and nanny.

236
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,888
Hook and granny. Crooked fan.

237
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,723
Search everywhere.

238
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,787
Quiet.

239
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,086
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

240
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,258
Chair's been dusted!

241
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,095
Our window's been washed.

242
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,972
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

243
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,267
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

244
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,145
There's dirty work afoot.

245
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,273
Sink's empty.

246
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,276
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

247
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,988
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

248
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,076
My cup's been washed.

249
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,412
Sugar's gone.

250
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,124
Something's cooking.

251
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,293
Smells good!

252
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,463
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

253
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,845
See? It's witches' brew.

254
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,307
Look what's happened to our stable. Table.

255
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,017
Flowers!

256
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,771
Look, goldenrod.

257
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,483
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

258
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,654
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I...

259
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,204
Thanks!

260
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,504
Hey!

261
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,181
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

262
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,017
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

263
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,562
When you gotta, you gotta. I gotta.

264
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,148
It's coming.

265
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,444
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.

266
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,615
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.

267
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,074
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.

268
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,618
Make a hard knot.

269
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,786
There, that will hold him.

270
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,873
Thanks!

271
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,210
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

272
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,718
- What's that?
- That's it.

273
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,555
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.

274
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,414
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.

275
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,753
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

276
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,964
Up. Down.

277
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,942
Here, take it.

278
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,945
Don't be nervous.

279
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,631
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

280
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,842
Yes! Right behind ya.

281
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,010
Here it comes!

282
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,189
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.

283
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,857
Hold it shut.

284
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,079
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.

285
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,288
Get it now!

286
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,665
- Quick!
- Give it to it!

287
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,750
Don't let it get away!

288
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,839
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

289
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,758
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?

290
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,386
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?

291
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,680
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?

292
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,390
What was it doin'?

293
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,106
He says it's a monster asleep in our beds!

294
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,149
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.

295
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,275
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

296
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,736
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.

297
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,363
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.

298
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,198
We'll kill it dead.

299
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,018
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!

300
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,937
- Gee!
- What a monster!

301
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,564
It covers three beds.

302
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,275
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

303
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,985
Which end do we kill?

304
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,140
Well...

305
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,644
- What is it?
- Why, it's a girl!

306
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,482
She's mighty purdy.

307
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:14,153
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

308
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,656
Angel! She's a female!

309
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,660
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

310
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,830
What are wicked wiles?

311
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,124
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

312
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,586
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

313
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,006
Let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

314
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,549
- Look out.
- She's movin'.

315
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,718
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?

316
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,178
Hide.

317
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,184
Oh, dear.

318
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,355
I wonder if the children are...

319
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,359
Oh!

320
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,701
Why, why, you're little men!

321
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,042
How do you do?

322
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,217
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?

323
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,595
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

324
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,349
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

325
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,352
I know, you're Doc.

326
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,231
Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.

327
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,235
And you're Bashful.

328
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,738
Oh, gosh!

329
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,618
And you, you're Sleepy.

330
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,412
How'd you guess?

331
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,749
And you...

332
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,503
You're Sneezy.

333
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,429
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.

334
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,180
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

335
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,058
You mean he can't talk?

336
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,102
He don't know. He never tried.

337
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,605
Oh, that's too bad.

338
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,235
Oh!

339
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,070
You must be Grumpy.

340
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,240
Oh, yes! Yes!

341
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,619
We know who we are.

342
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,413
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

343
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,833
Yeah! What are you and who are you doin'?

344
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,045
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

345
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,714
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

346
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,507
- Snow White?
- The princess?

347
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:41,675
Yes.

348
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:46,347
Well, my dear quincess. Princess.

349
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,891
We're honored. Yes, we're...

350
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,019
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

351
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,856
We're bad as cornets. No, no,
as bad as... What was I sayin'?

352
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,150
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

353
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,945
Who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

354
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,823
- Who's... Gutter...
- Oh, shut up and tell her to get out!

355
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,409
Please don't send me away!

356
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,578
- If you do, she'll kill me.
- Kill you?

357
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,829
- Who will?
- Yes, who?

358
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,915
- My stepmother, the queen.
- The queen?

359
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,541
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!

360
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,711
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!

361
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm warnin' ya.

362
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,298
If the queen finds her here,

363
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,843
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

364
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,513
But she doesn't know where I am.

365
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,516
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

366
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,185
She's full of black magic.

367
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,355
She can even make herself invisible.

368
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,193
Might be in this room right now.

369
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,033
Oh, she'll never find me here.

370
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,662
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

371
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,373
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

372
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,666
Cook?

373
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,335
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?

374
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,963
- Apple dumplings!
- Yes!

375
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,673
Crapple dumpkins.

376
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,925
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

377
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,220
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!

378
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,827
Soup!

379
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,370
Hooray!

380
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,097
Just a minute.

381
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:57,144
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

382
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,064
Wash? Wash?

383
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:03,734
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Knew there was a catch to it.

384
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,406
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

385
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,492
'Tain't New Year's.

386
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,703
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

387
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,413
Perhaps we...

388
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:21,627
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?

389
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,172
When? When. You said when...

390
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:30,177
Why, last week. Why, recently!

391
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,431
Yes, recently!

392
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,935
Oh, recently!

393
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,313
Let me see your hands.

394
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,822
Let me see your hands!

395
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,497
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

396
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,503
Come on, let's see them.

397
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,715
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

398
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,634
And you?

399
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,306
Worse than I thought!

400
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,016
Oh!

401
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,979
How shocking!

402
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,067
Goodness me, this will never do.

403
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,198
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

404
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,695
Well, aren't you going to wash?

405
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,575
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

406
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,421
Aw! Did you hurt yourself?

407
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,435
Women!

408
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,231
Courage, men, courage.

409
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,442
Don't be nervous.

410
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,948
Gosh, it's wet!

411
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,618
It's cold, too!

412
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,371
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

413
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,290
Well, it'll please the princess.

414
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,751
I'll take a chance for her!

415
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,127
Me, too!

416
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,506
Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

417
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,717
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch,

418
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,011
and they'll walk all over ya!

419
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,598
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on, now, men.

420
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,851
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?

421
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,270
Do ya get in the tub?

422
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,855
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?

423
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,109
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

424
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,028
<i>Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace</i>

425
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,948
<i>Just pull up your sleeves
And get 'em in place</i>

426
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,201
<i>Then scoop up the water
And rub it on your face and go...</i>

427
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,624
<i>Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff</i>

428
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,127
<i>Work up a lather
And when you got enough</i>

429
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,338
<i>Get your hands full of water
And you snort and you snuff and go...</i>

430
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,219
<i>You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub</i>

431
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,305
<i>You sputter and splash
All over the tub</i>

432
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,058
<i>You may be cold and wet
When you're done</i>

433
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,020
<i>But you gotta admit
It's good and clean fun</i>

434
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,981
<i>So, splash all you like
'Tain't any trick</i>

435
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,484
<i>As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick</i>

436
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,487
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

437
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,422
Next thing ya know

438
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,675
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

439
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,221
and smellin' ya up
with that stuff called "perfoom."

440
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:13,043
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

441
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:18,131
I'd like to see anybody make me wash
if I didn't wanna.

442
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,581
Get him!

443
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,835
Hey, let go of me!

444
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,546
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

445
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,714
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

446
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,676
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

447
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,262
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

448
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:10,142
Don't get excited! Don't get...
Don't get up! Don't get...

449
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,648
Get the soap!

450
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,327
- Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.

451
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,463
Never say die. Never say die.

452
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,047
You don't...

453
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,030
<i>Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied</i>

454
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,657
<i>That he'll look mighty cute
As soon as he's dried</i>

455
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,744
<i>Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...</i>

456
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,054
Ain't he sweet?

457
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,431
Smells like a petunia.

458
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,351
He sure is cute!

459
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,729
You'll pay dearly for this!

460
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,064
Supper!

461
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,527
- Supper!
- Food. Hooray!

462
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,176
Magic Mirror on the wall,

463
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,596
who now is the fairest one of all?

464
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,559
Over the seven jeweled hills

465
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,186
beyond the seventh fall,

466
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,772
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

467
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,569
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

468
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,699
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

469
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,451
The huntsman has brought me proof.

470
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,955
Behold her heart.

471
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,458
Snow White still lives,

472
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,669
the fairest in the land.

473
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,507
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

474
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,135
The heart of a pig!

475
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,804
Then I've been tricked!

476
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,204
The heart of a pig!

477
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,832
The blundering fool!

478
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,628
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

479
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,631
in a disguise so complete

480
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,176
no one will ever suspect.

481
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:38,391
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

482
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,854
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

483
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,692
Mummy Dust to make me old.

484
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,155
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.

485
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,664
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

486
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,384
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

487
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,556
A blast of wind

488
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,102
to fan my hate!

489
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,814
A thunderbolt

490
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,901
to mix it well.

491
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,946
Now,

492
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,075
begin thy magic spell.

493
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,766
Look!

494
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,102
My hands!

495
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,443
My voice!

496
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,362
My voice.

497
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,745
A perfect disguise.

498
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,792
And now,

499
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,796
a special sort of death

500
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,466
for one so fair.

501
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,135
What shall it be?

502
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,845
Ah!

503
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,348
A poisoned apple!

504
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,185
Sleeping Death.

505
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,498
<i>I'd like to dance and tap my feet</i>

506
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,500
<i>But they won't keep in rhythm</i>

507
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,629
<i>You see, I washed 'em both today
And I can't do nothin' with 'em</i>

508
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,633
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing</i>

509
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,387
<i>Isn't this a silly song
For anyone to sing?</i>

510
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,608
<i>I...</i>

511
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,284
Oh, gosh!

512
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,042
<i>I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb</i>

513
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,045
<i>And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him</i>

514
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:41,259
<i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing</i>

515
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,262
<i>Isn't this a silly song
For anyone to sing?</i>

516
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,252
Watch out. Be care... Watch... Watch...

517
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,338
Watch... Watch...

518
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,759
Thanks.

519
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,307
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

520
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,268
Hey! Hey!

521
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,902
Hooray!

522
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,693
That was fun!

523
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:47,528
Now you do something.

524
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,238
Well, what shall I do?

525
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,867
- Tell us a story.
- Yes, tell us a story.

526
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,953
- A true story.
- A love story.

527
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,041
Well, once there was a princess.

528
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,710
Was the princess you?

529
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,880
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?

530
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,174
Oh, it was very easy.

531
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,511
Anyone could see
that the prince was charming.

532
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,721
The only one for me.

533
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,390
Was he strong and handsome?

534
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,226
Was he big and tall?

535
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,063
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.

536
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,190
Did he say he loved ya?

537
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,317
Did he steal a kiss?

538
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,570
<i>He was so romantic</i>

539
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:34,575
<i>I could not resist</i>

540
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:49,841
<i>Some day my prince will come</i>

541
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:55,680
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

542
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:02,353
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

543
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,732
<i>To be happy forever</i>

544
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,943
<i>I know</i>

545
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,238
Mush!

546
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:18,286
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

547
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:24,458
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

548
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:30,131
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

549
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,970
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

550
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:42,894
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

551
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,939
<i>Come true</i>

552
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,537
Oh, my goodness!

553
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,539
It's past bedtime.

554
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,625
Go right upstairs to bed.

555
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,254
Wait! Hold on there, men!

556
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:16,344
The princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

557
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,970
But where will you sleep?

558
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:22,850
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in...

559
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,101
In a pig's eye!

560
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,355
In a pig's eye. Sty. No, no! I mean...

561
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,149
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

562
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,319
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

563
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,322
Now don't you worry about us.

564
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:41,452
- We'll be all right, ma'am.
- Go right on up now, my dear.

565
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,788
Well, if you insist.

566
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,333
Good night.

567
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,293
Good night, Princess.

568
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,257
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

569
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,635
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

570
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,721
Well, pleasant dreams.

571
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,724
Pleasant dreams.

572
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:09,939
Let go!

573
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,857
- I saw it first!
- Now, men, don't get excited.

574
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,277
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

575
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,696
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

576
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:34,547
Bless the seven little men
who have been so kind to me.

577
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:39,093
And may my dreams come true.

578
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:40,845
Amen.

579
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,266
Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me.

580
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,102
Women!

581
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,444
A fine kettle of fish!

582
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,217
Dip the apple in the brew.

583
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,680
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

584
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,402
Look! On the skin!

585
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:05,573
The symbol of what lies within.

586
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,911
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

587
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,747
To make her hunger for a bite.

588
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,669
Have a bite?

589
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,883
It's not for you.

590
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,260
It's for Snow White.

591
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,014
When she breaks the tender peel

592
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,850
to taste the apple in my hand,

593
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,687
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

594
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,441
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

595
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,862
But wait!

596
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,782
There may be an antidote.

597
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,035
Nothing must be overlooked.

598
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:56,040
Oh, here it is!

599
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,636
"Love's First Kiss."

600
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,054
Bah!

601
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,473
No fear of that.

602
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,434
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

603
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,063
She'll be buried alive!

604
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,118
Buried alive!

605
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,173
Thirsty?

606
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,841
Have a drink!

607
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,571
Now, don't forget, my dear.

608
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,324
The old queen's a sly one,

609
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,451
full of witchcraft.

610
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,745
So, beware of strangers.

611
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,914
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

612
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,418
See you tonight.

613
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,923
Yes. Well, come on, men.

614
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,096
Be awful careful

615
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,933
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I...

616
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:24,188
- Goodbye.
- Oh, gosh!

617
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,192
Disgustin'!

618
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,904
And be sure to watch out.
To wa... To wa...

619
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,530
To wa...

620
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,366
Watch out.

621
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,077
Thanks.

622
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,608
Well, all right.

623
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,530
But that's the last...

624
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,117
Oh, go on. Run along.

625
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,995
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

626
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,956
<i>It's off to work we go</i>

627
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,584
<i>Heigh-ho...</i>

628
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,795
Goodbye! Goodbye!

629
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:35,718
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

630
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,054
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

631
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,679
Goodbye, Grumpy!

632
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,651
The little men will be away

633
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:37,279
and she'll be all alone

634
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,325
with a harmless old peddler woman.

635
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,830
A harmless old peddler woman!

636
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:01,720
<i>Some day my prince will come</i>

637
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:07,476
<i>Some day we'll meet again</i>

638
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,397
<i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

639
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:17,569
<i>To be happy forever I know</i>

640
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:25,160
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

641
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:30,082
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

642
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:34,753
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

643
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,092
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

644
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,763
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

645
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,599
<i>Come true</i>

646
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,776
All alone, my pet?

647
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,405
Why, yes, I am. But...

648
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,117
The little men are not here?

649
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,203
No, they're not, but...

650
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,417
Making pies?

651
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,378
Yes, gooseberry pies.

652
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,714
It's apple pies

653
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:22,092
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

654
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:27,472
Pies made from apples like these.

655
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,561
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!

656
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,106
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

657
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:41,862
Like to try one?

658
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,993
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

659
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,337
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

660
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,298
Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.

661
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,010
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

662
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,806
There, there. I'm sorry.

663
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,809
Oh! My heart!

664
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,854
Oh, my poor heart.

665
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,816
Take me into the house and let me rest.

666
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,028
A drink of water, please.

667
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,018
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

668
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,356
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go</i>

669
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,694
<i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>

670
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,418
Hey, look!

671
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,343
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

672
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,262
Go on! Get outta here!

673
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,436
What ails these crazy birds?

674
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,688
They've gone plumb daffy.

675
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,939
Yeah, they've...

676
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:51,533
And because you've been so good
to poor old Granny,

677
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,745
I'll share a secret with you.

678
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,414
This is no ordinary apple.

679
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,125
It's a magic wishing apple.

680
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,961
A wishing apple?

681
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,421
Yes!

682
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:09,468
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

683
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,554
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.

684
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,724
Now, make a wish

685
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,143
and take a bite.

686
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,896
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.

687
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,647
- 'Tain't natural.
- There's something wrong.

688
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,609
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

689
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,488
Maybe the old queen's got Snow White.

690
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,281
- The queen!
- Snow White!

691
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,784
The queen'll kill her! We gotta save her!

692
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,328
Yes! Yes! We gotta save her!

693
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:37,871
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?

694
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,165
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

695
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,502
Come on! Giddap!

696
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,430
Wait for me! Wait for...

697
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:13,865
There must be something
your little heart desires.

698
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:17,327
Perhaps there's someone you love.

699
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,913
Well, there is someone.

700
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,290
I thought so. I thought so!

701
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,254
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

702
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,215
Now, take the apple, dearie,

703
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,883
and make a wish.

704
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,805
I wish... I wish...

705
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,182
That's it, go on! Go on.

706
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,907
...and that he will
carry me away to his castle

707
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,287
where we will live happily ever after.

708
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,331
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

709
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,005
Don't let the wish grow cold!

710
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,759
Oh, I feel strange.

711
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,848
Her breath will still.

712
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,227
Her blood congeal.

713
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:38,241
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

714
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,752
Hurry, hurry.

715
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,218
There she goes!

716
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,614
After her!

717
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,813
I'm trapped! What will I do?

718
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,066
The meddling little fools!

719
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:01,908
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

720
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:05,745
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

721
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,248
Look out!

722
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:20,380
- <i>One song</i>
- <i>One song</i>

723
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:24,968
<i>I have but one song</i>

724
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,637
- <i>One song</i>
- <i>One song</i>

725
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:32,475
- <i>Only for you</i>
- <i>For you</i>

726
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,562
<i>One heart</i>

727
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:39,315
<i>Tenderly beating</i>

728
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:43,153
<i>Ever entreating</i>

729
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:49,159
- <i>Constant and true</i>
- <i>So true</i>

730
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:52,579
- <i>One love</i>
- <i>One love</i>

731
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:56,666
<i>That has possessed me</i>

732
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,253
- <i>One love</i>
- <i>One love</i>

733
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:05,592
- <i>Thrilling me through</i>
- <i>So true</i>

734
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,845
- <i>One song</i>
- <i>One song</i>

735
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:13,475
- <i>My heart keeps singing</i>
- <i>Keeps singing</i>

736
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:18,855
- <i>Of one love</i>
- <i>One love</i>

737
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:25,361
<i>Only for you</i>

738
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:57,477
<i>And away to his castle you'll go</i>

739
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:03,566
<i>To be happy forever we know</i>

740
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,398
Goodbye.

741
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,528
Goodbye, Grumpy.

742
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,780
Goodbye.

743
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,789
Oh, Dopey.

744
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,420
Goodbye!

745
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:26,899
<i>Some day when spring is here</i>

746
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:32,655
<i>We'll find our love anew</i>

747
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:36,909
<i>And the birds will sing</i>

748
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:40,747
<i>And wedding bells will ring</i>

749
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,918
<i>Some day when my dreams</i>

750
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:49,297
<i>Come true</i>
