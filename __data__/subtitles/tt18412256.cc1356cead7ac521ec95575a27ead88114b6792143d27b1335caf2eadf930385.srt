to get us to Yvaga.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,101
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

180
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,304
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

181
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,638
Decommissioned ships
still carry

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,106
tons of functional equipment.

183
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,541
And the hyperlink shows

184
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,412
that ship
still has a few pods left.

[chuckles in disbelief]

186
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,617
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

187
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:17,220
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

188
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,521
Before someone else does.

-Well, of course we are.
-[man] No. No, we're not.

what do you need me for?

195
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,369
Andy.

196

-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

197
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,439
[Bjorn] Mm-hmm.

198
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,175
[man] He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

199
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,576
He can access
a terminal on the ship

200
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,278
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

201
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,613
It's the only way to get in.

202
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,816
Okay,
but what if we get caught?

203
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:48,518
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

204
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,286
Right, Rain's not comin'.

205
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,322
Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

206
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:56,425
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

207
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,593
He's not your
brother though, is he?

208
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,830
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

209
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,364
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

210
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,065
that your dad
found in the trash.

211
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,004
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

-[Bjorn] What?

214
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,706
-I didn't say anything.
-[man] Rain, wait.

215
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,808
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

216
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,142
can be a dick sometimes,
all right?

217
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,712
But he is right
about something.

218
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,780
You need to wake up.

219
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:17,848
Because this company,

220
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,949
they're not gonna
give us anything.

221
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,317
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

[Tyler] The signal's
coming from in here.

527
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:31,802
[Rain] Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

528
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,837
[Tyler] Yeah.

529
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,839
[Rain] <i>Doesn't look</i>

530
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,306
[Tyler] No, it doesn't.

531
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,542
But it's definitely deserted.

-[Taser powering up]
-Hey, Andy, look at this.

533
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,582
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

534
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,950
if I just amp up the juices.

536
00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,922
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

537
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:52,923
[Tyler] All right, enough.

538
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:55,226
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

539
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:59,428

I was joking.

541
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,867

548
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,293
[Tyler] Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

549
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:31,393
The fuel must be in that room.

550

[Tyler] Nah,

574
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:57,848
[Tyler] Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

575
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,417
Andy, the door.

576
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,420
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

577
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:05,521
What does that mean?

578
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:06,859
[Tyler] Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

579
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,025
So you're trying
to tell me that

580
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,492
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

581
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,560
but can't open
a random fucking door

582
00:35:11,562 --> 00:35:12,796

We'll get 'em out of there.

can't open those doors,

we'll have better luck.

its credentials to Andy.

602
00:36:24,236 --> 00:36:26,204

Right, this is an
F44AA pulse rifle.

1225
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:30,692
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

1226
01:13:30,694 --> 01:13:32,061
It's what the
Colonial Marines used.

1227
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:33,930
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

1228
01:13:33,932 --> 01:13:35,433

you put that under your arm.

All right.
Aim it towards Andy.

1232

Pull the trigger halfway.

1233
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:48,947

Aiming assistance.

1237
01:13:56,821 --> 01:13:58,054
If that thing
comes towards you,

1238
01:13:58,056 --> 01:14:00,890
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

1239
01:14:00,892 --> 01:14:02,761

-Uh...

1240

1241
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:08,464
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

1242
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:10,200
450 rounds.

1243
01:14:10,202 --> 01:14:12,003
[Andy] And you mustn't fire
a single one.

1244
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,007
Acid for blood. Remember?

1245
01:14:17,075 --> 01:14:19,075
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

1246
01:14:19,077 --> 01:14:20,910
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

1247
01:14:20,912 --> 01:14:22,278
You shoot that creature

1248
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,816
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

1249
01:14:25,217 --> 01:14:26,182
And we all die.

1250
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,017
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

1251
01:14:28,019 --> 01:14:30,019
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

1252
01:14:30,021 --> 01:14:32,290
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

1253
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,224
Maybe.

1254
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:35,393

in the cryo-pod. Okay?
