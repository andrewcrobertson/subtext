00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,107
What's your name again?

3
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,400
Chrissie.

4
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,319
Where are we going?

5
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,486
Swimming.

6
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,576
Slow up. Slow down.

7
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,288
I'm not
drunk! Slow down!

8
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,666
Wait. I'm coming.

9
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,461
I'm coming.

10
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,505
I'm definitely coming.

11
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,673
Whoa.

12
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,300
Hold on. Whoa!

13
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,269
I can swim.

14
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,814
I just can't walk
or undress myself.

15
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,878
Come on in the water!

16
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,797
Take it easy.

17
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,877
Oh, God, help!

18
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,053
Please help me!

19
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm coming.

20
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,767
It hurts!

21
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,515
...local
<i>fishing reported good.</i>

22
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,684
<i>Amity Boat Rental
Yard's opening early</i>

23
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,853

24
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>This is WISS...</i>

25
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,904
How come the sun
didn't use to shine in here?

26
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,285
We bought the house in
the fall, and this is summer.

27
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,666
Somebody feed the dogs.

28
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:34,959
Right.

29
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,341
Do you see the kids?

30
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,432
They must be in the back yard.

31
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,518
In Amity you say "yard."

32
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,981
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."

33
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,027
How's that?

34
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,278
Like you're from New York.

35
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,450
Mum, I got cut. I
got hit by a vampire.

36
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,335
You were playing on
those swings, weren't you?

37
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,037
Those swings are dangerous.

38
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,721
Stay off there. I
haven't fixed them yet.

39
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,500
I think you're going to live.

40
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,211
It's not the prettiest
thing I've ever seen. Hello.

41
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,088
Yes. Can I go swimming?

42
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,465
Yeah, but let me
clean this thing off first.

43
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,718
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?

44
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,180
Oh, no.

45
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,184
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about

46
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,563
15, 20 minutes. All right?

47
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,147
Dry you off. Okay.

48
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,899
Go on, get a Band-Aid.

49
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,569
Got to
go. Missing person.

50
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,863
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

51
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,910
Listen, Chief...

52
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,704
be careful, will you?

53
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,830
In this town?

54
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,498
Hi, Dad.

55
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,375
Wait a minute. Let me get on.

56
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,127
I want my cup back!

57
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,420
You'll get it.

58
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,923
Wave goodbye. Bye.

59
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,414
Nobody saw her
go into the water?

60
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,959
Somebody could've. I
was sort of passed out.

61
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,170
You mean, she ran out on you?

62
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,379
No, sir.

63
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,550
She must've drowned.

64
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,720
Look, I reported
it to you, didn't I?

65
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,929
You live here?

66
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,097
No. Hartford.

67
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,017
I go to Trinity. My
folks live in Greenwich.

68
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,381
Your folks were
born here, right?

69
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,895
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

70
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,980
They moved off
when my dad retired.

71
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,065
You an Islander?

72
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,232
No. New York City.

73
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,860
You here for the
summer? Come on.

74
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,750
Hold it.

75
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,764
Oh, Jesus.

76
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,584
Well, you're up awful
early. Is the Chief in there?

77
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,922
Chief, what have you got on?

78
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,924
If this new filing
system is to work,

79
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,926
you must keep outdated
stuff off my desk.

80
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,011
Just the pending,
all right? Yes, Chief.

81
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,848
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.

82
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,809
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been

83
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,311
karate-ing the picket
fences.

84
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,024
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.

85
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,873
The Fire Chief wants you to
go over the Fourth of July...

86
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,167
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities

87
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,419
that the city fathers
are planning for today.

88
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,879
Right away. Hendricks!

89
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,173
Where do we keep the
"Beach Closed" signs?

90
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,507
We never had any. No?

91
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,011
There's a dead truck with New
Hampshire plates in front of my store.

92
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,682
Just have him fill out
the form. Just fill it out.

93
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,832
Look what the kids did to
my fence. 8 and 9-year-olds...

94
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,626
Glasses? Yeah, glasses.

95
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,588
I'll call you later in the
afternoon. I promise.

96
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,513
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.

97
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,973
The summer ginks
come down here in June.

98
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,935
You haven't got one
thing on here I ordered.

99
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,272
Not a beach umbrella, not a
sun lounger, no beach balls.

100
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,274
If I can't get service...

101
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,992
Chief, Polly sent me to tell you

102
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,078
that there's a bunch of
Boy Scouts out in Avril Bay

103
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,121
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.

104
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,666
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

105
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,459
Okay. Come on, get out of there.

106
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,086
Take this stuff
back to the office

107
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,712
and get to work on those signs.

108
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,174
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P. D."

109
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,801
Let Polly do the printing.

110
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,029
What's the matter
with my printing?

111
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,388
Let Polly do the printing.

112
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,889
Chief Brody!

113
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,727
What have you got there?

114
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,312
Listen, we had a shark attack

115
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,022
at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

116
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,732
Fatal. I have to
batten down the beach.

117
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,444
Albert, come
on, you kook. Keep your arms up.

118
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,829
Charlie, take me
out to those kids, will you?

119
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,606
Martin, you're going to shut down
the beaches on your own authority?

120
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,399
What other authority do I need?

121
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,961
Technically, you
need a civic ordinance

122
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,485
or a resolution by a board of...

123
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,987
That's just going by the book.

124
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,405
We're really a little anxious

125
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,241
that you're rushing into
something serious here.

126
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,368
This is your first
summer, you know.

127
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,162
What does that mean?

128
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:30,207
I'm only trying to say that
Amity is a summer town.

129
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,835
We need summer dollars.

130
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,462
If they can't swim here

131
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,380
they'll be glad to
swim at the beaches

132
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,716
of Cape Cod, the
Hamptons, Long Island.

133
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,135
That doesn't mean we
serve them a smorgasbord.

134
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,639
But we've never had that
kind of trouble in these waters.

135
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,557
What else could've
done that to that girl?

136
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,725
A boat propeller?

137
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,062
I think possibly, yes,
a boating accident.

138
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,788
That's not what you
told me on the phone.

139
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,273
I was wrong.

140
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,275
We'll have to amend our reports.

141
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
And you'll stand by that?

142
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,070
I'll stand by that.

143
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,866
Martin, a summer girl goes
swimming, swims out a little far.

144
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,494
She tires, fishing
boat comes along...

145
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,703
It's happened before.

146
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,247
I don't think you
appreciate the gut reaction

147
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,499
people have to these things.

148
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,543
Larry, I appreciate it. I'm
just reacting to what I was told.

149
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,171
Martin, it's all psychological.

150
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,550
You yell, "Barracuda!" and
everybody says, "Huh? What?"

151
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,388
You yell, "Shark!"...

152
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,684
we've got a panic on our
hands on the Fourth of July.

153
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,896
Okay. You can take us back now.

154
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,533
Here's mommy, here.

155
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,328
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

156
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,414
Let me see your fingers.

157
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,417
Alex Kintner, they're
beginning to prune.

158
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,419
Just let me go
out a little longer.

159
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,670
Just 10 more minutes.

160
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,879
Thanks.

161
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,591
There
are no Islanders.

162
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,903
None of them are
from the island.

163
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:04,969
It's just a big bother.

164
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,072
They're bringing in...

165
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,346
All I want to know...

166
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,473
I just want to know
one simple thing.

167
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,100
When do I get to
become an Islander?

168
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,310
Ellen, never.

169
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,855
You're not born here, you're
not an Islander. That's it.

170
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,307
<i>Nantucket Ferries...</i>

171
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>...to Amity, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket islands.</i>

172
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,396
<i>Monday to Thursday, 8:40,
15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m.</i>

173
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,149
<i>Starting July 1 , 8:30 p.m...</i>

174
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,237
Come back here.

175
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,791
But don't bother him.
Come right back. Okay. I won't.

176
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,754
Martin, I know you got a
lot of problems downtown

177
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,924
but I've got problems at the
house I wish you'd take care of.

178
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,592
One, I've got some cats parking

179
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,116
in front of the
house, I can't get...

180
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,473
And that garbage truck next
to the office, that's terrible.

181
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,185
What I need is a red zone. It's a
simple thing you can take care of.

182
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,313
You've done it before.
Come here a minute, please.

183
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,110
Are you okay?

184
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,278
Yeah, I'm fine.

185
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,365
Listen, if the kids going in
the water is worrying you

186
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,493
they can play out
here on the beach.

187
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,537
It's all right. Let them go.

188
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,339
It's cold.

189
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,301
We know all about you, Chief.

190
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,512
You don't go in the
water at all, do you?

191
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,056
That's some bad hat, Harry.

192
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,856
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

193
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,235
Come on. That's it.

194
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Oh, do you know the muffin man</i>

195
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,664
<i>The muffin man</i>

196
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,167
Tippet!

197
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,032
Did you see that?

198
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,708
Blood!

199
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,048
Everybody out!

200
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,802
Get them out!

201
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,478
Michael, get out of the water!

202
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,492
Alex?

203
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,264
We don't even know if
there's a shark around here.

204
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,016
I can't argue with
you. I can't talk to you.

205
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,477
I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner.

206
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,271
Because this is
turning into a contest.

207
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,149
It's not just the Gazette. She's
advertising in out-of-town papers.

208
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,362
I suggest we move back to council
chambers where we'll have more room.

209
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm responsible for
public safety here.

210
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,534
Then go out tomorrow and
see that no one gets hurt.

211
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,370
It's a small story. I'll
bury it as deep as I can.

212
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,206
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

213
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,209
Right in here, please.

214
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,504
Move on in, please.

215
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,645
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?

216
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,858
I have a point of view and I think it
speaks for many of the people here.

217
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,489
Not only me, because I have the
motel. How do you feel about it?

218
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,366
Let's have some order.

219
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,370
Let's have order, please.

220
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,081
Any special questions?

221
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,669
Is that $3,000 bounty on
the shark in cash or check?

222
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,464
I don't think that's funny.

223
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,758
I don't think
that's funny at all.

224
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,259
All right.

225
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,680
That's private business between
you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

226
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,226
Martin, would you please...

227
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,354
Chief Brody.

228
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,525
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

229
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,361
What
about the beaches, Chief?

230
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:59,531
We're going to put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

231
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,951
And then we're going to try and
use shark spotters on the beach.

232
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,412
Are you going to
close the beaches?

233
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,292
Yes, we are.

234
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,047
We also plan to bring in experts

235
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,633
from the Oceanographic
Institute on the mainland.

236
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,594
Only 24 hours.

237
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,762
I didn't agree to that.

238
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,391
Only 24 hours.

239
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,769
Twenty-four
hours is like three weeks!

240
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,963
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.

241
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll catch this bird for you.

242
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,343
It ain't going to
be easy. Bad fish.

243
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,679
Not like going down to the pond

244
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,181
and chasing bluegills
or tommy cods.

245
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,144
This shark, swallow you whole.

246
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,691
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.

247
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,110
And we got to do it quick.

248
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,528
Got to bring back the tourists

249
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,698
that'll put all your
businesses on a paying basis.

250
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,784
But it's not going
to be pleasant.

251
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,037
I value my neck a lot
more than $3,000, Chief.

252
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:34,376
I'll find him for $3,000, but I'll
catch him and kill him for $10,000.

253
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,004
You got to make up your minds.

254
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,548
Gonna stay alive and ante up,

255
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,218
gonna play it cheap and be
on welfare the whole winter.

256
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,055
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

257
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,058
There's too many
captains on this island.

258
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,895
$10,000 for me, by myself.

259
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,400
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

260
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,740
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

261
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,911
We'll take it under advisement.

262
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,458
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

263
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,545
ladies and gentlemen.

264
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,498
Oh, God, you scared me.

265
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,625
Oh. Oh.

266
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,047
You know, Ellen, people don't
even know how old sharks are.

267
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,300
I mean, if they live 2,000,
3,000 years... They don't know.

268
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,594
Enough.

269
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,573
You're not going to even
be able to go to sleep tonight.

270
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,807
Here. Come on.

271
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,309
Thanks.

272
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,063
Oh.

273
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,984
Oh.

274
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,320
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

275
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,655
Oh, yeah.

276
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,287
Mikey really loves his present.

277
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,123
Where is he?

278
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,332
Sitting in it.

279
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,837
Good God.

280
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,968
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

281
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,180
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.

282
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,724
I'm helping Michael.

283
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,434
Get out of that boat!

284
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,186
Hi, Dad. Just a
little longer. Please?

285
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,771
It's his birthday.

286
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:00,958
I don't want him on the ocean!

287
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,733
He's not on the
ocean, he is in a boat.

288
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,192
He won't go in the water.

289
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,697
I don't think he'll go in the water
again, after what happened yesterday.

290
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,409
All right, now don't say that.

291
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,746
I don't want that to
happen, you know that.

292
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,124
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

293
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,377
the rules, before he
goes out on his own.

294
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:26,840
Michael, did you hear your
father? Out of the water now!

295
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,216
Now!

296
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm tired. Let's
stop before someone reports us.

297
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:43,023
Don't worry. The Chief
lives on the other side of the island.

298
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,400
Am I coming in straight?

299
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,069
Don't worry about
it. Just keep rowing.

300
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,222
We better
catch something,

301
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,414
this is my wife's holiday roast.

302
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,268
Don't worry about it.

303
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,293
$3,000 buys an
awful lot of roast.

304
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,429
Come and get it.

305
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,976
The tide's taking it right out.

306
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,272
Can't we go home?

307
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,169
He's taking it.

308
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,921
Go!

309
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,329
Charlie, take my word
for it, don't look back!

310
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,039
Swim, Charlie!

311
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:10,170
Come on ! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!

312
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,422
Come on, Charlie, keep
coming. Keep swimming.

313
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,716
Come on, a little
more. Atta boy.

314
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,011
I can't get up.

315
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,721
Give me your hand, Charlie.

316
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,808
Help me!

317
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,976
Get
your feet out of the water!

318
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,075
Can we go home now?

319
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,838
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there trying to catch their breath

320
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,173
and figure out how
to tell Charlie's wife

321
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,217
what happened to
her freezer full of meat.

322
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,970
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

323
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,722
Mrs. Kintner must've put
her ad <i>in Field & Stream.</i>

324
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,100
Looks more like <i>The
National Enquirer.</i>

325
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,480
All right, hold it. Hold
everything. I said, hold it!

326
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,779
Hello.

327
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,282
Hello back, young
fellow. How are you?

328
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:24,452
Say, I hope you're not going
out with those nuts, are you?

329
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,584
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.

330
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:33,545
You have to move out
or he can't get out at all.

331
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,923
Don't raise sail, you're going
to luff it. You got a paddle?

332
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,758
I got a paddle.
Scull it out of here.

333
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,386
Officer, wait a second.

334
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,891
How many guys are you
going to put aboard that boat?

335
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,392
Whatever's safe, right?

336
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,727
Yeah, well that ain't safe.

337
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,812
Watch it, that's dynamite.

338
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,355
What are you doing with that?

339
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,542
Where are you going with that?

340
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,317
I'm going on the boat.

341
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,153
Please, help me get those
guys out of the boat, will you?

342
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,529
Sure. Come on.

343
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,241
Gentlemen, the officer
asked me to tell you

344
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,646
that you're
overloading that boat!

345
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,078
Go on, get out of here.

346
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,843
You ain't
going. What do you care?

347
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:12,751
Can you tell me if there's a good
restaurant or hotel on the island?

348
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,085
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

349
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,923
They're all going to die.

350
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,593
Listen to me. We've got
some road block signs outside.

351
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,845
You've got to get
somebody to help us.

352
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,806
Yeah, get those road block
signs out on the highway.

353
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,185
Because we've got more people
down here than we can handle.

354
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,438
What're you doing there? These
are your people. Go talk to them.

355
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.

356
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,400
You see all the license plates?

357
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,904
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New
Jersey. I'm all by myself out there.

358
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,489
What happened
to the extra help...

359
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,990
It's not until the
Fourth of July.

360
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,575
Till then, it's you and me.

361
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,953
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?

362
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,372
None of them are getting
out of the harbor alive.

363
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,957
That's what I'm saying.

364
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,125
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.

365
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,669
Everyone's having
a good time today.

366
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:56,878
Tell me about it.

367
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,171
Polly, I'll get back to you.

368
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,924
Could you tell me how I
could find Chief Brody?

369
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,050
Who are you?

370
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,095
Matt Hooper. I'm from the
Oceanographic Institute.

371
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,723
Oh, for Christ's sakes. You're
the guy we called. I'm Brody.

372
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,850
Oh. I'm glad to
meet you. Me, too.

373
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,727
I know you got a
lot on your hands.

374
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:13,937
What can we do for you?

375
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,815
The best thing to do
is to see the remains

376
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,502
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

377
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,151
Okay, fine. Just bear
with me, will you?

378
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,361
Sure.

379
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,865
Wait till we get them silly
bastards down in that rock pile.

380
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,325
There'll be some fun.

381
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,744
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers

382
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,579
when they start
digging the bottoms out

383
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,832
and slamming into
them rocks, boy.

384
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,002
Get away
from there, you goddamn fool!

385
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,253
What's the matter with you?

386
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,089
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

387
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,925
What are
these guys doing out here?

388
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,302
What are they doing back there?

389
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,846
They're chumming right now.

390
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,055
What the hell is that?

391
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,640
They're tracking the shark.

392
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,685
$3,000
divided four ways is what?

393
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,355
Watch
your starboard. Jesus!

394
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,196
Let's show Mr. Hooper
our accident.

395
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,453
"Victim identified as Christine
Watkins, female Caucasian."

396
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:12,889
And here's the way we have it.

397
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,498
"Probable boating accident."

398
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,048
The height and
weight of the victim

399
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,176
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

400
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,641
The torso has been
severed in mid-thorax.

401
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,226
There are no major
organs remaining.

402
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,895
May I have a glass of water?

403
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,188
The right arm has been severed

404
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,691
above the elbow with
massive tissue loss

405
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,818
in the upper musculature.

406
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,071
Thank you very much.

407
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,826
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

408
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,953
Did you notify the
Coast Guard about this?

409
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,831
No. It was only
local jurisdiction.

410
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,630
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum

411
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,192
and portions of the
rib cage are intact.

412
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,842
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

413
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,262
This is what happens.

414
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,517
Indicates the non-frenzy
feeding of a large squalus

415
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,521
possibly longimanus
<i>or Isurus glaucus.</i>

416
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,275
The enormous amount of tissue
loss prevents any detailed analysis

417
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,862
however, the attacking squalus
must be considerably larger

418
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,448
than any normal squalus
found in these waters.

419
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,826
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

420
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,952
No.

421
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,703
Well, this is not
a boat accident.

422
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,582
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

423
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,960
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

424
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,381
It was a shark.

425
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,526
I wanna go AP and UPI. I want
to get on the state wire services.

426
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,653
See if Boston will pick
it up and go national.

427
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,029
Call Dave Axelrod in New York

428
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,865
and tell him he owes me a favor.

429
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,826
This is the shot I want with
everybody and the fish in it.

430
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,162
Guys, could we
please get organized?

431
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,497
I want to get a
picture for the paper.

432
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,707
Now, can we just have the...

433
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,333
Ben Gardner get this?

434
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,085
No, we caught it.

435
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,173
That's swell.

436
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,591
It's a beauty.

437
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,052
Guys, please, I
need a picture for the paper.

438
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,554
Clear out of the way, please.

439
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,557
Just the guys that caught
the fish. Open it up a little bit.

440
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,059
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

441
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,854
Come on. I need a
picture for the paper.

442
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,147
Could we get the sign, please?

443
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,528
Kneel down, just
like in high school.

444
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,572
One row kneeling,
one row standing.

445
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,407
Come on, just
get out of the way.

446
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,784
Young fellow, could you
step out of the picture?

447
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,620
Take your rake with you.

448
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,789
We're ready. Thank you.

449
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,060
Can you get that,
please.

450
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,293
How's that?

451
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,718
Larry, you won't believe it.

452
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,220
What kind of a shark is that?

453
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,471
I don't know.

454
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,139
I think it's a mako.

455
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,474
It's got a deep throat, Frank.

456
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,601
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

457
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,810
Tiger shark.

458
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,855
A what?

459
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,440
We can start breathing again.

460
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,793
Is Ben getting
plenty of pictures?

461
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,026
Oh, you bet he is.

462
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,736
What is this bite radius crap?

463
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,196
That is a big mouth.

464
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,300
You stuff your frigging
head in there, man,

465
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,326
and find out if
it's a man-eater.

466
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,832
All I'm saying is that it
may not be the shark.

467
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,084
It's just a slight...

468
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,629
I want you to meet Matt. This
is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.

469
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,589
Matt's from the
Oceanographic Institute.

470
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:52,674
Nice to meet you.

471
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,342
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

472
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,721
There are all kinds of
sharks in the waters.

473
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,015
Hammerheads, white
tips, blues, makos.

474
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,102
And the chances that these
bozos got the exact shark...

475
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,104
There are no other
sharks like this here.

476
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,106
It's 100-to-1.

477
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,819
I'm not saying that this is not
the shark. It probably is, Martin.

478
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,738
It's a man-eater. It's
extremely rare for these waters.

479
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,366
But the fact is, the bite
radius on this animal

480
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,910
is different than the
wounds on the victim.

481
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,081
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

482
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,708
We all want to be sure, okay?

483
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,418
What I want to
do is very simple.

484
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,296
The digestive system of
this animal is very slow.

485
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,505
Let's cut it open.

486
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,507
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

487
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,050
is bound to still be in there.

488
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,094
And then we'll be sure.

489
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,144
It may be the only
way to confirm it.

490
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,563
Look, fellows,
let's be reasonable.

491
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,274
This is not the
time or the place

492
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,944
to perform some kind of a
half-assed autopsy on a fish.

493
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,532
And I am not going to stand
here and see that thing cut open

494
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,494
and see that little Kintner
boy spill out all over the dock.

495
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Chief Brody?

496
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,844
Yes?

497
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,645
I just found out

498
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,941
that a girl got killed
here last week.

499
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:36,986
And you knew it.

500
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,656
You knew there
was a shark out there.

501
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,619
You knew it was dangerous.

502
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,622
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

503
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,295
You knew all those things,

504
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,051
but still my boy is dead now.

505
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,308
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

506
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,565
My boy is dead.

507
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,323
I wanted you to know that.

508
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,214
I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.

509
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,426
No, she's not.

510
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,849
All right, fellows

511
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,892
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

512
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,894
before it stinks up
the whole island.

513
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,731
Harve, you and Carl take it out
tomorrow and dump it in the drink.

514
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,096
Come here.

515
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,935
Give us a kiss.

516
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,144
Why?

517
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,482
Because I need it.

518
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,446
Get out of here.

519
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,698
Can I help you?

520
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,427
The door was
open. Mind if I come in?

521
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,993
I'm Matt Hooper.

522
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,537
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

523
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,121
Your husband's home? Yes.

524
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,831
I'd really like to talk to him.

525
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,500
Yes, so would I.

526
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,711
Come in. Can I get
you some coffee?

527
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,004
No. Nothing, thank you.

528
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,756
Oh, wine. How nice.

529
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,360
How was your day?

530
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,450
Swell.

531
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:17,498
I got red and white. I didn't
know what you'd be serving.

532
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,041
Oh, that's nice.

533
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,295
Is anyone eating this?

534
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,588
No.

535
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,515
My husband tells
me you're in sharks.

536
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,146
Excuse me. Yes. I've never
heard it quite put that way.

537
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,731
But yes, I am.

538
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,482
I love sharks.

539
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,609
You love sharks?

540
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,027
Yeah, I love them.

541
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,362
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

542
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,197
and I went fishing
off of Cape Cod.

543
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,450
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

544
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,369
I hooked a 4.5 foot
baby thresher shark

545
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,079
who proceeded to eat my boat.

546
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,209
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

547
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,730
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

548
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:07,089
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

549
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,634
When I was on the
beach, I turned around

550
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,677
and actually saw my
boat being taken apart.

551
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,347
Ever since then, I have
been studying sharks

552
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:18,184
and that's why I know that I'm
going to go to the Institute tomorrow

553
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,853
and tell them that you still
have a shark problem here.

554
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,897
Why do you have to
tell them that? Sorry.

555
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,607
I'm sorry, I thought that...

556
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,983
You told me the
shark was caught.

557
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,653
I heard it on the news. I
heard it on the Cape station.

558
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,322
They caught a
shark, not the shark.

559
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,408
Not the shark that
killed Chrissie Watkins.

560
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:37,286
And probably not the
shark that killed the little boy.

561
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,164
Which I wanted to prove
today by cutting the shark open...

562
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,334
You may want to let
that breathe... Nothing.

563
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:03,270
You know, you'll be
the only rational man

564
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,064
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

565
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,316
Where are you going?

566
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,361
I am going on the Aurora.

567
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,862
The Aurora? What is that?

568
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,865
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

569
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,992
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

570
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:20,955
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

571
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:25,668
Martin sits in his car when we
go on the ferry to the mainland.

572
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,962
I guess it's a childhood thing.

573
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,766
There's a clinical
name for it, isn't there?

574
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,257
Drowning.

575
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,968
Is it true that most
people get attacked

576
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,303
by sharks in three feet of water

577
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,013
about 10 feet from the beach?

578
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,181
Yeah.

579
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:43,310
And that before people
started to swim for recreation...

580
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,564
I mean, before sharks
knew what they were missing

581
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,942
that a lot of these
attacks weren't reported?

582
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,277
That's right.

583
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,157
Now this shark that swims alone

584
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,450
what's it called? Rogue.

585
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,951
Rogue, yeah.

586
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:02,496
This guy, he keeps
swimming around

587
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,373
in a place where
the feeding is good

588
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,333
until the food
supply is gone, right?

589
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,918
That's called territoriality.

590
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:11,255
It's just a theory that I
happen to agree with.

591
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,426
Then why don't we
have one more drink

592
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,012
and go down and
cut that shark open?

593
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,223
Martin? Can you do that?

594
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,063
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

595
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,198
We start in the alimentary canal

596
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,243
and open the digestive tract.

597
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,149
Just like I thought.

598
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:13,234
What?

599
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:17,571
Came up in the Gulf
Stream, from southern waters.

600
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,161
He didn't eat a car, did he?

601
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:25,371
No.

602
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,457
Tiger shark's like a
garbage can. It'll eat anything.

603
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,502
Somebody probably
threw that in the river.

604
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,176
That's it.

605
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,098
I've got to close the
beach, call the Mayor.

606
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:47,309
You got a bigger
problem than that, Martin.

607
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:49,937
You still got a hell
of a fish out there

608
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,814
with a mouth about this big.

609
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,487
How do we confirm
that by morning?

610
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:03,325
If he is a rogue, and there's
any truth to territoriality at all

611
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,202
we got a good
chance of spotting him

612
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,996
between Cape Scott
and South Beach.

613
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,205
Where are you going?

614
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,707
To find him. He's
a night feeder.

615
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,833
On the water?

616
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,418
We're not gonna
find him on the land.

617
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,938
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

618
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,004
Yes, you are.

619
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,380
No, I'm not. Yes, you are.

620
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,923
I can't do that. Yes, you can.

621
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,728
I'm telling you, the crime
rate in New York will kill you.

622
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,732
There's so many problems, you never
feel like you're accomplishing anything.

623
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,818
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

624
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,130
The kids can't leave the house.

625
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,280
You've got to walk
them to school.

626
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,366
But in Amity, one man
can make a difference.

627
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,077
In 25 years, there's never been

628
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,829
a shooting or a
murder in this town.

629
00:45:49,706 --> 00:45:52,207
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

630
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,168
Where are we?

631
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,254
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

632
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,592
Can you get <i>The Late
Show</i> on this thing?

633
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,260
No, it's a closed
circuit TV system.

634
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,888
I have underwater
cameras fore-and-aft.

635
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,223
Who pays for all this stuff?

636
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,725
The government? The Institute?

637
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,852
This stuff costs a lot of money.

638
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,773
I paid for this mostly
myself, actually.

639
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,650
You're kidding. No.

640
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,985
You rich? Yeah.

641
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,154
How much?

642
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,739
Personally, or the whole family?

643
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,328
Doesn't make any sense. They
pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

644
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:33,207
Well, it doesn't
make sense for a guy

645
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,171
who hates the water to
live on an island either.

646
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:38,712
It's only an island if you
look at it from the water.

647
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,756
That makes a lot of sense.

648
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,472
What is that thing doing?

649
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,892
Well, it's a fish finder.

650
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,061
It's probably just a school
of mackerel or something,

651
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,146
all clumped together.

652
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,192
Wait a minute.

653
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,407
There's something
else out there.

654
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,825
What is it?

655
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,869
About 100 yards,
south-southwest.

656
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:47,311
That's
Ben Gardner's boat.

657
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,615
You know him?

658
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,286
It's all banged up. Sure I
know him. He's a fisherman.

659
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,414
What happened?

660
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,756
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

661
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,924
Wait. Why
don't we just tow it all in?

662
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,635
We will. I just got to
check something out.

663
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,554
Hit the lights for me.

664
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,205
Let's tow it in.

665
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:39,458
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.

666
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:46,381
What am I supposed
to do while you're gone?

667
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:49,009
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

668
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,636
Don't touch any
of the equipment.

669
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,182
I'll be back in two minutes.

670
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,730
This is a great white,
Larry. A big one.

671
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,691
Any shark expert will tell
you it's a killer, a man-eater.

672
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,527
The situation is that
apparently a great white shark

673
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,905
has staked a claim in
the waters off Amity Island.

674
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,200
He'll continue to feed here as
long as there's food in the water.

675
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,868
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

676
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,328
We've had three incidents.

677
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,830
Two people killed within
a week. It'll happen again.

678
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:43,999
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

679
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,043
Five people were
killed... In one week.

680
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,377
Tell him about the swimmers.

681
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:50,714
A shark is attracted to the exact
kind of splashing and activity

682
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,634
that occurs whenever human
beings swim. You can't avoid it.

683
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:57,387
Opening the beaches on the Fourth
of July is like ringing the dinner bell.

684
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,847
Look, Mr. Vaughn

685
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:01,642
I pulled a tooth the
size of a shot glass

686
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,329
out of the wrecked
hull of a boat out there.

687
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,853
It was the tooth
of a great white.

688
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,605
It was Gardner's
boat, all chewed up.

689
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,982
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

690
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,818
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

691
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,881
I didn't see it. He
dropped it on the way in.

692
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,948
I had an accident.

693
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,284
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

694
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,538
<i>It's a Carcharodon
carcharias.</i> It's a great white.

695
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,707
You don't have the tooth?

696
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,795
Look, we depend on the
summer people for our very lives...

697
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,965
You won't have a summer
unless you deal with this problem!

698
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,218
We have to close the beach
and hire someone to kill the shark!

699
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,095
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

700
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:41,139
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

701
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,517
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

702
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,310
I don't think either one of you

703
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:47,104
are familiar with our problems!

704
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,398
I think that I am
familiar with the fact

705
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,650
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

706
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,069
until it swims up and
bites you in the ass!

707
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,155
Wait a second ! There are two
ways to deal with this problem!

708
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,367
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

709
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,327
We have
to close the beaches.

710
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:03,537
Brody?

711
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,164
Sick vandalism.

712
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:10,335
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

713
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,547
I want those little
paint-happy bastards caught

714
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,340
and hung up by
their Buster Browns.

715
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:18,468
That's it. I won't waste
my time arguing with a man

716
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,822
who's lining up
to be a hot lunch.

717
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,138
I'm gonna see you later, Brody.

718
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,307
Don't do this. He's not...

719
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:34,776
What we are dealing with here is a
perfect engine, an eating machine.

720
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,070
It's really a
miracle of evolution.

721
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:40,991
All this machine
does is swim and eat

722
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,744
and make little
sharks. And that's all.

723
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,747
Why don't you take a
long, close look at this sign?

724
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,999
Those proportions are correct.

725
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,394
You'd love to prove
that, wouldn't you?

726
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,378
Get your name into
<i>the National Geographic.</i>

727
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,641
Larry, if we
make an effort today,

728
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,560
we might be able to save August.

729
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,645
August? For Christ's sake,

730
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,189
tomorrow's the Fourth of July!

731
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,191
We will be open for business.

732
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,193
It'll be one of the best
summers we've ever had.

733
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,236
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

734
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,530
do whatever you have
to, to make them safe.

735
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:23,825
But those beaches will
be open for this weekend.

736
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:48,809
I want to know how many
men you're going to send.

737
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,103
There is no need for
me to come to Brisbane

738
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,730
when I have a great
white shark right here!

739
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:56,066
We need men to
<i>patrol the swimming area.</i>

740
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,236
<i>We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.</i>

741
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:13,959
Monday!

742
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,421
Is Chief Federal
Officer Feldman there?

743
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,589
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.

744
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,234
Operator, isn't there
a phone on the island?

745
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,527
Could you connect me, please?

746
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,203
Come on, get him!

747
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,832
Careful on the beach.

748
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,211
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

749
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:02,215
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

750
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,676
All right. I'll get
to them later.

751
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,348
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.

752
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,065
Brody to Daisy, do you read me?

753
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,794
<i>Fascinating
Rhythm, do you read me?</i>

754
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,486
<i>Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?</i>

755
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,363
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

756
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,576
Amity Island has long been
known for its clean air, clear water

757
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,870
and beautiful
white-sand beaches.

758
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,497
But in recent days

759
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,248
a cloud has appeared
on the horizon

760
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,250
of this beautiful
resort community.

761
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:39,753
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.

762
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:50,621
<i>That is very shocking in the outfield.</i>

763
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,518
<i>Two balls, one strike,
runners at first and third...</i>

764
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,438
<i>Fly ball, deep left field.</i>

765
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:02,108
<i>Jerry Christian goes back,
running back near the wall</i>

766
00:56:02,235 --> 00:56:04,110
<i>and he takes it for the out.</i>

767
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,159
Oh, hi, Larry.

768
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:12,744
Why aren't you in the water?

769
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,831
I just put some
suntan lotion on,

770
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,792
and I'm trying to absorb some...

771
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,627
Nobody's going in.

772
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,797
Please, get in the water.

773
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,104
Mike, come here.

774
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,943
Listen, Mike. Do
me a favor, will you?

775
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:28,297
You and the other
guys take the boat

776
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:30,864
and put it in the pond instead?

777
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,199
The pond is for old ladies.

778
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,469
I know it's for the old ladies,

779
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,786
but just do it for the old man.

780
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:37,871
Please?

781
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:38,955
All right.

782
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,041
Thanks.

783
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,221
I've got Sean.

784
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,811
Michael ! Wait!

785
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,733
Michael, I don't
like you no more.

786
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,536
I can stand Harry, you know...

787
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,345
Daisy, this is
Hendricks. Anything?

788
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,763
Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

789
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:40,517
Hendricks, <i>this
is Daisy here. I don't see anything.</i>

790
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,270
False alarm. Must be this glare.

791
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:59,202
I'm pleased and happy to repeat
the news that we have in fact

792
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,788
caught and killed
a large predator

793
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,790
that supposedly
injured some bathers.

794
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,625
As you see, it's
a beautiful day.

795
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,045
The beaches are open, and
people are having a wonderful time.

796
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,715
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."

797
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,105
My God!

798
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:39,325
Jesus Christ! Fin ! Shark! 350!

799
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,056
Get in there
<i>as fast as you can!</i>

800
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,289
Red one.

801
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,333
<i>Martin, get them the
hell out of the water.</i>

802
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,090
No whistles!

803
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,134
<i>Everybody, please,
get out of the water.</i>

804
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:57,738
<i>Everybody
out of the water.</i>

805
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:02,182
Don't push!
<i>Everybody out of the water, please.</i>

806
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,180
Come on!

807
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,554
<i>I
want them out of there, guys.</i>

808
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,497
<i>Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?</i>

809
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:14,212
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.

810
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:18,591
Please, move back. Give
these people some air.

811
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,927
Please, move back.

812
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:25,598
Martin, it's just a hoax. There
are two kids with a cardboard fin.

813
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,643
Is everyone there okay? Everyone
get out of the water all right?

814
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:30,330
Is everyone there okay? Everyone
get out of the water all right?

815
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:35,275
Folks, <i>we had some practical
joker down there with a fake fin...</i>

816
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,069
Shark! A shark!

817
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,031
It's going into the
pond ! Shark in estuary!

818
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:43,283
Now what?

819
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,452
Michael's in the pond.

820
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:51,416
It's going in the pond !
Somebody do something ! It's in the pond!

821
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:04,846
Hurry up, get that done.

822
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,139
I can't do a damn thing.

823
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:09,058
Get that rope undone. You
gotta untangle that up there.

824
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,435
I'm doing it!

825
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,648
Hey, fellows, haul in
your sheet. Make it fast.

826
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,238
You guys okay over there?

827
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,823
In the pond!

828
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,992
Somebody
get a gun and shoot it!

829
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,535
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

830
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,476
Is he dead?

831
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,561
No, he's not. He's in shock.

832
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,845
Doctor said he's
okay. Mild shock.

833
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,073
He can go home in the morning.

834
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,431
Thank you.

835
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,100
How's my big kid?

836
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,184
I'm all right.

837
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:18,021
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

838
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:19,416
Want me to bring
anything from home?

839
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,690
My cars.

840
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,774
What about ice cream?

841
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:22,859
Coffee.

842
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,956
Want to take him home?

843
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,793
Back to New York?

844
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,087
No. Home, here.

845
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,858
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

846
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:06,778
You got a pen, Larry?

847
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,197
Yeah, a pen, you know.

848
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,827
'Cause you're going
to do what you do best.

849
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:17,955
You're going to sign this
voucher so I can hire a contractor.

850
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,916
I don't know if I
can do that without...

851
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,960
I'm going to hire
Quint to kill the shark.

852
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,754
August? What?

853
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,465
What are you talking about?

854
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,967
Summer's over. You're
the mayor of Shark City.

855
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:31,886
People think you
want the beaches open.

856
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:35,598
I was acting in the
town's best interest.

857
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,892
You were acting in
the town's best interest.

858
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,894
That's why you'll
do the right thing.

859
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,289
That's why you're
going to sign this,

860
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,357
and we'll pay that
guy what he wants.

861
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,905
My kids were on that beach, too.

862
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,334
Sign it, Larry.

863
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,387
$10, 000.

864
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:16,764
<i>$200 a day, whether
I catch him or not.</i>

865
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:17,890
You've got it.

866
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,394
Get the Mayor off my back so I
don't have more of this zoning crap.

867
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,895
You've got that.

868
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,732
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

869
01:06:26,859 --> 01:06:30,069
Two cases. And you get
dinner when you get back.

870
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:32,405
Champagne,
<i>pâte de foie gras,</i>

871
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,074
Iranian caviar, and
don't forget the color TV.

872
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,707
Chief, you try this. Made
it myself. Pretty good stuff.

873
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,250
Thanks.

874
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:47,712
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.

875
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:56,596
Excuse me, Chief.

876
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:13,946
Can't get a good man
these days, under 60.

877
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,449
All gone at least 35 years.

878
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,950
Don't drink that.

879
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:19,285
Mr. Quint...

880
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,333
You're gonna need an extra hand.

881
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,126
This is Matt Hooper. I know him.

882
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,271
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.

883
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,295
Transplants?

884
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,857
He's from the
Oceanographic Institute.

885
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,757
And an America's Cup trial.

886
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,383
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking

887
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:37,178
about pleasure
boating or day-sailing.

888
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,724
I'm talking about working for a
living. I'm talking about sharking.

889
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,102
I'm not talking about hooking
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

890
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:47,271
I'm talking about
finding a great white.

891
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,649
Porkers? Talking about porkers?

892
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,822
Just tie me a sheepshank.

893
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,662
I haven't had to pass basic
seamanship in a long time.

894
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:06,499
You didn't say how
short you wanted it.

895
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:10,086
How's that?

896
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:15,007
Give me your hands.

897
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,135
Dogfish?

898
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:21,597
You got a $5,000 net and
you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

899
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:24,725
Along comes Mr. Whitey, and
when he's finished with that net

900
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,394
it looks like a
kiddies' scissors class

901
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,771
has cut it up for a paper doll.

902
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,441
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.

903
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,443
You been counting
money all your life.

904
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:38,030
I don't need this. I don't need
this working-class-hero crap.

905
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:41,909
You're not going to do this
aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?

906
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,538
Maybe I should go alone.

907
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:50,543
It's my party. It's my charter.

908
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,046
Yeah, it's your charter, it's
your party. It's my vessel.

909
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:58,050
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot

910
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,386
and I'm captain.

911
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:05,891
I'll take him for
ballast, Chief.

912
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:09,812
You got him.

913
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,607
"Straight-jet, killing lance.

914
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:18,654
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1
, handy billy, pliers, irons.. ."

915
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:22,616
Sample bottles,
dye marker, flares, safety float

916
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:25,453
temperature gauge,
spear guns, SMG...

917
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:28,748
What are you? Some kind
of half-assed astronaut?

918
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,760
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure, all right?

919
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,516
Jesus H. Christ!

920
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:50,269
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted

921
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,022
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.

922
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,193
What have you got here? A
portable shower or a monkey cage?

923
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,694
An anti-shark cage.

924
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,321
Anti-shark cage?

925
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,282
You go inside the cage?

926
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:10,122
Cage goes in the water? You go
in the water? Shark's in the water.

927
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,625
Our shark.

928
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:19,173
Farewell and
adieu <i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

929
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,844
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

930
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:29,809
<i>For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston</i>

931
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:35,398
<i>And so nevermore
shall we see you again</i>

932
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,424
Did you take your Dramamine?

933
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:44,490
Yes.

934
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:48,744
I put an extra pair of
glasses in your black socks

935
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,538
and there's the
stuff for your nose,

936
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:53,249
the zinc oxide and
Blistex is in the kit.

937
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,000
Son of a bitch!

938
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:58,379
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.

939
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:00,339
Young girls just
ain't quite smart

940
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:01,882
like their grandmothers were.

941
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,843
That's got to be Quint.

942
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,469
Colorful, isn't he?

943
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:06,846
He scares me.

944
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,392
Don't use the
fireplace in the den...

945
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,686
What am I going
to tell the kids?

946
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,858
Tell them I'm going fishing.

947
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,199
Break it up, will
you, Chief? Daylight's wasting!

948
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,704
Front, bow. Back, stern.

949
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,540
Better get it right,
squirt, or I throw your ass

950
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,542
out the little round
window on the side!

951
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,753
Come on, Chief. This
isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

952
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,548
See you got your
rubbers.

953
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:49,221
"Here lies the body of Mary
Lee Died at the age of 103

954
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:52,308
"For 15 years she
kept her virginity

955
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,560
"Not a bad record
for this vicinity"

956
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,481
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!

957
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,818
If you see a shark,
Hooper, swallow!

958
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,743
Up periscope. Rig for depth
charge. Stand by fire drill.

959
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,412
Damage control report.

960
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,582
Nor'easter coming, bad
news for Madison Avenue.

961
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,043
I'm tired of that.

962
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,836
How's the missus, Chief?

963
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:25,466
If they don't like you going
out, they'll love you coming in.

964
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:52,606
Keep that chum
line going, Chief.

965
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:55,454
We got five good miles on it.

966
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,040
Who's driving this boat?

967
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,625
Nobody. The tide.

968
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,546
One time, I caught a
16-footer off Montauk.

969
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,047
Had to stick two barrels in him.

970
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,967
Two to wear him
down and bring him up.

971
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:10,803
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

972
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:14,723
Radar, sonar,
electric toothbrushes.

973
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,144
Jesus H. Christ.

974
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,898
Chief, best drop
another chum marker.

975
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:47,464
Damn it, Martin!

976
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,883
This is compressed air.

977
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:51,510
What the hell kind
of a knot was that?

978
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,262
You pulled the wrong one!

979
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,657
You screw around
with these tanks,

980
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:56,765
and they're going to blow up.

981
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,892
Yeah, that's real
fine, expensive gear

982
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:01,478
you've brought out
here, Mr. Hooper.

983
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:04,440
I don't know what that bastard
shark's going to do with it.

984
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:05,983
Might eat it, I suppose.

985
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,611
Seen one eat a
rocking chair one time.

986
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:16,076
Next time, you just ask
me which line to pull, right?

987
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:24,335
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave

988
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,129
swims into the hole

989
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,800
comes out of the hole, goes
back into the cave again.

990
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,637
It's not too good, is it?

991
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:38,223
Nothing's easy, is
it? One more time.

992
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:40,184
Little brown eel...

993
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,514
I got it!

994
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,226
What? Get behind me.

995
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,398
Hooper, reverse her!

996
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,234
Taking a hell of a lot of line!

997
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,779
Chief, get the scoop out
of the bucket! Wet the reel!

998
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,660
Hooper, reverse her!

999
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:28,751
Duck your head down. We're
swinging. Get behind me again.

1000
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:32,004
No more water. I don't
want you to drown me.

1001
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,049
Hooper, you idiot, starboard
! Ain't you watching it!

1002
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,513
Hooper, neutral.

1003
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:50,689
Where'd he go now?

1004
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:53,275
He ain't fooling me.

1005
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,403
What's he yanking on now?

1006
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,864
Go on, try it.

1007
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:14,546
I don't know, Chief, if he's
very smart or very dumb.

1008
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,721
Jesus...

1009
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,893
He's gone under.

1010
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,897
He's gone under the boat. I
think he's gone under the boat.

1011
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,233
Yeah, it's too easy.

1012
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:37,611
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

1013
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:41,365
Keep her steady, now. I
got something very big!

1014
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,991
I don't think so.

1015
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,119
Chief, put your gloves on.

1016
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,289
You put your gloves
on, both of you!

1017
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,002
Getting ready to run out again.

1018
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,380
Quint, let it go.

1019
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,174
Maybe you're a
big yahoo in the lab,

1020
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:00,611
but out here you're
just supercargo!

1021
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:03,387
If you don't want to backstroke
home, you get down here!

1022
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:06,390
You don't want to listen
to me, don't listen to me.

1023
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:07,683
It's not a shark.

1024
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,810
The wire's showing.

1025
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,353
Unbuckle me.

1026
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:13,856
Get the other side.

1027
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,482
It's a tuna or swordfish

1028
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,901
wasting our time.

1029
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,112
Take this rod.

1030
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,864
Hooper, give the
Chief a hand, will you?

1031
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:22,990
Right!

1032
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,116
Oh, shit!

1033
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:37,004
It may be a marlin or a stingray

1034
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,840
but it's definitely a game fish.

1035
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:52,978
Gaming fish?

1036
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:57,065
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

1037
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,859
Don't you tell me
my business again.

1038
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,212
You get back on the bridge.

1039
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,779
Quint, that doesn't
prove a damn thing.

1040
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,990
It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.

1041
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,243
You wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough

1042
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:10,078
to admit if you're wrong.

1043
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:22,215
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?

1044
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,137
You lose one, you rig one.

1045
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:34,311
Twelve minutes,
south-southeast, now! Full throttle!

1046
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,896
Aye-aye, sir!

1047
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:41,318
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick them to the surface.

1048
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,445
And then I jab at them.

1049
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:47,199
I'm not going to haul
them up like a lot of catfish.

1050
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:49,117
Hooper, full throttle!

1051
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,870
I don't have to take
this abuse much longer.

1052
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:54,998
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.

1053
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,405
Start that chum
line again, will you?

1054
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,701
Let Hooper take a turn.

1055
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,703
Hooper drives the boat, Chief.

1056
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:50,512
Stop playing with
yourself, Hooper.

1057
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,264
Slow ahead, if you please.

1058
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:55,183
You heard him. Slow ahead.

1059
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,193
Slow ahead.

1060
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:09,531
I can go slow ahead. Come on
down and chum some of this shit.

1061
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:29,593
You're going to
need a bigger boat.

1062
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,318
Shut off that engine.

1063
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,472
That's a 20-footer.

1064
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,765
Twenty-five.

1065
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,434
Three tons of him.

1066
01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:27,109
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?

1067
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,610
Gotta get to work.

1068
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,446
How do we handle this?

1069
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,698
Come up front,
Martin. I need you.

1070
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,661
He's circling the boat.

1071
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,803
<i>This is
Amity Point Light Station to Orca.</i>

1072
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,054
<i>Come in, Orca.</i>

1073
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,056
Orca. Come in.

1074
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:00,058
<i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>

1075
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:01,351
Put her on.

1076
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,937
Come on, Martin ! Move!

1077
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,397
I'm not going out there!

1078
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,971
Beyond the edge of the barrels.

1079
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:10,068
Go to the end of the
barrels, further out.

1080
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,736
Further out! Why?

1081
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,572
Go further out! What for?

1082
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:15,407
Will you go to the
end of the pulpit?

1083
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,491
What?

1084
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:17,719
Will you go to the
end of the pulpit?

1085
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,662
I need something in the
foreground to give it some scale!

1086
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,997
Foreground my ass!

1087
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,999
Your husband's
okay. He's fishing.

1088
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,250
He just caught some stripers.

1089
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:29,087
We'll bring them for dinner. We
ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

1090
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,589
I'm not staying here!

1091
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:31,673
I'm begging you!

1092
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:35,051
God damn it! Come here, darling.

1093
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,684
Chief, I want you
up on the bridge,

1094
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,019
just take her forward, steady.

1095
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:45,562
I've never steered
a boat in my life.

1096
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,398
Just watch my
hand, take her steady.

1097
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,360
Mr. Hooper, attach the end
of this line to the first keg.

1098
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,447
I've got to get a good
shot at that porker's head.

1099
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,256
He's coming.

1100
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,092
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.

1101
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,224
Hurry up, will you?

1102
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:23,475
Your turn, Quint.

1103
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:25,685
Hooper, where are you?

1104
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,650
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

1105
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,403
He's coming straight for
us. Don't screw it up now.

1106
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:36,988
Don't wait for me.

1107
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:42,494
Come on, Hooper,
hurry it up! Tie it on!

1108
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:44,663
Now.

1109
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,709
Kill it!

1110
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:51,962
Now!

1111
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:54,965
Shoot!

1112
01:24:58,219 --> 01:24:59,386
Time.

1113
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:02,491
What were you
doing? You knew I had

1114
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,933
to get a clean shot
right in the head.

1115
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,645
All right, let's see how long
that barrel takes to bring him up.

1116
01:25:10,356 --> 01:25:13,525
Bring another barrel !
I'm coming around again!

1117
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:09,372
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?

1118
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:13,460
We got one barrel on him. We
stay out here until we find him again.

1119
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:16,212
We could radio in
and get a bigger boat...

1120
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,365
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

1121
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:47,619
It won't be permanent. You
want to see something permanent?

1122
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,796
You want to feel
something permanent?

1123
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,967
Just put your hand underneath
my cap. You feel that little lump?

1124
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:06,221
Knocko Nolans, St.
Patty's Day, Boston.

1125
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,227
I got that beat.

1126
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,655
It's a moray eel. It bit
right through my wet suit.

1127
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,741
Well, Hoop, now, listen

1128
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:30,078
I don't know about that, but I
entered an arm-wrestling contest

1129
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,914
in a bar in San
Francisco. See this?

1130
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,541
I can't extend that.
You know why?

1131
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,876
'Cause in the semi-final

1132
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:39,879
celebrating my
third wife's demise,

1133
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,923
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.

1134
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:56,354
Look at that.

1135
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,566
That's a bull shark.

1136
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,527
He scraped me when
I was taking samples.

1137
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,363
I got something for you.

1138
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:09,534
There's a thresher. You
see that? A thresher's tail.

1139
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,744
Thresher? It's a shark.

1140
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,791
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?

1141
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:17,876
I'll drink to your leg.

1142
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,044
So we drink to our
legs.

1143
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:28,553
I got <i>the crème de la
crème.</i> Right here. Hold on.

1144
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,306
Here, you see that?

1145
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:33,433
You're wearing a sweater.

1146
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,561
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

1147
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,481
She broke my heart.

1148
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,159
What's that one?

1149
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,660
What?

1150
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:54,204
That one, there. On your arm.

1151
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:56,873
Oh.

1152
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,500
A tattoo. I got that removed.

1153
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,293
Don't tell me.

1154
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:02,462
"Mother."

1155
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:09,469
What is it?

1156
01:29:14,475 --> 01:29:17,644
Mr. Hooper, that's
<i>the U.S.S. Indianapolis.</i>

1157
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:27,153
You were <i>on the Indianapolis?</i>

1158
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:28,613
What happened?

1159
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:34,661
Japanese submarine slammed
two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

1160
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:39,874
I was coming back from
the island of Tinian to Leyte

1161
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:43,086
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

1162
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:49,008
1 , 100 men went into the water.

1163
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,927
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

1164
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,224
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

1165
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:58,393
Tiger, 13-footer.

1166
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:01,354
You know how you know that
when you're in the water, Chief?

1167
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,691
You tell by looking
from the dorsal to the tail.

1168
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:08,152
Well, we didn't know.

1169
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:11,656
Because our bomb
mission had been so secret

1170
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,826
no distress signal
had been sent.

1171
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,544
They didn't even list
us overdue for a week.

1172
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:29,507
Very first light,
sharks come cruising

1173
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:32,927
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

1174
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,639
You know, kind
of like old squares

1175
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:38,308
in a battle like you
see on a calendar

1176
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:41,185
like the Battle of
Waterloo. The idea was...

1177
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,895
the shark comes
to the nearest man

1178
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:45,773
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

1179
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:48,484
Sometimes the
shark would go away...

1180
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:51,446
but sometimes he
wouldn't go away.

1181
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:55,783
Sometimes that shark, he looks
right into you, right into your eyes.

1182
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:59,871
You know, a thing
about a shark, he's got...

1183
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:04,334
lifeless eyes. Black
eyes, like a doll's eyes.

1184
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:09,464
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be living

1185
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:14,719
until he bites you. Those black
eyes roll over white and then...

1186
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,724
Then you hear that terrible
high-pitched screaming.

1187
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:22,060
The ocean turns red.

1188
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:26,314
In spite of the pounding and
the hollering, they all come in.

1189
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:29,734
They rip you to pieces.

1190
01:31:34,573 --> 01:31:37,575
You know, by the
end of that first dawn...

1191
01:31:38,744 --> 01:31:40,370
we lost 100 men.

1192
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,415
I don't know how many
sharks. Maybe 1 ,000.

1193
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,585
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

1194
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:51,172
On Thursday morning, I
bumped into a friend of mine...

1195
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:53,675
Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

1196
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:57,512
Baseball player, bosun's mate.

1197
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,643
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.

1198
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:09,107
He bobbed up and down in
the water just like a kind of top.

1199
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:11,067
Upended.

1200
01:32:15,114 --> 01:32:17,782
He'd been bitten in
half, below the waist.

1201
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,707
Noon the fifth day, a
Lockheed Ventura saw us.

1202
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:28,918
He swung in low and he
saw us. He was a young pilot.

1203
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,211
Younger than Mr. Hooper.

1204
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,131
He saw us and he came in
low, and three hours later...

1205
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:36,718
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

1206
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:39,637
That was the time I
was most frightened.

1207
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,140
Waiting for my turn.

1208
01:32:43,517 --> 01:32:46,269
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.

1209
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,440
So, 1 , 100 men
went into the water

1210
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:53,067
316 men come out.

1211
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:57,113
The sharks took the
rest, June 29, 1945.

1212
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:03,828
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

1213
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,176
What's that?

1214
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,510
It's a whale.

1215
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:26,476
Farewell and
adieu <i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1216
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:32,899
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

1217
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:41,240
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1218
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:46,829
<i>I'm tired and I
want to go to bed</i>

1219
01:33:48,207 --> 01:33:53,127
<i>I had a
little drink about an hour ago</i>

1220
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:57,340
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

1221
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:02,595
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1222
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:07,391
<i>By land, or sea or foam</i>

1223
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:12,939
<i>You will always hear
me singing this song</i>

1224
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:16,776
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1225
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:22,031
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1226
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:25,243
<i>I'm tired and I
want to go to bed</i>

1227
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:27,912
<i>I had a little drink
about an hour ago</i>

1228
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,331
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

1229
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,834
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

1230
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:35,586
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>

1231
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:39,006
<i>You can always
hear me singing...</i>

1232
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,594
Start the engines.

1233
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:56,148
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!

1234
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,609
He's busting the shaft.

1235
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:05,491
Put out the fire, will you?

1236
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:16,794
Pump her out. Done.

1237
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:26,721
Everybody on deck.

1238
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:27,930
He ate the light.

1239
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:29,599
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

1240
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:35,104
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

1241
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,564
Quint, come on.

1242
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,357
What's wrong with this?

1243
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:44,572
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

1244
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:03,633
You okay?

1245
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,120
Chief, more left rudder!

1246
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,706
Pull your left hand down.

1247
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:38,834
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.

1248
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:40,795
All of our
injectors got scored

1249
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,797
from the salt water in the fuel.

1250
01:36:43,674 --> 01:36:46,258
Yeah, the housing's
bent, you can hear it.

1251
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:51,597
Try the left rudder again. More
left. Good. Once again now.

1252
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:56,310
Quint, there it is.

1253
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,980
What do you say, Chief?

1254
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:01,774
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.

1255
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:09,198
I think he's right under the
keg. Grab the boat hook.

1256
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:23,004
Quint, if we can
get close enough...

1257
01:37:24,423 --> 01:37:26,173
I've got things on
board that'll kill it.

1258
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:29,135
Just want to goose
him up. Come on.

1259
01:37:40,981 --> 01:37:44,692
When he runs, you drop that
rope or you'll lose your hands.

1260
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:48,195
I've seen fingers torn
out at the knuckles.

1261
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,281
Whole sea's bones, full of them.

1262
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,283
Give it to me a minute.

1263
01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:10,259
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.

1264
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:12,428
Start the engine.

1265
01:38:14,765 --> 01:38:16,348
Where are you going?

1266
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:17,975
I'm going to make a phone call.

1267
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,901
Hello, mayday,
Orca. Coast Guard?

1268
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,738
Coast Guard, this is the
Orca. Do you read me?

1269
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:33,324
Coast Guard, this
is the Orca. Do you...

1270
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:40,956
Excuse me, Chief.

1271
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:44,752
That's great! That's just great!

1272
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,504
Now, where the hell are we, eh?

1273
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:51,675
You're certifiable, Quint, you
know that? You're certifiable!

1274
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,803
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!

1275
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:55,179
Boys,

1276
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:59,517
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

1277
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:02,812
Hook me up another barrel.

1278
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,261
Bring her around after him.

1279
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:54,572
Full throttle! Get me
right up alongside of him!

1280
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:57,950
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!

1281
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:17,261
Five degrees port.

1282
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:26,103
All right, hold your course.

1283
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:34,361
Five degrees port now.

1284
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:39,283
Hold your course.

1285
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,203
Fast fish.

1286
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:43,454
Watch my hand.

1287
01:40:44,664 --> 01:40:48,209
Be sure you watch
my hand ! Follow me.

1288
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:52,046
Lad, you watch
him now! Starboard!

1289
01:40:53,298 --> 01:40:55,132
Run him down, Hooper.

1290
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:03,641
Hard aport.

1291
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:09,146
Watch him. Starboard.

1292
01:41:33,964 --> 01:41:37,299
I can't believe it. Two barrels
and he's going down again.

1293
01:41:42,931 --> 01:41:44,348
It's incredible.

1294
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:52,314
They're up again ! Now what?

1295
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,951
Why don't we lead
the shark into shore

1296
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,828
instead of him
leading us out to sea?

1297
01:42:10,292 --> 01:42:12,001
Grab a couple of poles.

1298
01:42:14,296 --> 01:42:16,422
Hang on now, we're going around.

1299
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,717
Into starboard. Easy.

1300
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:22,720
I'm going to back her off now.

1301
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,596
Watch those barrels,
boys. Watch them.

1302
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,228
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

1303
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,861
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.

1304
01:42:42,115 --> 01:42:44,742
Brody, bring your
end around the cleat.

1305
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:49,330
That's right, it'll lock itself
off. Give him room, Brody.

1306
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,125
Stay clear of the line!

1307
01:43:00,884 --> 01:43:02,593
Watch it. Stand clear.

1308
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:15,230
Stand away from
those stern cleats!

1309
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:30,454
Back home we got
a taxidermy man.

1310
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,997
He's going to
have a heart attack

1311
01:43:32,082 --> 01:43:34,750
when he sees what I
brought him.

1312
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:43,467
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.

1313
01:43:46,179 --> 01:43:48,847
My God, this one,
too. They're both going.

1314
01:43:49,099 --> 01:43:51,016
He's eating his way
through that line.

1315
01:43:51,101 --> 01:43:52,976
He's working his
way right up to us.

1316
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:55,938
Quint! Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1317
01:43:58,483 --> 01:43:59,775
Out of my way.

1318
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:05,989
Watch it.

1319
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:12,663
Untie this. He'll
pull out the transom.

1320
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:18,460
Make it fast! We got
another line in him!

1321
01:44:18,545 --> 01:44:20,504
I can't, it's trying to run!

1322
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,590
We better
get another line!

1323
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:25,676
Pull, you son of a bitch!

1324
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:28,178
I hope your back breaks!

1325
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:30,139
Go ahead. Pull
your bloody heart out.

1326
01:44:30,807 --> 01:44:32,182
Tie him off!

1327
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:39,690
It's impossible!

1328
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,568
Boys, it's too tight!

1329
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,820
He's pulling us!

1330
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,657
We're breaking up over here!

1331
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:57,541
We're breaking up! Cut it!

1332
01:44:58,376 --> 01:44:59,835
Watch your hands!

1333
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,255
Cut it
quick. I can't hold it!

1334
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:26,778
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

1335
01:45:26,905 --> 01:45:29,072
Not with three
barrels, he can't.

1336
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,741
What about us?

1337
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:34,953
Hooper, get the pump out of
the locker in front of you, will you?

1338
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:37,164
We're going to sink, aren't we?

1339
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:40,209
Keep an eye on the
barrels. Pump it out, Chief.

1340
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,258
Starting to go under.

1341
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:51,887
He can't with three barrels
on him. Not with three he can't.

1342
01:46:26,756 --> 01:46:28,924
You ever have
one do this before?

1343
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:32,261
No.

1344
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:06,628
He's chasing
us. I don't believe it.

1345
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:14,261
I'm going to draw
him into the shallows.

1346
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:15,614
Draw him into the shallow water.

1347
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:18,432
I'm going to draw
him in and drown him.

1348
01:47:18,683 --> 01:47:19,891
We're heading in, Brody.

1349
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:21,143
Thank Christ!

1350
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:30,087
You ever had a
great white do that?

1351
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:31,445
No.

1352
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,620
How far do we have to go?

1353
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:44,791
Don't put that
much pressure on it.

1354
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,053
God damn it.

1355
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,846
Shut up. Get back there.

1356
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:04,728
Hold on.

1357
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:24,998
Farewell and
adieu <i>to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

1358
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:32,089
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

1359
01:48:33,675 --> 01:48:38,845
<i>For we received order
for to sail back to Boston</i>

1360
01:48:39,222 --> 01:48:41,598
You idiot, you
burned out the bearings.

1361
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:46,728
All right,
stop the boat. Stop it.

1362
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,915
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1363
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:37,839
I think I can pump 20 cc of
strychnine nitrate into him.

1364
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:40,425
If I can get close enough.

1365
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:45,388
Get this little needle
through his skin?

1366
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:48,767
No, I can't do that.

1367
01:50:50,728 --> 01:50:52,646
If I can get him
close to the cage,

1368
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:53,897
I can get him in the mouth.

1369
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:55,541
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.

1370
01:50:55,608 --> 01:50:58,026
You got any better suggestions?

1371
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:24,302
Easy.

1372
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,098
Up she goes.

1373
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:31,226
Ease her up.

1374
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:24,571
Ain't got no spit.

1375
01:52:39,921 --> 01:52:42,422
Try and keep him
off me until I'm lower.

1376
01:52:45,176 --> 01:52:46,635
Okay, I'm ready.

1377
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:47,023
Bring him up, God
damn it. Bring him up now!

1378
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:54,364
Pull it up. Pull it.

1379
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,876
Pull him up. Come
on, Quint, bring him in.

1380
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:11,548
It's giving way!

1381
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:25,520
Rig something!

1382
01:56:28,524 --> 01:56:29,691
Got it?

1383
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:35,071
It's coming.

1384
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:37,365
Slow it down.

1385
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:39,033
Slower.

1386
01:59:50,976 --> 01:59:53,686
All right, come on.

1387
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,313
Show me the tank.

1388
02:00:13,791 --> 02:00:15,124
Blow up!

1389
02:00:18,295 --> 02:00:20,088
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1390
02:01:49,261 --> 02:01:50,386
Quint?

1391
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:52,805
No.

1392
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:03,733
Can we get in on those?

1393
02:02:10,407 --> 02:02:11,824
What day is this?

1394
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:16,662
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.

1395
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:20,416
I think the tide's with us.

1396
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:22,585
Keep kicking.

1397
02:02:25,964 --> 02:02:28,090
I used to hate the water.

1398
02:02:30,302 --> 02:02:32,136
I can't imagine why.

1399
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:35,160
