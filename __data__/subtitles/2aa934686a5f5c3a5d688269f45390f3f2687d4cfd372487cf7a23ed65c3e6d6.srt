You know
the first thing I thought

20
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,682
when I saw you?

21
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:24,687
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

22
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,065
What if it's a her?

23
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,194
What would you call her?

24
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,321
Ragni, maybe.

25
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,906
Sorry?

26
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,532
Ragni.

27
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,827
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

28
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,163
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

29
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,874
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

30
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,126
You kidding me?

31
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,630
Texas is, like, a state,
you know? -I know.

32
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,673
There's about
three or four hours

33
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,008
till we reach the peak.

34
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,886
Ah, great.

35
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,852
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

36
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,396
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

37
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,857
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

38
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,443
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

39
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,029
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

40
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,073
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

41
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,033
to use your brother's band.

42
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,618
- Why not?
- Honey...

43
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,078
He's super, super good.

44
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,038
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,790
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

46
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,375
Yeah, I know this.

47
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,169
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,839
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,301
His singing is like shit.

50
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,515
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

51
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,226
Olaf!

52
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,019
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,604
Wait for me.

54
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,565
Why are you so sensitive?

55
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,073
Told you I could get us here.

56
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,872
It's beautiful.

57
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,833
Thank you. I love you.

58
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,513
Elsa.

59
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,559
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

60
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,936
- Look.

61
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,690
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

62
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,693
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

63
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,362
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

64
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,866
We have such good luck
in nature.

65
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,960
What do you see?

66
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,795
Hmm?

67
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,465
It's demented or something.

68
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,800
What?

69
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,013
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. -Yeah.

70
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,057
Demented?

71
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,600
I-I-I think we should leave it.

72
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,643
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

73
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,020
- Come on...
Ah!

74
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,482
Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.

75
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,984
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, kristoffer.

76
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,404
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

77
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,866
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

78
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,162
Oh, fuck.

79
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,664
Don't panic.

80
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,832
What do we do?

81
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,376
"If it's black, fight back.

82
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,378
If it's brown, lay down."

83
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,046
But is it black or is it brown?

84
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,381
I mean, it looks brown to me.

85
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,174
We're in appalachia.
It's black.

86
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,884
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

87
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,929
You're not a bear expert.

88
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,555
Whatever you do, don't...

89
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,641
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

90
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,562
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

91
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,021
Run!
- Where do we go?

92
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,399
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,526
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

94
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,736
- Run!

95
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,530
He's coming! Come on!

96
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,241
No! It's following...

97
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,665
Olaf! No!

98
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,917
God!

99
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,594
Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

100
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,556
Olaf!

101
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,123
This is drugs.

102
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,500
This is your brain on drugs.

103
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,172
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

104
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,424
The thrill can kill.

105
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:09,430
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

106
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,642
And pulling the trigger.

107
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,689
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

108
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,775
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

109
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,777
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

110
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,280
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

111
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,283
when his parachute
failed to open.

112
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,870
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

113
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,623
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

114
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,625
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

115
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,627
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

116
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,712
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

117
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,548
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

118
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,634
wrapped in
football-size packages

119
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,679
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

120
00:07:55,935 --> 00:08:00,105
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

121
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,149
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,817
Nothing.

123
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,945
Here's the I.D.

124
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,696
I know who that is.

125
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,242
Full name:
Andrew c. Thornton ii.

126
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,495
Man was out of his mind.

127
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,415
- What's the "c" stand for?
- Hmm?

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,670
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

129
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,675
Thornton was one of Syd
white's guys out of Missouri.

130
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,719
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,681
Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.

132
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,851
And there's more of this
out there.

133
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,896
They dumped it somewhere.

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,024
Hey, reba,
you have a dog, right?

135
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,859
Had.

136
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,571
Border collie. Barry.

137
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,990
Sorry for your loss.

138
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,992
Border collie, huh?

139
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,077
That's a cool dog.

140
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,412
Did he play fetch and stuff?

141
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,789
He loved fetch.

142
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,041
What?

143
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,002
Nothing. I just...

144
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,922
That's just awesome.

145
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,400
Damn it, Gabe.

146
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,153
Hi, daveed.

147
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,906
Uh, mind if I order first?

148
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,909
This won't take long.

149
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,168
Damn, I just bought these.

150
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,342
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

151
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,720
Did you hear about Thornton?

152
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,596
It's a tough way to go.

153
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,806
He only had 30 kilos on him.

154
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,768
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

155
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,269
Chattahoochee.

156
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,562
Georgia?

157
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,397
There's an area
called blood mountain.

158
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,274
When the plane's going down,

159
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,276
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

160
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,861
And then we just go and get it.

161
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,281
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

162
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,116
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

163
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,493
Eddie's in mourning.

164
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,328
Joanie just died.

165
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,621
And he quit.

166
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,539
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

167
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,291
She's not here anymore.

168
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,460
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

169
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,671
Syd, I-I just don't...

170
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,880
Stop.

171
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,758
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

172
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,136
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

173
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,556
Grandpa Syd, watch.

174
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,851
Yeah, that's great.

175
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,606
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

176
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,276
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

177
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,862
Chicken's in the microwave.

178
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,740
Just hit "start."

179
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,659
Thought you were off tonight.

180
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,411
We talked about this, remember?

181
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:02,954
Me picking up some extra shifts?

182
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,497
You said you were okay with it.

183
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,207
I was okay with it
until I realized

184
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,167
why you want
those extra shifts...

185
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,506
So you could go and do overtime
with ray the pediatrician.

186
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,510
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

187
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,346
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

188
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,931
this weekend
to see his band play.

189
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,767
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

190
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,644
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

191
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,187
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

192
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,106
It's Nashville.

193
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,818
He's a good guy, deirdra.

194
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,236
Just...

195
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,612
Give him a chance.

196
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,781
Please don't do that.

197
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,117
Do what?

198
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,870
You know what.

199
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,915
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

200
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,712
Close my door.

201
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,220
That's enough for today.

202
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,307
Wait, what?

203
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,310
Hey, Eddie.

204
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,689
They spelled her name wrong, daveed.

205
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,066
- It says "John."
- Oh.

206
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,402
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

207
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,571
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

208
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,740
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

209
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,742
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

210
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,911
I got seven more days of "John."

211
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,913
The chutist has been identified

212
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,706
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

213
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,042
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

214
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,879
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

215
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,466
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

216
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,094
I'm so sad, man.

217
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,806
I'm so fucking sad.

218
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,642
Okay?

219
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,317
Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?

220
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,111
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

221
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,114
It's just plain.

222
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,377
I knew you'd be late.

223
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,587
It finally came in.
Check it out.

224
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,464
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

225
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,508
Like a thousand, but worth it.

226
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,343
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

227
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,428
My mom is gonna be home soon.

228
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,599
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

229
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,560
Why by lunch?

230
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,229
The light, Henry.

231
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,356
But I got to go pee.

232
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,774
Go outside.

233
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,651
Why do I skip school with you?

234
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,195
You're bossier than
the teachers.

235
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,780
Now, the adoption people...

236
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,949
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there...

237
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,159
Told me I was supposed to be
getting me a lab.

238
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,955
A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.

239
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,665
I don't know
if there was an error,

240
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,501
because the one I got
is just kind of...

241
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,336
Bob?
- I don't know,

242
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,838
just kind of fancy.

243
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,549
Bob, captain says
it's time to go. -Got it.

244
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,052
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

245
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,929
Hey, reba.

246
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,182
You got plans for tonight?

247
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,810
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

248
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,606
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after rosette?

249
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,524
- Oh.
- I have to go to Georgia

250
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,775
for the Thornton case,

251
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,485
and you said
you were good at dogs.

252
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,237
I said I had a dog.

253
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,032
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

254
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,742
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

255
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,201
talking at a bar last night.

256
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,079
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,873
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

258
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,834
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

259
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,086
I only had her for a day.

260
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,630
Please?

261
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,216
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

262
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,053
Just go.

263
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,764
We'll be fine.

264
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,058
Thanks.

265
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,061
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

266
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,938
I can. I know the way.

267
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,773
School's gonna call, you know.

268
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,775
You know what? Let 'em.

269
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,235
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

270
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,779
So's your dad.

271
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,572
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

272
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,157
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

273
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,909
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

274
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,577
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

275
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,912
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

276
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,246
Admit it.

277
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,249
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

278
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,907
- Jesus! Fuck!

279
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,033
Coral, it's sari.

280
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,660
Is Dee Dee over there?

281
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,620
School just called.

282
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,955
No.

283
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,291
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

284
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,210
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

285
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,089
so can you please
just put him on?

286
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,134
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

287
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,470
What the hell is wrong with him?

288
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,306
Never mind.

289
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,832
♪ A love song of the waterfall ♪

290
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:45,756
♪ I hear through
virgin timbertop... ♪

291
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,935
50 cents.

292
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,693
I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside

293
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,528
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

294
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,906
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

295
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,075
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

296
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,536
Vest pocket. Come on.

297
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,791
Is that perfume?

298
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,667
That's none of your business.

299
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,003
Well, it smells really nice.

300
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,547
Yeah, well, it's European.

301
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,882
Oh.

302
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,425
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

303
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,344
Is it too much?

304
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,428
Not at all.

305
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,721
Smells expensive.

306
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,391
Well, it is.

307
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,227
You want a sucker?

308
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,104
Sure.

309
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,396
I like the green one.

310
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,065
This is a red one.

311
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,652
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

312
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,447
Oh, shit. He's here.

313
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,584
Am I in the right place?

314
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,088
Oh! Right.

315
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,756
Told you it was big.

316
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,425
Oh, it's big.

317
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,552
What's that smell?

318
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,929
It's European.

319
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,474
Someone been smoking?

320
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,101
Um, he was.

321
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,435
- Can you believe it?
- What?

322
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,770
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

323
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,522
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

324
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,817
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

325
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,944
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

326
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,113
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

327
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,865
Just get out of here.

328
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,450
- Get out.

329
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,579
Unbelievable.

330
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,873
You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.

331
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,959
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

332
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,066
Hey, Henry!

333
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,944
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

334
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,488
Hold on.

335
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,701
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

336
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,119
Marking our territory.

337
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,996
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

338
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,667
I'm not shitting.

339
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,422
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

340
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,008
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

341
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,677
Hey, Henry.

342
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,564
Check it out.

343
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,610
It's drugs, I think.

344
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,237
It's drugs?

345
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,405
Remember that guy from assembly?

346
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,533
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

347
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,452
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

348
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,079
No.

349
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,373
This is definitely cocaine.

350
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,874
Yeah. Of course.

351
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,710
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

352
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,799
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

353
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,051
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

354
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,386
When I do it.

355
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,512
Oh, yeah?

356
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,596
With who?

357
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,056
With faulk.

358
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,391
After church.

359
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,393
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

360
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,019
Are you friends with faulk?

361
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,187
No. He's a pervert.

362
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,647
Then you wouldn't know.

363
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,898
Liar.

364
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,150
You're just mad
you're never invited.

365
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,194
I don't care I'm not invited.

366
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,447
Sounds like you care.

367
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,242
Do some, then.

368
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,536
What?

369
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,663
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

370
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,583
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

371
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,712
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

372
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,297
That wouldn't be good.

373
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,589
Fine.

374
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,092
Knife me.

375
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,562
Okay, so how do I do it?

376
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,731
You eat it.

377
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,773
How much?

378
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,444
Like a tablespoon's worth.

379
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh!

380
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,042
- Son of a bitch!

381
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,129
Oh, what the hell?

382
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,882
- Rookie.

383
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,551
You do it, then.

384
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,429
Ugh.

385
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,652
- Ah, shit!

386
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,488
What the hell?

387
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,866
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

388
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,788
Ugh!

389
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,499
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

390
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,459
Let's sell drugs together.

391
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,796
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and faulk.

392
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,508
There's more.

393
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,011
Ow.

394
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,681
Something got into it.

395
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,141
A deer, maybe.

396
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,352
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

397
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,853
It'd be like this.

398
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,648
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like... bang!

399
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,400
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

400
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,860
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

401
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,030
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

402
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,992
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

403
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,539
My throat's really runny.

404
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,627
Stop that.

405
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,391
Did it do the cocaine?

406
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,228
Don't move a muscle.

407
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,985
Listen to me.

408
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,238
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

409
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,365
Now we have trouble.
You understand? -Got it.

410
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,534
- I'll take care of it.

411
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,703
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

412
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:35,038
Grandpa Syd!
Gabe, driving me nuts.

She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.

It's fine.

00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,678
No, I could've did more.

It's fine.

428
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,889
I should've been there.

429
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,224
I didn't need you there.

430
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,558
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

431
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,143
It's against my constitution.

432
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,103
I'm more than a drug dealer.

433
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,397
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

434
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,857
We're friends, right?

435
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:44,942
No.

436
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,861
Fine.

437
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,197
I think he's happy she's dead.

438
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,657
He's not happy she died.

439
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,159
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

440
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,995
if we can call it that.

441
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,789
Sometimes...

442
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,166
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

443
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,918
No, joanie died of cancer.

444
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,169
I know.

445
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,255
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

446
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,673
You can't give no one cancer.

447
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,341
Yes, you can. With stress.

448
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,385
Stop protecting him.

449
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,303
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

450
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,389

00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,246
I'm wearing the stuff.

459
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,915
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

460
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,750
13, come through here?
My daughter...

461
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,794
You lost your daughter
in the park.

462
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,422
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

463
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,508
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

464
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,343
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

465
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,970
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

466
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,431
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

467
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,974
with the way things are at home.

468
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,309
She's not a runaway.

469
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,727
She just came to paint the...

470
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,228
Can someone just please point me

471
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,563
in the direction
of blood mountain?

472
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,607
This is blood mountain.

473
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,941
- Sorry. I-I'm Peter.
Oh.

474
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,526
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

475
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,404
We're about to head up there ourselves.

476
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,822
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

477
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,365
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

478
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,742
is a very important process.

479
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,285
We wouldn't want you distracted

480
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,245
by our little
damsel in distress here.

481
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,788
Nothing can distract me

482
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,416
from making sure
the entire biological community

483
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,209
is safe for all our friends.

484
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,836
Friends?

485
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,796
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

486
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,257
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

487
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,677
Well, I won't be a burden.

488
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,431
I'll get my hat.

489
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,933
Okay.

490
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,813
Shoes okay for hiking?

491
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,732
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

492
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,609
I have on boots.
- Yep.

493
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,277
Come on, Eddie.

494
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,987
I'm done playing this game.

495
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,238
You-you wanted...

496
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,823
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

497
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,784
You still have
three more questions.

498
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,953
Listen.
What?

499
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,206
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

500
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,957
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

501
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,795
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

502
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,385
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

503
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,804
Park rangers are peace officers.

504
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,139
Which means we can shoot people.

505
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,600
Forest is a dangerous place.

506
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,852
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

507
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,229
"Gang of pubes"?

508
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,606
Teens. Delinquents.

509
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,151
They've been attacking hikers.

510
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,653
They hurt anyone?

511
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,948
They cut them with a knife.

512
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,325
Call themselves the doochamps.

513
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,203
Watch your back.

514
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,831
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

515
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,209
Out of nowhere.

516
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,141
Fuck is this?

517
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,227
He's afraid, buds.

518
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,020
Empty your pockets.

519
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,439
No.

520
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,025
Empty your pockets, please.

521
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,530
Since you asked so nicely.

522
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,325
You think this is a joke?

523
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,910
I do.

524
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,704
Get him, buds.

525
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,372
I'm shaking
a fucking knife, man. Come on.

526
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,207
Just stab him. -Come on, man.
It's a fucking knife!

527
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,793
- Go on!

528
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,714
Oh!

529
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,215
Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.

530
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,801
- Come on, rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

531
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,055
Give me this fucking board!

532
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,559
You're going down, man!

533
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,317
Submit! Submit!

534
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,736
What the...

535
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,239
Hold this!

536
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,701
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

537
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,548
Oh, my.

538
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,480
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

539
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,107
Shit!

540
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,609
I love this road.

541
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,152
Ah, love it up there.

542
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,279
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

543
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,781
What? The falls.

544
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,157
The secret falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

545
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,784
- or take the loop.
I love the loop.

546
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,494
Well, you can see
the top of the...

547
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,454
This is a more direct...

548
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,331
All right. We're going this way.

549
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,999
Well, crap.

550
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,585
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

551
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,671
Just distracting you completely.

552
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,172
She can hear you.

553
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,759
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

554
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,303
- What's taking you so long?

555
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,265
What'd you do?

556
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,609
Please tell me
you found them like this.

557
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,652
They attacked me.

558
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,820
Are they dead?

559
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,196
Well, one might be.

560
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,700
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

561
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,787
Jesus chr... they're kids.

562
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,123
I loved this fucking Jersey, man.

563
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,583
Okay, they're fine.

564
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,710
Thank god.

565
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,337
No fucking way.

566
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,674
Daveed?

567
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,515
What happened?

568
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,600
Hey.

569
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:52,851
- Wake up.

570
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,394
Where'd you find this?

571
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,854
Whoa.

572
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,481
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

573
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,025
You tried to fucking kill me.

574
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,485
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

575
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,654
I tell him that all the time.

576
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,573
Where did you find this?

577
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,366
Up on the mountain.

578
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,451
Where's the rest of it?

579
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,328
I don't know.

580
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:14,998
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

581
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,541
What do you think I'll do
to just you

582
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,752
when you're already
on the floor?

583
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,795
Okay. Okay.

584
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,548
We stashed it under a gazebo.

585
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,425
Going back for it later tonight.

586
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,385
A gazebo?

587
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,555
It's a pavilion-type structure.

588
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,349
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

589
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,185
I didn't.

590
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,062
Are my buds dead?

591
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,730
- Show us where.
- Oh, god.

592
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,899
You know,
i-I'm feeling kind of tired.

593
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
I think I should rest.

594
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,402
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

595
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,820
Eddie, go get the gun.

596
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,238
It's in the glove.

597
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,573
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

598
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,533
Yeah. Same.

599
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,578
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

600
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,456
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

601
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,250
Okay.

602
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,752
Okay.

603
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:01,920
All right, all right.

604
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,923
All right, I'm coming.

605
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,008
Relax.

606
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,936
It's getting real cold out.

607
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,495
Let's go.

608
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,623
So, where you guys from?

609
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,333
Shut up. Keep walking.

610
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,961
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

611
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,963
It better not be a long hike.

612
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,297
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

613
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,966
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

614
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,634
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

615
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,469
Well, it wasn't me.

616
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,971
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

617
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,472
Getting stabbed sucks.

618
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,933
Hey, shut the fuck up.

619
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,438

Yeah, reba, it's Bob.

626
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,911
I was wondering
how rosette is doing.

627
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,205
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

628
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,790
I...

629
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,503
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

630
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,257
Anyway, I...

631
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,218
Thanks again for helping out.

632
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,846
Bye.

633
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,474
Look at this.

634
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,850
Oh, no.

635
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,102
Look at this mess.

636
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,146
People don't have any respect.

637
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,106
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

638
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,399
I... let me pick that up.

639
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,693
- All right. Thank you, ranger.
- Dee Dee!

640
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,653
That is sticking.
- I got some oil in the car.

641
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,863
Dee Dee! Henry!

642
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,364
'Cause if that stays open,

643
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,200
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

644
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,285
What kind of critters? Huh?

645
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,912
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

646
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,122
Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

647
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,749
- Dee Dee!
Uh, skunks.

648
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,209
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

649
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,044
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

650
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,045
Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. -I think they're cute.

651
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,505
Uh, skunks.

652
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,672
Skunks. Hmm.

653
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,799
- Possums.
Possums.

654
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,966
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

655
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,052
- Uh...
- Hey, possum.

656
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,221
Mrs. Mckinndry!

657
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,597
Henry?

658
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,390
Here! Hello?

659
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,642
Henry?

660
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,228
Up here!

661
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,231
Hey. Whoa.
Oh.

662
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,191
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

663
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,275
No.

664
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,069
- No, that's not safe at all.
No.

665
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,238
It's too high.
You got to come down.

666
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,322
Get down here.

667
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,117
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

668
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,952
- No shit, Henry.
It's high.

669
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,495
But there was a bear.

670
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,830
A really terrible bear.

671
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,289
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

672
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,416
- It was fucked!
Hey!

673
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,210
That's inappropriate.

674
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,588
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

675
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,048
It attacked you?

676
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,050
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.

677
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,052
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

678
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,762
You must have done something
to upset it.

679
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,722
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

680
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,808
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

681
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,644
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

682
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,688
You have to listen to me!

683
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,565
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

684
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,108
The monster took her.

685
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:13,444
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

686
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,071
Get down here now.

687
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,615
- A...

688
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,742
- I...

689
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,453
Dee Dee!

690
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,514
Whoa!

691
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,766
Peter!

692
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,644
- No!
- Peter!

693
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,025
Oh! Oh, no!

694
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,860
It let me go! He ran off!

695
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,071
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

696
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,531
Is it gone?

697
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,451
Do you see it?

698
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,250
Yeah.

699
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,544
Why are you shooting at me?

700
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,754
Get your ass down!

701
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,172
This is your fault.

702
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,716
Right behind you. I saw it.

703
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,177
Stay down.

704
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:29,021
What?

705
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,123
Help me!

706
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,793
Help!

707
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,882
Ranger! Ranger!

708
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,259
Did it get you?

709
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,803
That asshole!

710
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,096
I'm gonna get him.

711
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,640
I'm gonna get that asshole.

712
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:09,227
I'll get help.

713
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,728
Where are you going?

714
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,063
God almighty.

715
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,233
Hey. What...

716
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,236
Where is it?

717
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,447
Hey!

718
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,659
What should I do?

719
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,160
Motherfucker!

720
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,579
Come back! Help us!

721
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,833
Oh, fuck!

722
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,423
There's something wrong with it.

723
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,008
Yeah, I told you there was.

724
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,218
Why is it acting like this?

725
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,262
Did you feed it cocaine?

726
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,639
No. But you're safe.

727
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,599
Bears can't climb trees.

728
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,892
Of course they can!

729
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,854
Then why are you up here?

730
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,299
It's okay. It's okay.

731
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,360
Okay.

732
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,835
No.

733
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,090
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

734
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,509
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

735
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,052
- Climb.
Go, Henry!

736
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,345
Go!

737
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,473
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

738
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,351
Go up!

739
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,436
Henry, go!

740
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,314
Oh, god.

741
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,817
Go, Henry! No!
- Whoa!

742
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,026
No!

743
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,071
Oh, god. Henry!

744
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,963
Oh, god.

745
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:44,466
Oh, shit.

746
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,180
No, no, no, no!

747
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,309
Get off of me! No, no!

748
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,646
- Get off! Get off of me!

749
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,862
Henry, jump! Jump down!

750
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:07,948
- Move, Henry!

751
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,664
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

752
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,250
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

753
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,586
- Come on. Let's go.

754
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,547
Come on.

755
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,735
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

756
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,408
That was so messed up.

757
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,827
That little man
was an expert on bears

758
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,788
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

759
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,499
Wait. What did you say?

760
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,958
We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.

761
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,793
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

762
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,296
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

763
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,798
and now on that guy back there.

764
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,675
Did you hear him scream?

765
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,928
He's so dead.

766
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,430
I'd love to not remember that.

767
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,432
But it kind of seems like

768
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,977
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

769
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:23,147
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

770
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,149
Alive? Yeah.

771
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,818
It chased her that way.

772
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,655
We got to go. Let's go.

773
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,991
He get at you, too?

774
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,827
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

775
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,623
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

776
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,417
Keep him awake.

777
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,879
Yeah, I've been trying.

778
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,396
You piles of shit!

779
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,982
- You're the doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

780
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,651
We found it.

781
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,573
"It's not ours."

782
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,032
I'm a park ranger.

783
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,201
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

784
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,869
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

785
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,372
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

786
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,291
I'd have been
at yellowstone by now

787
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,375
if it weren't for you shits!

788
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,876
- Buds.
Huh?

789
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,754
There's someone outside.

790
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,549
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

791
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,758
- Yeah.

792
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,679
Now, uh, open it
when I-I count to three.

793
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,681
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

794
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,182
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

795
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,601
He took a bite out of my ass!

796
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,021
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

797
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,733
Now, open it when I say so.

798
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,570
Now.

799
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,450
That's a fucking bear.

800
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,458
What the fuck?!

801
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,424
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

802
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,759
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

803
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,178
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

804
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,262
Where's the bear?!

805
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,014
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

806
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:23,809
- Close the motherfucking door.
- Jesus Christ.

807
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,063
Close the door.

808
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:30,150
Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.

809
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,076
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

810
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:04,226
Shh.

811
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,355
He's up there.

812
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,816
He's up there.

813
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:44,641
I got it. I got it.

814
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,527
Maybe the kid can help you.

815
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,696
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

816
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,531
- What game?
- 20 questions.

817
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:03,033
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

818
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,536
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

819
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,663
Like, "is it a spider?

820
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,707
- Is it an arrow?"

821
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,085
What are you, new?

822
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,087
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

823
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,380
Everybody knows that.

824
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,174
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

825
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,759
Is that one of your questions?

826
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,469
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

827
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,722
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

828
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:27,058
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

829
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,771
Is it bigger than a bread box?

830
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,230
- Yes.
- Whoo!

831
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,565
Yeah!

832
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,358
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

833
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,527
What? No.

834
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,739
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

835
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,909
You have one question left.

836
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,675
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

837
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:44,301
You sure this is the way?

838
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,388
Pretty sure.

839
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:53,477
Dee Dee! It's okay.

840
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,146
It's mama.

841
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,650
Oh.

842
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,360
Thank god.

843
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,320
- Ew! What the heck?

844
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,614
It's paint. It's just red paint.

845
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:08,158
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

846
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,119
I'm a nurse, Henry.

847
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,830
Good point.

848
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,708
Come on.

849
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,006
Oh, smart girl.

850
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,259
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

851
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,512
Mrs. Mckinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

852
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,180
What?

853
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,349
Why do you ask?

854
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,852
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects...

855
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:38,105
For the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

856
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,525
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

857
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,028
What if they never want
to do it again?

858
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,697
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

859
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:49,575
But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry

860
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,827
because drugs...
Especially cocaine...

861
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,996
Are very, very bad.

862
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,748
What if they would
never find out?

863
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,374
Oh, Henry.

864
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,585
We always find out.

865
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,462
Dee Dee!

866
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:05,299

- Just open it.

872
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:31,116
Yeah, open it. You think?

873
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,243
Can you just push?
Harder. -

874
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,745
- I'm doing it as hard as...
- Just let...

875
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,121
- All right. You go.
- Let me do it.

876
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:36,998
You go. Yeah.

877
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,416
Please, show me how it's done.

878
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:42,711
Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?

879
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,797
Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.

880
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,840
What is that?

881
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,842
- See anything?
- Just, can you...

882
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,260
- Can you help? Can you help?
- Yeah.

883
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,096
What happened to feminism, huh?
Is that dead?

884
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,099
- Come on.
- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

885
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,102
Oh, fuck.

886
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,478
- Come on.

887
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,105
God, I'm trying.

888
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,773
- Come on, push.

889
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,108
I'm trying.

890
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,236
You said they called in
a concussion.

891
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,823
They did.

892
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,661
Jesus.

893
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,329
This guy's been shot.

894
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,999
Yeah. Obviously.

895
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,668
Holy shit.

896
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:23,794
It's the ranger.

897
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,129
- Tom.

898
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,132
Come here. She's got a gun.

899
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,136
Tom! Hello?

900
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,181
No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.

901
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,142
It's okay.

902
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:40,144
- B...
- Did you shoot that guy?

903
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:43,147
B... b...

904
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:44,315
"Buh"?

905
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:56,369
B... b...

906
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,007
Beth?

907
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:13,178
It's okay. It's okay. Calm.

908
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:20,560
Uh...

909
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,125
Beth, we should go.

910
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:47,045
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

911
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,138
Bear.

912
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,891
Bear.

913
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,728
- Let's go.

914
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,606
Tom, get up!

915
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,113
Don't look back.
Don't look back.

916
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,578
Hang on. Push.

917
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,042
Oh, shit.

918
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,254
- Sorry. Sorry.

919
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,969
- Come on. Come on.

920
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,262
Anybody else surprised by

921
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:39,805
that rain this morning?
I know I was.

922
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,391
Leave him!

923
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,617
Our next story, the weather

924
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,536

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.

Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?

963
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:10,914
My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.

964
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,416
And what a man you are.

965
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,501
Attacking innocent people
for no reason.

966
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:15,752
Can you not?

967
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm sorry. Just continue.

968
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,923
Well, when my daddy died,

969
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,259
my mama bought me
this pet lizard.

970
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,219
It was the coolest little thing.

971
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,388
It had all these
green scales on it.

972
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,807
She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.

973
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,475
I thought that was so awesome.

974
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,186
I was real bad
at connecting with people,

975
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,896
but I practiced
conversation starters

976
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,690
on that lizard every day.

977
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:39,861
And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.

978
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,779
That's my team, man.

979
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,200
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

980
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,120
Those are my buds, man.

981
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:52,748
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

982
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:55,459
Well, you know what?

983
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,129
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

984
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,173
but people...

985
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:03,760
People are good at hearing.

986
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:10,974
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

987
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,601
- Can we...
- It's okay.

988
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:14,728
Y'all are hugging.

989
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:17,190
It's okay.

990
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,903
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

991
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:39,272
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

992
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:42,733
I'm already angry with you.

993
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,905
It's gone.

994
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:50,240
What the actual...

995
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:51,741
- No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

996
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,285
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

997
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:54,661
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

998
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,329
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

999
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,706
It's just gone.

1000
00:56:57,707 --> 00:56:59,875
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

1001
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:02,085
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

1002
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,337
i'm-a give you one more chance.

1003
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,964
Where's the ba...

1004
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,926
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

1005
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:15,265
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

1006
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:17,851
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

1007
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,270
I ain't fucking around.

1008
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:22,440
Just do it.

1009
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,776
Fuck.

1010
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,862
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

1011
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,532
I'm coming down there.

1012
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,458
Uh...

1013
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:46,672
Uh...

1014
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,009
- Uh...

1015
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:51,969
Shh!

1016
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,970
I'm just trying to...

1017
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,097
Find a safe spot to hop down.

1018
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,807
How did you get up there?

1019
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,143
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

1020
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:01,645
I hurt my hip a little.

1021
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,355
I can try to catch you
if you want.

1022
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:06,943
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

1023
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,986
Let's, uh, see, uh...

1024
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,280
Get it.

1025
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,784
Fuck!

1026
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,161
Fuck!

1027
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:20,163
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

1028
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,999
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

1029
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,543
I told you not to move.

1030
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:27,629
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

1031
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,674
They're not even
next to each other.

1032
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,010
Fuck you!

1033
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,845
Come out of there!

1034
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,430
Shit! Come on out!

1035
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,350
No fucking way!

1036
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:42,728
God! Goddamn it!

1037
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,022
You two, on your bellies.

1038
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,067
Now! And no more moving.

1039
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,152
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

1040
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,445
Can you grab them for me?

1041
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,863
Can I grab his fingers?

1042
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,533
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

1043
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,578
Slow. Slow.

1044
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,539
Easy.

1045
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,083
Ugh, god.

1046
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,544
All right.

1047
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,170
Now, you get back on your belly.

1048
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,048
I'll hold on to these.

1049
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:18,764
Now, where you at?

1050
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,892
Shit.

1051
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,436
What?

1052
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:25,980
Oh, no. The river.

1053
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,066
Henry, look.

1054
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,068
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

1055
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,362
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

1056
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,156
We're on the right track.

1057
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,867
I can feel it.

1058
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,926
Mama?

1059
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,304
Fuck.

1060
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,139
Fuck, man.

1061
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,601
My fucking Jersey, man.

1062
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,771
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

1063
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:09,439
Until that guy in the gazebo

1064
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,191
throws his weapon
into the woods.

1065
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,151
Well, then we'll be here forever.

1066
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:15,654
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1067
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:17,530
We don't need to die
because of this.

1068
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,532
Eddie, I got this.

1069
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,784
Do you?

1070
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,620
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1071
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,288
You're all gonna get arrested.

1072
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,582
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1073
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:30,335
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1074
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,420
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1075
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:34,130
and supervised shower time.

1076
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,633
Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1077
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,385
I've never even done coke.

1078
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:41,471
I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.

1079
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,640
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1080
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,183
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1081
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:47,143
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1082
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,063
I like to shit in peace.

1083
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,779
Nobody move.

1084
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,531
It's a bear.

1085
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:01,199
Yeah.

1086
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,951
No, no.

1087
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:05,830
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1088
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,936
Oh, fuck.

1089
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,188
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1090
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,566
Just play dead.

1091
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,051
Shh.

1092
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:28,913
Oh, fuck.

1093
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,255
Oh, man. You fucked.

1094
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,381
Eddie, can you breathe?

1095
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,342
What the fuck?

1096
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:43,928
I think that's a yes.

1097
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,513
Can someone do something?

1098
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:47,931
Maybe your boy can do something.

1099
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:51,768
Can you just, like... move it?

1100
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,688
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1101
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,984
Dee Dee!

1102
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:03,113
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1103
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,116
Oh, god.

1104
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,077
Look.

1105
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,830
Hello.

1106
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,583
- Is he okay?

1107
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:18,461
Help me, please.

1108
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,421
Does he have food?

1109
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,799
Her name was Elsa,

1110
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,219
and she was so beautiful.

1111
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:28,388
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1112
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,640
Were you attacked?

1113
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,393
Devil bear.

1114
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,602
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1115
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:35,812
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1116
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,021
Have you seen her?

1117
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,565
You have?

1118
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:40,775
- Was she alive?
Yes.

1119
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,318
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1120
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,237
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1121
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,280
I haven't...

1122
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,824
Henry!

1123
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:03,007
I'll show you. Come.

1124
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,264
It's not moving.

1125
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,600
I think it died.

1126
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:15,685
It died on top of me?

1127
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:16,936
Check its pulse.

1128
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,522
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1129
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,859
I'm not sure.

1130
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:26,029
Uh, hey, guy?

1131
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,155
Detective.

1132
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:28,197
Can we call a truce

1133
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,199
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1134
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,410
Yeah.

1135
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,166
Fuck.

1136
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,630
You okay?

1137
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:45,883
What do you think?

1138
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,068
S-Still breathing.

1139
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:07,403
We should go.

1140
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,781
He'll probably be all right.

1141
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:11,866
What the hell, man?

1142
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:13,242
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1143
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,286
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1144
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,579
"She."

1145
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,914
What?

1146
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,749
The bear is a girl.

1147
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,292
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1148
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:24,380
Because its vagina is on my ear.

1149
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,299
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1150
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,717
She's awake.

1151
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:32,095
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1152
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:34,765
Okay.

1153
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:40,645
Chill out. Just chill out!

1154
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:42,605
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1155
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,316
- Stay back.

1156
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,946
What the hell?

1157
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:52,783
Okay. Okay.

1158
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:57,955
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1159
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:00,623
I will be goddamned.

1160
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,125
Should we shoot her?

1161
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:05,587
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1162
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:09,466
What the fuck?

1163
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,814
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1164
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,733
- Eddie!
Daveed, help.

1165
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:29,360
What is this?

1166
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:30,820
- No, no.

1167
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,572
- Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?

1168
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:34,323
I-I don't like this.

1169
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,742
Please stop.

1170
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:37,828
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1171
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,789
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!

1172
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,958
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1173
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,084
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1174
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:46,169
It's-it's playing with you.

1175
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,670
I'd stay still if I were you.

1176
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,881
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1177
01:06:49,882 --> 01:06:52,300
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1178
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,551
Daveed!

1179
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,344
All we've been through! Come on!

1180
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,679
Come on, help him!

1181
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,681
Get lower. You're not listening!

1182
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,017
- Eddie.

1183
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,811
Oh, my god. He's gonna die.

1184
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:06,355
No!

1185
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,067
Hey, girl.

1186
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,452
There you go, girl.

1187
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,205
There you go.

1188
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,707
There you go.

1189
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,212
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1190
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:44,393
Go!

1191
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,314
Don't have to tell me twice.

1192
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,400
Come on!

1193
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,485
Daveed!

1194
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,070
That bag's worth 14 million.

1195
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,073
We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.

1196
01:07:57,074 --> 01:08:00,701
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1197
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,411
I need that bag.

1198
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,497
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1199
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,084
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1200
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:19,096
Shot...

1201
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:23,016
No. I didn't.

1202
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,106
Run! Go, go!

1203
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,568
Oh, shit!

1204
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,457
Holy shit.

1205
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,585
- Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.

1206
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:51,794
Where's Gabe?

1207
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,045
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1208
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,755
- Calm down.

1209
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,841
He's safe at home watching TV.

1210
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:58,759
What?
How long has he been alone?

1211
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,344
You left him with me!

1212
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:03,473
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1213
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,143
- Huh?

1214
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,937
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1215
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:12,523
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1216
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:14,609
The bear ate most of it.

1217
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,652
- What?
- The bear.

1218
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,613
It fucking did cocaine.

1219
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,114
A fucking...

1220
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,450
A bear did cocaine, dad!

1221
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:23,492
Fuck this!

1222
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,621
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1223
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:28,539
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1224
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,542
Look at me. Look at me.

1225
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,336
I'm on the hook here.

1226
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:38,174
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1227
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,051
And the people that I deal with,

1228
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:42,553
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1229
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:44,472
And look at me.

1230
01:09:44,473 --> 01:09:48,017
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1231
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:51,520
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1232
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,439
You hear what I'm saying?

1233
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,400
It's you and Gabe.

1234
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,362
You understand?

1235
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,783
We don't have a choice.

1236
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,161
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1237
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,289
over at the pavilion structure.

1238
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,542
Come on.

1239
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:17,714
Come on, son. Come on.

1240
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,223
Who's there?

1241
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,225
Easy.
Stay away.

1242
01:10:29,226 --> 01:10:30,851
Where's the duffel?

1243
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,561
I gave it to the bear.

1244
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,563
You gave it to the bear?

1245
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,692
Yeah. The bear.

1246
01:10:37,693 --> 01:10:39,236
It loves coke.

1247
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,113
Wh-which way did it go?

1248
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,073
I'm not fucking around here.

1249
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,575
Syd white.

1250
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,120
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1251
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,914
They all have.

1252
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,421
Reba.

1253
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:01,007
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1254
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,258
I got you now.

1255
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,260
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1256
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,846
They're kind of shifty.

1257
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,685
What...

1258
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,271
What are you doing?

1259
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:20,151
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.

1260
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:22,028
You shot him?

1261
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,154
I told you not to hurt him.

1262
01:11:23,155 --> 01:11:24,905
I don't work for you.

1263
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,532
The department trusted you.

1264
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:30,244
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1265
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:34,957
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1266
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,625
I know.

1267
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,086
- I trusted you with rosette.
- I know.

1268
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:41,005
Who's rosette?

1269
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,256
The dog in my car.

1270
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,799
You left a dog in the car?

1271
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,760
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1272
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:47,637
How is she?

1273
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:57,355
She being a good girl?

1274
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,940
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1275
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,317
E-Enough.

1276
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,444
Tell me which way the bear went,

1277
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:06,072
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1278
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:08,574
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1279
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:10,868
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1280
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,745
but that's just me.

1281
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,497
Well, what do you guys say?

1282
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,833
What's so funny?

1283
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:21,337
Apex predator,

1284
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,674
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1285
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:33,265
Dead north, man.

1286
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:35,226
- Yes, we will.

1287
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:38,062
Dead... dead north.

1288
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:39,731
Let's go.

1289
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,858
The devil bear is in there.

1290
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:26,402
You can't go in there.

1291
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:28,904
Do you have kids?

1292
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,406
We would have.

1293
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:32,158
I have to go find mine.

1294
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,411
And his name would be Texas.

1295
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,913
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1296
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:43,670
Here.

1297
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:45,921
Thank you.

1298
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,591
Bye, lady and little man.

1299
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:50,385
Bye, you both.

1300
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:54,096
Okay.

1301
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,349
Wait. What about me?

1302
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,456
Watch where you step.

1303
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,668
- I got you. Stay close.

1304
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,298
What's that?

1305
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,386
Don't move.

1306
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,014
Stay still, Henry.

1307
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,188
They look like polar bears.

1308
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,564
Henry?

1309
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,525
Dee Dee?

1310
01:14:46,526 --> 01:14:47,983
Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1311
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,777
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1312
01:14:49,778 --> 01:14:51,987
No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. -Dee Dee!

1313
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,449
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1314
01:14:55,242 --> 01:14:56,408
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1315
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:57,743
Are you hurt?

1316
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,161
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1317
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,579
That looks really deep.

1318
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,831
Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow! Ow! Henry!

1319
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,291
Let's keep you warm.

1320
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,834
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1321
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,127
You smart girl.

1322
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,837
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1323
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:10,214
We found you.

1324
01:15:10,215 --> 01:15:11,715
Put that on.

1325
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,718
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1326
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,220
Oh, my god.

1327
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,680
Mom, i'm-I'm so sorry.

1328
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,931
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1329
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:19,974
Henry told me everything.

1330
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:21,517
Everything?

1331
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:22,726
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1332
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,395
- You told her?
No.

1333
01:15:24,396 --> 01:15:26,355
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1334
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:28,649
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1335
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:32,570
- Um, what was that?

1336
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:34,656
Cocaine bear's back.

1337
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,283
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1338
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:38,784
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1339
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,077
Go that way.

1340
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:41,329
Go ahead.

1341
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,165
It's okay. Come on.

1342
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,252
Look. It's a way out.

1343
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,966
It's the falls.
Oh, wow.

1344
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:04,977
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1345
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:06,938
Oh, god.

1346
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,822
This is it.

1347
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,743
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1348
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:05,329
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1349
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:08,208
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1350
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,713
What is that?

1351
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,757
- Oh, fuck!

1352
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:19,010
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1353
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,014
Come on.

1354
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:30,062
Eddie.

1355
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:32,148
Take this.

1356
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,822
Fuck.

1357
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,913
Thank you.

1358
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:58,465
Goddamn bear.

1359
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,051
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1360
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:11,353
You got what you wanted?

1361
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:12,689
Let's go.

1362
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:19,069
There's-there's a lot more
out there.

1363
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:22,031
We got to keep looking, understand?

1364
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,034
We're not whole yet.

1365
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,996
I'm leaving, Syd.

1366
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,543
Go.

1367
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,069
Give me the bag.

1368
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,864
When did you all get so soft?

1369
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:06,993
All got sand in your pussies.

1370
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:12,498
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1371
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:14,541
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1372
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,252
Stay away from the bears.

1373
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,590
This way.

1374
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,342
Come on. There's an opening.

1375
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:25,427
Henry, come here.

1376
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,889
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1377
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,643
He has a gun.

1378
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,856
No!

1379
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:39,317
Come on!

1380
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,902
The hell is this?

1381
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,404
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1382
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,323
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1383
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:47,950
I'm a mom.

1384
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:50,953
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1385
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:53,205
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1386
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:56,625
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1387
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,169
You understand?

1388
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,005
Go.

1389
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,967
Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1390
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,097
It's stuck.

1391
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:11,224
Fuck!

1392
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,143
Who are these guys?

1393
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:17,521
We're going home.

1394
01:20:17,522 --> 01:20:19,690
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1395
01:20:19,691 --> 01:20:21,234
Nobody's going anywhere!

1396
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:24,695
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1397
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:26,489
- Dad!
- Shut...

1398
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:30,158
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1399
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,827
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1400
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,162
- Fuck.

1401
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,998
Get back! Get... fuckers!

1402
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,374
- Stay away.

1403
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,458
- Whoa.
Stay away.

1404
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,585
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1405
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:40,919
Just give 'em the bag.

1406
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,796
Shoot the fucking bears!

1407
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:44,131
- Get over here.
- Dee Dee and Henry: Whoa!

1408
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:45,841
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1409
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,843
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1410
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,804
The fuck's the matter with you?

1411
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,682
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1412
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,100
Get 'em off me!

1413
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:56,560
- Fuck him.
Help me out!

1414
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,145
Ow. Eddie!

1415
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,856
- Ow!
- No.

1416
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,066
Coward. Daveed!

1417
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,402
Here, catch.

1418
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:10,700
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1419
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:12,784
Mama!

1420
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,746
Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.

1421
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:16,955
Look around, dad.

1422
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,999
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1423
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,376
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1424
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,211
People are dead.

1425
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,297
You are no son of mine.

1426
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:26,548
Hey, you!

1427
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,050
You did this.

1428
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,551
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1429
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,887
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1430
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,097
because you're
a piece of crap person

1431
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,224
and a bad dad!

1432
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,559
Who the fuck are you?

1433
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,728
I'm Henry,

1434
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:42,397
and I am so fucking tired!

1435
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,566
Yeah, me, too.

1436
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:12,594
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1437
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,596
She's protecting the cubs.

1438
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:15,681
Oh, shit!

1439
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:17,140
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1440
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,475
- What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.

1441
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:19,768
We're gonna be okay.

1442
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:20,978
Here, here, here.

1443
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:22,396
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1444
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,981
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1445
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,817
- We're gonna be all right.

1446
01:22:26,818 --> 01:22:28,485
- Ready?
Mm-hmm.

1447
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:31,739
Three, two, one. Jump!

1448
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,287
- Oh, shit.

1449
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:50,633
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1450
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,430
Let's go!

1451
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:29,005
- Come on. It's okay.

1452
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:32,842
Eddie. Help.
We made it.

1453
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,895
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1454
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,308
- Oh, shit. He shot you.

1455
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,104
Help! Help!

1456
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,277
S-Six more days of John.

1457
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:16,945
Okay.

1458
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:18,822
Six more days...

1459
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,199
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1460
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,368
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1461
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,203
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1462
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:27,582
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1463
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:31,168
Hey, hey, I...

1464
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:33,336
I got my last question.

1465
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:34,629
What?

1466
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,131
It's 20 questions.

1467
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:37,966
I got my last one.

1468
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:40,678
What? All right. Sure.

1469
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,098
Is it joanie?

1470
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,641
It's joanie, right?

1471
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,311
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1472
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,104
How'd you guess?

1473
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:53,815
You're so fucking obvious.

1474
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,775
I just didn't want to guess it

1475
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,653
to have you crying on me
all day.

1476
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,456
She's a nurse!

1477
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,166
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1478
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,500
He's in shock.

1479
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,212
Put pressure on him.

1480
01:27:12,228 --> 01:27:14,521
I've called backup.

1481
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:17,066
Her name's rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1482
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,026
You should get going.

1483
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,238
Take care of yourself.

1484
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:30,538
Hi. Hi.

1485
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:33,582
Rosette.

1486
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:46,261
Whose dog is this?

1487
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,846
I think it's mine.

1488
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:49,597
Mine and Gabe's.

1489
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,932
Is it on cocaine?

1490
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,852
No.

1491
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,439
That's a good dog.

1492
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,817
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1493
01:28:00,818 --> 01:28:02,320
Yeah.

1494
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:07,699
I knew you'd be okay.

1495
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,118
You're the toughest person
I know.

1496
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:13,079
I think you get that
from your mom.

1497
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,456
I think you're right.

1498
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:16,624
Thanks for coming to get me.

1499
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,877
I'm your mom. I love you.

1500
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:21,546
You, too, Henry.

1501
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:24,049
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray
on you too soon.

1502
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,802
No. You deserve to be happy.

1503
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:29,679
Henry, let's walk over here.

1504
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,057
- Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.

1505
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,475
I also don't want to look.

1506
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:35,185
Ugh.
Don't look.

1507
01:28:35,186 --> 01:28:37,479
- Let's just cruise on by.

1508
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,065
Oh, here come the po-po.

1509
01:28:40,066 --> 01:28:41,441
Hey, mom.

1510
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:43,693
I want to go to Nashville
with you and ray.

1511
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:46,780
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1512
01:28:46,781 --> 01:28:48,156
Rehab?

1513
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,866
We're cokeheads now.

1514
01:28:49,867 --> 01:28:51,326
You know?

1515
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:52,869
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1516
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,287
- Mrs. Mckinndry.
Mm-hmm.

1517
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:56,624
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1518
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:13,848
Rodney, are you getting it?

1519
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,892
I swear to god, Carol.

1520
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:17,477
Well, then zoom in.

1521
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:19,688
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1522
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:22,399
Oh, they're so cute.

1523
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,983
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1524
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,193
Wait.

1525
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:26,861
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1526
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,613
Oh.

1527
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:30,156
Oh, shit.
