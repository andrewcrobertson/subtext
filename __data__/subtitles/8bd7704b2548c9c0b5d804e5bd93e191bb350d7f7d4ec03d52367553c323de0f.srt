1
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:49,793
<i>Fuck.</i>

2
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,004
<i>What is an adult?</i>

3
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>Becomin' one
didn't suddenly transform me</i>

4
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,881
<i>into anything outstanding
or significant.</i>

5
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,318
<i>I am 18 and
entirely unremarkable.</i>

6
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,887
<i>Languishing in the wilds</i>

7
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,802
<i>of nowhere, Tennessee.</i>

8
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,325
<i>In this tomb of a house
left to me</i>

9
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,501
<i>by my brilliant
and selfish parents.</i>

10
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>They're not dead...</i>

11
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,723
<i>though they pretend I am.</i>

12
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,334
<i>They're permanently abroad.</i>

13
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,165
<i>Literature is my solace
in the solitude.</i>

14
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,211
<i>And writing is my only means
of escape.</i>

15
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,562
<i>Because, you see...</i>

16
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,651
<i>I've never left the edges
of this town.</i>

17
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:07,741
<i>It's positively gothic,
really.</i>

18
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:11,179
<i>Lonely girl longs to escape</i>

19
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,530
<i>the interminable boredom
of her small village.</i>

20
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,619
<i>Lonely girl longs
to be meaningful.</i>

21
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,754
<i>Lonely girl longs to be loved.</i>

22
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,496
<i>Books make longing
seem romantic, but it's awful.</i>

23
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,715
<i>It's greedy.</i>

24
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,240
<i>And I wear longing
like a fucking veil.</i>

25
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,476
<i>But today?</i>

26
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,783
<i>Today comes with
something new.</i>

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,176
<i>Something surprising.</i>

28
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,397
<i>Today I meet a writer,
like me.</i>

29
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,748
<i>A teacher.</i>

30
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,315
<i>One who somehow
found inspiration</i>

31
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,838
<i>in a place like this.</i>

32
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,145
<i>If you can believe it.</i>

33
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,806
<i>Well...</i>

34
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:15,243
<i>I suppose even graveyards
grow flowers.</i>

35
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,057
Good morning.

36
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,321
Morning.

37
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:53,977
You know, class doesn't start
for another hour.

38
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,197
I know. I don't like crowds.

39
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:01,158
- Do you live far?
- Close enough to walk.

40
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,986
- Where's that?
- Lovell Hill?

41
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:04,901
You live in Lovell Hill?

42
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:06,773
- You know it?
- I just didn't think it was

43
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,166
occupied by anything
except ghosts.

44
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:10,342
Who says it is?

45
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,432
You, you
really live in Lovell Hill?

46
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,520
Wow.

47
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:17,436
It's enormous.

48
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,959
My parents are lawyers.

49
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:20,743
- What kind?
- The expensive kind.

50
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,267
And you wanna be a lawyer?

51
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,181
About as much as I wanna be
a high school student.

52
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,487
What's your name?

53
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:26,923
Cairo Sweet.

54
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,099
- I'm Mr. Miller.
- I know.

55
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,232
My friend Winnie
recommended your class.

56
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,542
Now I'm assuming that you got
one of these before...

57
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,370
the holidays.

58
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,762
Got a chance to look it over?

59
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:40,981
I read it.

60
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,504
I, I,
I know it looks like a lot,

61
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:43,723
but I promise you
we'll get through it

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,246
as quickly as we can.

63
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,378
I read the whole list.

64
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,467
Wait, you read these?

65
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,340
Well, like,
there's 12 books on that list.

66
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:53,472
I party hard.

67
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,737
Winnie.

68
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,434
One semester
wasn't enough for you?

69
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:00,609
Did you miss me?

70
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,958
I did not.

71
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,396
Well, that's too bad.

72
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:09,531
You're overdressed as usual,
I see.

73
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,794
Your underwear,
as usual, I see.

74
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,541
How boring.

75
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:20,934
Censorship is dead.

76
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,544
It can't exist
with the Internet.

77
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,719
And yet it does.

78
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,068
Do you know why?

79
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,156
Yeah.

80
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,333
Do you?

81
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,030
Ignorance is a product
of laziness.

82
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,772
Not limitation.

83
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,208
Excuse me,

84
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:35,731
but what's that you say?

85
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:39,779
You want
a chicken biscuit

86
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,390
and a Coke?

87
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:45,175
Well, you heard the boss.

88
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,396
It's chickybikky Coke-y time,
let's go.

89
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,093
You want anything, Mr. Miller?

90
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,574
No, thank you, Cairo.

91
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,793
Sweet of you to ask.

92
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,665
I see
what you did there.

93
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,580
"Cairo, sweet of you to ask."

94
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,668
Not.

95
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,409
Good one.

96
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:03,629
Like we've never heard
that before.

97
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,077
Jesus.

98
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:25,607
My God.

99
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:35,704
What you reading?

100
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:39,012
- Nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothin'.

101
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,100
It's a student's.

102
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:41,231
Yeah? What's her name?

103
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,450
How do you know it's a girl?

104
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,104
Boys are too lazy
to read porn.

105
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,279
How do you know it's porn?

106
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,762
"Marcelle wants me
to fuck her.

107
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:50,937
"She leaps off the couch

108
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,025
-"and pushes herself..."
- Boris.

109
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,418
"...between the girl and me.

110
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:56,595
"It's all
so fantastically horrible

111
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,031
-"that I can't move."
- Give me that.

112
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,554
-"Marcelle stretches..."
- Okay.

113
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,382
-"...her tiny split fig."
- That's quite enough...

114
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:02,775
- All right.
- ...of your elocution...

115
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,429
- And test tomorrow, kids.
- I think.

116
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,039
Well, "Split fig"
is fucking poetry.

117
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,432
- This coffee for me?
- Biscuit, too.

118
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,304
One of yours?

119
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,566
Yeah,
that's one of yours.

120
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:12,654
One of mine. Exactly.

121
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,786
Christ!

122
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,222
I don't know what
you're doing,

123
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,571
- but it's some...
- You know. Come on, now.

124
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,051
I'm trying to just entice you.
What the...

125
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,139
- Man, that's good.
- "I read <i>The Paris Review.</i>

126
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,270
-"I'm so smart."
- Can you not?

127
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,924
"Everybody,
I'm in high school.

128
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,012
-"But I read <i>The Paris Review.
- </i>  Boris. Boris. Come on.

129
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,187
"I'm better than most people."

130
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:25,101
- Stop, please.
- Is this her diary?

131
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,320
What do we have here?

132
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,365
Well, well, well.

133
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:31,325
<i>"Apostrophes
and Ampersands..."</i>

134
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,938
six abysmally
romantic short stories

135
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,463
by Jonathan Albert Miller.

136
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:42,292
She has my book?

137
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,685
It would appear so.
It would also appear

138
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,078
she's the only one
who checked it out.

139
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,384
Yeah, well, don't you have
a class to teach?

140
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:48,690
Well, you know,

141
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:49,952
I can't start my day
without seeing you.

142
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,215
No, you really can't.

143
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:54,261
Hey, how'd you score
the big room anyway?

144
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,002
They cut
the theater program.

145
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:57,482
But they kept you?

146
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,222
Along with
the other props, yeah.

147
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,008
Damn.

148
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,163
- Hello, wife.
- Hello, husband.

149
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,039
Beatrice.

150
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,041
- What?
- Look at me.

151
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,353
Red-Letter Day.

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,747
What, your school
finally get computers?

153
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:46,879
Better.

154
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,141
Indoor bathrooms?

155
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,621
A writer.

156
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,970
One who reads <i>Finnegans Wake</i>

157
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,449
of her own volition.
Can you believe that?

158
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,103
Well, I'm forever stunned
that the children

159
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,279
in that backwater shanty
can read at all.

160
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,238
And, guess what else?

161
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,674
<i>Naked Lunch.</i>

162
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,720
<i>Apostrophes and Ampersands.</i>

163
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,851
She...

164
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,158
She checked it out
of the library.

165
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,464
They carry your book
at the library?

166
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,945
Aw. Fuck.

167
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,819
<i>A Confederacy of Dunces.</i>

168
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,690
Well, deep breaths.

169
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,039
Happy place.

170
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,346
My happy place
has all their heads

171
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,827
impaled on Montblanc pens.

172
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:23,524
Share your riches.

173
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,703
Hello, Amy.

174
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,575
What? Are you fucking joking?

175
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:32,185
I've been back and forth
all day

176
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,143
with the Nashville office
who can't seem to articulate

177
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,449
what it is they want

178
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,364
and somehow think
they can articulate

179
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,235
to me,
which is pretty ambitious

180
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:40,367
considering how they think

181
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,848
"articulate"
is a Danish cheese.

182
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:45,590
So, I'm about to start
fucking scooping out

183
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,243
my teeth with a baby spoon.

184
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,941
They can go

185
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:51,639
fuck themselves if they think
I'm gonna change the ending.

186
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,510
Okay, have a nice day,
bye-bye.

187
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,623
Here now.

188
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,538
Cheers.

189
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,628
Cheers.

190
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,675
That's so good.

191
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,332
Hey, you ever read,

192
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,595
<i>Under the Roofs of Paris,</i>
Henry Miller?

193
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,945
Honey,
my first copy got so sticky,

194
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,991
I had to throw it away.

195
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,036
That beginning bit
with the prostitute...

196
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,647
...and the cum money?

197
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,344
That is choice.

198
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:47,739
"I take the first
bill I find in my pocket

199
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:50,524
"and wipe my cock on it."

200
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:55,094
"And place it crumpled
on her bare belly

201
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,313
"weighted with a coin."

202
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,707
I love when you do magic.

203
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:01,100
You care to reenact?

204
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,971
I can papier-mache you...

205
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,453
with cum and money.

206
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,802
So you're expecting

207
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,109
a heavy load, then?

208
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,894
A full body of work.

209
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,548
Come here.

210
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,681
Dance with me.

211
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:37,310
You're so beautiful.

212
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:38,964
Shut up.

213
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,243
For fuck's sake.

214
00:11:58,157 --> 00:11:59,158
Okay.

215
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,161
Will you take care
of those dishes?

216
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,120
I'll give you a handy later.

217
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,125
It's Pushkin, Amy.

218
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,648
Not Pollyfuckinanna.

219
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:14,956
What
a terrible weekend.

220
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,132
Come on,

221
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:19,352
why you always gotta
hold my coffee hostage?

222
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,788
'Cause you're a puritan.

223
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,050
I feel like it's my duty

224
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:23,748
to punish the goodness
out of you.

225
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:25,140
God, you're a sadist.

226
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,576
I'm a public school teacher.

227
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,100
- Amen to that.
- Cheers.

228
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,712
Ooh, mama.

229
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,674
You think there's ghosts
up in there?

230
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:41,591
Why don't you go see?

231
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,898
I don't go in the kudzu.

232
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:45,987
That feeds on
the souls of the dead.

233
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,293
That's why it grows so fast.

234
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:16,888
Good morning.

235
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:18,150
You always walk through
the woods alone?

236
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,325
That's a peculiar question

237
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,544
to ask a young lady,
Coach Fillmore.

238
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,111
What, what are you,
listening to?

239
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,983
- Celine Dion.
- Really?

240
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,462
Really.

241
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:27,899
But why?

242
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,335
- I'm sorry.
- Because she's great.

243
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:30,640
Ignore him. Ignore him.

244
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,729
He wept aloud openly...

245
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,383
...at the <i>Titanic</i>
theme song...

246
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,558
At my bachelor party.

247
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:37,343
- Remember that?
- I was drunk.

248
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,518
You were disconsolate.

249
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,867
You are a fucking traitor.

250
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:40,999
And you're a fucking
hypocrite.

251
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,653
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,003
Want a biscuit?

253
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,526
- Yeah, sure.
- There you go.

254
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:54,969
- It's good.
- Yeah?

255
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,101
- Do you make these?
- Yeah.

256
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,624
But you know,
don't tell nobody.

257
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,452
- Why not? I don't.
- You know.

258
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,932
- You'll figure it out.
- I won't.

259
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,368
You can't have
the baseball team knowing

260
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,239
that he bakes biscuits
and cries to Celine Dion.

261
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:07,112
On that...
Take my leave.

262
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,375
I shall bid you goodbye.

263
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:10,593
- Okay.
- You, bad bye.

264
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,812
- Well, goodbye.
- A bad bye?

265
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,031
But I love you though.

266
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,119
No, you don't.

267
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,645
Don't you get scared walking
through those woods?

268
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,607
I'm the scariest thing
in there.

269
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:41,842
Oldest trick in the book,
Winnie.

270
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,149
Ain't you gonna say somethin'?

271
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,803
I dressed up just for you.

272
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:49,937
What you want?

273
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,025
I wanna get into

274
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:53,114
- your physics class.
- Why?

275
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,202
You'd be really behind.

276
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,638
Don't you tutor?

277
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,162
You don't need lessons.

278
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,425
Then what do I need?

279
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,167
Um...

280
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,823
See what I can do.

281
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,216
'Preciate ya!

282
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:09,435
Hope so.

283
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,264
You are insane.

284
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,791
Here.

285
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:20,054
I think
I'm seducing Coach Fillmore.

286
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,188
But you're a lesbian.

287
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm an equal opportunist.

288
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,584
Are you jealous?

289
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,412
Well, if I say, "yes,"
will you lay off him?

290
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,675
If I say, "yes,"
will you lay on me?

291
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:35,461
Okay, chickybikky?

292
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,333
Okay.

293
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,909
So, you're a smoker now?

294
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,781
I'm smoking now.

295
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,219
No plans for it
to define me yet.

296
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:55,698
Where are your parents
this time?

297
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:57,483
Mumbai.

298
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,702
For how long?

299
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,574
Who knows?

300
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,228
Let me dress you up.

301
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:04,925
Winnie, you know I don't give
a fuck about being hot.

302
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:06,274
I give a fuck
about being smart.

303
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,276
You can be both.

304
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:11,627
What are you doin'?

305
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,804
I'm willing my cursor
to blink itself

306
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,110
into my Yale essay.

307
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,807
You dry?

308
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,375
Unqualified.

309
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,899
What's the subject?

310
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:24,727
"What has been your greatest
achievement to date?"

311
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:27,861
All right, what the fuck
am I supposed to say?

312
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,732
Surviving the crippling ennui

313
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:30,864
of growing up
in bumfuck nowhere?

314
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:31,996
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,519
I just...
I couldn't hear you over

316
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,608
the high whine
of your shining trust fund.

317
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,870
My greatest achievement
cannot be that

318
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,132
I've had no achievement.

319
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,395
Well, you are gonna
be valedictorian.

320
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,483
Boring.

321
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,964
- You have a 4.6 GPA.
- Boring.

322
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,270
And you've successfully...

323
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:46,358
- What?
- Well...

324
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:49,013
You've successfully, um...

325
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:50,971
Well...

326
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,886
Shit.

327
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,975
I guess you're just another
run-of-the-mill,

328
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,498
generationally wealthy gal

329
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,587
livin' in
a haunted ancestral mansion.

330
00:16:58,674 --> 00:16:59,719
Fuck.

331
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,461
So...

332
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:05,507
Experience something.

333
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,726
Like what?

334
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,075
Something worth writing about.

335
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:13,124
You could write a treatise
on teacher-student affairs.

336
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,344
How exactly would that
be an achievement, Winnie?

337
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,563
Easy.

338
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,521
It becomes a conversation

339
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,654
about achieving emancipation

340
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,353
from your inherited beliefs
about sex and age.

341
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,138
You're not seriously
gonna fuck Fillmore, are you?

342
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,314
Haven't decided yet.

343
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,098
What's it to you?

344
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:32,273
Like, he's, like,

345
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,580
- twenty years older than you.
- So?

346
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,408
Older men have been
harvesting virginity

347
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,974
since the dawn of time.

348
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:43,545
So, it doesn't mean
anything to you?

349
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,243
What?

350
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,809
Your virginity.

351
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,376
Does it mean something to you?

352
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,163
I haven't decided yet.

353
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,904
Come to Winnie.

354
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,436
We're, like,

355
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:07,569
the fucking
American wet dream.

356
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:10,703
Young girls with
ambivalent sexuality.

357
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,315
Pheromones steaming off
our bodies.

358
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,709
I don't wanna drop it
for some rando jock-twat

359
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,450
whose sexual standards
are mandated

360
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:20,713
by the shit porn he downloads.

361
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,888
That's deli meat.

362
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:25,892
I want a dry-aged

363
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,503
slab of perfectly marbled
hot man meat

364
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,114
to take me to pleasure town.

365
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,291
Like...

366
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,031
Wagyu beef.

367
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:39,906
Hungee.

368
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,386
You think
that's Boris Fillmore?

369
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:43,823
Why not?

370
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:46,695
He's fine.

371
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:50,003
He's like,
really fucking smart.

372
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,396
And he's kind.

373
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,702
Which means, as my first time,

374
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,531
he'd take his time

375
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,751
to get me all good and juiced.

376
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,622
And then
he'd give me aftercare.

377
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:05,236
You know,
the first time you have sex,

378
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,715
it's not supposed to hurt.

379
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:08,543
Right?

380
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,330
Like,
if you're properly aroused.

381
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,681
You likely won't even bleed.

382
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:18,945
Didn't know that.

383
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,816
That's because a woman's pain

384
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,905
is valued more
than her pleasure.

385
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,907
But that's a conversation
for another day.

386
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:26,039
My point...

387
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:30,652
is that Boris has just got it
going on.

388
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,655
I know what I'm looking for.

389
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:39,008
And I think Mr. Miller knows
what he's looking for.

390
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,140
What do you mean?

391
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,664
I've never seen him look
at a student

392
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,926
the way he looks at you.

393
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,103
He sees you

394
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:48,844
even though
you hide in plain sight.

395
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,672
- Shut up.
- What?

396
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,934
- Stop!
- No.

397
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,285
Come on.
Like you don't notice, Cairo.

398
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:56,025
It's like he's been living
in gray scale

399
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,898
and you're the first thing
he's ever seen in color.

400
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,205
No, you're being... Shut up.

401
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:08,168
I'd fuck you.

402
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,214
I know.

403
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,833
<i>"I was nothing</i>

404
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,313
<i>"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.</i>

405
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,752
<i>"Human ruins
of a madman's love."</i>

406
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:30,930
<i>"A madman's love."</i>

407
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,935
<i>God, I'd give anything
to feel that.</i>

408
00:20:38,677 --> 00:20:42,420
<i>What muse could inspire
this deranged yearning?</i>

409
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,690
<i>To inspire.</i>

410
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,432
<i>To be so inspired.</i>

411
00:20:58,566 --> 00:21:00,351
<i>Could we be that
to each other?</i>

412
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,573
<i>What was I saying?</i>

413
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:09,185
<i>Feels like I'm not right.</i>

414
00:21:10,796 --> 00:21:11,971
<i>Feels good.</i>

415
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,495
<i>It feels pink.</i>

416
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:15,931
Never forget.

417
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,630
There's a reason this guy
was called romantic.

418
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,067
It's very big, it's very bold.

419
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,896
To us,
it might seem a little...

420
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,289
much.

421
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,118
If we don't stick
to the brief,

422
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,033
it gets a little bit woolly.

423
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,515
Can you see me
after school, please?

424
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,606
Some of you, as you can see
could have done...

425
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:40,086
<i>It's like a sugar cube
under the tongue.</i>

426
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,174
...a little better.

427
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,785
But worth persevering.

428
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:45,483
Colby, what?

429
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,267
<i>I want your attention.</i>

430
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,272
How's Bea?

431
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,622
She's, she's Bea.

432
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:55,928
Yeah.
How's the book coming?

433
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,538
It's not.

434
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,105
You mean you're not.

435
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,976
No, she's, she's occupied.

436
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:02,151
All right,
what time is dinner?

437
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,370
Seven o'clock.

438
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:04,763
And please take a shower.

439
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,242
Are you worried?

440
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,289
Your old lady's gonna get hot
for all this?

441
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,769
Top three worst nightmares.

442
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:13,467
Yeah. Because you know
how nasty she is.

443
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:15,469
No, because I wanna keep you
for myself.

444
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,602
Aw, cutie.

445
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:19,952
- Hey.
- What?

446
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,301
You remember the Roger Rabbit?

447
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:22,433
Check it out now.

448
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,705
- It's close, right?
- To?

449
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,010
Kids ain't got nothing on me.

450
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,185
- All right, man.
- Bye, Professor.

451
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,578
Love you.

452
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,289
Ooh!

453
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,770
F... Hi.

454
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,775
Hello... Well,
that was embarrassing.

455
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,908
- I won't tell.
- That's generous, thank you.

456
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,606
Hope I'm not keeping you
from anything.

457
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,043
I'm waiting for Winnie.

458
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,132
It's like you're always
waiting for Winnie.

459
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,134
That sounds like
a Gin Blossoms album.

460
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,615
<i>Waiting for Winnie.</i>

461
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:17,444
Gin Blossoms? How old are you?

462
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,533
Well, if you can't tell,
then I won't.

463
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,014
What's Winnie doing?

464
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,319
She's applying to Vandy.

465
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:24,973
You would be pleased to know.

466
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,671
And are you?

467
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,325
Tennessee is a fucking
tar pit. No offense.

468
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:32,241
I think you'll appreciate it
when you're older.

469
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,373
Maybe.

470
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:35,419
From afar.

471
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,290
As it burns.

472
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,032
Like Nero.

473
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,818
Well, that's...

474
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,168
So, how far are we talkin'?

475
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:47,474
Yale far.

476
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,084
Yale far? My God!

477
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,086
What, so you can eat
pot brownies

478
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:52,871
and read Joan Didion or what?

479
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,612
Because I hear
the literacy rate is high.

480
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,182
You ever been to

481
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,836
the Scroll Sessions
at Sally Bunny's?

482
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,490
No. What's that?

483
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,275
Poetry salon
every third Saturday.

484
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,494
Victorian Village.

485
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,278
- What is that?
- What's...

486
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,019
What's that? It's blank.

487
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:12,499
Ca... How can you disdain

488
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,675
of what Tennessee has to offer

489
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:18,636
without conducting a thorough,
cultural investigation?

490
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,289
Educated judgment.

491
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,467
Well, I've heard
things there that haunt me.

492
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:25,469
Because they're bad?

493
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:28,776
Sometimes, yeah.
Sometimes they're bad.

494
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:30,735
Most of the time, it's,
it's kind of beautiful.

495
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:32,867
Yeah.

496
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,522
Maybe you should go
this weekend.

497
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,871
I think you might
be surprised.

498
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,397
You wanted to see me?

499
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:43,051
This week's story,

500
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:47,795
you wrote about
a reluctant spider.

501
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:48,927
I enjoyed this one.

502
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:54,280
"Survival
and desire amalgamated

503
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,674
"and turned
an aphotic eye inward.

504
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,940
"I saw my expectations
dismantled and dismembered

505
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,467
"by the harsh and starving
dogs of reality.

506
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:10,035
"Truths that sit in
the vacuity of space

507
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,689
"like a hypergiant star

508
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,517
"burning to ash.

509
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:19,087
"All elements too weak
to withstand the awesome heat.

510
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,525
"We are what we are.

511
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:24,745
"And all creatures must eat."

512
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:31,360
- Um...
- Damn. That, I mean...

513
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,971
I was not expecting that.

514
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,103
Um...

515
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:38,106
She's not reluctant.

516
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,456
She's resigned.

517
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:41,719
- To her death?
- No.

518
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:42,894
To the order of things.

519
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:46,027
She eats and waits
to be eaten.

520
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:48,334
- It's dark.
- It's nature.

521
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,640
That's true.

522
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,862
You memorized it.

523
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,518
Well, I'm eidetic.

524
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,346
It's a,
it's a cool party trick.

525
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:04,655
You are...

526
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,660
You're exceptionally talented.

527
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:11,792
- Do I get an A?
- Well, how about a jumpstart

528
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:13,315
on the midterm?

529
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:15,230
Are you offering me
special treatment, Mr. Miller?

530
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:17,929
I want you to write
a short story

531
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,931
in the style
of your favorite author.

532
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,890
I think it could be
the highlight

533
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,588
of your portfolio submission

534
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,067
- to Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

535
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:27,678
- Vanderbilt.
- Yale.

536
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,070
Come on.
I've got to have some hope.

537
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:31,986
I think
that's a terrific assignment.

538
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:33,074
Thought you would.

539
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:34,728
Good.

540
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:37,949
I read your book.

541
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:40,560
God. Well...

542
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,653
Reviewers,
of which there were three,

543
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,003
found it,

544
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,398
"overreaching
without ambition," to quote.

545
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,617
I would call it...

546
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,228
grand and tragic.

547
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,970
Okay.

548
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,755
Romantic horror.

549
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:06,064
That's...

550
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:09,458
"She was an electric white

551
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:11,939
"noon-shadow moon

552
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,508
"casting cold light like water

553
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:17,205
"over the flat earth
of my face.

554
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,295
"'Don't look into the sun,'
they said.

555
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,123
"But the moon,

556
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,430
"the moon...

557
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:27,259
"I stared until I was nothing

558
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,391
"but a bleached bone monument
beneath her.

559
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:34,005
"Human ruins
of a madman's love."

560
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:40,751
Well, you memorized that, right?

561
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,891
That was too much.
That was weird.

562
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:52,110
No, it wasn't.
It's not. It's not.

563
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:54,765
That was really weird.
I'm sorry.

564
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:56,375
That was the first thing
I'd ever written...

565
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:00,422
which felt tangible.

566
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,773
Like I'd touched somethin'.

567
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,300
You know,
I haven't written anything

568
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,606
- in a very long time.
- Why not?

569
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:11,695
I don't know.

570
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,653
Do I know?

571
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,312
I guess I got married.

572
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:22,706
Started teaching.

573
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,841
I don't have anything else
to say.

574
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:31,018
You're uninspired.

575
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:33,368
- You judging me?
- I am challenging you.

576
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,892
That's my job.

577
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,815
- Hi, Winnie.
- No.

578
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,169
- Hungee.
- I think she's hungry.

579
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:52,431
She just doesn't use
real words

580
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:53,911
because she's a child.

581
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:59,264
No, it's fine.
Your hair looks great.

582
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,787
- I knew it.
- Please don't start.

583
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:02,267
- Don't.
- Your hair looks good.

584
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:03,268
- I will not go...
- I'm more concerned...

585
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,878
...gently into the good night.

586
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:06,053
- No, I know. You look fine.
- Like you have.

587
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,359
I'm just more concerned
about the fact

588
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:08,186
that you got two damn phones
on the table

589
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:09,317
like you're a rapper.

590
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:10,841
This one
is my professional phone.

591
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:12,407
And the other one...

592
00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:13,844
- The other one...
- ...is for selling drugs.

593
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,149
- The other one is personal.
- Yeah?

594
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,150
That's why you're not gonna
get that number.

595
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,850
How y'all doin'?
That burger treatin' you well?

596
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:21,765
Sorry,
it's a two-man show tonight.

597
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:24,289
I'm getting angry now.

598
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,030
- Well...
- Well, hi.

599
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:27,988
I don't see any Michelin stars
here, honey.

600
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:29,729
So, what is the holdup?

601
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,165
- A fuck-up...
- Bea. Come on.

602
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,819
...in the kitchen
that was entirely preventable.

603
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,953
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

604
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,172
- On me.
- Another Maker's.

605
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,826
Okay, you got it.

606
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,872
- Coach?
- Blue Moon.

607
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,525
Workin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

608
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:45,614
Drinkin' late on
a school night, ain't you?

609
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,834
You think sassing me
is gonna get you a better tip?

610
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,314
Gets me
a better grade.

611
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:51,403
Doesn't it?

612
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,361
- That might be true, yeah.
- Anything for you, Mr. Miller?

613
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:54,841
I'm good, Winnie.

614
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:55,973
Designated driver.

615
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,496
Really?

616
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,758
- Unless you wanna do it.
- First I'm hearing of this.

617
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,848
You know, why can't you just
be a nice,

618
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:04,459
boring teacher
like Mr. Miller?

619
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:06,026
Boring?

620
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:07,071
What? And let
my students make their grades

621
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,463
with scholastic merit?

622
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,595
Do you really think
I'm boring?

623
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,118
In a good way.

624
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,425
Like a nice pastoral.

625
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,296
I'll get those drinks for you.

626
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:16,907
Yeah. "Pastoral."

627
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,343
She just called you a field.

628
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,605
At best.

629
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,433
- She's cute.
- Yeah, and a 4.4 student.

630
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,695
And she can paint.

631
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,305
She's in my morning class.

632
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,830
Is this the last scion
of James Joyce?

633
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,527
That's Cairo.

634
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:29,876
- Cairo?
- Yeah.

635
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:31,225
Did he tell you that
Cairo read his book?

636
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,097
He sure did.

637
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:36,056
- Is she pretty?
- Is she pretty?

638
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:37,841
Um, I don't know.
She's talented.

639
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:39,364
Damn. Even worse.

640
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,235
Our friend Jon here
is prepping her to be

641
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:43,977
his transcendence into
the annals of academic glory.

642
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:46,501
And so what if I am?
It's exhilarating.

643
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:48,242
And it's rare as well

644
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:49,635
- to be so engaged and so...
- I bet is is. Yes.

645
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,419
- So worshipped.
- So worthy.

646
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:53,247
- Wanna be like me.
- She, in earnest

647
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,902
uses words
like "vituperation."

648
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,077
Please.

649
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:58,774
Vocabulary doesn't make
you a writer

650
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,386
any more than math
makes you a rocket scientist.

651
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,692
Bea, she's extraordinary.

652
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,520
- Okay?
- But enjoy it while you can.

653
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:07,305
You know, pickings are slim
in the boonies.

654
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:09,133
Rural education
not as romantic

655
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,438
as you thought it'd be?

656
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:11,875
No, I thought it was going
to be fucking

657
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,572
<i>Friday Night Lights,</i> okay?

658
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,008
- That's on you, man.
- Just cool stories

659
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:16,531
and, like, sexy guitar riffs.

660
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:19,273
Meanwhile, the professor
disapproves of my cynicism.

661
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
- He's judging you.
- Yes, he is. I feel it.

662
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,146
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

663
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,538
Are too.

664
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,149
"The teacher
who attempts to teach

665
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:26,715
"without inspiring the pupil

666
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,893
"with a desire to learn
is hammering on cold iron."

667
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,503
- Horace Mann.
- Ten points to Slytherin.

668
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,591
That's so rich.

669
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:34,288
I wanted to be a teacher.

670
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,376
You fell back on it.

671
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:37,161
And by the way,
I love teaching.

672
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,119
You're better suited for it,
I think, anyway.

673
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:40,947
- Hey, than what?
- Writing.

674
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,949
- Goddamn, Beatrice.
- What does that mean?

675
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,472
You don't have kids.

676
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,299
- You don't have kids.
- You don't have

677
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,779
brain damage, right?

678
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,824
So, um, you stopped writing

679
00:31:48,912 --> 00:31:50,826
I imagine,
because it wasn't for you.

680
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:52,698
Otherwise,
you'd still be doing it.

681
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:54,656
I'm a writer.

682
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,136
You haven't put pen to page

683
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:57,921
since your stories got panned.

684
00:31:58,704 --> 00:31:59,705
You're not a writer.

685
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,622
Well, okay.

686
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,232
Didn't realize you
saw me this way, but okay.

687
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,755
It's not that
you can't write, Jon.

688
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:07,931
It's that you don't.

689
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,108
You chose to be a teacher.

690
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,023
Why would I see you
as anything else?

691
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,765
'Cause you married a writer.

692
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,071
I did.

693
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,594
Didn't I?

694
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:33,739
<i>Why am I here?</i>

695
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,352
<i>It's not for the poetry,
I'll tell you that.</i>

696
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:44,576
<i>It's for the thrill
of something</i>

697
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,926
<i>that I've managed to go
my whole life without knowing.</i>

698
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:53,150
<i>An ache of anticipation
that you'll be here.</i>

699
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,808
<i>And it will mean something
that you are.</i>

700
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,639
<i>Be here.</i>

701
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,293
<i>Be here. Be here.</i>

702
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:11,342
"Stay, illusion.

703
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,866
"If thou hast any sound,
speak to me."

704
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,175
- Hi.
- Hi.

705
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,785
- Can I sit?
- Of course.

706
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,182
What's that you got there?

707
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,141
It's, um,
sacramental grape juice.

708
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:29,882
Said the barrister's daughter.

709
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,927
Do you know
all these people?

710
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:33,320
Most of them.

711
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,279
We've been doing this
for a couple years now.

712
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,803
Like group therapy?

713
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,719
Yeah, exactly that.

714
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:43,765
- Who's that fellow?
- That's Elliot.

715
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:45,724
Three-time Ostrander winner.

716
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:47,552
He just finished
playing Edmund in <i>Lear.</i>

717
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,293
It's sure to get him
his fourth.

718
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,210
"It is my intention
to escape you

719
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,474
"and leave you far behind...

00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,304
"...bereft of me and aching.

721
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:03,655
"Puzzled by the pain
in your rib.

722
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,875
"Not quite heartache.

723
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:09,356
"Not quite homesick.

724
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,967
"Me-shaped and filled

725
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:14,013
"with the remnants of stars.

726
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:18,626
"You choke up the void
with verdurous blooms,

727
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,976
"and the wrap of my veins
around you.

728
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,980
"The hideous pulse,

729
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:27,244
"the shouting blood,

730
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,943
"the ventricle kudzu
smothering you

731
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,118
"with wanting

732
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:36,296
"is turned hideously soft
in reminiscence.

733
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:41,301
"And yet
some part of me stays.

734
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:43,216
"Some bit,

735
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,218
"some parcel,

736
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,743
"some ash left behind.

737
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,792
"And with it,
you will recreate me.

738
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,665
"A moving effigy,
a patch-work person."

739
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,280
"But they are not me.

740
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:07,501
"And the space I left
grows misshapen."

741
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:14,029
"I will never fit there
again."

742
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:24,605
What?

743
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,565
I can see.

744
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:29,654
It was really something.

745
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:32,439
Hot dog.

746
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,398
You thought it was gonna
be trash, didn't you?

747
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:36,487
Yes, I did.

748
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,576
Have more faith.

749
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,063
<i>What is the word?</i>

750
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:52,198
<i>It's not falling.
That's too stale.</i>

751
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,550
<i>It's more deliberate
than that.</i>

752
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:01,468
<i>It's recognition
of what we really are.</i>

753
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:05,820
<i>Ghosts.</i>

754
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,824
<i>You do see me.</i>

755
00:36:11,957 --> 00:36:13,611
<i>And I see you.</i>

756
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,666
Goddamn, Tennessee,
why are you so fuckin' hot?

757
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,668
- Go inside.
- And miss Godot?

758
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,148
Gifts for the wallflowers.

759
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:30,889
Okay.

760
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:32,369
- Thank you.
- What's this?

761
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:35,110
- Coffee.
- No, no.

762
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:37,548
What's this? What is...
What's with the, new look?

763
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:40,290
Thank you for this. It's,
It's very generous.

764
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:42,205
No one should have to suffer
cafeteria coffee.

765
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,945
You want a biscuit, biscuit?

766
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,686
- What flavor?
- Split fig.

767
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,212
Excuse me.

768
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:50,778
- It's good.
- Come on, man.

769
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:52,215
You got
a little split fig in you?

770
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:54,608
- Not right now. Really?
- Caught in your throat?

771
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:56,436
- You know what you should do?
- What should I do?

772
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:57,872
You should make a logo
and sell these

773
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,526
to raise money for the team.

774
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:01,398
Don't laugh.

775
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,486
You'd buy some, wouldn't you,
Mr. Miller?

776
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:03,791
- Yeah.
- He doesn't count.

777
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:05,489
I can't resist a cute boy
with a biscuit.

778
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,534
Right?
Winnie could design the logo.

779
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:08,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

780
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:09,754
She's really good
at that stuff.

781
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:11,669
- Really?
- Coach.

782
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,541
Call yourself
the Biscuit Batters.

783
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,021
Winnie and I could help you
get it off the ground.

784
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,631
What's in it for you?

785
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,546
What's in it for me?

786
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:22,375
Well, I mean,
it's pleasure, you know?

787
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:24,159
Connection. 5%.

788
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,816
- I'm the Biscuit Batter.
- No. Once more with pride.

789
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:31,906
- I'm the Biscuit Batter!
- Okay. Okay.

790
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:33,256
I'm the...

791
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:34,648
I'm gonna work on that.

792
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,215
Um, but I'm leaving
before I fucking burn up.

793
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:38,348
- Y'all coming inside?
- You go ahead.

794
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:40,045
All right, suit yourself.

795
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,090
I'll suit myself. See you now.

796
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:52,057
Hi.

797
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,625
Hi.

798
00:37:58,368 --> 00:37:59,369
You're sweet.

799
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,502
When it suits.

800
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:07,420
Please.

801
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,075
Thank you.

802
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:34,317
What did he say
about the outfit?

803
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:36,101
He didn't have
to say anything.

804
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,323
You ready? Can we go?

805
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,150
No. I need to stop
by his class.

806
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,762
Can I watch?

807
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,111
Hi.

808
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,242
Hey.

809
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,331
How are you, kid?

810
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,335
Are you in a hurry?

811
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:53,988
Well, I'm just goin' on
a little,

812
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:57,078
weekend vacation with my wife.

813
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,387
What do writers
do on vacation?

814
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,519
Excuse me.

815
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,565
Um, well,
they pretend to write

816
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:07,088
someplace else, I guess.

817
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:10,614
Can we talk about
the midterm?

818
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:12,093
Sure, what's on your mind?

819
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,921
I want your approval
on my author before I start.

820
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:15,401
Okay. Who is it?

821
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,055
Henry Miller.

822
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,666
Provocative and,...

823
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:22,277
...his structure is very
challenging to emulate.

824
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:24,802
It's not just structural,
though, it's everythin'.

825
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:26,151
You know, his decadence,

826
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,936
his total disregard
for literary etiquette,

827
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,982
his, um,
destruction of convention.

828
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,114
It's...
It's all the good stuff.

829
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,903
- Do you not think I can do it?
- Look,

830
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,732
Miller is public enemy
number one

831
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:42,950
with the censors.

832
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:44,778
I'm not even approved
to teach him.

833
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,520
So?

834
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,351
So, it would be like
a controversial choice.

835
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,965
If it's not controversial,
it's not interestin'.

836
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,968
Okay.

837
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:02,622
Okay, yes?

838
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,668
Okay, I trust you.

839
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,279
Write what you know,
little ghost.

840
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,242
Damn, I gotta go.

841
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,897
Do me a favor.

842
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,160
Have some fun this weekend,
will you?

843
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:20,771
Take a recess.

844
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:23,513
Yeah, I'll rest if you write.

845
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,558
Listen,
I'll see you Monday, okay?

846
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:26,646
Bye, Winnie.

847
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:31,085
Don't do that.

848
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:33,740
Don't look at me like that.

849
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,010
No, I never did that.

850
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,708
Stop.

851
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:48,363
Wait, Winnie, don't...

852
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,801
"Mr. Miller,

853
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:55,240
"I just love the decadence,
and the words

854
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,069
"and breakin' all the rules!"

855
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,462
Okay, enough, enough.

856
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:01,072
You need to get off his desk.

857
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,682
I did not say it like that.

858
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,249
But you meant it
like that.

859
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,120
- No, I didn't.
- You're seducin' him,

860
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:08,296
you floozy.

861
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,168
We make a good double team.

862
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,257
Hi.

863
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,867
Am I interruptin'?

864
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:15,913
- We were just leavin'.
- Where's Jon?

865
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,610
Where's Mr. Miller?

866
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:18,785
He left.

867
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:21,353
Shoot.
While I have you. Cairo.

868
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,094
I think your idea
is fresh to death.

869
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,312
And, Winnie...

870
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,271
- I'd like your help too.
- With what?

871
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,533
Well, can you keep the secret?

872
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,621
Sure can.

873
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:29,753
I bake biscuits.

874
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,058
He's gonna have
the baseball team

875
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:32,407
sell them to raise money.

876
00:41:32,495 --> 00:41:34,453
But Fillmore wants you
to design the logo.

877
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,107
I think that's really cool.

878
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,413
- Really?
- I'd love to help.

879
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:39,763
Cool. All right.

880
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,112
I'll call you guys out
on your lunch period.

881
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,156
We can go over the specs.

882
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:44,028
Hey, um...

883
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:46,421
I think it'd be easier

884
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,554
if you just gave me
your phone.

885
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:51,122
I could text you the specs.

886
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,558
It'd be faster that way.

887
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,908
Okay.

888
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:56,388
Great.

889
00:41:58,608 --> 00:41:59,739
Hey, can you call me?

890
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,049
And now
you'll have Cairo's number.

891
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:06,572
Good.

892
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,532
There is no reception
in here.

893
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:10,707
- Shit.
- Cairo, it's probably

894
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,447
just at the bottom
of your bag.

895
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,275
No, I just had it
a minute ago.

896
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:15,929
Well, it's Friday,

897
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:18,279
and we're still here.

898
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:19,803
So let's a-fucking go.

899

1072
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:06,040
<i>"and choked her

1073
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:07,912
<i>"He would fill her up

1074
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,442
Good morning.

1075
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:07,189
Are you okay?

1076
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:11,845
What's wrong?

1077
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:17,808
Your story.

1078
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:21,855
You didn't like it?

1079
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,512
You have to choose
another author.

1080
00:53:28,993 --> 00:53:30,037
Why?

1081
00:53:31,343 --> 00:53:32,562
This is inappropriate.

1082
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:35,565
"Inappropriate."

1083
00:53:35,652 --> 00:53:36,653
What does that mean?

1084
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,569
Why did you write this?

1085
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:40,918
You asked me to.

1086
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,921
Okay.

1087
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:45,488
Why did you choose
that material?

1088
00:53:45,575 --> 00:53:47,359
You said,
"Write what you know."

1089
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,231
And this is what you know?

1090
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:50,754
This is...

1091
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:53,626
us.

1092
00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:55,324
No.

1093
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,064
This is... This is you.

1094
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,718
I don't...

1095
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:00,329
I don't understand this.

1096
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,026
Are you being serious?

1097
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:04,420
Okay. It's...

1098
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:07,118
It's about two like people
abnegating social convention.

1099
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,426
You know, it's commentary

1100
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,949
on the sexual anesthetization
of a culture

1101
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,299
that's super saturated
with pornography.

1102
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:17,259
It's about the inefficacy
of romantic dogmas

1103
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:19,130
on young people's
expectations.

1104
00:54:20,436 --> 00:54:22,481
It's about
inexorable attraction.

1105
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,180
It's layered.

1106
00:54:26,268 --> 00:54:28,008
- This is pornography.
- Yes.

1107
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,533
So put it in your diary,
not on my fuckin' desk.

1108
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,710
Write a new story
with a new author.

1109
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:38,976
I'm not gonna indulge this.

1110
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:40,760
Are you talking about
the story or us?

1111
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:42,284
Both.

1112
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,898
You already have.
You inspired it.

1113
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,293
I can't accept it.

1114
00:54:53,382 --> 00:54:54,774
But you can't or you won't?

1115
00:54:58,474 --> 00:55:00,258
Because it sounds like
you're scared...

1116
00:55:00,345 --> 00:55:01,390
- Hey. Hey.
- ...and it looks like

1117
00:55:01,477 --> 00:55:02,652
you're measurin'.

1118
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:06,351
Stop talking to me
like a stranger,

1119
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:08,048
- and say what you mean.
- Rewrite it.

1120
00:55:08,135 --> 00:55:09,136
Why?

1121
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,661
- You know why.
- Tell me.

1122
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:13,271
- Say it.
- If you don't rewrite this,

1123
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:14,533
I'll have to fail you
for the midterm.

1124
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,926
- Tell me why.
- I don't have to tell you

1125
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:17,057
a goddamn thing.

1126
00:55:21,975 --> 00:55:23,455
It made you feel something
that scared you.

1127
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:25,414
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- Then say them yourself.

1128
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,894
Tell me what it made you feel.

1129
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:30,810
Incredibly foolish

1130
00:55:30,897 --> 00:55:33,726
for havin' trusted
this material to a child.

1131
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,078
What was I before you read it?

1132
00:55:48,524 --> 00:55:49,916
A student.

1133
00:55:52,528 --> 00:55:53,572
You built the world.

1134
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:58,316
You built the fantasy,
not on the page,

1135
00:55:58,403 --> 00:55:59,796
but in real life.

1136
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,061
You can't blur the lines

1137
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:05,279
and then expect me to see
a boundary

1138
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,368
when I suddenly cross it.

1139
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,330
Let me be very, very clear...

1140
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:15,420
...with you.

1141
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,511
You're my student.

1142
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:21,948
And I'm your teacher.

1143
00:56:24,037 --> 00:56:25,082
That's all.

1144
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,216
Any misconception of that
is something,

1145
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,436
regrettably, that you have
to shoulder...

1146
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:33,917
alone.

1147
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:09,431
"Write what you know"
is what you said.

1148
00:57:11,476 --> 00:57:13,260
Yeah, I know what I said.

1149
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,001
You don't know anything
you say.

1150
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,445
This is good.

1151
00:57:25,011 --> 00:57:26,012
And you know it is.

1152
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,757
So, let's examine
the real issue.

1153
00:57:35,065 --> 00:57:36,196
It's not my writing.

1154
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:40,331
It's yours.

1155
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:44,074
Good try.

1156
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:47,730
You thought you were
gonna be hot shit, didn't you?

1157
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:49,079
What?

1158
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,168
You thought that
you were gonna be somebody.

1159
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:53,910
Right?

1160
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:00,090
"Overreaching
without ambition."

1161
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,271
Do you know what that means?

1162
00:58:11,884 --> 00:58:13,930
It means you weren't brave
enough to be better.

1163
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:19,022
Means
you're deliberately impotent.

1164
00:58:22,634 --> 00:58:25,637
It means that you,
Jonathan Miller...

1165
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,336
are mediocre.

1166
00:58:34,516 --> 00:58:35,560
You wanna fail me?

1167
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:39,172
I fucking dare you.

1168
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,003
But you better make it mean
somethin' to you.

1169
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,703
And you better know
what it means.

1170
00:58:50,096 --> 00:58:52,185
Because the cost is very high,
Mr. Miller.

1171
00:58:54,623 --> 00:58:57,539
And if you're not very,
very careful

1172
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,196
this banality, this falsity
that you wallow in,

1173
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:07,766
it will devour you
until you are as small

1174
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:08,941
as you pretend to be.

1175
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:14,294
And you will disappear.

1176
00:59:18,777 --> 00:59:20,300
And no one will pay
any more thought to you

1177
00:59:20,387 --> 00:59:22,041
than they do an unread
cookie fortune.

1178
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:35,054
How disappointin' you must be

1179
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:36,708
to those who had believed
you'd be more.

1180
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:46,457
No wonder you're here.

1181
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,607
<i>Heartbreak is
a slow-motion car crash</i>

1182
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:07,434
<i>set to Mozart.</i>

1183
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,176
<i>You know the one.</i> The Requiem.

1184
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,314
<i>It tastes like graveyard dirt.</i>

1185
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,495
<i>It smells
like burnin' flowers.</i>

1186
01:00:29,848 --> 01:00:31,371
<i>It feels like violence.</i>

1187
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,233
How you doin', Professor?

1188
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,322
Had a bad day.

1189
01:01:21,465 --> 01:01:23,859
- You want a drink?
- Thank you.

1190
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:31,867
What?
So, he was offended?

1191
01:01:33,216 --> 01:01:34,260
He was affected.

1192
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,699
Are you still into him?

1193
01:01:43,922 --> 01:01:44,967
He's a pretender.

1194
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:50,363
You know, at least what

1195
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,582
you see with Boris
is what you get.

1196
01:01:51,669 --> 01:01:54,063
You know,
Jonathan Miller is like...

1197
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:59,068
He's like
fuckin' imitation crab

1198
01:01:59,155 --> 01:02:00,460
and gas station sushi.

1199
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,422
Aren't you in love with him?

1200
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,737
What happened?

1201
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,527
I had
a very unpleasant conversation

1202
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,224
with a student about
the midterm assignment.

1203
01:02:26,312 --> 01:02:27,400
Was it with her?

1204
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:29,489
Your acolyte?

1205
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,756
She drafted something

1206
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:38,194
to make Henry Miller
look like Dr. Seuss.

1207
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,413
Well, you let a teenager
run with Miller,

1208
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,111
and you're surprised
it's vulgar?

1209
01:02:42,198 --> 01:02:44,809
She was supposed to use
his literary structure,

1210
01:02:44,896 --> 01:02:46,289
not his subject matter.

1211
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,510
What's the subject matter?

1212
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:52,121
An English teacher
and a student

1213
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:56,038
who have an illicit affair
complete with "pre-cum"

1214
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,430
and "cherry popping."

1215
01:02:57,517 --> 01:02:59,258
Those words exactly.

1216
01:02:59,345 --> 01:03:00,825
Show me right now.

1217
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:03,306
Don't...

1218
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:06,788
Come on.
Tell me what shocked you.

1219
01:03:10,356 --> 01:03:11,575
You fuck Fillmore yet?

1220
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:16,362
You know when
I'm in my luteal phase,

1221
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:17,886
I tell you everything.

1222
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:26,329
<i>"For Jonathan.</i>

1223
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,157
"Love, Cairo."

1224
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:33,684
Baby, it's a love letter.

1225
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:35,599
She's got it bad.

1226
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,427
Tell me how she describes you.

1227
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,081
- You can read it right there.
- No.

1228
01:03:39,168 --> 01:03:41,170
You tell me.

1229
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:44,651
Because I know that
you remember it word for word.

1230
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,698
And I want you
to do the thing.

1231
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:48,830
No. No.

1232
01:03:51,397 --> 01:03:52,398
Tell me.

1233
01:03:58,274 --> 01:03:59,841

01:04:43,928 --> 01:04:47,889
"All cunts were created equal

1249
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,109
"and magnificent in his mind."

1250
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,374
Are they?

1251
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,901
Are all cunts equal?

1252
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,034
Or are some cunts...

1253
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,647
remarkable?

1254
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:10,215
Come on, you're, you're,
you're drunk.

1255
01:05:10,302 --> 01:05:12,043
I'm indecent.

1256
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:19,703
Yeah, tell him

1257
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,834
you're drunk textin' him.

1258
01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:23,533
That way,
he'll imagine you drunk,

1259
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,187
and what
you might be doin' drunkenly.

1260
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:26,884
Serious?

1261
01:05:27,885 --> 01:05:29,060
Ask him what he's up to.

1262
01:05:34,936 --> 01:05:36,676
We've got company.

1263
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:38,461
- They what?
- Hey, seriously.

1264
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:40,289
Stop leaving
this door unlocked.

1265
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,161
For your own safety, okay?

1266
01:05:43,248 --> 01:05:44,510
Hello.

1267
01:05:48,297 --> 01:05:49,951
Get a room!

1268
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:51,387
What up, player?

1269
01:05:51,474 --> 01:05:53,302
- Slang? Get out.
- Fuck.

1270
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:54,999
Do you think he likes me?

1271
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,221
Well, do you wanna be liked,
or do you wanna be fucked?

1272
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,270
'Cause those are very
different things

1273
01:06:05,357 --> 01:06:06,445
for girls who look like you.

1274
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,709
I want both.

1275
01:06:20,633 --> 01:06:21,983
You should tell him
you're with me.

1276
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:26,944
And that we're doing
what all girls do

1277
01:06:27,031 --> 01:06:28,076
when they're alone at night.

1278
01:06:29,512 --> 01:06:30,817
Who is she?

1279
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:31,993
Not telling.

1280
01:06:36,388 --> 01:06:41,393
"We are measuring
the depths of our sexuality

1281
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,483
"within the safe confines
of our friendship."

1282
01:06:45,745 --> 01:06:47,399
Why are you so mean?

1283
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,661
- Goddamn.
- Can I help it

1284
01:06:48,748 --> 01:06:50,098
if every girl
you've ever dated

1285
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:51,969
owned a pair
of five-inch Lucite heels

1286
01:06:52,056 --> 01:06:53,275
and was named after
a character

1287
01:06:53,362 --> 01:06:54,711
in <i>The Baby-Sitters Club?</i>

1288
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:56,017
- No, I can't.
- No. You can't.

1289
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:57,975
But you know what?
Your life, your choice.

1290
01:06:58,062 --> 01:06:59,498
Yeah, you bein' a snob.

1291
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:01,544
You and I know
Kristy was great.

1292
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:03,285
He hasn't said anything?

1293
01:07:08,768 --> 01:07:11,249
Well, he said,
"Go to bed."

1294
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:12,555
So...

1295
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:21,433
Take off your shirt.

1296
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:26,960
What?

1297
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:29,137
- Why?
- We are gonna make out.

1298
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:31,530
For him, not for you.

1299
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:36,622
Well, it can be
a little for me.

1300
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:48,069
How is this?

1301
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,073
Yeah, good.

1302
01:07:56,903 --> 01:07:57,948
Your turn.

1303
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:09,525
Here ya go.

1304
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,619
Be a little closer
when I take this photo.

1305
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,926
Not like that. What, are you
a fucking Dutch clock?

1306
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,058
I meant like this.

1307
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:24,192
Close.

1308
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:38,728

You got a title yet?

1324
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:21,744
<i>Lesser Expectations

1325
01:10:27,576 --> 01:10:28,794
I mean, I don't know.

1326
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:31,101
Hi, Joyce.

1327
01:10:31,188 --> 01:10:32,494
Another beer?

1328
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:34,191
No, I should go.

1329
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:35,236
- I should get outta here.
- Come on.

1330
01:10:35,323 --> 01:10:36,672
- Don't be boring.
- No. No.

1331
01:10:36,759 --> 01:10:40,197
I got 45 pop quizzes
on thermodynamics

1332
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,112
to fail.

1333
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:43,940
And we haven't even gotten
to fractals yet.

1334
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:45,507
Goddamn hopeless youth
of America.

1335
01:10:45,594 --> 01:10:47,160
Well, you're the one
who wanted

1336
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:48,684
to make a difference, remember?

1337
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:50,555
Hey, fools rush in.

1338
01:10:50,642 --> 01:10:52,427
- Where's Jonathan?
- Tithing.

1339
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,776
All right, well, look,
tell him I had to run.

1340
01:10:53,863 --> 01:10:55,081
Bye, kiddo.

1341
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,213
Bye.

1342
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:03,786
Joyce got the story.

1343
01:11:06,354 --> 01:11:07,659
What?

1344
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:11,315
Well, it had a "For Jonathan.
Love, Cairo..."

1345
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:15,232
...written at
the top, so, you know...

1346
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:17,321
there's no mistakin'.

1347
01:11:17,408 --> 01:11:19,105
And she'd like to speak
to me formally

1348
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,412
about the necessary paperwork.

1349
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:24,285
Paperwork for what?

1350
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,983
An incident report.

1351
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:30,247
I think she did it.

1352
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:33,424
Who did what?

1353
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:36,645
Cairo. Cairo turned it in.

1354
01:11:39,517 --> 01:11:42,303
It's a short story, Jonathan.

1355
01:11:43,478 --> 01:11:46,872
It's not
<i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>

1356
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:48,221
I know.

1357
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,010
But, yeah, but,
it's the...

1358
01:11:55,098 --> 01:11:56,404
it's the implication.

1359
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:59,537
Why if she can convince them

1360
01:11:59,624 --> 01:12:01,887
that somethin' happened
between us, then...

1361
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,326
Well, I could lose my job.

1362
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:11,462
That's not all you could lose.

1363
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,955
Did somethin' happen
between you?

1364
01:12:28,174 --> 01:12:29,306
Nothin' I invited.

1365
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:35,007
Teenage girls are dangerous,
Jonathan.

1366
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,271
They're full
of emotional violence

1367
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:40,752
and vituperation.

1368
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,974
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1369
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:34,763
Have you seen Cairo?

1370
01:13:37,069 --> 01:13:39,115
- I haven't.
- I haven't seen her.

1371
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:40,508
And I just thought...

1372
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,686
- maybe you had.
- I haven't. No.

1373
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:51,736
- You don't text?
- She tell you we do?

1374
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:54,696
Well, you know...

1375
01:13:56,741 --> 01:14:00,571
Cairo says everything...

1376
01:14:04,096 --> 01:14:05,141
And nothing.

1377
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:14,193
I don't understand
what's happening.

1378
01:14:18,589 --> 01:14:19,634
Don't you, Winnie?

1379
01:14:44,006 --> 01:14:46,835
How did it start?
In your own words.

1380
01:14:46,922 --> 01:14:48,706
We recognized each other.

1381
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,317
She's exceptionally talented.

1382
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,625
She's singular in that
at this school.

1383
01:14:54,712 --> 01:14:56,409
Did you exhibit favoritism?

1384
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:58,629
- Give special mentorship?
- Of course.

1385
01:14:58,716 --> 01:14:59,804
He was excited to give me

1386
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:01,545
the midterm assignment
in advance.

1387
01:15:01,632 --> 01:15:03,634
And the midterm is what
percentage of the final grade?

1388
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:04,896
It's 25%.

1389
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,159
Enough to destroy my GPA.

1390
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:08,509
<i>You do know
that Henry Miller</i>

1391
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:09,640
<i>is not an approved author</i>

1392
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:10,946
<i>for public school study,
right?</i>

1393
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,252
She's better than
the curriculum, Joyce.

1394
01:15:13,339 --> 01:15:14,471
You know that.

1395
01:15:14,558 --> 01:15:16,255
I wanted to help her
stand out.

1396
01:15:16,342 --> 01:15:18,649
I think he was impressed
I knew who he was.

1397
01:15:20,477 --> 01:15:22,174
Have you read his work?

1398
01:15:22,261 --> 01:15:23,698
How often have you
been together

1399
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,787
beyond the classroom?

1400
01:15:25,874 --> 01:15:27,397
We would see each other
before school,

1401
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:31,096
in class, of course,
and sometimes after.

1402
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:33,708
And what would you do?

1403
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,318
We would talk about literature

1404
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,581
and things that
we cared about.

1405
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:40,845
Sometimes we'd share
a cigarette.

1406
01:15:40,932 --> 01:15:44,675
We happened to be smoking
in the same place one time.

1407
01:15:44,762 --> 01:15:45,763
And that, well, that...

1408
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,373
That's how it started,
I guess.

1409
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,853
Not...

1410
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,726
I mean, that is how
we started smokin' together.

1411
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:55,381
Do you see each other
socially?

1412
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,905
Absolutely not.

1413
01:15:56,992 --> 01:15:59,342
We went to
a poetry reading together.

1414
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,039
Would you consider
yourself friends?

1415
01:16:01,126 --> 01:16:02,258
Without question.

1416
01:16:02,737 --> 01:16:05,435
We are as close,

1417
01:16:05,522 --> 01:16:09,395
as is appropriate
for a student and a teacher.

1418
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,832
Have you ever been
alone together

1419
01:16:10,919 --> 01:16:12,181
outside of school?

1420
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:13,835
Only a couple of times.

1421
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:15,924
Y... Yes, sort of.

1422
01:16:16,011 --> 01:16:19,797
I mistakenly left
with her phone

1423
01:16:19,884 --> 01:16:22,800
from the classroom,
and I returned it to her,

1424
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:27,152
before my wife and I
went on a business trip

1425
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:28,284
to Nashville.

1426
01:16:28,371 --> 01:16:29,807
We didn't actually go,

1427
01:16:29,894 --> 01:16:33,158
but, you know,
we were going to go.

1428
01:16:34,899 --> 01:16:36,074
He came to my house.

1429
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:38,120
Were you alone?

1430
01:16:41,645 --> 01:16:42,646
Yes.

1431
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,083
My parents were out of town.

1432
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,563
What happened?

1433
01:16:48,696 --> 01:16:49,871
Why?
She say somethin' happened?

1434
01:16:54,005 --> 01:16:55,616
Nothin' that didn't seem okay
at the time.

1435
01:16:57,574 --> 01:16:58,749
I returned her phone.

1436
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:00,316
Did you go inside the house?

1437
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,148
I didn't touch her, okay?
Um...

1438
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:08,672
When she sent the story,

1439
01:17:08,759 --> 01:17:10,761
I told her it was not
appropriate for school.

1440
01:17:19,988 --> 01:17:21,859
I'm gettin' the impression
there's nothin' I can say,

1441
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,559
to defend my position here.

1442
01:17:28,866 --> 01:17:30,128
'Cause there isn't.

1443
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:41,444
Jonathan...

1444
01:17:43,446 --> 01:17:44,708
are you in love with her?

1445
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:50,409
Fuck Almighty. Are you?

1446
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,542
It's not about my feelings.

1447
01:17:55,066 --> 01:17:56,677
It's what she implies.

1448
01:17:56,764 --> 01:17:58,417
And you know I could get
crucified for this...

1449
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:00,681
- Fuck me.
- ...while you're sittin' there

1450
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,204
swiping through pictures

1451
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,640
- of naked students.
- He's so smart, everybody.

1452
01:18:03,727 --> 01:18:04,815
That's why I deleted it.

1453
01:18:04,902 --> 01:18:05,903
You deleted it.

1454
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,470
- Good.
- No. No.

1455
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,167
Well, as soon
as you delete somethin',

1456
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:11,343
of course, it means
it's really deleted, right?

1457
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,954
- Come on. Jesus.
- I'm shakin'

1458
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,303
in my fuckin' boots.

1459
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,608
You know the difference
between you and me?

1460
01:18:16,784 --> 01:18:19,308
You cannot identify the line.

1461
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:21,658
So, you cross it.

1462
01:18:22,224 --> 01:18:23,573
Right.

1463
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:25,227
That's why
you're sittin' here scared,

1464
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,012
defensive.

1465
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:30,188
You are the adult.
Show some responsibility.

1466
01:18:30,275 --> 01:18:31,276
You can't be serious.

1467
01:18:31,363 --> 01:18:33,148
- Like you?
- Yes.

1468
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:34,932
I know where the line is,
Jonathan.

1469
01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:36,586
I don't cross it.

1470
01:18:36,673 --> 01:18:38,544
You see, knowin' the line
is knowin' the risk.

1471
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,419
You tryin' to make me
your collateral damage.

1472
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:44,812
You don't know... Man,

1473
01:18:44,899 --> 01:18:46,509
you think
you're my collateral damage?

1474
01:18:48,685 --> 01:18:51,601
- All right, man. Just go, man.
- All right. No, no.

1475
01:18:51,688 --> 01:18:53,821
- Yeah, all right. I will.
- All right, yeah.

1476
01:18:53,908 --> 01:18:55,561
Cool, bro. - Thanks for your help.

1477
01:18:56,171 --> 01:18:57,172
Appreciate that.

1478
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,796
I've been suspended.

1479
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:18,933
Did you fuck her?

1480
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,891
No.

1481
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:22,763
Then what happened?

1482
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,070
She impressed me.
I gave her preference.

1483
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:29,247
She handed in the story,

1484
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:31,249
which I obviously
could not accept.

1485
01:19:31,336 --> 01:19:33,251
Her feelings got hurt,
and she lashed out.

1486
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:35,123
That's how I understand it.

1487
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,472
So you flirted with her,

1488
01:19:36,559 --> 01:19:37,734
- and then, you rejected her.
- No,

1489
01:19:37,821 --> 01:19:38,779
- it wasn't flirting.
- What was it then?

1490
01:19:38,866 --> 01:19:40,215
It was affection!

1491
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,393
Well, are you
attracted to her?

1492
01:19:48,963 --> 01:19:49,964
I'll tell you.

1493
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,838
This is about a girl
who flattered you,

1494
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:56,535
who read your little book,

1495
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:58,886
and your inevitable surrender
to adulation.

1496
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:01,584
You fucking fell for it.

1497
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,934
Finally. Finally!

1498
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:07,111
Someone gave your reductive
short stories a second glance.

1499
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:08,983
And you can't help
but get hard for it

1500
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,419
because, what, now suddenly

1501
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,029
you feel worth somethin',
is that it?

1502
01:20:12,116 --> 01:20:13,161
Yes!

1503
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:16,338
She made me feel
worth something.

1504
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:17,513
What does that tell you?

1505
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:23,388
Was it her sycophancy
that got you hard?

1506
01:20:23,475 --> 01:20:25,782
Or was it the smell
of teen spirit?

1507
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:27,566
- Fuck you.
- Be my guest.

1508
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:29,830
Stop.

1509
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:31,614
- Did you?
- No, I didn't fuck her.

1510
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:32,833
Why do you look so guilty?

1511
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,008
I haven't done anything wrong.

1512
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:37,185
Didn't you?

1513
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,495
God, I'm in hell.

1514
01:20:43,582 --> 01:20:46,063
Well, make yourself at home.

1515
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:47,804
Why are you so punishing?

1516
01:20:47,891 --> 01:20:49,588
You wanted her.

1517
01:20:49,675 --> 01:20:51,547
I can read it all
in your face.

1518
01:20:51,634 --> 01:20:52,896
How can you see anything
in this state,

1519
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:54,506
you fuckin' alcoholic?

1520
01:20:56,378 --> 01:20:58,771
It's the only thing
that makes you bearable, baby.

1521
01:21:00,512 --> 01:21:01,687
You are a cunt.

1522
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,254
And you're a liar.

1523
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,126
Liar!

1524
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,391
You're the banner boy
for mediocrity,

1525
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:11,872
waving your flag
of spotless virtue

1526
01:21:11,959 --> 01:21:15,092
like some middling
American hero.

1527
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:17,225
But, Jon, baby...

1528
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:20,445
you're the villain.

1529
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:27,452
But you can't even see that,
can you?

1530
01:21:42,554 --> 01:21:43,991
Don't you worry for me at all?

1531
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:47,559
What would I possibly
worry about

1532
01:21:47,646 --> 01:21:49,039
other than dying of boredom

1533
01:21:49,126 --> 01:21:51,433
having to listen to
your inventions of conflict?

1534
01:21:54,218 --> 01:21:55,219
You...

1535
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,178
are...

1536
01:21:58,788 --> 01:21:59,832
vile.

1537
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,058
Why don't you write about it?

1538
01:22:35,346 --> 01:22:36,521
Spit it out, Winnie.

1539
01:22:38,088 --> 01:22:39,263
What are you doing?

1540
01:22:41,135 --> 01:22:42,745
I'm completing
my admissions essay.

1541
01:22:44,921 --> 01:22:46,444
Is that all?

1542
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:47,837
Well, I'm smokin' a cigarette,

1543
01:22:49,317 --> 01:22:51,362
if you wish to be
very literal.

1544
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:53,495
What are you doin'
to Mr. Miller?

1545
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:06,595
I'm testifyin' against him
in front of the school board.

1546
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:08,771
- Why?
- He underestimated me.

1547
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:11,165
I overestimated him.

1548
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:13,428
Are you okay?

1549
01:23:13,515 --> 01:23:14,646
I'm inspired.

1550
01:23:16,822 --> 01:23:18,520
- That's not funny.
- It is.

1551
01:23:19,347 --> 01:23:20,783
A little.

1552
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,568
- Please don't do this.
- Why?

1553
01:23:25,744 --> 01:23:27,485
You're gonna ruin his life.

1554
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:29,226
And for what?

1555
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:35,058
To avenge your rejection?

1556
01:23:37,713 --> 01:23:38,975
To punish him?

1557
01:23:41,325 --> 01:23:43,414
Because
he didn't wanna fuck you?

1558
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,373
He wanted to fuck me, Winnie.

1559
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,114
Yes.

1560
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,119
But he didn't leave his wife
for you.

1561
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:57,472
I'll testify against you.

1562
01:23:57,559 --> 01:23:58,603
No, you won't.

1563
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:01,954
Excuse me?

1564
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,305
I'll show them the evidence
I have against you and Boris.

1565
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,917
And not only will your
credibility be shot to shit,

1566
01:24:08,004 --> 01:24:09,397
but you'll incriminate him
as well.

1567
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,576
Two teachers
can lose their jobs.

1568
01:24:18,406 --> 01:24:20,103
Hey,
maybe we can double team.

1569
01:24:21,104 --> 01:24:22,758
You played me.

1570
01:24:22,845 --> 01:24:24,194
You knew what we were doing.

1571
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,153
This is not what I meant.

1572
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,284
Isn't it, though?

1573
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:35,597
Didn't I play it out
exactly like you imagined?

1574
01:24:35,684 --> 01:24:38,078
This isn't a fucking game,
Cairo.

1575
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:40,906
You're right.

1576
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:47,522
This is, to date,

1577
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,569
my greatest achievement.

1578
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,021
"In the end,

1579
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,678
