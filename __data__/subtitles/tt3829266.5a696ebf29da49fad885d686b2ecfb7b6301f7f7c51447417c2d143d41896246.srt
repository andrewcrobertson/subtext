00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,881
(electricity sparking)

2
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,970
(predator clicking)

3
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,913
(crackling)

4
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,711
(insects trilling)

5
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,194
HAINES (on radio):
Picket One, copy.

6
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,779
Do you got eyes
on the hostages?

7
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,364
Still negative.

8
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,908
DUPREE (on radio): 20 bucks
says they don't show.

9
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,868
You two morons
really making bets

10
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,663
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

11
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,622
DUPREE: Abso-fucking-lutely.

12
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,123
HAINES: I believe
that was implied. Yeah.

13
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,917
Just checking. I'm in for 20.

14
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,020
(indistinct chatter)

15
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,313
QUINN: I got two hostages.

16
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,444
No crosswind.

17
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,906
I'm not waiting. 10-50, out.

18
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,204
(spaceship whirring)

19
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,085
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

20
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,015
(grunting)

21
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,189
(yells, grunts)

22
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,033
(grunts)

23
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,744
(radio beeps)

24
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,579
Bluebill Two,
are you out there?

25
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,247
Over.

26
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,390
(engine slowly powering down)

27
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,021
-(rustling)
-(gasps)

28
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,732
Goddamn it!

29
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,194
Dupree, Jesus!

30
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,155
(pants) Where's Haines?

31
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,949
Don't know.
Comm's not fucking working.

32
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,118
Give me the pack.

33
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,916
It's evidence.

34
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,835
Ain't nobody
gonna believe this one.

35
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,717
The fuck is that, Cap?

36
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,220
It's above our pay grade.

37
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,557
-(radio beeps)
-Haines! Come in. Over.

38
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,184
(grunts)

39
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,688
Haines, goddamn it,
come in. Over! (echoes)

40
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,649
(clicking sound)

41
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,734
Sir?

42
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,903
(quiet crackling)

43
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,571
PREDATOR (distorted voice):
The fuck is that, Cap?

44
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,697
The fuck is that, Cap?

45
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,199
Comm's not fucking working.

46
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,621
-(birds squawking)
-(gasps)

47
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,667
Haines?

48
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,922
Light it up!

49
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,882
(gun firing)

50
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,430
(groaning)

51
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,226
(groans)

52
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,731
(quiet warbling)

53
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,693
(predator growls)

54
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,364
(grunting)

55
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,812
(growls)

56
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,147
(grunts)

57
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,740
(helicopter whirring)

58
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,208
(whirring)

59
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,386
(panting)

60
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,355
(indistinct radio chatter)

61
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,743
Gentlemen, remember...

62
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,828
they're large, they're fast,

63
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,247
and fucking you up's
their idea of tourism!

64
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,041
Go!

65
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,834
SOLDIER: Eyes up! Come on!

66
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,462
I want the passenger.
I want the pod.

67
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,421
If it's not from here...

68
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,672
-You want it.
-...I want it.

69
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,726
(mariachi music playing)

70
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,809
(clears throat)

71
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,442
(speaks Spanish)

72
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,200
(in English) I need help.

73
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,952
And I have money.

74
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,371
(speaks Spanish) Why should I
help a man with a gun, eh?

75
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,457
(in English) All right.

76
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,511
(gasps)

77
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,561
I need you
to mail this for me.

78
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,521
You send it to this address.

79
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,732
Mail what's in the pack,
not the backpack.

80
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,317
Ahora. Go!

81
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,074
(sirens blaring in distance)

82
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,493
Okay.

83
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,793
-(thudding)
-(cops shouting indistinctly)

84
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,086
COP: Back up!

85
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,130
GIRL: It was so amazing!

86
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,464
Yeah, it was.

87
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:52,843
Bye, Mom!

88
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,160
(exclaims)

89
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,332
-(laughs) Do it, man.
-No, you do it.

90
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,416
Okay.

91
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,752
-Do it.
-(both laughing)

92
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,420
(alarm blaring)

93
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,216
(alarm continues blaring)

94
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,092
(whimpering)

95
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,474
(continues whimpering)

96
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,934
(both laughing)

97
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,520
Oh, shit.

98
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,148
Looky, looky, loo.

99
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,775
Hey, EJ, you hungry?

100
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,277
I'm hungry for an ass-burger.

101
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,695
Mmm. Sounds delicious.

102
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,198
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

103
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,325
-EJ: Oh, yeah.
-(whimpering)

104
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,745
The hell are you doing?

105
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,040
-DEREK: He's a goner.
-All right.

106
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,553
-(dog barking)
-(gasps)

107
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,518
(door closes)

108
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,988
(doorbell rings)

109
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:24,953
Hi, there.

110
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,372
Does, uh, Quinn McKenna
live here?

111
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,626
His post office box payments
are past due.

112
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,712
Department of Defense.

113
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,048
He works for the government,
does he?

114
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,593
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

115
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,929
Military designation.

116
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,556
-Ah.
-He kills people...

117
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,476
so you can be a mailman.

118
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,610
(dogs barking)

119
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,199
Dr. Brackett?

120
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,251
I understand
you enjoy stargazing?

121
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,547
My men
will take care of your dog.

122
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,756
Will you come with me, please?

123
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,519
What am I looking at?

124
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,314
It's exactly
what you think it is. Yeah.

125
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,569
They've been here before.

126
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,779
'87. '97.

127
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,535
Lately, the visits
are increasing in frequency.

128
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,382
EMILY: Rory, I'm home!
Hey, I got you something.

129
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,593
Hey.

130
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,098
Did you do
one of these after school?

131
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,725
I did all of them.

132
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,102
Oh. Okay.

133
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,064
Well, I got you two options.

134
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,400
We have...

135
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,195
pirate, or...

136
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,698
Frankenstein.

137
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,952
Frankenstein,
you know, green skin?

138
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,371
Threw a girl
to see if she would float?

139
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,625
No. Okay.

140
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,877
Well, let's go with pirate.
Yeah?

141
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,545
This is dumb.

142
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,632
The guys will...

143
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,051
They will still
be able to see.

144
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,470
See what?

145
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,472
That it's me.

146
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,143
PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once
quoted as saying,

147
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,229
"I dropped
from my mother's womb...

148
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,231
I hit the floor...

149
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,024
and I started crawling

150
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,527
through hostile territory
toward my grave."

151
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,403
(laughing)

152
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,821
QUINN: About right, yeah.

153
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,907
-That's badass.
-It's pretty morbid.

154
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,033
It's pretty dark.

155
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,578
What's with the polygraph?

156
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,913
I thought
this was a psych eval.

157
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,374
We need to know
if you pose a threat.

158
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,583
Oh, I'm a sniper.

159
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,503
Isn't posing a threat
kind of the fucking point?

160
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,382
You spend most of your time
now in-country...

161
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,759
estranged from your wife
and son?

162
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,347
(sighs)

163
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,100
Look, I get it.

164
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:37,020
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

165
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:37,938
Excuse me?

166
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,691
You're not here
to find out if I'm crazy.

167
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,443
You wanna make sure
the label sticks.

168
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,945
So, you feel
you're being railroaded?

169
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,489
I can see the tracks
on the floor!

170
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,909
I don't see tracks
on the floor, for the record.

171
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,870
You feel
like you're a stranger

172
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,329
on your own planet,
don't you, Captain?

173
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,166
Like an alien, you mean?

174
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,088
That's what you wanted.

175
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,884
Do I get a cookie now?

176
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,802
He saw something.

177
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:09,928
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

178
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,934
Wow!

179
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,696
Ow.

180
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,123
(beeps)

181
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,637
(device trilling)

182
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,435
(exhales deeply)

183
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,981
You shove me again,
I'm gonna break your neck.

184
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,149
Did I say that out loud?

185
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,114
-(Quinn clears throat)
-McKenna.

186
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,118
OFFICER: Last one.

187
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,661
Thanks for your kindness.
Thank you.

188
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,626
(sighs)

189
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,130
(keys jangling)

190
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,471
Oh, yeah?

191
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,309
(Baxley mumbles)

192
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,061
(clicks and sniffs)

193
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,189
You all right over there?

194
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,065
No, don't worry about him.
He's just got Tourettes.

195
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,067
-He can't control it.
-Fuck you, Coyle.

196
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,527
You get used to it, bro.

197
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,492
Welcome to Group Two.

198
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,952
Oh, yeah? What's that?

199
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,120
Like a unit?

200
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,788
No, group. Group Two.

201
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,749
Group therapy, room two.

202
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,168
Oh.

203
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,878
-McKenna.
-Nebraska Williams.

204
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,046
That's your real name?

205
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,255
Gaylord.

206
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,132
-That's a good call, then.
-Yeah, I thought so.

207
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,675
(chuckles)

208
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,010
Where did you serve?

209
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,513
Operation
Enduring Freedom, '03.

210
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,849
Went for the Taliban,
stayed for the opium.

211
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,935
(laughing)

212
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,231
That's Coyle.
Friendly fire incident.

213
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,192
Got turned around, fired
at one of his own vehicles.

214
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,653
Now, he tells jokes.

215
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,820
(Coyle clears throat)

216
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,989
-(thuds)
-(grunts) That's Lynch.

217
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,534
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

218
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,410
Entropy.

219
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,454
That's my game.

220
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,706
Things like to fall apart

221
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,792
and I... make it happen.

222
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,795
Just... Just like that.

223
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,089
-(gasping)
-Ooh! Wow! Oh.

224
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,967
-Hey.
-Hey. Don't.

225
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:37,970
Don't.

226
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,471
That's Nettles.

227
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,890
(stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.

228
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,017
Did three tours flying Hueys.

229
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,311
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?

230
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,980
Is it end times yet?

231
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,481
Yeah, laugh all you want.

232
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,525
But when you're standing at
attention before your Maker...

233
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,569
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

234
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,320
-(whistles)
-(laughter)

235
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,905
God makes shitty people.

236
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,657
Yeah.

237
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,951
I mean, why do you think
people make war?

238
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,452
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?

239
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,872
-Come on, Baxley!
-Because fuck-cock-cock!

240
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,874
-Because we fuck cock-cock?
-Yes, we fuck cocks.

241
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,166
That's it,
because we fuck cocks,

242
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,501
that's why. We get upset.

243
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,087
How'd you snag a ticket
on this shitmobile?

244
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,256
Put a bullet in a CO.

245
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,758
Any particular reason?

246
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,720
He was an asshole.

247
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,161
Keep your head down.

248
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,795
Here, throw this on.

249
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,052
(bell rings)

250
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,931
Is it just your imagination?

251
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,434
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

252
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,229
Every fucking time?

253
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,523
(elevator dings)

254
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,733
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your attention, please.

255
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,362
The GRC meeting has been moved
to section 3, room A.

256
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,489
Aha! There you are!

257
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,326
Welcome.
I'm Sean Keyes.

258
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,954
Wow. I heard you basically
wrote the book

259
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,413
on evolutionary biology.

260
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,123
Um, I'm sorry, can I just...

261
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,500
Is that...?

262
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,754
Oh, my God!

263
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,800
(chuckles nervously)
Holy shit.

264
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,844
That's alien technology.

265
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,806
This is what
you brought me here to see?

266
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,183
KEYES: Well, yeah.

267
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,520
Can I... Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

268
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:52,896
Doc.

269
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,857
Let's go.

270
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,984
(indistinct PA announcement)

271
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,329
-TRAEGER: Everything good?
-Yes, sir.

272
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,748
TRAEGER: What is it?

273
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,835
Dr. Brackett.

274
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,171
Would you like
to meet a Predator?

275
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,298
(chuckles) Come on.

276
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,224
WOMAN (on PA):
Please observe

277
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,059
decontamination protocol.

278
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,687
KEYES: So, how'd they
rope you into this?

279
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,273
I wrote a letter to
the president when I was six.

280
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:37,691
Told him how much
I loved animals,

281
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,276
and that if NASA
ever found a space animal,

282
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,777
they should call me.

283
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,864
Couple years ago,
I was put on a short list

284
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,657
for a paper
I wrote on hybrid strains.

285
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,328
Computer cross-referenced
the letter, and... here I am.

286
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,456
(machine whirring)

287
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,253
Dr. Brackett.

288
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,797
Thanks for coming.

289
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,132
I'm sure you have questions.

290
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,968
-Oh. Just two, actually.
-Okay.

291
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:06,929
Why do you call it
"the Predator"?

292
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,181
It's a nickname.

293
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,684
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.

294
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,269
Exploits weakness.

295
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,979
Seems to...

296
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,648
well, enjoy it.

297
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,274
Like a game.

298
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,276
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.

299
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,194
Sorry?

300
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,738
A predator
kills its prey to survive.

301
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,617
I mean, what you're describing
is more like a bass fisherman.

302
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,619
Well, we took a vote.
Predator's cooler, right?

303
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,538
-SAPIR: Fuck yeah.
-Fuck yeah.

304
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,706
Found his escape pod
in Mexico.

305
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,416
Still looking
for the ship he came in.

306
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,710
He's heavily sedated.

307
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,802
You are
one beautiful motherfucker.

308
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,597
I'm gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?

309
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,936
Our test results yielded
something a little... odd.

310
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,314
(scoffs) Is this a joke?

311
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,067
KEYES: We ran the genome
sequence ten times.

312
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,111
This specimen has...

313
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,821
-Human DNA?
-Yeah.

314
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:06,905
Yeah.

315
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,825
Look, we know
about spontaneous speciation.

316
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,410
Mostly plants and insects,
but...

317
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,121
But some mammals,
sheep, goats, uh...

318
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,122
Yeah.

319
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,832
KEYES: The red wolf
is known to be a hybrid

320
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,166
between the coyote
and the grey wolf...

321
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,544
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

322
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,880
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

323
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,465
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?

324
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:28,886
Yeah.

325
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,640
Okay, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,

326
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:34,641
biohelmet, and...

327
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,144
What are these? Like,
some kind of wrist gauntlets?

328
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,228
Exactly.

329
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,064
So, where's the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

330
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,107
We've looked, believe me.

331
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,819
Who is this?

332
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,572
He made first contact
with the Predator.

333
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,407
Great.
I'd like to talk to him.

334
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,702
Well, he's
being evaluated, so...

335
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,165
Okay.

336
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,541
Well, before
you lobotomize him,

337
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,293
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.

338
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,297
MAN (on radio):
We have a request to reroute.

339
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,841
OFFICER: Read you
five-by-five. Destination?

340
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,052
Starkweather Dam.
Proceed at once.

341
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,929
You'll be met
by military personnel. Over.

342
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:14,973
COYLE: Hey, Baxley!

343
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,642
Question for ya.

344
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,060
All right, here we go.

345
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,145
How do you circumcise
a homeless man?

346
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,063
Here it comes.

347
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:23,232
Kick your mom in the chin.
(chuckles)

348
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,900
Fuck your mother...
Fuck your mother...

349
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,777
-(imitates barking)
-(laughter)

350
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,862
-Shut the fuck up!
-WILLIAMS: All right.

351
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,155
You shut the fuck up.

352
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,074
(laughter)

353
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:34,660
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Y'all going too fucking much.

354
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,703
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

355
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,163
Why are you here?

356
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,876
Come on, man,
this is the loony bus.

357
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,545
-Look at this motherfucker.
-LYNCH: Loonies!

358
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,796
Loonies, yeah. (ululates)

359
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,422
Ah... (sighs)

360
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,175
I had a run-in
with a space alien.

361
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,427
Oh, shit!

362
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,304
(all laughing)

363
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,597
-No, let him...
-COYLE: Okay, that guy wins.

364
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,015
That's the best story
I've ever heard.

365
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,100
Classic story...

366
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,102
That's the winner right there.
Fuckin' hell.

367
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,020
Would you shut the fuck up?

368
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,355
Oh.

369
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,526
They want to put a lid on it,

370
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,987
so here I am.

371
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,363
Stuck in Group Two.

372
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:13,532
The sequel to Group One,
only stupider.

373
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,701
Oh, huh.

374
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,037
(laughing)

375
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,330
NETTLES: Give this man
a fuckin' cigar.

376
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,415
Shut the fuck up.

377
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,333
"Would you shut the fuck up?"

378
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,752
(laughter continues)

379
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,130
COYLE: It's a conspiracy.

380
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,465
The goddamn space aliens, huh?

381
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,688
SENSORS ENGAGED

382
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,901
SCANNING FOR TARGET

383
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,030

EMILY: What are you
doing down there, Rory?

389
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,348
Uh, just... just playing games.

390
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,849
EMILY: Well,
dinner's getting cold.

391
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,809
(trilling)

392
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,854
Major?

393
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,773
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

394
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,151
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

395
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,111
GENERAL (sighs): Damn it.

396
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,239
We need something in the air.

397
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,740
Get me NORAD.

398
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,576
I feel like I'm missing
something in the research.

399
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,827
There's something
I'm just not seeing.

400
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,122
Look, if this is
the blood, okay, I think--

401
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,333
can you just tell me
what that is?

402
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,960
Because I was trying

403
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,878
to get into this earlier,
but somebody stopped me.

404
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,547
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

405
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,590
-That guy actually.
-KEYES: Hold that thought.

406
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,342
Sir, NORAD's reporting
a 202 anomaly

407
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,718
possibly heading
our direction.

408
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,262
Is it coming here?

409
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,179
God, I hope not.

410

We gotta get off this thing.
We gotta move.

Brother, it's a bus.

490

Hey, Baxley!

492
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,894
If your mom's vagina

it'd be rated "E"

five big black guys

498

547
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,600
(moans)

548
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,584
SOLDIER: Stargazer, I got eyes
on the woman.

549
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,793
Instructions?

550
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:51,461
-TRAEGER: Eliminate her.
-Hey.

551
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,796
Retrieve any contraband.

552
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,339
SOLDIER:
Roger that, Stargazer.

553
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,764
(groans)

554
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,266
(groans)

555
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,351
That's it, that's it, girl.

556
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,353
Hey, Nebraska!

557
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,521
Got it.

558
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,361
(sirens blaring)

559
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,822
(thuds)

560
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,619
(men groaning)

561
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,040
Everything okay back there?

562
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,962
You fucking guys.

563
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,927
(clicking)

564
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,727
(growls)

565
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,821
(sniffs)

566
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,406
(growls)

567
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,825
-(laughing)
-(indistinct chatter)

568
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,040
COYLE: We found the one place
to hide out

569
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,333
where we don't look crazy.

570
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,878
(snoring)

571
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,299
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

572
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,425
What's it feel like?

573
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,428
Like a gun.

574
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,932
Hey, you think she's safe
in there with them?

575
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:28,767
The girl?

576
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,144
They're soldiers, man.

577
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,565
Sleeping ladies? Nah, bro.

578
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:37,651
Sit down.

579
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:42,948
Here.

580
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,285
It's the end of times, huh?

581
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,622
Worst thing
about the end times...

582
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,041
they never fucking are.

583
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,002
(chuckles)

584
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,129
So, um...

585
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,007
did he live?

586
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,425
Say again?

587
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,886
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

588
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,970
Ah.

589
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,222
Yeah. He did.

590
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:09,057
Yeah, and where is he at now?

591
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:14,730
You're shitting me.

592
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,898
I missed.

593
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,858
(Williams chuckles)

594
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,359
Why did you do that?

595
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,528
-Miss?
-No, shoot yourself.

596
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:23,780
Doctors asked me
the same thing.

597
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:28,076
Walked to the hospital with
a bullet in my skull.

598
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,621
-Good times.
-Hey.

599
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:33,707
Should I be worried?

600
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,217
Probably. (chuckles)

601
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,260
-NETTLES: There we go.
-COYLE: Did you get that?

602
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,845
-That's too close to her hand.
-NETTLES: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

603
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,180
But then
she's gonna drop that there.

604
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,431
Guys!

605
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,309
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

606
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:53,936
We're trying
to make her feel comfortable.

607
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:54,853
WILLIAMS: Come on.

608
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,647
She's gonna wake up and see

609
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,106
a bunch of motherfuckers.
Come on.

610
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,233
What are you doin'?

611
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,693
(whispers) Nettles! Nettles!

612
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,903
BOTH: Move!

613
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,112
WILLIAMS: Move!

614
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,447
QUINN: Get out of there!

615
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,046
Morning, sunshine.

616
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:23,715
(exhales)

617
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,553
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

618
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:30,138
COYLE: Chill, hey!

619
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:34,017
(laughs) I told you
she'd grab it. Ten bucks!

620
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,644
Pay up! Whoo!

621
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,646
-Fuck it, fuck it.
-(laughing)

622
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,606
-Where's my phone?
-You're not gonna need that.

623
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,149
(cocks gun)

624
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:43,068
COYLE: Oh, that's not cool.

625
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,111
It's okay.

626
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,029
I said it's okay.

627
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,407
Give me the gun.

628
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,200
-Give me the gun.
-No. No.

629
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,328
(gun clicks)

630
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,289
(all gasp)

631
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,583
WILLIAMS: Oh, she pulled...

632
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,752
Oh! Shit, I told you
she'd pull the trigger!

633
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,045
I should have bet you
that time!

634
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:03,255
WILLIAMS: I like her.
I like her.

635
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,423
I should have bet you
that time!

636
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:05,757
-I like her.
-NETTLES: I like her.

637
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,176
I like her. I like her a lot.

638
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,594
QUINN: Give me that,
ding-dong.

639
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,388
COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.

640
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,766
What? You're a scientist, huh?
What they got you working on?

641
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,686
You're not gonna last a day
out there!

642
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,607
What, you think you're special?

643
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,484
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

644
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,320
They were gonna shoot her?

645
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:27,362
Yes.

646
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,281
Oh, I'm sorry.

647
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,825
Get out of the way.
See you around.

648
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,662
(stutters) Eat your pussy.

649
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,456
Wait, what?

650
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,832
How you doing?

651
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,334
No, you just said,
"Eat your pussy."

652
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,335
Hey...

653
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,086
-How you doing?
-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

654
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,379
What the fuck
is wrong with him?

655
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,048
-I said you're pushy.
-He said you're pushy.

656
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,132
No, you said,
"Eat your pussy."

657
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,842
No. I said,
"Sheesh! You're pushy!"

658
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,135
CASEY: No, you said,
"Eat my pussy."

659
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,512
No, that's what he said,
I heard it.

660
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,305
-He said... pushy.
-What the fuck?

661
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,973
Which is also fucking rude.

662
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,517
He doesn't mean your pussy
in particular.

663
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,976
You're insane, right?

664
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,394
-Are you fucking insane?
-COYLE: Probably.

665
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:00,521
Well, what's it gonna be?

666
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,147
-BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy.
-NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.

667
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,232
BAXLEY: I feel fine.

668
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,025
CASEY: They were gonna
shoot me?

669
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:06,652
Why?

670
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,656
Uh, maybe 'cause of this?

671
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:16,995
Well, I guess I'm in.

672
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,915
Stay the fuck away from me.

673
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:24,628
What the fuck is this?

674
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:27,130
What is this?

675
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,591
-What is that? Like a unicorn?
-NETTLES: A unicorn.

676
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,968
-It's a unicorn.
-A unicorn.

677
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,845
I made a unicorn...

678
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,596
I'm sorry,
it's a piece of shit.

679
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,432
So, what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?

680
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,184
Uh, maybe staying alive?

681
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,561
We are soldiers.

682
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,854
We're the good guys, okay?

683
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,272
CASEY: Well, that's debatable.

684
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:47,359
I read your file.
The guys in Mexico it killed?

685
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,443
They yours?

686
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,445
They're gonna need
a patsy for that.

687
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,655
You're looking at him.

688
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:53,240
Yeah, I figured.

689
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,701
Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's
actually kind of perfect.

690
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:56,994
How about you telling us

691
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,037
what you were doing
in a secret base.

692
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,915
Surrounded by
trained soldiers. Mercs.

693
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,129
I'm a biologist, and they have
me on call in case there's...

694
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,174
contact.

695
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:12,968
What did I tell you?

696
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,845
End days. End days.

697
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,388
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

698
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,681
I'm gonna set you on fire.

699
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,183
Guys, if we wanna
keep breathing,

700
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:20,934
we need to find this thing.

701
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,060
Expose it.

702
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,229
It's called the Predator.

703
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,315
It hunts people for sport.

704
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,609
Technically, that's not
a predator. That's like...

705
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,735
Thank you.

706
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,278
-It's a hunter.
-I said the same thing.

707
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,905
NETTLES: A sportsman,
or a hunter, or a fisherman.

708
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,031
COYLE: Well, look at you...

709
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,200
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

710
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:38,660
Equipment. Weapons.

711
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,581
I took its gear.

712
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:44,666
What?

713
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,918
You took something
from the thing?

714
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,753
-What?
-So, I'd have evidence.

715
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,881
I think I know
where it's going.

716
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,345
(whirring)

717
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,705
(growls)

718
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:25,624
What?

719
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,428
(indistinct chattering)

720
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:45,769
(door opens)

721
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:51,066
Oh, hi, honey, you're home.

722
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:54,069
-I'm looking for a package.
-A package?

723
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,112
Rory!

724
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,030
Hey! This is
not your house anymore!

725
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,365
QUINN: Rory!

726
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,993
Hey, buddy. Where are ya?

727
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,870
He's not here.

728
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,538
What do you mean,
he's not here?

729
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,165
Oh, shit!

730
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,084
What? So we
ordered some video games.

731
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,086
No! No! No!

732
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,380
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

733
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,007
was so
I didn't put you in danger.

734
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:16,758
Goddamn it,
we need to find him.

735
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,968
Wait, Quinn,
you're scaring me now.

736
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:19,678
(footsteps)

737
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,890
(indistinct chatter)

738
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,313
I specifically said

739
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,190
no first-person shooter.
No combat games.

740
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,900
Did you ever think that
maybe he plays them

741
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,026
to connect with his father?

742
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,402
Oh, my God.
We're doing this again.

743
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:37,070
Hey! Can you
stop taking all my...

744
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:40,699
Who are these people
in my house?

745
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,868
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

746
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,328
Good evening.

747
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:45,829
Uh, the brushstrokes on this

748
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,581
are really dynamic.
It's a wonderful piece.

749
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:49,208
Okay, you need
to put that down.

750
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:51,126
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

751
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:52,669
They're my unit.
They're soldiers.

752
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:55,005
Marines. There's his unit.
(laughing)

753
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:56,590
Hi. You seem like
a really nice...

754
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:58,383
Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

755
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,594
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

756
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,554
What happened
to Haines and Dupree?

757
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,973
They're dead.

758
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:07,100
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

759
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:08,435
What are you talking about?

760
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:09,561
There's something out there.

761
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,481
It tore my friends apart.
What is it?

762
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:13,482
(Coyle stuttering)

763
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,734
Like, it's a creature.
Seriously, it's not a person.

764
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:16,652
Like from the Bible.

765
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,487
-Revelations.
-From the Bible?

766
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,489
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

767
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,406
It's a space alien.

768
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:23,450
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

769
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,160
It's like
an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

770
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,329
Oh, shit!

771
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:28,872
Shit.

772
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:30,249
I want a grid search.

773
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,375
Three teams.

774
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,043
(men exclaiming)

775
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,002
Hey!

776
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,964
-No.
-No, no, I'm coming with you.

777
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,257
QUINN: No, nix that.

778
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,550
(gun cocking)

779
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,051
(Quinn clears throat)

780
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:43,971
Is there a problem?

781
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,182
Thing is, we're
kind of moving targets.

782
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,643
Yeah, in case you haven't
noticed, we're fugitives.

783
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,562
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?

784
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,230
I get it. Fine,
stay here and watch TV.

785
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:56,400
You know what? If you try
to split? Or draw the Feds?

786
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:57,734
Or if you jeopardize my son

787
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,945
by your half-assed
yardbird bullshit...

788
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,530
I will come back here,
and I will happily

789
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:03,282
kill every single
fucking one of you.

790
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,164
WILLIAMS: Come on,
brothers. Let's go.

791
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,041
(door closes)

792
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,043
Seriously?

793
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:16,962
It's not our fight.

794
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,760
Is your husband
the man I think he is?

795
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:25,888
Excuse me?

796
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:28,182
Tell me
about your husband, please?

797
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,144
He's a security
counter-sniper.

798
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,520
-Mmm.
-Army Rangers.

799
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,856
He supervised

800
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,650
23 close precision engagements
across five continents

801
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:41,028
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

802
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,364
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,

803
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:46,241
to ever receive
a Distinguished Service Medal

804
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,409
and the Silver Star.

805
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,245
So, he might be
a lousy husband,

806
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:51,747
but he is a good soldier.

807
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,710
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.

808
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,253
-Yeah.
-Jesus Christ.

809
00:47:58,295 --> 00:47:59,421
That's what I thought.

810
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,590
Fucking pussies.

811
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,260
(door opens and closes)

812
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,470
Where you going, Nettles?

813
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,933
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

814
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:14,478
But... he called me a pussy

815
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,480
and nobody
calls me a pussy, so...

816
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,023
-Fuck off, pussy.
-Okay...

817
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,316
(clears throat)

818
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:24,279
Come on, Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

819
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,740
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.

820
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,162
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move.

821
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:33,247
Hey!

822
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:34,331
You too, lucky charms.

823
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:35,457
LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.

824
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,002
I'd like to watch TV

825
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,379
-with you sometime.
-Okay.

826
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,547
I liked your speech.

827
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:42,840
BAXLEY: I liked the couch.

828
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,802
Whoa, what's happening? What?

829
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,513
Well, we're finding my son,
that's what.

830
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,974
All right,
when all this is over...

831
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,101
Fuck me in the face
with an aardvark.

832
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,269
(groaning)

833
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:58,397
I just want to be famous.

834
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,398
LYNCH: Ostensibly,

835
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:01,066
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

836
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,568
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.

837
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,236
COYLE: You're using
"ostensibly" incorrectly.

838
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,362
Is this for me?

839
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:06,905
This is like the reverse
of a clown car.

840
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:08,323
All right, Nebraska,

841
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:09,700
let's find some wheels,
nothing flashy.

842
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:10,784
Copy.

843
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,537
All right. Find my son.

844
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,247
Casey, you're with me.

845
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:16,665
Let's go.

846
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,376
DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.

847
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,339
What are you supposed to be?

848
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,591
RORY: Leave me alone.

849
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,552
EJ: Or what? You'll wash our
hands five hundred times?

850
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,720
(snickers)

851
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:31,722
(doorbell rings)

852
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,390
RORY: Trick or treat?

853
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,938
EJ: What's the matter, dude?

854
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:41,481
(chuckles)

855
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:43,150
Here's a treat,
you little shit.

856
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:44,818
-Oh!
-(laughs)

857
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,570
(helmet whirring)

858
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,533
(grunting)

859
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,955
(tires screeching)

860
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,669
(indistinct shouting)

861
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:05,130
-(horns honking)
-(alarms blaring)

862
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,056
(whimpering)

863
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,731
OFFICER (on radio):
I got a male juvenile.

864
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:24,316
10 to 12 years old.

865
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,609
Metal cast on his arm.

866
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:26,777
Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?

867
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,195
OFFICER:
Ran right in front of my car.

868
00:50:29,112 --> 00:50:30,322
Moving east on Woodruff.

869
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,449
Repeat, moving
east on Woodruff.

870
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,913
(sirens wailing in distance)

871
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:40,541
(panting)

872
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,668
Nebraska, you got wheels?

873
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:44,628
WILLIAMS: Yeah, I got wheels.
Something flashy.

874
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,799
Listen, the kid's spooked,
he's rabbiting.

875
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:51,552
Where's he headed?
Where's some place he knows?

876
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,306
(faint growl)

877
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,688
(whimpering)

878
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,532
(whimpers)

879
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:27,421
(snarling)

880
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,719
(dog barking)

881
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,429
(creature hissing)

882
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,816
There he is.

883
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,073
Dad!

884
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,746
How you doing, buddy, huh?

885
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:01,830
I'm good.

886
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,378
(grunts)

887
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:12,257
(grunts)

888
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,135
-Move! Move!
-(gasps)

889
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,846
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

890
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:23,852
(roars)

891
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,521
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

892
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,648
BAXLEY: Oh, shit!

893
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:30,776
(snarling)

894
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:32,945
(grunts)

895
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:36,782
(roars)

896
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:38,158
WILLIAMS: McKenna!

897
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,201
(grunts)

898
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:43,038
NETTLES: Take cover!
Take cover!

899
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,373
(growls)

900
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,670
(snarling)

901
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:03,934
BAXLEY: Williams!
Get the fuck out of there!

902
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:05,310
(indistinct shouting)

903
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,688

Maybe, like, sensor receptors.

909
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:30,794
Kind of like cat whiskers.

Whoa! What the--
I'm getting a sample.

911

I know what it is.
Our big boy's a hunter.

01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,843
What's the difference?

1081
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:20,639
Well, when you like it,

1082
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:22,474
that's when you're a killer.

1083
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,603
-(sniffles)
-Are you good?

1084
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:30,524
Sorry I never grew up.

1085
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,319
You know...
the way you wanted.

1086
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:41,577
Tell you a secret.

1087
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,122
Truth is, kid,

1088
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:48,125
I never grew up
the way I wanted.

1089
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,173
(sighs)
Are we gonna get killed?

1090
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,340
(grunts softly)

1091
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,261
Nope.

1092
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,598
Come on.
(clears throat) Get up.

1093
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:04,975
I'm single.
I don't know if you knew that.

1094
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,060
No, I could tell
that you're single.

1095
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:10,314
We got so much stuff
in common, you know...

1096
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:13,400
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

1097
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,277
-Shit.
-What?

1098
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:17,905
This is more than spinal fluid.

1099
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:18,906
What does that mean?

1100
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,324
If I'm right,

1101
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,702
they're trying
to upgrade themselves.

1102
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:25,120
McKenna, I got something.

1103
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:27,164
I think I know
what they're up to

1104
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,624
on Predator World these days.

1105
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:31,710
You see this? They found this
in the Predator's plexus.

1106
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,128
So, remember how I told you

1107
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,588
how they take
people's spines, right?

1108
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,673
Yeah, for trophies.

1109
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:39,176
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,

1110
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:42,179
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

1111
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:43,430
Collecting survival traits

1112
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:44,848
from the most
high-end specimens.

1113
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:47,309
I think they're
attempting hybridization.

1114
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,479
You're just pulling this
out of your ass.

1115
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:52,439
Did you not see
the new Predator?

1116
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,400
It's evolving.

1117
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:57,069
Or being upgraded.

1118
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:05,953
QUINN: That little boy

1119
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:08,121
managed to figure out
alien technology.

1120
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:11,250
You know,
a lot of experts say that

1121
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,418
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.

1122
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,296
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

1123
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:18,632
NETTLES: Hey, yo!
What the fuck?

1124
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:19,800
Get the fuck away from me!

1125
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:21,718
Yo! Casey! (whistling)

1126
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,012
QUINN: Casey, get inside.

1127
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:25,889
Casey!

1128
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,475
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

1129
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:29,893
Casey! Look.

1130
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:32,145
I think this thing's
been following us, all right?

1131
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:34,857
-Move, Netty!
-Hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,567
-Space dog!
-Move, Netty!

1133
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:37,901
(whimpers)

1134
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:41,780
Fuck that.

1135
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,323
Hey! You had
your fucking chance.

1136
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,700
(creature whines)

1137
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:47,411
Look, I'm just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

1138
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,329
You know, maybe we can
use it, or something?

1139
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:51,373
Okay, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

1140
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,667
We're gonna study it. That's
what we're gonna do with it.

1141
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,169
What's to learn?
Except Williams sucks

1142
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,670
at shooting shit in the head.

1143
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,547
Williams, you lobotomized him.
(chuckles)

1144
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,966
Okay, new rule.
No one shoots my fucking dog.

1145
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:01,967
(creature growls)

1146
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,260
BAXLEY: There it is.
It's official.

1147
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:04,845
You were right,
we can use this.

1148
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,058
BAXLEY: Shit.

1149
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:11,852
COYLE: Netty, what is that?

1150
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,522
WILLIAMS:
Everybody, tighten up.

1151
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,316
-Little man, come here.
-NETTLES: That's an EC-130.

1152
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:18,483
That's not civilian.

1153
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,568
Hey, hey, hey!

1154
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,029
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

1155
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,238
WILLIAMS: There you go.

1156
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,074
Do you wanna help? Go get
a helicopter and some pyro.

1157
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:27,910
All right! On me!

1158
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,244
Now go!

1159
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:31,663
-Casey! I'll be right back!
-No, you won't.

1160
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,498
Hold on. Hey. See this?

1161
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,709
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

1162
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,586
-Fetch!
-(creature huffing)

1163
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:42,883
(coughing)

1164
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:02,194
Where is it?

1165
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:03,445
Where's what?

1166
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:05,781
The device.

1167
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,534
It goes, right in here.

1168
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,328
(grunting)

1169
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,375
Okay, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.

1170
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,585
Why'd he come here? To Earth?

1171
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:20,963
The "Thing One",
as you called him,

1172
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,257
arrived in
a hijacked spacecraft.

1173
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,384
We think there's
something on it.

1174
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:27,386
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

1175
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,221
CASEY: Wait, enemies?

1176
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,849
Other Predators.
Like that big one.

1177
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,601
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?

1178
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,144
I'll help you find it.
We can analyze it...

1179
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:37,479
Shut the fuck up!

1180
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:42,609
Why are they here?

1181
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:47,406
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

1182
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,950
There was a run on Twinkies?

1183
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:52,119
Snapped up
from coast-to-coast.

1184
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,787
Get 'em while they still last.

1185
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:55,622
Remember?

1186
01:05:56,874 --> 01:06:00,002
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?

1187
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,629
Two generations?

1188
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:04,840
One?

1189
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:06,758
CASEY: That's why their visits
are increasing?

1190
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,968
They're trying to snap up

1191
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,469
all of our best DNA
before we're gone.

1192
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:13,015
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.

1193
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,351
We're an endangered species,
and they know it.

1194
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:18,020
They thrive
in a hothouse environment.

1195
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:20,230
Maybe they want
to move into ours.

1196
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,399
And that dead Predator

1197
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,151
was bringing us
a way to stop them.

1198
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:26,695
(grunts)

1199
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:29,198
You've hidden this thing
before in the mail.

1200
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:30,199
(groans)

1201
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:32,034
So, where is it this time?

1202
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,493
Your mother's ass.

1203
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:35,579
Wait, did I say that out loud?

1204
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:37,539
(grunts)

1205
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,461
Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no.
That is not for you.

1206
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,545
That is my son's,

1207
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:45,088
and you are violating
his privacy reading that.

1208
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,298
You both need
to leave right now.

1209
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:48,425
Ma'am, I don't wanna
restrain you.

1210
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,677
Really? Well,
why don't you try?

1211
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,722
(objects clattering)

1212
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:58,060
(footsteps running)

1213
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:05,984
(snarling)

1214
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,448
(yells)

1215
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:13,784
(gunshots)

1216
01:07:14,076 --> 01:07:15,702
(snarling)

1217
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,251
(low growling)

1218
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,678
(speaking alien language)

1219
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:44,690
CRYPTOGRAPHER: You haven't
found the spacecraft?

1220
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,483
Why are we trying
to crack the entry code?

1221
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,485
SAPIR: Because when we do
find it, wouldn't it be great

1222
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:49,778
if we could
get into the fucking thing?

1223
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,988
What's that?

1224
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,906
A map.

1225
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:54,616
A map to what?

1226
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:56,660
CRYPTOGRAPHER: ...give us
a clue of where this place is,

1227
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,537
maybe we can try
to get into it.

1228
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,497
But if you don't give us
anything, we can't get in!

1229
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,048
(grunts)

1230
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,552
(whimpering)

1231
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,054
Hey, Rory, I'm Will.

1232
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:17,723
How you doing?

1233
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,142
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

1234
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:35,157
Golf tomorrow?

1235
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:36,617
Why not?

1236
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,328
You two never read
my file, did ya?

1237
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:41,205
What makes you say that?

1238
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:43,540
'Cause you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

1239
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,125
(laughing)

1240
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,292
The worst part is,

1241
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,629
you're making me lie to my son.

1242
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:51,715
What lie did you
tell him, hmm?

1243
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:54,510
That I won't enjoy this.

1244
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:57,345
(grunting)

1245
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,057
(screams)

1246
01:09:00,098 --> 01:09:01,600
(mouthing)

1247
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:04,853
-(gun cocking)
-Hey, please, don't.

1248
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,773
Look, I don't know
what they told you...

1249
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:10,149
Can you just wait
for a second? Just wait!

1250
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:11,609
No, no, no!

1251
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:13,153
No.

1252
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:14,947
(grunting softly)

1253
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,202
-Jeez!
-(yipping)

1254
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:21,328
Oh, my God.

1255
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:27,584
(retches)

1256
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:34,508
(both grunting)

1257
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:49,314
(gasping)

1258
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,195
(grunting)

1259
01:09:58,657 --> 01:09:59,700
Nebraska!

1260
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,743
-Yeah?
-You just kill somebody?

1261
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:02,911
Well, he ain't well.

1262
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:04,204
Untie my friend.

1263
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,622
They got Rory. We gotta move.

1264
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:07,499
Shit, they rough you up?

1265
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,626
Did worse on myself,
back in the day.

1266
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:11,170
(grunting)

1267
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,754
What do you want to do
with this guy?

1268
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:17,342
Sorry, buddy,
that was a dumb question.

1269
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:18,552
Yeah, that was
a dumb question.

1270
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:20,971
(panting)

1271
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:27,644
(low growling)

1272
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:32,816
QUINN: Casey!

1273
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,905
Can I interest you in getting
the fuck out of here?

1274
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:40,449
"Getting the fuck out of here"
is my middle name.

1275
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:42,868
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1276
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:43,952
(Quinn groans)

1277
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,245
(stomach grumbling)

1278
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,497
What? What's wrong?

1279
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,750
(toilet flushing)

1280
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,753
Whew! All right.

1281
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:55,088
Hey! Just let me unpack this.

1282
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,798
You're saying my son's headed
towards a spaceship

1283
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,133
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1284
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,510
Uh, 11, actually.

1285
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:00,886
Used to be a contractor.

1286
01:11:01,178 --> 01:11:02,763
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

1287
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:04,890
Meaning it's the Chinese menu
of DNA.

1288
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,934
Comprised of the deadliest
species in the entire...

1289
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:08,227
In the entire universe, yeah?

1290
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:09,728
-Galaxy.
-What?

1291
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,813
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1292
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:13,440
Why go universe? Just saying.

1293
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:15,442
(helicopter whirring)

1294
01:11:27,538 --> 01:11:29,498
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1295
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,582
That's what you asked for?

1296
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:31,625
Yeah, that'll do.

1297
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:34,461
Saddle up!

1298
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:39,591
COYLE: It's the best
we could do, man.

1299
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:43,804
WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!

1300
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:45,180
That's it? Another one.

1301
01:11:45,222 --> 01:11:46,348
QUINN: The other one!

1302
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,850
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1303
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,564
Figured something out.
I think we're gonna die.

1304
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:56,650
We're gonna go hunt and fight
the what, the army?

1305
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:57,985
COYLE: We're not gonna
fight the army...

1306
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,695
BAXLEY: And some
fucking people from space!

1307
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,196
You wanna talk survival, huh?

1308
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:02,823
Fine!

1309
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:04,992
You, yesterday,
you were on a prison bus

1310
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,243
barking to yourself,

1311
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,078
now you got a gun
in your hand.

1312
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,329
Who's a survivor now?

1313
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:12,624
We put bullets in our head

1314
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:14,126
and walk
to the fucking hospital.

1315
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:15,794
We're soldiers!

1316
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:18,755
Nettles, what's our 20?

1317
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,008
I can follow
your boy's chopper.

1318
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,301
I locked into its frequency.

1319
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,816
SOLDIER: Fence is hot!

1320
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,543
(indistinct radio chatter)

1321
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,129
What do you say, buddy?

1322
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:01,423
You think you can get us
in there?

1323
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,259
Because I'm not sure
that you can.

1324
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:06,094
Nice reverse psychology.

1325
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,013
I can do that, too.

1326
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:09,473
Don't go fuck yourself.

1327
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:11,892
(laughs)

1328
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:14,353
TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.

1329
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:17,022
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1330
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:18,106
TRAEGER: Right on.

1331
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,525
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1332
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,026
Been trying to figure out

1333
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:22,361
what these
bird-chirping motherfuckers

1334
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:23,779
been saying since '87.

1335
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,531
Gave the Harvard School
of Linguistics

1336
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,907
a billion-dollar grant.

1337
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,159
Voila. Watch your step,
come on.

1338
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,966
Goddamn, kid, I don't know
where you get it from.

1339
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:47,010
(trilling)

1340
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:13,412
TRAEGER: Put the translator
into the mainframe.

1341
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:14,621
Download everything.

1342
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:22,796
SAPIR: What the hell's
inside there?

1343
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,673
It's property
of Project Stargazer.

1344
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,758
That's what the fuck it is.
(laughs)

1345
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,387
OFFICER (on comms):
Code three. Code three.

1346
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:31,805
We have motion
at the south fence line.

1347
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:33,599
Send a fireteam
to check it out.

1348
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,059
That's my dad.
He's gonna come save me now.

1349
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:37,644
Oh, is he?

1350
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,314
Is that what he's gonna do?

1351
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,357
I'll tell you what, buddy...

1352
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:44,776
if it is your daddy,

1353
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:46,987
and I truly hope that it is...

1354
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:49,489
he's gotta be just about

1355
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:52,701
the dumbest motherfucker
I've ever met. (laughing)

1356
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:58,165
I mean, a Ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1357
01:14:58,207 --> 01:14:59,458
He's gotta be...

1358
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:02,461
creating a diversion.

1359
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:03,879
It's a fucking diversion.

1360
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:05,380
(grunts)

1361
01:15:05,422 --> 01:15:06,715
Oh, shit!

1362
01:15:06,757 --> 01:15:08,091
Wow. Howdy.

1363
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:10,093
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1364
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:12,429
You took my boy, so yeah.

1365
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:14,139
Told you.

1366
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:16,058
Take this, son.

1367
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,102
You outta your mind? We
literally have you surrounded.

1368
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:20,562
That's why
you're coming with me.

1369
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:22,147
I just want the boy.
Nobody's got to die.

1370
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,065
Dad?

1371
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,110
From here forward.

1372
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:28,612
Don't look at the dead guy.

1373
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,294
(grunting)

1374
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:50,509
That was pretty good.

1375
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:51,718
You all right? Did I get you?

1376
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,761
No, I'm good.

1377
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,847
Welcome back.

1378
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,014
Fuck you. I never left.

1379
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,185
You open your mouth,

1380
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:02,020
I'm gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1381
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,230
Come on, just get behind me.

1382
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,357
SOLDIER (on radio):
All units. They got Traeger.

1383
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:06,441
They got Traeger.

1384
01:16:07,985 --> 01:16:09,152
(softly) Let's go. Let's go.

1385
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,488
Just tell them
to put the guns down.

1386
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:22,291
Tell them!

1387
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:25,669
If Captain McKenna
doesn't lower his weapon

1388
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,670
in the next 10 seconds...

1389
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:28,714
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1390
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,090
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1391
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,718
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1392
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:34,428
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1393
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:35,387
10.

1394
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:37,764
Nine.

1395
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:39,474
Eight.

1396
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:41,852
Seven.

1397
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,438
Come on, you just give
the fucking word, man.

1398
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,522
TRAEGER: Six. Five.

1399
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:47,024
(predator clicking)

1400
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,567
(predator grunting)

1401
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:50,402
(grunts)

1402
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,779
(growling)

1403
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:54,698
(screaming)

1404
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:57,701
(yelling)

1405
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,247
-(distant yelling)
-Oh, shit!

1406
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:03,999
(grunting)

1407
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:05,125
Come on, son!

1408
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,711
(indistinct shouting)

1409
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:08,795
Take them down!

1410
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,053
Get down, sir.

1411
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:17,596
Let's go, son. Go!

1412
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:18,805
SOLDIER: Come on. Come on.

1413
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,396
Okay, take this. (spits)

1414
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:28,857
You wanna vanish,

1415
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:30,442
you really vanish, son,
you understand?

1416
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:33,111
All right, we're going home.
I promise you.

1417
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:39,660
(predator growls)

1418
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:43,997
It's here.

1419
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:52,214
-(predator growls)
-No! No! No!

1420
01:17:58,387 --> 01:17:59,847
SOLDIER 2: Come on,
go around the end there!

1421
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:01,431
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1422
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,100
Move, move, move!

1423
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,518
-You got him?
-SOLDIER 3: Yeah!

1424
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,656
-(explosion)
-QUINN: Stay back.

1425
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:18,866
Get down! Get down!

1426
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:25,289
SOLDIER 4: Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1427
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,800
(low growling)

1428
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:39,136
(both panting quietly)

1429
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:53,442
-COYLE: Huh?
-All right.

1430
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:55,027
Hey, McKenna.

1431
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:57,946
Be reasonable. There's six
of you, seven of us.

1432
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,823
(grunts)

1433
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:01,200
Fuck!

1434
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:02,701
Who taught you math?

1435
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,995
You ain't the only
fucking sniper, white boy.

1436
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:09,082
You can walk away
from this, Captain.

1437
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,293
I just want the ship.

1438
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,545
-Dad, he's lying.
-Yeah.

1439
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,881
McKenna! I don't like this.

1440
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,591
What's he doing in there?

1441
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:20,928
(predator warbling)

1442
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:24,515
-(loud warbling)
-(feedback whines)

1443
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:28,310
(all groan)

1444
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,104
It's using the translator.

1445
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,317
PREDATOR (over speaker):
Hello. I have enjoyed

1446
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:37,027
watching you kill each other.

1447
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,821
I came here
to destroy this vessel.

1448
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:41,907
You cannot have it.

1449
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,117
What you can do is run.

1450
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:47,704
I detect one among you
who is a true warrior.

1451
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,040
The one called McKenna.

1452
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,377
He will be your leader.

1453
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,379
He will be my prize.

1454
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:57,631
I offer time advantage.

1455
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,591
Go.

1456
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,552
What the fuck
is time advantage?

1457
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:02,678
Like a head start?

1458
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,931
(alarm sounding)

1459
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:07,766
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1460
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:10,018
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1461
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,981
Hey!

1462
01:20:14,398 --> 01:20:15,440
I'm coming out!

1463
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:26,118
We're in.

1464
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,579
-Baxley!
-Shit!

1465
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,706
Watch where the fuck you're
throwing, dickhead.

1466
01:20:30,747 --> 01:20:32,124
-(vehicle engine stalling)
-Will do.

1467
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:35,252
Okay, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1468
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:37,129
-McKenna's the one he wants.
-TRAEGER: No, no, no!

1469
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,464
We stay together,
or it'll take us one by one.

1470
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:41,008
He's right. It's their MO.

1471
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:43,010
-Grow a dick, will you?
-SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!

1472
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:45,137
Son of a bitch. He must have
hacked the vehicles.

1473
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,598
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1474
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:48,682
-Got you.
-Hey?

1475
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:50,767
When this is over, you and me,
we're gonna dance.

1476
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:51,977
I got my shoes all picked out.

1477
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,020
All right.

1478
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,861
(soft growling)

1479
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:02,946
-Fuck.
-No, no, no! Don't.

1480
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,741
Here, boy. Fetch.

1481
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,410
-(creature barks)
-Here, boy. (whistles)

1482
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:09,453
Here you go.

1483
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:13,874
That was a valuable weapon.

1484
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:17,669
Let's go.
He'll be coming for us.

1485
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:20,339
(alarm blaring)

1486
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,906
(warbling)

1487
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:47,199
(device beeps)

1488
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,751
Give me the goody bag.

1489
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:01,964
Hey. On Halloween,
this blew up a whole house.

1490
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:03,715
-How do you shoot it?
-You don't.

1491
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,801
It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1492
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,302
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1493
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:10,556
(man coughing)

1494
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,600
(faint rustling)

1495
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:17,145
I heard something.

1496
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:19,314
TRAEGER: Hey, man.
That's Predator technology.

1497
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:21,692
Fuck.

1498
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,318
That-- It's gonna come back.

1499
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,112
You got, uh, a catcher
on the wrist.

1500
01:22:25,821 --> 01:22:26,947
That's gonna come back.

1501
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,449
No!

1502
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,369
-(screaming)
-Quiet. Quiet.

1503
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,080
-Let me see. Let me see.
-My fucking hand.

1504
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,498
-Shit.
-My fucking hand.

1505
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:39,960
Gotta be quiet.

1506
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,258
(screaming)

1507
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:52,097
(predator warbles)

1508
01:22:58,812 --> 01:22:59,938
Moving!

1509
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:18,165
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1510
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:20,876
There's a clearing up ahead.

1511
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:23,462
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1512
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:25,214
Let's find it
and trap the motherfucker.

1513
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:27,633
You guys go set it up.
We'll lure him in.

1514
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,593
-Who?
-You and me.

1515
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:30,636
Yeah? All right.

1516
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:32,471
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1517
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:34,515
Come on.

1518
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:37,976
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1519
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:39,269
What's this "we" shit?

1520
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:40,646
What, are you gonna
live forever, Coyle?

1521
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:42,231
-Just calm down.
-COYLE: Calm down?

1522
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:45,150
Me, calm down?
Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.

1523
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,194
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1524
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:06,296

1525
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:11,218
-(indistinct animal croaking)
-Shit!

1526
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:15,097
Okay, fuck this.

1527
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:17,850
Hey! Asshole!

1528
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,393
What the fuck was that?

1529
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:21,103
COYLE: It's a chance for you
to survive.

1530
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:23,063
Go! I got this.

1531
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:25,232
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I've ever heard.

1532
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,323
Come and get us, asshole!

1533
01:24:35,576 --> 01:24:36,660
Contact!

1534
01:24:36,702 --> 01:24:38,036

-Contact!

1535
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:41,748

-Alien!

1536
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,791
-Contact!
-He's coming!

1537
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:50,215
Come on. Come on. Come on.

He said he wanted me!

No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1580
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:13,377

in the evolutionary chain.

1608
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,962
(screams) Fuck!

1609
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,421
Netty!

1610
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,638
(coughing)

1611
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:32,349
QUINN: Hey, hey, hey.

1612
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:33,851
No, no, no! Bro!

1613
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:35,853
Bro.

1614
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:41,024
(engine whooshing)

1615
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,279
No.

1616
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:47,281
(laughs)

1617
01:30:48,866 --> 01:30:50,784
(yelling)

1618
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:55,831
Fuck!

1619
01:31:15,559 --> 01:31:16,935
(grunts)

1620
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:31,783
(growls)

1621
01:31:35,287 --> 01:31:36,830
-(roars)
-(yells)

1622
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:40,209
(speaks alien language)

1623
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:02,105
(yelling)

1624
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,494
(panting)

1625
01:32:25,587 --> 01:32:27,214
(grunting)

1626
01:32:52,573 --> 01:32:53,574
Shit!

1627
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:01,790
Rory!

1628
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:05,460
(roars)

1629
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:09,298
(screeching)

1630
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:11,341
(growls)

1631
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,310
(predator growling)

1632
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:28,400
(speaks alien language)

1633
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:30,235
(grunting)

1634
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,531
(screams)

1635
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:35,866
(groans)

1636
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:39,912
(predator groans)

1637
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,960
-(growling)
-(gasps)

1638
01:33:49,588 --> 01:33:50,672
(predator bellows)

1639
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:55,344
(screeches)

1640
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:57,846
(roars)

1641
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:00,182
Toss it!

1642
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:18,242
(beeping)

1643
01:34:18,283 --> 01:34:19,284
(creature whines)

1644
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:23,830
(roars)

1645
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:45,060
(predator whimpers)

1646
01:34:54,152 --> 01:34:55,362
What are you?

1647
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:57,447
(speaks alien language)

1648
01:34:57,489 --> 01:34:58,448
Shut the fuck up.

1649
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:00,951
(gasps)

1650
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:20,345
My unit.

1651
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:23,891
Nettles.

1652
01:35:26,185 --> 01:35:27,394
Coyle.

1653
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:31,690
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1654
01:35:34,234 --> 01:35:36,195
Baxley had this
the whole time.

1655
01:35:39,615 --> 01:35:40,949
Nebraska's bad habit.

1656
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:43,660
Son...

1657
01:35:44,036 --> 01:35:46,205
these are the ones
that no one's gonna remember.

1658
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:48,665
Just us.

1659
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:51,126
What do you say
we put them to rest?

1660
01:36:29,206 --> 01:36:32,334
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

1661
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:36,338
Captain McKenna.

1662
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:40,509
Hiroshi Yamada.

1663
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:42,386
-Sir.
-First things first.

1664
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,763
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1665
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:45,889
He loves it here.

1666
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:47,975
Yeah, he's something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1667
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:50,102
Well, I assume
that you know by now,

1668
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:53,063
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1669
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:55,232
-He brought something.
-Exactly.

1670
01:36:55,274 --> 01:36:56,692
Now, you want
to hear the good news?

1671
01:36:57,985 --> 01:36:59,236
The cargo survived.

1672
01:37:00,195 --> 01:37:01,822
With some sort of fail-safe.

1673
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,907
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1674
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:05,450
a pod escaped.

1675
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:06,952
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.

1676
01:37:08,287 --> 01:37:11,623
It seems that our boy
wasn't taking any chances.

1677
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:14,293
He wanted us to have this.

1678
01:37:14,334 --> 01:37:15,669
(door sliding open)

1679
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:20,048
(indistinct announcement)

1680
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:29,975
What is it again
you do here, exactly?

1681
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:33,395
He's the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.

1682
01:37:35,522 --> 01:37:36,857
QUINN: Hey, kiddo.

1683
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:40,360
RORY: Pretty cool, huh?

1684
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:41,778
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1685
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,197
I'll make sure to tell Mom.

1686
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:48,118
So, this is his gift
to humankind?

1687
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:57,586
(static interference)

1688
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:04,134
-(electricity crackling)
-(woman screams)

1689
01:38:04,176 --> 01:38:06,136
-MAN 1: Get back!
-MAN 2: Look out!

1690
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:07,679
MAN 3: Everyone, stand back!

1691
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:08,722
MAN 4: Stand back!
Clear the area!

1692
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:10,557
(pod hissing)

1693
01:38:11,058 --> 01:38:12,351
(indistinct shouting)

1694
01:38:15,354 --> 01:38:17,105
Dad, the pod
sent me a message.

1695
01:38:19,566 --> 01:38:21,735
-Rory, what's in that pod?
-Don't know!

1696
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:24,821
Oh, wow... Oh, shit!

1697
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:26,573
-It's got a name!
-Name? What name?

1698
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,867
I guess you'd call it,

1699
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,327
the Predator Killer.

1700
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,621
-QUINN: Get him out of here!
-Come with me. Let's go.

1701
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:35,999
SOLDIER 1: Get back.
Clear the area.

1702
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:37,084
SOLDIER 2: Eyes on it.

1703
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:06,071
(device trilling)

1704
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:11,368
Whatever it is,
it appears to be dormant.

1705
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:14,288
-I assume it needs to be...
-(women gasp)

1706
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:16,790
SOLDIER: Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.

1707
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:19,585
(gasps) Get it off!
Get it off me!

1708
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:21,920
(screaming)

1709
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:54,036
What the hell is that?

1710
01:39:54,494 --> 01:39:56,079
That's my new suit, bubba.

1711
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:00,292
I hope they got it
in a 42 long.
