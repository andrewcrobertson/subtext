1
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,194
[theme song plays]

2
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,113
[chains rattling]

3
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,963
[man grunting]

4
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,137
[horse nickering]

5
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,862
- Whoa.
- [horses snorting]

6
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,698
[gentle metallic rattling]

7
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,328
Whoa.

8
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

9
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,933
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

10
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

11
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,188
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:36,193
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,196
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,699
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

15
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

16
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
Might that be you?

17
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,665
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:52,793
[snorting]

20
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,464
- What kinda doctor?
- [Schultz] Dentist.

21
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,424
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

22
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,385
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,641
- Speak English.
- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,066
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,693
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,075
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,037
[man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

33
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,840
[Schultz lighting match]

34
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

35
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
Django.

36
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,597
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

37
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,685
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

38
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,314
Who are they?

39
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,360
Big John.

40
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,487
Ellis.

41
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

44
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,793
Tell me...

45
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,171
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,008
- would you recognize them?
- [man] Hey.

47
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,635
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like what?

48
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,345
Like that.

49
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,806
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,935
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,814
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
Move it.

56
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,536
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,498
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,213
Oh, very well.

60
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,923
[horse whinnying]

61
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,844
[man screaming]

62
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,642
[scream echoing]

63
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,240
[screaming continues]

64
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,411
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,957
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,544
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,506
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
And you killed Ace!

70
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

72
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,609
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,778
[screaming resumes]

77
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,075
- [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,331
Yeah.

80
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
Sold American!

81
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,920
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,845
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,185
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,814
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,858
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,818
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,517
[screaming]

90
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:05,606
Goddamn it! Oh!
[moaning]

91
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:12,446
One hundred... ten... 20...

92
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,448
...and five...

93
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,867
...for young Django here.

94
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,872
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,544
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,296
Do you have one?

98
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,382
- You go to hell, dentist.
- [scoffs]

99
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,551
I thought not.

100
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,222
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,144
Thank you.

102
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,898
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,404
[nickering]

104
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
Whoa.

105
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,877
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:14,091
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,094
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,391
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,476
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,230
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:34,069
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,780
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,492
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,744
Choice is yours.

115
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,460
the North Star is that one.

117
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,090
Ta-ta. [clucking]

118
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,984
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,446
- [lantern crashing]
- [chains rattling]

120
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,033
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,495
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,249
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,377
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,588
- I'll get you your freedom.
- [gun cocking]

125
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,508
- No. No, please...
- [gunshot echoing]

126
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,068
[dogs barking nearby]

127
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,178
[squeaking]

128
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,222
All right, now.

129
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,391
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

130
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,768
- [coughing]
- ...and then in the morning...

131
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,689
That's a nigger on a horse.

132
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,091
What's everybody staring at?

133
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,760
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

134
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,222
[goats bleating]

135
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,065
Whoa.

136
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
Good morning, innkeeper!

137
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,914
Two beers for two weary travelers.

138
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,833
It's still a bit early.

139
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
We won't be open for another hour.

140
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

141
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:45,010
[gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

142
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,262
Get that nigger outta here!

143
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,811
- [panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

144
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,148
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

145
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
[man] Sheriff! Help!

146
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,985
Alas.

147
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

148
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
Sit down, my boy.

149
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [chortles]

150
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

151
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,977
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

152
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,564
...bounty hunter.

153
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,989
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

154
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,741
No.

155
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,118
Well...

156
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,873
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

157
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,376
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

158
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,753
[tsking] Hat.

159
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,050
Prost.

160
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,894
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

161
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,730
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,860
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

163
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,737
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,699
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,576
I truly have killed him,

166
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,745
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,249
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

168
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
What's a bounty?

169
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,132
It's like a reward.

170
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,677
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

171
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
Certain people, yeah.

172
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,014
Bad people?

173
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,143
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

174
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,604
Which brings me to you.

175
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,025
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

176
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

177
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

178
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

179
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

180
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,373
work to my benefit.

181
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,212
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

182
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,135
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

183
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

184
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,025
However, at this endeavor,

185
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,322
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

186
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,451
But you do. Don't ya?

187
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,828
I know what they look like all right.

188
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,499
Good. So here's my agreement.

189
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,086
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

190
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,880
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

191
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,216
but I don't know where.

192
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

193
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:21,101
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

194
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,522
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

195
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,818
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

196
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,697
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

197
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,785
[scoffs]

198
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,960
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

199
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,175
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

200
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,928
Go about your business.

201
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

202
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:07,480
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

203
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,900
And scare all these nice people.

204
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,738
You ain't got nothing better to do

205
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,116
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

206
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,535
and show your ass?

207
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,454
- [metal springing noise]
- [sheriff screaming]

208
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,582
- [crowd gasping]
- [groaning]

209
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,125
[woman screams]

210
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,797
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- [groaning]

211
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,134
- [yelling]
- [shot echoing]

212
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,510
[woman gasps]

213
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,637
[crowd screaming]

214
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,436
Now you can get the marshal.

215
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,273
[man] Marshal! Marshal!

216
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,692
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

217
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,069
After you.

218
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,742
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

219
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

220
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,122
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

221
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,625
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

222
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,753
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

223
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

224
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,259
You in the saloon!

225
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,763
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

226
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,642
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

227
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,978
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

228
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,106
and I mean right now.

229
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
[Schultz] Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

230
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,612
Yes, it is.

231
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,864
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

232
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,325
[Schultz]
<i>Na wunderbar,</i> marshal.

233
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

234
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,499
and just as you have instructed,

235
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,335
I am ready to step outside

236
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,589
with my hands raised above my head.

237
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,093
I trust as a representative

238
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,638
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

239
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:09,644
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

240
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,647
before I've had my day in court.

241
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
You mean like you did our sheriff.

242
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

243
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,612
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

244
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,452
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

245
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,041
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

246
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,211
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

247
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,215
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

248
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,219
They're a little tense out there.

249
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,848
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

250
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,851
- [doors squeaking open]
- Come ahead.

251
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,151
You unarmed?

252
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

253
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,115
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

254
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,242
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

255
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,745
as to the incident that just occurred?

256
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,540
- Go on.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,834
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

258
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,254
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

259
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,841
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

260
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,095
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

261
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,850
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

262
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,603
with a price on his head of $200.

263
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,731
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

264
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,233
The hell, you say!

265
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,445
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

266
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,782
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

267
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,451
sometime in the past two years?

268
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

269
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,957
[Schultz] I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

270
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,585
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

271
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,548
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

272
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:07,387
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

273
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
You're encouraged to wire him.

274
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,477
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

275
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,606
[guns uncocking]

276
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,573
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

277
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,659
[medium-tempo song plays]

278
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,749
I'll be damned.

279
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:08,364
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

280
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:14,078
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

281
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,291
What's your plan after that?

282
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,380
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

283
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,512
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

284
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

285
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, me and my wife do.

286
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,398
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

287
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,234
[man] Django.

288
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,488
Django, Django.

289
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
You got sand, Django.

290
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,951
Boy's got sand.

291
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,873
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

292
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,087
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

293
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,296
And the girl, too.

294
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,256
[groaning]

295
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:12,220
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

296
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
Both of 'em.

297
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,849
Separately.

298
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,645
And this one...

299
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,983
...you will sell him cheap.

300
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,445
In Greenville...

301
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,951
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

302
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,377
You know when she was sold...

303
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,798
...you know where she came from,

304
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,800
and you know her name.

305
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,136
What is her name?

306
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,971
Broomhilda.

307
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,809
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

308
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,936
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

309
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,024
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

310
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,318
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

311
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,029
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

312
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,323
She speak a little German, too.

313
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,242
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

314
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,244
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

315
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
to speak German with.

316
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,167
Well, let me get this straight.

317
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,921
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

318
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,214
Yep.

319
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,013
They call me Hildi.

320
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,523
[rooster crowing nearby]

321
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:59,285
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

322
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,372
You'll be playing a character.

323
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,380
Hm?

324
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,508
No?

325
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:24,977
During the act, you can
never break character.

326
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,605
Do you understand?

327
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah. Don't break character.

328
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,156
And your character
is that of The Valet.

329
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,408
What that is?

330
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,703
That's a fancy word for servant.

331
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,121
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

332
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,456
[chuckles]

333
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,127
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

334
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,382
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

335
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,508
But of course.

336
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:59,345
[medium-tempo song
resumes playing]

337
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,496
Whoa.

338
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,379
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

339
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,924
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

340
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,970
- I said niggers on horses...
- [Schultz] His name is Django.

341
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,931
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

342
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,560
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

343
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:53,232
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

344
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,860
Allow me to unring this bell.

345
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,864
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

346
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,158
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

347
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:04,160
- [snorting]
- [women giggling]

348
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,371
Mr. Bennett?

349
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:11,751
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

350
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,880
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

351
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,965
to parley with you now.

352
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,095
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

353
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,725
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

354
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,685
to buy one of my nigger gals?

355
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,520
No appointment, no nothin'?

356
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,606
Oh, I'm afraid so.

357
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,192
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

358
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,027
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

359
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,404
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

360
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,531
Now what you got to say about that?

361
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,787
Mr. Bennett.

362
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,207
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

363
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:56,545
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

364
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,006
[chuckles softly]

365
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,220
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

366
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,306
Hm-mm.

367
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,061
[chuckles]

368
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,695
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

369
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,406
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

370
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,950
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

371
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,285
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

372
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,204
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

373
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,248
What's your Jimmie's name again?

374
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,916
- Django.
- Django.

375
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,252
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

376
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,630
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

377
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,090
As you please, Big Daddy.

378
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,177
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

379
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,681
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

380
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,350
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

381
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,520
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

382
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,316
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

383
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,820
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

384
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,906
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

385
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,951
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

386
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,246
No. That's not what I said.

387
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,957
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

388
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,962
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

389
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,592
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

390
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,719
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

391
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,638
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

392
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,307
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

393
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,602
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

394
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,730
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

395
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,233
[playing medium-tempo tune]

396
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,406
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

397
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,493
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

398
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,829
That there is the pantry.

399
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,500
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

400
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,710
Po' little squirrels.

401
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,839
What you do for your massa?

402
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,758
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

403
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,344
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

404
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,846
You mean you wanna dress like that?

405
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,142
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

406
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:18,395
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

407
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,022
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

408
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,066
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

409
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:26,529
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

410
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,531
I don't know them.

411
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
They could be usin' a different name.

412
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,369
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

413
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,163
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

414
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,457
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,376
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

416
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,294
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

417
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,755
Well, one's over in that field.

418
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,556
[medium-tempo song plays]

419
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,437
[Django] Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

420
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,564
She work in the house, John.

421
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,607
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

422
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,734
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

423
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,778
Now, your Bible say...

424
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,535
[Django] Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

425
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,328
You ready?

426
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,789
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

427
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,332
it should be me. It should be me, John.

428
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,460
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

429
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,213
[dogs barking in distance]

430
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,181
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

431
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,974
She's a... she's a house slave.

432
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,561
- She a house slave, she can't be...
- [screaming]

433
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,567
[dogs howling]

434
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,451
[screaming]

435
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,416
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

436
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

437
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,421
[gasping, sobbing]

438
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,550
I's on my knees, John.

439
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,677
I like the way you beg, boy.

440
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,347
[whip cracking, echoing]

441
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,975
Is that who you was lookin' for?

442
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,978
Yep.

443
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,564
Where the other two at?

444
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:29,485
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

445
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,320
They whippin' Little Jody?

446
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,822
Point me in that direction.

447
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,534
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

448
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,250
Go get that white man
I came here with.

449
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,169
- [man] Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

450
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,837
- Come on, girlie.
- [shrieks] Please!

451
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,548
- Come on. Get you set up now.
- [screaming]

452
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,176
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

453
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,304
- [cracking]
- "...and the dread of ye

454
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,765
shall be on every beast
of the earth.'"

455
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:00,891
[cracking]

456
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,434
Come here now, woman!

457
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,688
- You'd better give me that arm!
- [screaming]

458
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,623
OK, she's ready!

459
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,003
[whimpering]

460
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,725
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

461
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,063
John Brittle!

462
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,295
- You remember me?
- [metal springing noise]

463
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,600
I like the way you die, boy.

464
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,900
Goddamn son of a bitch!

465
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,744
[grunting]

466
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,788
[whip cracking]

467
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,581
[groaning]

468
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,419
- Keep it funny!
- [grunting]

469
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,008
[yelling]

470
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,644
[man groaning]

471
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,446
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

472
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,698
[cocking pistol]

473
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,618
No! [groans]

474
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,541
[clicking]

475
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,296
Who were they?

476
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,008
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

477
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,677
Where's Ellis?

478
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,179
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

479
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,519
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

480
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,604
- Positive?
- I don't know.

481
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,023
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

482
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,442
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

483
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,902
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

484
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,709
I'm positive he dead.

485
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,756
Django!

486
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,969
Everybody calm down.

487
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,388
We mean no one else any harm.

488
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,098
Who are you two jokers?

489
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

490
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,104
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

491
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,859
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

492
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,986
In my pocket is a warrant,

493
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,240
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

494
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:49,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

495
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,458
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

496
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,710
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

497
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:02,257
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

498
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,092
These are wanted men.

499
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,719
The law wants 'em for murder.

500
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:10,015
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

501
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,477
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

502
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,105
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

503
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,611
I realize passions are high,

504
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,823
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

505
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,368
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

506
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,455
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

507
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:41,213
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

508
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,424
Gimme.

509
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,317
Satisfied?

510
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,118
May I have that back, please?

511
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,835
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

512
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:24,923
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

513
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,470
[Schultz whistling indistinctly]

514
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,286
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

515
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,547
[galloping hoofbeats]

516
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:11,678
- [dramatic choral music]
- [horses snorting, whinnying]

517
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,564
[men yelling, whooping]

518
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,577
Come on, men!

519
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,291
- [man 1 ] We're coming for you, nigger!
- [man 2] Hee-haw!

520
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,930
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

521
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,307
That's way too simple for these jokers.

522
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,686
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

523
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,899
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

524
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,987
Damn.

525
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,950
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

526
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,160
We ready or what?

527
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,705
[Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

528
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,249
- [fabric ripping]
- Oh... Oh, shit.

529
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,626
I just made it worse.

530
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,837
Who made this goddamn shit?

531
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,965
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

532
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,719
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

533
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,471
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

534
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:38,306
I coulda cut it better than this!

535
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,268
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

536
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,644
Not too good.

537
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:47,149
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

538
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,819
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

539
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,071
- Shit.
- [man] Yeah.

540
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,282
I just made mine worse.

541
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,242
Oh, God.

542
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,952
Anybody bring any extra bags?

543
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,080
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

544
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm just askin'.

545
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,834
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

546
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,210
Oh, well, shitfire!

547
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,464
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

548
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,591
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

549
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

550
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,054
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

551
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,017
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

552
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,186
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

553
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,106
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

554
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,443
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

555
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

556
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,867
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

557
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,368
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

558
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,372
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

559
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:49,336
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

560
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,462
- Yeah.
- [mumbling agreements]

561
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,716
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

562
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:59,387
So how 'bout no bags this time,

563
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:04,559
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

564
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,728
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

565
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,232
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

566
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,400
But nobody can see.

567
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,652
So?

568
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,695
So it'd be nice to see.

569
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,617
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

570
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:26,164
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

571
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,125
- [overlapping shouts]
- [man] Sons of bitches!

572
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,628
I can't see shit!

573
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,423
[Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

574
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,260
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

575
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,053
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

576
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,638
- What?
- They tricked us!

577
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
Well, where are they?

578
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,432
Auf Wiedersehen.

579
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,186
- [all shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

580
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,940
Oh! [chuckles]

581
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,149
Bull's-eye.

582
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,986
- [men yelling]
- [horses whinnying]

583
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,447
- [Django] Look at 'em run.
- [all shouting]

584
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,661
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

585
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,788
Goddamn it!

586
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,170
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

587
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,510
Would you care to?

588
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,144
Can't see shit outta this!

589
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,938
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

590
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
[Schultz]
Big Daddy's getting away.

591
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,860
I got him.

592
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:43,825
- [slow-motion impact sound]
- [Big Daddy grunting]

593
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,168
Got him.

594
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,009
[chuckles] The kid's a natural.

595
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,349
[animal yipping nearby]

596
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,482
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

597
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

598
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,779
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

599
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

600
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,952
Broomhilda is the name of a character

601
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,039
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

602
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,166
There's a story about Broomhilda?

603
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh, yes, there is.

604
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,552
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

605
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

606
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:59,859
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

607
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,782
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

608
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,036
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

609
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:11,454
What she do?

610
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,873
I can't exactly remember.

611
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,710
She disobeys him in some way.

612
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,046
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

613
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

614
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,258
It's a German legend,

615
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,219
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

616
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,432
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

617
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,188
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

618
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:42,986
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

619
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,576
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

620
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,245
Does a fella arise?

621
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,373
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

622
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,584
A fella named Siegfried.

623
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,294
Does Siegfried save her?

624
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,090
Quite spectacularly so.

625
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,262
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

626
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:14,142
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

627
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,811
And he walks through hellfire...

628
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,524
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

629
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,322
I know how he feel.

630
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,659
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

631
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:41,336
Now, look, Django...

632
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,301
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

633
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,014
...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

634
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:58,520
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

635
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,564
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

636
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,694
But let me ask you a question.

637
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,621
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

638
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,458
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

639
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,627
What's not to like?

640
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,213
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

641
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

642
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,468
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

643
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,595
but normally, that's a good thing.

644
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,598
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

645
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,767
What you mean "partner up"?

646
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:42,230
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

647
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,233
...I give you a third of my bounties.

648
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:50,363
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

649
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,449
I'll take you to Greenville myself

650
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,828
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

651
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,834
Why you care what happen to me?

652
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,546
Why you care if I find my wife?

653
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,089
Frankly...

654
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

655
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:16,264
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

656
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,227
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

657
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,649
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

658
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,444
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

659
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:39,370
[medium-tempo song plays]

660
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,741
[man] You got her.

661
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:51,461
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

662
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,339
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

663
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,090
He'll have a loved one with him.

664
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,760
Maybe even share a last word.

665
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,805
That's better than most of them get.

666
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,266
Damn sight better than he deserves.

667
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,776
Put down the rifle.

668
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,489
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

669
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,617
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

670
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,081
Read it aloud.

671
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,750
Consider that today's lesson.

672
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,838

01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:58,163
[Calvin] Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

857
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,082
[man screaming]

858
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,042
[Calvin] There you go!

859
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,838
There you go! Look at that.

860
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,883
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

861
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,094
Do what I told you, boy!

862
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:13,720
- There you go!
- [bones cracking]

863
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,181
- No!
- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!

864
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:19,393
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

865
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,645
[man screaming]

866
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,314
- Oh, no, Luigi.
- [screaming]

867
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,446
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [screaming]

868
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,240
Oh...

869
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,243
- [panting]
- [man continues screaming]

870
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:41,331
[playing pool]

871
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,625
[screaming continues]

872
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:45,085
Finish him.

873
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,133
Go on, boy, finish him!

874
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,094
[screaming halts]

875
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,347
[Moguy] That's why they
call him Big Fred.

876
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,934
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

877
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,312
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

878
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:06,481
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

879
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,817
Mercedes.

880
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:31,131
Tequila.

881
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,643
What's your name?

882
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,313
Django.

883
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,400
Can you spell it?

884
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:56,573
D-J-A-N-G-O.

885
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,576
The D is silent.

886
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,328
I know.

887
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:09,127
[speaks foreign language]

888
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,798
[Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

889
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,675
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

890
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,427
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

891
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,347
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

892
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,515
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

893
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:25,560
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

894
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,401
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

895
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,860
Yessir.

896
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,165
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

897
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,542
[Calvin chuckles]

898
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,337
Where'd you dig him up?

899
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:55,757
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

900
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,553
I've heard tell about you.

901
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,056
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

902
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,350
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

903
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:09,730
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

904
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

905
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,489
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

906
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:21,867
No offense given...

907
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,910
...none taken.

908
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,787
[Schultz] Monsieur Candie...

909
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:29,458
...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

910
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,084
One...

911
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,838
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

912
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,841
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

913
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,843
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

914
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,845
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

915
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,097
Do not spare the rum.

916
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:47,768
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

917
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,644
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

918
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:54,941
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

919
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,613
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

920
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,199
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

921
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

922
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,204
at above top-dollar market price.

923
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,915
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

924
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

925
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,631
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

926
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,133
We were discussin' my curiosity.

927
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,428
Thank you.

928
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:26,306
[Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

929
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:31,770
Sheba... you stay right there.

930
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
I know you didn't mean me.

931
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,734
- Prost!
- German.

932
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,447
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

933
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,658
I'm doing business with both y'all.

934
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,244
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

935
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,164
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

936
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,499
Hm.

937
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,793
So...

938
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,878
...Bright Boy...

939
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:59,005
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

940
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,341
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

941
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,009
Not for top dollar.

942
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,222
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

943
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

944
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,935
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

945
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,062
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

946
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,191
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

947
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:22,654
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

948
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,577
Well, you won't sell your best.

949
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,163
You won't even sell your second best.

950
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:35,000
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

951
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,087
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

952
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,923
[chortles]
...who knows what could happen?

953
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

954
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,641
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

955
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,437
How much would you say, Django?

956
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,525
Twelve thousand dollars.

957
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,903
[straw slurping]

958
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:09,075
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

959
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,161
but now you have my attention.

960
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:30,514
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

961
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,099
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

962
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:37,187
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

963
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

964
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,942
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

965
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

966
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,745
[Calvin] Django.

967
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:02,170
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

968
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:07,509
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

969
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,805
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

970
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,643
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

971
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,311
The exceptional nigger.

972
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,356
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

973
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:23,650
Sun is up.

974
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,695
Shining on all of us.

975
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,369
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

976
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:35,829
Quite an honor.

977
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,706
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

978
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,251
<i>[Calvin] But I do believe that,
given time,</i>

979
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,379
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

980
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,173
...become if not frequent...

981
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,051
...more frequent.

982
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:56,391
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

983
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,436
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

984
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,105
[men laughing]

985
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,700
- Whoa!
- [whinnying]

986
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,622
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

987
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,707
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

988
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,916
Are you kidding me?

989
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,085
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

990
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:26,796
Now take your hand off your pistol!

991
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,675
Butch, that means you too.

992
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,888
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

993
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,600
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

994
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,894
He broke my collarbone!

995
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:45,357
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

996
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,568
- [man] Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

997
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,321
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

998
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,948
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

999
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,909
You wanna hold my hand?

1000
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,370
[chuckling]

1001
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,538
[rap song playing]

1002
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,332
[clucking]

1003
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,168
Willie, take us home.

1004
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,422
[man] Start moving!

1005
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,055
Head 'em out!

1006
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:04,227
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1007
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,645
No, sir.

1008
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,313
You want a boot heel in it?

1009
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:09,482
No, sir.

1010
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:12,694
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1011
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1012
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,699
Now move, nigger!

1013
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,659
[horse snorting]

1014
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,953
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1015
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1016
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:27,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:30,962
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? [chuckles]

1018
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,464
Indeed.

1019
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:38,344
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1020
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:42,223
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1021
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,477
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1022
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:50,023
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1023
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,819
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1024
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:57,030
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1025
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,661
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1026
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:07,207
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1027
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,250
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1028
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,878
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1029
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:16,674
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1030
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

1031
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,762
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,431
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1033
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:28,561
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1034
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:33,399
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1035
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,569
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1036
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,280
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1037
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:45,703
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1038
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

1039
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,208
You remember that?

1040
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

1041
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,423
What you said was that
this is my world...

1042
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,385
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1043
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,264
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1044
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,104
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1045
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,649
...that was the general gist.

1046
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,317
[sighing]

1047
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,904
See you at Candyland.

1048
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,206
[Django]
All right, niggers, back at it.

1049
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,543
That means you too, Moonlight.

1050
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,013
[dogs barking nearby]

1051
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,332
[dogs barking loudly]

1052
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,801
[Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1053
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:27,221
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1054
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,474
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1055
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:30,934
[Calvin] Yes, you can.

1056
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,646
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1057
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:37,231
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1058
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:40,026
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

1059
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,236
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1060
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,947
Hush up! Hey!

1061
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,741
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1062
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:49,160
[dogs whining]

1063
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,712
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

1064
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:01,547
Yessir.

1065
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,758
[dogs resume barking]

1066
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,389
[barking stops]

1067
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,239
How long was he loose?

1068
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:29,659
[speech slurred]
A night. Day.

1069
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,452
Half the other night.

1070
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,122
How far he get off the property?

1071
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,999
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1072
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,292
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1073
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,836
Hm.

1074
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,424
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1075
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,217
One-a this new lot.

1076
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,096
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1077
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,765
[D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

1078
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:54,434
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

1079
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,020
Now, no beggin'.

1080
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,647
No playin' on my soft heart.

1081
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,653
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

1082
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,118
I done paid $500 for you.

1083
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:17,165
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1084
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,709
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1085
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,755
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1086
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,632
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1087
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1088
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,471
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1089
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:32,680
Yessir.

1090
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,393
Still, the fact remains:

1091
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,189
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1092
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,900
So what about my $500, huh?

1093
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,695
What about my $500?

1094
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,782
You gonna reimburse me?

1095
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1096
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,375
- [laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

1097
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,671
[laughter continues]

1098
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,383
I'll reimburse you!

1099
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,347
You will?

1100
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,100
Yep.

1101
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,563
You'll pay $500

1102
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,192
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1103
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,485
No, he won't.

1104
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:31,823
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1105
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,700
Matter of fact, so am I.

1106
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,328
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1107
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,288
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1108
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,250
You heard him.

1109
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:55,179
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1110
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:59,016
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1111
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,769
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1112
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,481
That right.

1113
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,817
[Calvin] For that matter...

1114
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,695
...nor have I.

1115
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:17,952
Now...

1116
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,248
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1117
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:28,087
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1118
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,756
He's your nigger.

1119
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,596
Mr. Stonesipher?

1120
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:41,350
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1121
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:46,314
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
- [barks echoing]

1122
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,984
Get 'im, get 'im!

1123
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,529
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1124
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:55,114
Whoo-ee!

1125
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:02,955
- [dogs snarling]
- [screaming]

1126
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,519
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1127
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,855
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1128
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:32,652
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1129
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,528
Hm.

1130
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,989
You are used to it?

1131
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:40,117
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1132
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:44,997
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1133
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,791
...whenever you're ready.

1134
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,336
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1135
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,129
Let's get to it.

1136
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,718
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1137
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,347
Follow me.

1138
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,653
[snarling]

1139
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:22,910
[clucking]

1140
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,287
[nickering]

1141
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,342
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1142
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,345
Stand up straight, now!

1143
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
Get up there.

1144
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,558
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1145
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,352
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1146
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,604
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1147
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,538
[indistinct chatter]

1148
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,874
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1149
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1150
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,838
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1151
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,341
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1152
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:26,886
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir. [laughs]

1153
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:30,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1154
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:34,685
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
- [all chuckling]

1155
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:38,689
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1156
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:40,941
[laughing]

1157
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:45,571
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1158
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,406
Hey, Snowball?

1159
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,203
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1160
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,206
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1161
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,041
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1162
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,584
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1163
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,836
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1164
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:05,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1165
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,843
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1166
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,262
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1167
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:14,225
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1168
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:17,645
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1169
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,815
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1170
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:25,903
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1171
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,446
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1172
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:31,116
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1173
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:33,661
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1174
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,496
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1175
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,290
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1176
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,793
Yessir. I understand.

1177
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,420
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1178
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:45,714
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1179
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,551
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1180
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,928
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1181
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,681
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1182
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:56,141
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1183
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,352
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1184
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,854
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1185
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,274
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1186
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,651
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1187
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:07,736
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1188
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1189
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,576
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1190
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,203
Go on, now.

1191
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1192
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,041
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1193
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:24,753
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1194
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,088
Now...

1195
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,926
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1196
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:34,179
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1197
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:39,393
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1198
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,564
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1199
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:48,193
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1200
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,739
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1201
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:54,033
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1202
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,242
You know where it is.

1203
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,161
Like you on a rope!

1204
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,123
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1205
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:04,835
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1206
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,797
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1207
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:09,923
Nigger gal?

1208
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:13,093
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1209
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,846
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1210
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:20,184
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1211
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,521
[laughs] You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1212
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:28,067
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1213
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,069
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1214
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:31,654
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1215
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,489
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1216
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:36,325
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1217
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:40,204
- What?
- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1218
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:42,873
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1219
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,793
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1220
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,419
She bein' punished.

1221
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,922
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1222
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1223
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,427
- Two.
- When did she go?

1224
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,097
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1225
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,933
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1226
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:05,354
[Stephen] Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1227
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,817
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1228
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,903
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1229
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,279
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1230
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,115
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1231
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:19,076
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1232
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,912
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1233
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,124
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1234
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:29,211
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1235
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,337
Hildi is my nigger.

1236
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,674
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1237
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,052
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1238
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:39,638
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1239
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,266
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1240
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:46,603
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1241
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,938
Yessir.

1242
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,817
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1243
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,362
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1244
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,905
[Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.

1245
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:01,952
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1246
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,997
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1247
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:09,668
[clucking]

1248
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1249
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,299
Cora! Come here!

1250
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,510
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1251
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:21,054
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1252
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:23,682
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1253
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:27,227
- Yessir.
- [soft guitar music plays]

1254
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:09,978
[Hildi screams]

1255
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,524
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1256
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:16,109
[Hildi yelling]

1257
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,822
[gasping, screaming]

1258
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:23,575
[sobbing]

1259
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:47,099
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1260
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,479
[slow-tempo song plays]

1261
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:58,652
[woman sings in foreign language]

1262
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:15,520
[exhales]

1263
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,737
Hello, ladies.

1264
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,282
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1265
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:33,914
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1266
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1267
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:40,879
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1268
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,840
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1269
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,926
- [chuckles]
- [forced chuckle]

1270
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1271
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:54,226
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1272
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,898
The doctor here speaks German.

1273
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,860
And I've been informed you do as well?

1274
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,572
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1275
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,328
[speaking German]

1276
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,747
Ha! [laughs]

1277
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,916
Astonishing.

1278
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,751
[speaking German]

1279
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,092
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1280
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,728
<i>Ja.</i>

1281
01:37:58,373 --> 01:37:59,958
[speaks German]

1282
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,586
Don't be afraid.

1283
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:43,168
Hm. Pardon.

1284
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,052
<i>Danke.</i>

1285
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,514
[chuckling]

1286
01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:22,350
[repeats German phrase]

1287
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,075
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1288
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:41,244
[gasping]

1289
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:44,831
[moaning]

1290
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:50,962
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1291
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:53,882
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1292
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,300
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1293
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,428
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1294
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:01,348
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1295
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,725
[laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1296
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,478
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1297
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:12,442
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1298
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:16,988
But the best three by far were Samson...

1299
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,950
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1300
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:23,453
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1301
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,206
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1302
01:41:26,373 --> 01:41:29,459
[chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1303
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1304
01:41:32,379 --> 01:41:34,381
[all laugh]

1305
01:41:35,882 --> 01:41:41,221
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1306
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:45,100
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1307
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:49,020
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1308
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,773
Samson's the champion.

1309
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,733
Them other two pretty good.

1310
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:56,528
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1311
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:57,821
It's all right.

1312
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,073
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1313
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,618
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1314
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:08,081
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1315
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,332
Is that right?

1316
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:13,586
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1317
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:14,713
Hm.

1318
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,340
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1319
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1320
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:24,556
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1321
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,475
- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1322
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:30,854
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1323
01:42:31,021 --> 01:42:32,647
[all chuckling]

1324
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:34,190
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1325
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:35,358
More like Nigger-les.

1326
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,652
[laughing]

1327
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:43,199
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1328
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,494
...'the right nigger.'"

1329
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:50,957
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1330
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,835
But is he right as rain?

1331
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,504
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1332
01:42:56,671 --> 01:43:00,467
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1333
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:02,552
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1334
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,471
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1335
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:05,638
Nobody.

1336
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,640
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1337
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:09,184
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1338
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,353
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1339
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:12,729
Hm-mm.

1340
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,108
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1341
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,319
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1342
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:23,448
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1343
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1344
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
First thing's first.

1345
01:43:32,624 --> 01:43:34,250
[whispers in German]

1346
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,838
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1347
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:40,882
Famously.

1348
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,302
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1349
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:47,806
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1350
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:49,808
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1351
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:52,060
[laughing]

1352
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,270
Two weeks in Boston!

1353
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:57,232
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [coughing]

1354
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,109
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1355
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:04,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1356
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,743
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1357
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,787
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,288
You might-a caught yourself

1359
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:13,706
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1360
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:15,959
[Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1361
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
- [Stephen] Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1362
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:19,921
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1363
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,049
Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]

1364
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,759
[Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.

1365
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:27,178
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1366
01:44:27,345 --> 01:44:31,850
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1367
01:44:32,976 --> 01:44:34,102
[Lara Lee giggles]

1368
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:36,729
Well, naturally.

1369
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:40,525
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1370
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,486
- not the plucked chicken.
- [all chuckle]

1371
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:46,156
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1372
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:48,241
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1373
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,451
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes,

1374
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:51,619
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1375
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,997
You know that nigger, don't you?

1376
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:56,207
- Who?
- "Who?"

1377
01:44:56,374 --> 01:44:59,461
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1378
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,214
At the table?

1379
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:04,632
I don't know him.

1380
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,844
- You don't know him.
- No.

1381
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:10,847
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1382
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:14,017
[chuckles]

1383
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,937
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1384
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,359
OK.

1385
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:27,739
Yeah. If you say so.

1386
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:37,624
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1387
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,172
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1388
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:46,674
What would your price be?

1389
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:48,801
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1390
01:45:48,968 --> 01:45:52,430
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1391
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,643
...9,000. Maybe.

1392
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,691
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1393
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:06,027
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1394
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,153
Sure wasn't.

1395
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,030
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1396
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,366
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1397
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,952
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1398
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:15,745
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1399
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:18,873
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1400
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:23,294
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1401
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,924
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1402
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,927
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1403
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,935
[deep inhale]

1404
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:43,189
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1405
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:44,649
[chuckles]

1406
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,529
[slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1407
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:53,032
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.

1408
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,326
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1409
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:59,038
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1410
01:46:59,205 --> 01:47:02,375
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1411
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,335
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1412
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:07,589
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1413
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:10,800
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1414
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,968
Hm-mm.

1415
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,803
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1416
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,598
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1417
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:21,477
So, say I return in about...

1418
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:25,940
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1419
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:27,358
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1420
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:29,569
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1421
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:32,697
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1422
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:36,576
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1423
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,494
Gentlemen...

1424
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,497
...may I propose a toast.

1425
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:48,755
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1426
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:51,591
- [all chuckling]
- To The Black Hercules.

1427
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,134
[Stephen] The Black Hercules.

1428
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
[speaks low]
To The Black Hercules.

1429
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,723
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]

1430
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,308
Hm.

1431
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,728
Hildi, top my drink off.

1432
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:11,861
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1433
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:15,239
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1434
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:18,159
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1435
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,079
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1436
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:22,580
through a bramble bush.

1437
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:25,833
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1438
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,585
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1439
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,920
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1440
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,546
[Hildi] No, sir.

1441
01:48:30,713 --> 01:48:32,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1442
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:35,885
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1443
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,305
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1444
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:41,599
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1445
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:44,811
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1446
01:48:44,977 --> 01:48:46,729
No, we just talked and...

1447
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:49,273
[Calvin] Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1448
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,234
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1449
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,444
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1450
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:56,698
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1451
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,825
- Go on.
- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.

1452
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,369
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1453
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,455
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Düsseldorf.

1454
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:07,625
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1455
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,378
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1456
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:14,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1457
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:16,467
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1458
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:18,553
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1459
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:19,846
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1460
01:49:20,012 --> 01:49:22,265
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1461
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:26,102
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1462
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,189
- [exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1463
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:33,025
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1464
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:36,028
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1465
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,953
[Lara Lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1466
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,788
[approaching footsteps]

1467
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:50,626
- [Lara Lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!

1468
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:53,254
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1469
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,756
Come on in here.

1470
01:50:01,262 --> 01:50:05,057
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1471
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,185
You say you ain't know him.

1472
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,395
Huh?

1473
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:15,151
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1474
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,697
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1475
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,493
Mr. Stephen...

1476
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,495
...I don't.

1477
01:50:25,661 --> 01:50:28,164
Why is you lying to me?

1478
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:31,876
I ain't.

1479
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,545
Then why is you crying?

1480
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,881
You scarin' me.

1481
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,968
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1482
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,723
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1483
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,018
was positively soul-enriching.

1484
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,063
[Calvin] Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1485
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,066
You stay right here.

1486
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:04,909
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1487
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:07,912
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1488
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:15,878
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1489
01:51:16,045 --> 01:51:17,421
I'm all ears.

1490
01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:19,298
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1491
01:51:19,924 --> 01:51:21,509
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1492
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,012
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1493
01:51:26,138 --> 01:51:28,266
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1494
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:31,143
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1495
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,436
Excuse him.

1496
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:36,357
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1497
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,442
You mean get up out of my chair?

1498
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:41,946
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1499
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1500
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,744
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1501
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,788
We're having white cake!

1502
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,291
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1503
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:57,795
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1504
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,755
[whispers] Meet me in the library.

1505
01:51:59,922 --> 01:52:03,009
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1506
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:05,052
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1507
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:10,224
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1508
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:11,559
Yessir.

1509
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:16,147
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1510
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:18,065
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1511
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:21,861
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1512
01:52:22,028 --> 01:52:23,321
[all chuckle]

1513
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,657
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1514
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:34,624
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1515
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:39,462
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1516
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:45,051
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1517
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:47,887
[chuckles] The circus?

1518
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:49,555
[fire crackling]

1519
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,145
What is the matter?

1520
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:06,489
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1521
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:10,201
- They wants that girl.
- [chuckling]

1522
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,120
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1523
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,457
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1524
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:20,294
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1525
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:22,630
They here for that girl.

1526
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,424
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1527
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:29,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1528
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1529
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,059
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1530
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1531
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:40,106
But he's just about to buy

1532
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:43,484
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1533
01:53:43,651 --> 01:53:46,654
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1534
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
Where you gettin' all this?

1535
01:53:55,204 --> 01:53:56,998
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1536
01:53:57,164 --> 01:53:59,667
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1537
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:04,130
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1538
01:54:04,296 --> 01:54:06,132
She probably his wife.

1539
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,093
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1540
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,346
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1541
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:16,892
If she's who they want...

1542
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:21,772
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1543
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:25,443
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1544
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:31,073
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1545
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:35,453
Yes, it did.

1546
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,416
His wife, huh?

1547
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,007
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1548
01:54:48,174 --> 01:54:49,592
[chuckles]

1549
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:53,304
Those lying...

1550
01:54:54,138 --> 01:55:00,144
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1551
01:55:02,354 --> 01:55:03,522
Sons of bitches!

1552
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,944
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1553
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:11,655
Oh, there you are.

1554
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:14,617
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1555
01:55:14,784 --> 01:55:16,243
[all chuckling]

1556
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:18,579
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1557
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,832
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1558
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:25,044
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1559
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,295
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1560
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:30,341
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1561
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,760
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1562
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:49,735
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1563
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:54,698
Apropos, before your exit,

1564
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:58,869
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1565
01:55:59,036 --> 01:56:01,956
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1566
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:04,250
And we will again. In a moment.

1567
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,768
Who's your little friend?

1568
01:56:25,146 --> 01:56:26,188
[clearing throat]

1569
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,233
This is Ben.

1570
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:35,573
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1571
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:38,159
And I do mean a long damn time.

1572
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:42,997
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1573
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,916
...and my daddy's daddy.

1574
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,669
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1575
01:56:51,505 --> 01:56:53,174
...Old Ben took care of me.

1576
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:59,555
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1577
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:05,603
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1578
01:57:07,229 --> 01:57:12,526
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1579
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:17,573
...surrounded by black faces.

1580
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,952
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1581
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:25,289
I only had one question:

1582
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,462
- Why don't they kill us?
- [laughs]

1583
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:39,637
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1584
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:44,725
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1585
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:50,022
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1586
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:53,609
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1587
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:57,655
But he never did.

1588
01:57:59,531 --> 01:58:00,824
Why not?

1589
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:06,997
You see, the science of phrenology

1590
01:58:07,164 --> 01:58:12,253
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1591
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,800
In the skull of the African here,

1592
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,094
the area associated
with submissiveness

1593
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:25,766
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1594
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,519
[sawing]

1595
01:58:41,282 --> 01:58:43,242
If you examine...

1596
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:46,787
...this piece of skull here...

1597
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:56,672
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1598
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,971
Here, here and here.

1599
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,389
Now...

1600
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:10,561
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1601
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:13,230
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1602
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,734
most associated with... creativity.

1603
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,236
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1604
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,989
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1605
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,450
unburdened by genius,

1606
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:28,787
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1607
01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:31,248
...servility.

1608
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:34,001
Now, Bright Boy...

1609
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:37,087
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1610
01:59:39,548 --> 01:59:41,633
But if I took this hammer here...

1611
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,096
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1612
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:52,436
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1613
01:59:53,687 --> 01:59:55,147
...as Old Ben.

1614
01:59:56,273 --> 01:59:59,860
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1615
02:00:00,027 --> 02:00:02,988
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1616
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:06,408
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1617
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:10,621
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1618
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:13,123
but that you can believe!

1619
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:16,085
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1620
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:18,629
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1621
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:25,761
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1622
02:00:30,307 --> 02:00:31,683
Where were we?

1623
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:37,564
Jackass.

1624
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:43,070
Ah, yes.

1625
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,989
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1626
02:00:46,156 --> 02:00:48,617
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1627
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,160
Am I right?

1628
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,499
Right.

1629
02:00:57,918 --> 02:00:59,420
Bring out Hildi!

1630
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:03,715
Get over there yonder.

1631
02:01:05,175 --> 02:01:07,428
- [screams]
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1632
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:08,846
[Stephen] Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1633
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:10,556
[Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1634
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,438
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1635
02:01:17,604 --> 02:01:20,357
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1636
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:24,862
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1637
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:28,073
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1638
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,202
To which you said, "$12,000."

1639
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,746
- [yells]
- Now, considering y'all

1640
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:36,874
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1641
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:41,003
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1642
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,589
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1643
02:01:43,755 --> 02:01:49,720
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1644
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:53,640
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1645
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:59,438
the price is $12,000.

1646
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:03,400
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1647
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:07,196
Yes, I do, doctor.

1648
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,033
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1649
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,745
Broomhilda here is my property.

1650
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,042
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1651
02:02:21,126 --> 02:02:23,420
And if y'all think my price...

1652
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:26,798
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1653
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:30,427
- [grunts]
- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1654
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,476
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1655
02:02:37,643 --> 02:02:39,770
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1656
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,441
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1657
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,779
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1658
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,280
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1659
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:54,326
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1660
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,870
Yes, you may.

1661
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:11,843
That 12.

1662
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:17,766
- Sold!
- [screaming]

1663
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,477
To the man with the exceptional beard

1664
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:23,981
and his unexceptional nigger.

1665
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,114
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1666
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:35,951
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1667
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:37,869
$12,000.

1668
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:43,166
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1669
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:45,794
Now, gentlemen...

1670
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,880
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1671
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,301
...we will be serving white cake.

1672
02:03:53,176 --> 02:03:54,803
[Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp]

1673
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:52,778
- [screaming]
- [dogs snarling]

1674
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:09,628
[screaming]

1675
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,973
Well done, Calvin.

1676
02:05:24,476 --> 02:05:27,354
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1677
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:32,484
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1678
02:05:36,738 --> 02:05:37,823
[Stephen] Doctor!

1679
02:05:37,989 --> 02:05:40,617
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1680
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:41,952
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1681
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,453
Let it be.

1682
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:45,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1683
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,124
I'll handle this.

1684
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,276
White cake?

1685
02:06:15,277 --> 02:06:17,529
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1686
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:19,781
Hm.

1687
02:06:24,536 --> 02:06:25,537
[Calvin chuckles softly]

1688
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:30,208
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1689
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:35,672
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1690
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:37,674
D'Artagnan.

1691
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:42,262
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1692
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,889
Come again?

1693
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:51,021
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

1694
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:52,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1695
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,566
I figured you must be an admirer.

1696
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,154
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1697
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:03,033
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1698
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,160
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1699
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:09,039
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1700
02:07:11,249 --> 02:07:16,421
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1701
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:20,509
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1702
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:24,596
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1703
02:07:28,433 --> 02:07:31,228
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1704
02:07:31,394 --> 02:07:33,063
- May I?
- Of course.

1705
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,606
Thank you.

1706
02:07:36,733 --> 02:07:39,694
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1707
02:07:39,861 --> 02:07:42,030
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1708
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:44,407
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1709
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,578
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1710
02:08:09,891 --> 02:08:11,101
Thank you.

1711
02:08:14,688 --> 02:08:16,982
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1712
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,611
...consider yourself a free woman.

1713
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,500
Mr. Candie...

1714
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:41,256
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1715
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:45,886
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1716
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:48,388
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1717
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:53,226
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1718
02:08:57,105 --> 02:08:58,398
Let's go.

1719
02:08:59,357 --> 02:09:00,901
Come on.

1720
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:04,696
One more moment, doctor!

1721
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,616
What?

1722
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,456
It's a custom here in the South...

1723
02:09:14,956 --> 02:09:20,337
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1724
02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,214
It implies good faith.

1725
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:26,426
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1726
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,887
...in my house, doctor.

1727
02:09:29,763 --> 02:09:32,682
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1728
02:09:32,849 --> 02:09:34,851
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1729
02:09:35,018 --> 02:09:38,313
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1730
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:41,942
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1731
02:09:42,108 --> 02:09:43,902
No, I don't.

1732
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:50,784
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1733
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,914
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1734
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,708
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1735
02:09:59,584 --> 02:10:02,420
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1736
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,883
...you don't shake my hand.

1737
02:10:07,842 --> 02:10:13,515
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1738
02:10:13,682 --> 02:10:15,433
I don't think so.

1739
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:17,602
Mr. Pooch?

1740
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:24,150
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1741
02:10:24,317 --> 02:10:26,069
you cut her ass down.

1742
02:10:28,989 --> 02:10:30,323
[cocking shotgun]

1743
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:51,428
You really want me to shake your hand?

1744
02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:54,681
I insist.

1745
02:10:55,765 --> 02:10:58,435
If you insist.

1746
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:01,980
[metal springing noise]

1747
02:11:15,035 --> 02:11:18,038
No! Calvin!

1748
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:20,707
Calvin!

1749
02:11:20,874 --> 02:11:23,209
[slow heartbeat rhythm]

1750
02:11:27,047 --> 02:11:29,549
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1751
02:11:32,385 --> 02:11:34,137
[sobbing]

1752
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:43,980
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1753
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:45,940
- [screaming]
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1754
02:11:46,107 --> 02:11:47,817
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

1755
02:11:51,905 --> 02:11:52,947
Ah! [screams]

1756
02:11:53,114 --> 02:11:54,282
[grunting]

1757
02:11:57,827 --> 02:11:59,245
[screaming]

1758
02:12:02,999 --> 02:12:04,125
Holy...!

1759
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:06,503
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1760
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:09,255
[overlapping gunfire]

1761
02:12:10,673 --> 02:12:11,883
[man] Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1762
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,385
- Get the...!
- [screaming continues]

1763
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:17,847
[man] Damn it, son of a bitch!

1764
02:12:18,014 --> 02:12:19,557
What...? Fucking...

1765
02:12:19,724 --> 02:12:21,351
Goddamn it!

1766
02:12:22,685 --> 02:12:24,979
- What the fuck is going on?
- [screams]

1767
02:12:25,146 --> 02:12:27,107
You shot me!

1768
02:12:27,273 --> 02:12:30,360
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- [man] Sorry, Jessie!

1769
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,656
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1770
02:12:46,584 --> 02:12:48,086
[whimpering]

1771
02:12:51,422 --> 02:12:52,924
[screaming]

1772
02:12:58,346 --> 02:13:01,015
[yelling]

1773
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:05,812
[man] Aim low!

1774
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:09,983
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1775
02:13:10,942 --> 02:13:13,111
[screams] God! Oh, my God!

1776
02:13:13,278 --> 02:13:15,238
[man continues screaming]
Motherfucker!

1777
02:13:15,405 --> 02:13:17,240
[slow-motion gunshot]

1778
02:13:21,661 --> 02:13:23,663
[rap song playing]

1779
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,248
Shit!

1780
02:13:26,457 --> 02:13:27,333
[screaming]

1781
02:14:22,222 --> 02:14:23,306
Shit.

1782
02:14:23,473 --> 02:14:24,515
[door squeaks open]

1783
02:14:33,233 --> 02:14:35,318
[overlapping gunshots]

1784
02:14:35,485 --> 02:14:36,903
[Stephen] Hold your fire!

1785
02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,824
Hold your fire!

1786
02:14:43,743 --> 02:14:45,620
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1787
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:47,956
[gunfire stops]

1788
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:55,755
Django!

1789
02:14:55,922 --> 02:14:57,173
What?

1790
02:15:00,385 --> 02:15:02,011
We got your woman!

1791
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:05,932
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1792
02:15:06,099 --> 02:15:08,685
- [gasping]
- You don't stop all that carrying on,

1793
02:15:08,851 --> 02:15:11,896
- he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
- [gasping]

1794
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:16,025
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1795
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,861
Or...

1796
02:15:19,028 --> 02:15:22,031
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1797
02:15:23,157 --> 02:15:25,326
- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1798
02:15:25,493 --> 02:15:29,205
Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1799
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:34,919
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1800
02:15:36,379 --> 02:15:38,798
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1801
02:15:38,965 --> 02:15:41,676
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1802
02:15:41,843 --> 02:15:44,887
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1803
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:48,933
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1804
02:15:51,185 --> 02:15:54,939
Don't do it. [sniffling]
You give me up.

1805
02:15:55,106 --> 02:15:56,941
- [Stephen] Six!
- Just let me go.

1806
02:15:57,108 --> 02:15:58,651
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1807
02:15:58,818 --> 02:16:00,403
- [Hildi] Django.
- [Stephen] Eight!

1808
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:03,072
- I love you.
- Nine!

1809
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:05,325
- [Django] Hold it!
- No.

1810
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:08,411
I give up.

1811
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:12,373
I can't hear you, nigger.

1812
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:15,043
I said I give up!

1813
02:16:25,345 --> 02:16:28,890
[up-tempo song plays]

1814
02:16:38,149 --> 02:16:40,693
No! [sobbing]

1815
02:16:41,861 --> 02:16:43,321
No!

1816
02:17:50,513 --> 02:17:53,516
[door opening]

1817
02:17:53,683 --> 02:17:56,018
[spurs clinking]

1818
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:17,165
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1819
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:24,589
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1820
02:18:25,548 --> 02:18:28,301
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1821
02:18:29,302 --> 02:18:31,512
We found your wanted posters...

1822
02:18:32,096 --> 02:18:34,307
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1823
02:18:35,725 --> 02:18:37,351
I got to say...

1824
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:41,355
...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1825
02:18:41,522 --> 02:18:44,567
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1826
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:48,237
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1827
02:18:50,281 --> 02:18:51,741
[sizzling]

1828
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:56,329
[Django yells, muffled]

1829
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:57,538
[grunting]

1830
02:18:57,705 --> 02:18:59,540
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

1831
02:18:59,707 --> 02:19:02,376
- [yelling]
- On three. One...

1832
02:19:02,543 --> 02:19:05,421
- [screaming]
- I got you. Two...

1833
02:19:05,588 --> 02:19:08,799
- [screaming]
- Calm down, now, here it comes.

1834
02:19:08,966 --> 02:19:11,552
- [screaming]
- [Stephen] Captain?

1835
02:19:11,719 --> 02:19:13,471
Miss Lara want to see you.

1836
02:19:14,305 --> 02:19:18,226
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1837
02:19:18,392 --> 02:19:22,188
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1838
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:25,816
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1839
02:19:25,983 --> 02:19:27,485
[Django moaning]

1840
02:19:27,652 --> 02:19:29,779
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1841
02:19:37,036 --> 02:19:38,829
How disappointing.

1842
02:19:45,336 --> 02:19:47,129
[hissing]

1843
02:19:47,296 --> 02:19:48,631
[chuckles]

1844
02:20:01,769 --> 02:20:03,104
[Stephen] You leavin'.

1845
02:20:04,772 --> 02:20:07,817
This here what you take with you.

1846
02:20:11,195 --> 02:20:14,657
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

1847
02:20:14,824 --> 02:20:18,244
could talk about
for the last few hours.

1848
02:20:18,411 --> 02:20:22,123
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1849
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:25,001
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1850
02:20:25,167 --> 02:20:30,464
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1851
02:20:30,631 --> 02:20:36,178
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1852
02:20:37,763 --> 02:20:40,016
...when you snip a nigger's nuts,

02:20:46,355 --> 02:20:49,525
[chuckles]
Well, more than most.

1856
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:56,115
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1857
02:20:56,282 --> 02:21:00,286
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1858
02:21:01,329 --> 02:21:04,040
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1859
02:21:04,206 --> 02:21:07,501
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1860
02:21:07,668 --> 02:21:10,880
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1861
02:21:11,047 --> 02:21:13,174
We do that shit all the time.

1862
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:19,221
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1863
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:23,059
Lo and behold,

02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:28,064
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1865
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:31,692
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1866
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:39,200
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1867
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,912
henceforth, till the day you die,

1868
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:46,207
all day, every day,

1869
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:49,210
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1870
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:54,006
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1871
02:21:54,173 --> 02:21:58,761
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1872
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:01,847
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1873
02:22:02,014 --> 02:22:04,433
and say, "Get to work!"

1874
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:07,019
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1875
02:22:07,186 --> 02:22:09,522
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1876
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:13,359
Oh, they does that real good.

1877
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,111
They gonna work ya.

1878

All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1879

Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1880
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:25,621

1881

Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

11,500, actually.

What the fuck are you talking about?

1892
02:23:40,196 --> 02:23:44,867
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1893
02:23:45,034 --> 02:23:47,870
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1894

You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1895
02:23:50,706 --> 02:23:54,919
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1896

You can't steal it.

1897
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:58,339
You got to earn it, white boy.

1898
02:23:59,298 --> 02:24:01,300
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1899
02:24:01,467 --> 02:24:04,678
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1900
02:24:04,845 --> 02:24:06,972
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1901
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:09,475
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1902

Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1903
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:14,563
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1904
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:16,315
the Bacall Gang.

1905
02:24:16,482 --> 02:24:19,735
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1906
02:24:19,902 --> 02:24:23,239
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1907
02:24:23,405 --> 02:24:26,659
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1908
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:29,537

You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1912
02:24:37,419 --> 02:24:38,963
But it ain't got to be that way.

1913

You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1914
02:24:42,591 --> 02:24:43,676
What'd these jokers do again?

1915

- I'm a bounty hunter.

1925
02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:17,543
Yesterday, as a free man,

1926
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:22,256
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1927
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,966
Dr. King Schultz.

1928
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:28,888
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1929
02:25:29,054 --> 02:25:31,974
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1930
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,644
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1931
02:25:35,811 --> 02:25:39,148
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1932
02:25:39,315 --> 02:25:43,485
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1933
02:25:45,487 --> 02:25:47,406
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1934
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:50,367
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1935
02:25:50,534 --> 02:25:53,871
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1936
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,333
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1937
02:25:57,499 --> 02:25:59,752
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1938
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,670
[man 1 ] What's the deal?

1939
02:26:01,837 --> 02:26:05,299
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1940
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:08,344
No, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1941
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:12,014
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1942
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:16,685
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1943
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:18,729
This is a real handbill.

1944
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:19,939
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1945
02:26:20,105 --> 02:26:22,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1946
02:26:22,358 --> 02:26:28,280
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1947
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,746
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1948
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:46,048
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1949
02:26:47,257 --> 02:26:49,885
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1950
02:26:50,594 --> 02:26:52,429
Is he a Candyland slave,

1951
02:26:52,596 --> 02:26:56,392
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1952
02:26:56,558 --> 02:27:00,229
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1953
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,940
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1954
02:27:03,607 --> 02:27:07,778
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1955
02:27:07,945 --> 02:27:09,446
