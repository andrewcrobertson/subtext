1
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,700
(lights buzzing softly)

2
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,841
(TV playing quietly)

3
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:11,664
-(sighs)
-(watch ticking)

4
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,739
Another glass of...

5
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:23,009
...rosé?

6
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:27,913
No. The hour is long past.

7
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,182
Check.

8
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,354
Check!

9
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,789
(traffic rumbling in distance)

10
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,150
The case, Santos.

11
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,318
My case. Stand back!

12
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,785
Do not advance!

13
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,288
The case, Santos.

14
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,457
Halt! Evildoer.

15
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,892
The case, Santos.

16
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,062
Not on your life, waiter.

17
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,764
(gasps)

18
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,735
-(lid clatters)
-(cat yowls)

19
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,937
(tires squealing)

20
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,141
SANTOS:
Oh, God.

21
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:29,442
(car door closes)

22
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:32,045
(gasps, screams)

23
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,446
(choking)

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,814
(groaning)

25
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:41,720
(gasps, yells)

26
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,193
(gurgles, spits)

27
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:48,928
(Santos gasps, yells)

28
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:53,732
(muffled groaning)

29
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,468
Go.

30
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:58,004
-(tires squealing)
-(screaming)

31
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,112
(screaming continues)

32
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:20,493
(gasping, moaning)

33
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,295
-Oh, Jamie!
-(phone ringing)

34
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,231
SUKIE (recorded): Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

35
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,498
Leave a message.

36
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,799
-(beeps)
-MARIAN (on phone): Hey, Jamie.

37
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,801
-Are you there?
-(Carla gasping)

38
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,303
MARIAN: Just wondering,
are you and Sukie

39
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,372
-going to shot night tonight?
-CARLA: Oh, my God!

40
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,541
MARIAN: I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.

41
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:35,874
Maybe Carla's going.

42
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,244
Do you know if Carla's going?

43
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,345
Are you going?

44
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:39,812
(grunting)

45
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,448
MARIAN:
Anyway, call me if you would.

46
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,948
Come on, back to mama.

47
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,317
MARIAN: Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.

48
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,186
Miss you, friend. It's Marian.

49
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,324
Hey. Marian.

50
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,059
Hi, Bart.

51
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,528
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

52
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,397
There's a Phish concert.

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,065
What?

54
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,833
Phish concert.

55
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,136
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

56
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,538
Yeah, oh, I...

57
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:06,539
P-H.

58
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,841
I know how to spell Phish.

59
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,477
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

60
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,280
-Y-You know, I just meant...
-Sorry, I have an engagement.

61
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,482
Okay. Bummer. (chuckles)

62
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,484
Didn't mean to, you know...

63
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,884
That's fine.

64
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,853
Anyhoo, what about...

65
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,855
Please don't use
that expression.

66
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,823
-What expression?
-"Anyhoo."

67
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,093
(laughs):
It's not an expression.

68
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,894
What is it?

69
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,398
A word.

70
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,366
Please don't use that word.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,002
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

72
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:37,470
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

73
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,039
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

74
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,906
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

75
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,342
It's very good.

76
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,444
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

77
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,812
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

78
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,848
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

79
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,287
People don't usually call them
"engagements."

80
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:56,955
Do I tell you how to speak?

81
00:04:57,624 --> 00:04:59,259
Yes.

82
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,194
The fact remains.

83
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,329
The engagement.

84
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,064
That's right.

85
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,868
-(siren wailing in distance)
-(panting)

86
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,872
-(Carla moans)
-(grunts)

87
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:16,975
(gasping, shuddering)

88
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:20,080
(giggles)

89
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,848
(moaning)

90
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:26,419
(phone ringing)

91
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:27,554
Oh, my.

92
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:29,389
Oh, my God. Oh!

93
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,591
My God!

94
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,959
(breathing heavily)

95
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:36,096
(phone continues ringing)

96
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,397
(grunting)

97
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,898
SUKIE (recorded): Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.

98
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:42,335
-Leave a message.
-(machine beeps)

99
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,504
JAMIE: Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

100
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,272
Yes, I am going tonight.

101
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,607
SUKIE:
During sex?

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,974
(Carla moaning, panting)

103
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,477
-Hi, Sukie.
-SUKIE: Wow.

104
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,179
(busy signal)

105
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,281
-Who? Here?
-SUKIE: Yes, there.

106
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh, no one's here, babe.

107
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,653
-I was just masturbating.
-SUKIE: Uh-huh.

108
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,021
Me... me time.

109
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:03,989
(Carla yells, pants)

110
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,092
Let me turn the video down.

111
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,395
-(electrical buzzing)
-(cat meows)

112
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,030
-(dance music playing)
-(lively chatter)

113
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:18,304
CARLA:
No.

114
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,972
-MARIAN: What?
-No.

115
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,008
No what, Carla?

116
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,510
You're not wearing that.

117
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,646
-I just came from work.
-I came from Toledo.

118
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,946
I don't dress like it.

119
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,216
-Is Jamie here?
-Okay, look.

120
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,419
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

121
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:34,154
And flaunt my breasts?

122
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,988
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

123
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,390
Why else would you be here?

124
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:39,025
To socialize.

125
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,527
-(feedback squeals)
-DJ: Hello, girls.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,960
(cheering)

127
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:45,665
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

128
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,634
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

129
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,702
Why not 2K?

130
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,638
(cheering)

131
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,706
New millennium, bring it on.

132
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,442
(cheering)

133
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:59,646
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

134
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,214
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

135
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:03,550
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

136
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,186
so we are gonna salt you up.

137
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,387
(cheering)

138
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,556
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

139
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:12,225
(sighs) So, first lick...

140
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,662
Here.

141
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,464
(cheering)

142
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,265
God, look at that slut.

143
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

144
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,734
SUKIE:
Don't put that woman

145
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,603
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

146
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:27,040
-JAMIE: And then second lick...
-Well, she likes to entertain.

147
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,108
WOMAN:
Ooh! Take it off! Take it off!

148
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,610
(cheering, excited shouting)

149
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:31,744
Here.

150
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:33,746
(cheering)

151
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,582
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

152
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:38,351
-JAMIE: And then third lick...
-Do you know who she's fucking?

153
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,119
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

154
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:41,621
She's seeing you, of course.

155
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,523
WOMAN:
Can I have your shirt?

156
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:44,757
Here.

157
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,626
(cheering)

158
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,127
She's a free spirit.

159
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,629
-I admire her.
-(scoffs)

160
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,231
Free. Yeah, that's the problem.

161
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,766
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

162
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,168
That's not fair, Sukie.

163
00:07:55,201 --> 00:08:00,273
And a lime wedge... right here!

164
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,408
(cheering)

165
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,743
Pull that out!

166
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,145
That is not a public receptacle!

167
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,448
-Somebody's gonna get hit.
-JAMIE: Oh. Hi, Sukie.

168
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,050
-(punch lands, body thuds)
-(crowd gasping)

169
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,786
JAMIE:
I've had it with love.

170
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,322
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

171
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,258
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

172
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,593
20th-- soon-to-be 21st--
century lesbian.

173
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,529
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

174
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:25,198
-This right here is
what it gets you. -Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,066
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

176
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,368
If you'll come help me

177
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,802
move my shit out of Sukie's
tomorrow...

178
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:30,803
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

179
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:32,505
I have my own problems.

180
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,374
What problems?

181
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:35,775
Internal.

182
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,577
-Internal?
-Yes.

183
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,212
I don't know how else to put it.

184
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,414
Problems with what I feel
internally.

185
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,316
How can you have
internal problems?

186
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,351
You got your ass all bricked up.

187
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:48,454
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

188
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:52,492
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

189
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,328
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

190
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:58,498
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

191
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,301
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

192
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,570
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

193
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,171
Please don't eat those peas.

194
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:07,707
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

195
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,376
-and then we two...
-I can't. I'm leaving town.

196
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,111
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

197
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,179
Where are you going?

198
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,847
Tallahassee, Florida.

199
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,883
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

200
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,651
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

201
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,520
Can't she move?

202
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,388
Tallahassee is very nice.

203
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,390
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

204
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,192
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

205
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,228
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

206
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:31,431
There's good birding.

207
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,132
Birding?

208
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,734
How have I missed out on this?

209
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,469
It's very pleasant.

210
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,238
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

211
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,374
I've been unhappy,

212
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,576
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

213
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,244
and it's not fair to them.

214
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm only impatient with myself.

215
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,616
Well, we can fix that.

216
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,517
We'll have you running right
in no time.

217
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,720
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

218
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,389
We get our shit together,
together.

219
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,224
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

220
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,660
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

221
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:01,928
Now you can come with me,

222
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,930
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

223
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,665
What's a drive-away?

224
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:07,233
Free one-way rental.

225
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:08,768
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

226
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,403
of the drive-away company
wants it,

227
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,505
if they got one going
near your destination.

228
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:15,241
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

229
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,543
Are you kidding? A birder?

230
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,546
I'll wear my great big old
straw hat,

231
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,516
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

232
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,385
You know how
parents and such love me.

233
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,220
They think I got charisma.

234
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,555
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

235
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,190
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

236
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:32,258
Isn't she something?"

237
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,793
I'm not sure.

238
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,228
Don't go finding a problem here.

239
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,863
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

240
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,465
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

241
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,534
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

242
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,269
SUKIE:
<i>Oh, God!</i>

243
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,271
-(sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!
-(power drill whirring)

244
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,440
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

245
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:49,942
-I don't want it anymore.
-(dog barking)

246
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,944
(hushed):
You said she wouldn't be here.

247
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:55,481
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

248
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,716
That was a gift.

249
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,384
I wanted you to have it.

250
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:02,822
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

251
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,525
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

252
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,793
No, no, no, no.

253
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,594
And take Alice, too.

254
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,329
I never liked her.

255
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,298
And she won't stop barking!

256
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:14,434
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

257
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,835
Remember, you kicked me out?

258
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:16,969
(continues sobbing)

259
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:19,906
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

260
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,009
It's your dildo, Susanne.

261
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,844
(Alice barks, growls)

262
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,512
Curlie's Drive-Away,

263
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:27,980
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

264
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,515
Curlie speaking.

265
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,250
MAN (on phone):
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

266
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,286
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

267
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,854
Yeah, you have something
to write this down?

268
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,457
-Yes, I'm writing it down.
-To 14 Tinywick Road.

269
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,825
-Right.
-Tallahassee.

270
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,293
-Sure.
-You got it?

271
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,694
-Right. Got it.
-Can you help us?

272
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:44,330
And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.

273
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:45,998
-By tomorrow.
-No later.

274
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,734
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

275
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,669
-Okay.
-Over and out.

276
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:53,740
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

277
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,609
$250 deposit and a reference.

278
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:57,944
A reference?

279
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:00,013
Somebody local
I can break his balls

280
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,981
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

281
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,750
His balls.

282
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,485
Can the reference be a woman?

283
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,620
We don't know a lot of men.

284
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,921
No kidding.

285
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,557
-Where do you want to go?
-Tallahassee.

286
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,460
Tallahassee?

287
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,896
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

288
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,498
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

289
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,766
I think Curlie here...

290
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't call me Curlie.

291
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,337
Isn't your name Curlie?

292
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,438
My name is Curlie.

293
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,074
We just met. It's too familiar.

294
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,342
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

295
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,576
No, I got good sense.

296
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,412
-Your car is a Dodge Aries.
-Oh.

297
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,848
Okay. Is that a good car?

298
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,550
Not really.

299
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,387
You sell those shirts?

300
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,056
JAMIE: There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

301
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,391
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

302
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,360
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

303
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,561
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

304
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:49,996
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

305
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,464
-but it's just...
-Jamie.

306
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:52,799
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

307
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:54,333
Down and across.

308
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,802
Right here's
the world's largest Dixie cup

309
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,070
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

310
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,838
MARIAN:
Direct route, down and across.

311
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:01,574
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

312
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,410
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

313
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:06,712
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

314
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:09,116
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

315
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,650
The interstate is not life.

316
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,085
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

317
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,686
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.

318
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,554
That's nature.

319
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,422
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

320
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,890
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

321
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,425
He said it was a rush job.

322
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,726
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

323
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,828
Tomorrow can wait a day.

324
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,429
We could even go to Miami.

325
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:24,831
Bikinis and high heels.

326
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,732
(engine revs, tires squeal)

327
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,634
A medical doctor?

328
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,802
Or a reverend?

329
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:34,107
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

330
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,409
No, not for medical doctors,
either.

331
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,111
Make up your mind--
which are you?

332
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,813
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

333
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:44,383
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

334
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,686
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

335
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,389
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

336
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,826
Well, we're here.

337
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,495
Okay. Who are you?

338
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,999
-The car.
-The car?

339
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,767
The Dodge Aries.

340
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:03,903
The Dodge Aries?

341
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:05,172
What are you, a mynah bird?

342
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,505
I'm Curlie.

343
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,407
I understand that.

344
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,976
You're not the Dodge.

345
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:14,014
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

346
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,453
(doors open and close)

347
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,889
(engine starts, tires squeal)

348
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,523
What's the big deal?

349
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,193
The car isn't ours.

350
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,961
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

351
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:30,529
And once we get to Tallahassee,

352
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,032
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

353
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:34,000
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

354
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,701
-soap and water.
-It won't.

355
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,737
-Won't what?
-Come off with soap and water.

356
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,073
-Well, how do you know?
-I tried.

357
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,142
Marian, it's art.

358
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,576
Stop saying it's art.

359
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,145
That doesn't end all discussion.

360
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,646
We're gonna be driving through

361
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,514
some conservative towns--
the South.

362
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,183
-The Bible Belt.
-Mm, don't I know it.

363
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:52,185
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

364
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,953
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

365
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,189
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

366
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,724
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

367
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,228
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

368
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:02,595
My project.

369
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,630
What's your project?

370
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:08,434
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

371
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,736
How long's it been?

372
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,573
Weeks?

373
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,178
Months?

374
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,946
Oh, my God, Marian.

375
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,215
Don't tell me it's been years.

376
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,550
H-How many years? Who was it?

377
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,652
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

378
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,121
Donna.

379
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,755
Yeah, Donna.

380
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,894
Oh, my God.

381
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,463
Oh, my God. Donna?

382
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,999
(sighs)
She work for Al Gore now?

383
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,500
Nader.

384
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,004
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

385
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,573
CURLIE:
Wait a minute.

386
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:50,977
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

387
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,247
Yes, I did.

388
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:57,683
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

389
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,252
and then these broads come in

390
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,654
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

391
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,723
You gave them the car.

392
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,524
You don't know who they were?

393
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,127
CURLIE:
I told you their names.

394
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,627
Their names, yes, but...

395
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,297
This place is a dump.

396
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,765
They drive the car
instead of you.

397
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:13,733
Is that bad?

398
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,168
Bad if they find the goods.

399
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:17,737
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

400
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,239
CURLIE:
I like clutter.

401
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,740
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

402
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:21,874
Sterile doesn't work for me.

403
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,642
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

404
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,112
-Dick-yank?
-CHIEF: Flint.

405
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,279
I'm a dick-yank?

406
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,780
Don't antagonize.

407
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,182
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

408
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,251
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

409
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,918
And you would?

410
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,222
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

411
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,922
(footsteps approaching)

412
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,091
Not per se.

413
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,692
"Per se"?!

414
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,195
They left a local number.

415
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:45,165
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

416
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,966
Someone whose balls I can break.

417
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,567
(grunts)

418
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,171
(groaning)

419
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,539
Now you've gone and done it.

420
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:57,310
(grunting)

421
00:16:57,344 --> 00:17:01,281
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

422
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:04,117
-(thumping)
-(grunting and groaning)

423
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,952
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

424
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,688
Tomorrow.

425
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,957
(grunting and groaning continue)

426
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,627
(sighs) This is great.

427
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,929
This is so slutty. I love this.

428
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:19,665
-Hope they have postcards.
-Uh, Jamie?

429
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,600
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

430
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:22,768
The Butter Churn awaits.

431
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:24,071
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

432
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:26,073
No. No, don't even.

433
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,307
You come with me.

434
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,109
I'll show you how this is done.

435
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:34,214
(chatter in foreign language,
audience laughter over TV)

436
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:36,982
(door opens, closes)

437
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,087
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

438
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,720
It's a dyke bar.

439
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,924
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

440
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,860
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

441
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:49,895
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

442
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,998
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

443
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:56,036
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

444
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,740
Hello?

445
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,977
(engine idling)

446
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,147
-(engine shuts off)
-(muffled music playing inside)

447
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,881
JAMIE:
Confidence.

448
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:11,717
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

449
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,853
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

450
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,821
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

451
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,424
Jamie, I have done this before.

452
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,126
It's just like this.

453
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,693
One message.

454
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,196
You dig the female body.

455
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,397
Your body.

456
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,665
You're like this.

457
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,270
Not like this.

458
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,072
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

459
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,406
I have done this before.

460
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,907
I am not a schoolmarm.

461
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,409
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

462
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:38,345
-Not only.
-Only in the last four years.

463
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,113
Three years.

464
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,982
(hushed):
And four months and 14 days.

I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

481
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,048
I said they all looked fine.

482
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:17,883
Yeah, but not in the sense
of "super fine."

In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

485
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,990
I'm not jousting.

"throw up against the wall

490
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,500
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

491
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,101
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

492
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:37,736
I'm just trying
to get you laid, sugar sweet.

493
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,772
They sense it,
whether you want to fuck them

494
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,341
or you think they're just fine.

495
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:42,875
I have to be me.

496
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,910
It has to be done
with authenticity.

497
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,946
-You mean with authority.
-I mean with authenticity.

498
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,482
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

499
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,251
You don't know
what our life was like.

500
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:52,519
You know nothing
about its worth.

501
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:54,154
Then why didn't
the two of you move

502
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,223
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

503
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,490
That didn't happen.

504
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:59,459

<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

533
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:07,227
Wow. Thick one.

534
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,197
Hello, Marian.

535
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,899
Hello.

536
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:18,171
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

537
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:19,239
No.

538
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:21,174
No, no.

539
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:23,410
-No.
-Oh. Okay.

540
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:25,944
(chuckling):
Rats.

541
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,448
(smacks lips)

542
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,116
Well...

543
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,019
I'll just...

544
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,857
-(patting)
-(chuckling)

545
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,094
(upbeat music playing over TV)

546
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,567
(wheezing softly)

547
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,478
(thunder crashes)

548
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,986
(thunder crashes)

549
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:52,365
("Eau d'Bedroom Dancing"
by Le Tigre playing)

550
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,007
How was it?

551
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:03,510
Bouncy.

552
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,182
How's your book?

553
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:11,418
Good.

554
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,386
It's about two free spirits

555
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,355
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

556
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:19,192
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

557
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:21,661
That is why we are going
the other way.

558
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,163
Although there was
this one chick

559
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:24,697
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

560
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,433
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

561
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,568
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

562
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,236
No, I'm not kidding.

563
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,172
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

564
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,740
in India supposedly
who can do that.

565
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:35,742
Black belts in cunnilingus.

566
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:38,311
They can even
cunniling themselves.

567
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:40,580
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

568
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,980
You got to ask the librarian.

569
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,716
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

570
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,485
Who wrote your book?

571
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,520
Henry James.

572
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,055
Henry James...

573
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,224
American writer.

574
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:53,393
Famous family. His brother, too.

575
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,494
Rick?

576
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,030
No, I'm kidding.

577
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,698
I know who Henry James is.

578
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:00,266
White and uptight.

579
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:04,571
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

580
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,473
Boy, that was a great read.

581
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:09,609
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

582
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:12,312
(chuckles)
That's a very apt simile.

583
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:15,081
-His prose is labyrinthine.
-Yeah.

584
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,116
Put me off the whole book thing.

585
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:20,086
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

586
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,387
-Uh-huh.
-Except road signs.

587
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:22,722
Uh-huh, yeah.
I don't think you should've

588
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,057
brought someone
back to the room.

589
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,759
Okay.

590
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,228
I knew this was coming.

591
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,762
How do you think I felt?

592
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,498
You told me to have
a night on the town.

593
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

594
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,735
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

595
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,370
We operate on a handshake basis.

596
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:39,272

They're very committed lesbians,

621
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:31,624
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

622
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:33,326
which is practically on our way.

623
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,294
Not exactly.

624
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,162
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

625
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:37,463
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

626

JAMIE: Forget the map.

to the public,

789
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:43,829

because you're not nourished

00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:42,022

Am I not gonna pick you up?

812
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,025

00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:49,828
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

816
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,564
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

817
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:53,899
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

818
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:57,070
And so I say thank you.

819
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:05,045
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

820
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,547
and I've been careful
not to ask,

821
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,083
but damn, Marian,

822
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,553
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

823
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:15,555
I think it was jail, not prison.

824
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,157
Oh. I'm sorry.

825
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,459
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

826
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:21,328
It wasn't hell-raising.

827
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,330
Sorry to disappoint.

828
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,066

829
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh.

830
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:29,868
You copped some attitude.

831
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:32,272
I don't have attitude.

832
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,908
Marian, if I may,

833
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,111
there are certain things in life

834
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:40,979
which you got to sense
and understand

835
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,083
in order to live life,

836
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:46,119
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

837
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:48,355
well, all these
funny little creatures

838
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:50,956
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

839
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,226
we call 'em human beings.

840
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,395
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

841
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:57,197
And your whole social situation,

842
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,265
you got to understand
what that is.

843
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,367
Uh-huh.

844
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,501
You know what that means?

845
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:02,968
"Social situation"?

846
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,903
I know what
"social situation" means.

847
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,139
Okay, good.

848
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,074
So, the whole thing
with a cop is--

849
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:10,243
and you should remember this
for future reference--

850
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:13,646
when you're in
a social situation with a cop,

851
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,914
there ain't no social situation.

852
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:18,184
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

853
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:20,919
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

854
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:22,655
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

855
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,224
for two years now, and...

856
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:25,991
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

857
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,461
Thank you. I understand.

858
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,597
But if authority
is being abused,

859
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,267
-there's an obligation to...
-Holy shit.

860
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,169
Florida.

861
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:42,142
Lesbian...

862
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:47,013

870

BOTH:
You okay?

871
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,404
Spare tire.

872
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:27,420
What?

873
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:32,225
Something burning?

874
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:50,243
Jamie, it's cold.

875
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,113
Don't touch it.

876
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,317
I saw this movie once where

877
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,019
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

878
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,387
and they opened the box,

879
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:05,258
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

880
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,375
Head!

881
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:24,577

882
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,013
(laughter)

883
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,653
No, I'm kidding.

884
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:36,389
It was a minor traffic accident.

885
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:37,790
Fast stop.

886
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:41,194
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

887
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:43,329
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

888
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:45,131
(laughter)

889
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,267
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

890
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,801
(laughter)

891
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,336
That's right.

892
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,239
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

893
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:55,542
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

894
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,777
Just drove off
with something we need.

895
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,445
Didn't even know they had it.

896
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:02,382
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

897
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,652
-Just making out.
-(light laughter)

898
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:07,554
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah?

899
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,289
With who?

900
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:11,457
(laughter)

901
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,426
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

902
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,161
(laughs)

903
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:18,565
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

904
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,333
sample case back.

905
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:23,202
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

906
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,837
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

907
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:27,407
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

908
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,676
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

909
00:42:34,347 --> 00:42:35,815
No, no.

910
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,450
We should just call the cops.

911
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,718
We will, Jamie.

912
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:41,554
First, we should see
what's in here.

913
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,389
Why? I don't want to look.

914
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:45,425
-Why do I have to look?
-Jamie, listen.

915
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,827
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

916
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,429
This might tell us who they are,

917
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:51,397
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

918
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:53,700
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

919
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,468
Protect us?

920
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:57,804
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

921
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,106
What do we lose by looking?

922
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,308
Look.

923
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,445
I just want to know
what's going on.

924
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,448
This might tell us.

925
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:11,184
I bet it's locked.

926
00:43:18,558 --> 00:43:20,493
(latch clicks)

927
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:37,477
-We got to call the cops.
-Why?

928
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,578
That was awful.

929
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:40,546
You just said
not to call the cops.

930
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,248
In ignorance.

931
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:43,549
No, what you said was true.

932
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,385
The cops could think
you're involved.

933
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:46,853
You just spent
the night in jail.

934
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:48,354
For vagrancy.

935
00:43:48,388 --> 00:43:50,690
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

936
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:51,958
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

937
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:53,359
Here's what we do.

938
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,395
First, we get to Tallahassee.

939
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:56,763
ALL (laughing):
Bye!

940
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,300
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

941
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:02,735
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

942
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,737
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

943
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:06,472
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

944
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:07,840
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

945
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:09,308
the address
where they're headed?

946
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,477
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

947
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,413
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

948
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:15,448

Welcome to El Conquistador.

951
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,723
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

952
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,292
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

953
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:28,761
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

954
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:30,296
You take the Rainbow Card?

955
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:31,731
Uh, I'm sure we do.

956
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,766
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

957
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,668
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

958
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,303
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

959
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:38,738
You do that, right?

960
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:40,573
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

961
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:42,009
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

962
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,710
for sensitive materials?

963
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:45,012
We do have in-room safes

964
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,512
for any valuables
that you may have.

965
00:44:46,546 --> 00:44:48,848
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

966
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:50,717
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

967
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,618
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

968
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:53,853

But why would these people
just be waiting there

994
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,908
in the drive-away office?

995
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:23,110
Well, clearly, this was not

996
00:46:23,143 --> 00:46:24,844
your garden-variety
decapitation.

997
00:46:24,877 --> 00:46:26,445
This was some kind of a...

998
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,381
Well, I don't know what it was,

999
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:30,950
but they know
we have their stuff.

Yeah?

1001
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,854
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

1002
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:37,590
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

1003
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,559
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

But why would we get
in touch with them?

Sell it back, shake 'em down.

is not such a bad idea.

Let's be friends. I...

-Did the two creeps find you?
-What?

The two weirdos looking for you.

1032
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,888
I tried to be helpful.

1033
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:44,924
-Uh, but who were they?
-How should I know?

1034
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:46,692
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

1035
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:48,594

you fucked over somehow.

00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:58,771

a big murder case.

00:48:04,077 --> 00:48:05,878

-Yeah.

1043
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:08,681
-And you ask Curlie about...

1044
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:11,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

1045
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:14,054
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

1046
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,589
You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.

1047
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:17,924
(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

1048
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:20,793
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

1049
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,929
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

1050
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:24,463
I guarantee you someone's there.

1051
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:26,933
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

1052
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,468
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

1053
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:31,171
I'll take Alice.

1054
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:32,838
Really? Swear?

1055
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:35,208
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,091
told us of another juke joint

1063
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:52,892
-fairly close by called...
-You see?

1064
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:54,027
Stop!

1065
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:55,895
Called Ike's.

1066
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,898
Maybe he said "Mike's."

1067
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:00,533
Maybe he said "Mike."

1068
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,668
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

1069
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:04,570
I think the soccer team
was just confused

1070
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,572
about which joint
these girls were going to,

1071
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:08,041
so we're gonna drive...

1072
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:10,776
Stop saying words.

1073
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,512
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

1074
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:14,981
They arrived in Tallahassee

1075
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:18,651
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

1076
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:20,686
Tallahassee.

1077
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,255
I want you to get
your asses over there

1078
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:24,590
and take care of it right away.

1079
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:26,126
Not a juke joint.

1080
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,660
You should arrive
by early morning.

1081
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:28,761
I'll meet you there.

1082
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:30,997
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

1083
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:32,965
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

1084
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,068
We have not slept
since the night before last,

1085
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,004
-and we...
-(click, dial tone)

1086
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:38,704
Hello?

1087
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:42,042
-Chief?
-Who's in Tallahassee?

1088
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:44,610
DESK CLERK:
Certainly.

1089
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:46,545
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

1090
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:47,880
or right here at the hotel,

1091
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:50,549
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

1092
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,019
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

1093
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:55,088
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

1094
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:57,623
Maybe we should stay here.

1095
00:49:57,656 --> 00:49:59,092
Replenish the ice.

1096
00:50:01,827 --> 00:50:03,662
(piano playing
"Fly Me to the Moon")

1097
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,731
This is great, but how...

1098
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:08,101
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

1099
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:11,804
(softly):
Rainbow.

1100
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:12,705
Yes.

1101
00:50:12,738 --> 00:50:15,275
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

1102
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:17,044
Like, a really, really good one?

1103
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:18,145
WAITER:
Of course.

1104
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:22,182
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

1105
00:50:22,215 --> 00:50:23,849
Theoretically.

1106
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:27,787
(Jamie sighs)

1107
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,626
So...

1108
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:38,831
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1109
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,669
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1110
00:50:43,702 --> 00:50:47,074
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1111
00:50:47,973 --> 00:50:49,975
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1112
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,978
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1113
00:50:53,013 --> 00:50:55,115
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1114
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:58,018
but I usually have stuff to do.

1115
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:00,653
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1116
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:03,190
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1117
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:07,693
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1118
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:09,728
-(cork pops)
-Something I decided

1119
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:11,098
last night
while I was lying in bed

1120
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:14,101
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1121
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:18,338
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1122
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,905
Especially since, with you,

1123
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:21,974
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1124
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:23,143
Am I right?

1125
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:26,645
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1126
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:29,915
-Thank you.
-WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

1127
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,118
Yes, please.

1128
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,253
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1129
00:51:33,286 --> 00:51:34,920
I mean, we're good friends,

1130
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:36,922
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1131
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:38,391
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1132
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:41,961
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1133
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:44,930
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1134
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:47,134
-You never have sex.
-Exactly.

1135
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:49,069
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1136
00:51:49,102 --> 00:51:51,770
She was always saying
that this or that

1137
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:53,440
-would be inappropriate.
-Uh-huh.

1138
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:57,110
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1139
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,811
the sex was great.

1140
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,779
Ladies, have we decided?

1141
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,085
Don't rush us, buddy.

1142
00:52:06,052 --> 00:52:09,055
First, we'll dance.

1143
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:12,791
("You Belong to Me"
by Diana Krall playing)

1144
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,070
Maybe I do overthink things.

1145
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:26,906
Yeah.

1146
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:30,943
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1147
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:34,813
(sighs softly)

1148
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:38,084
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1149
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:39,985
Ah, you know Debbie.

1150
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,055
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1151
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:44,057
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1152
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,992
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1153
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:49,029
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1154
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:51,730
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

1155
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:56,936
♪ Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle ♪

1156
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,242
♪ Just remember, darling ♪

1157
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,910
♪ All the while ♪

1158
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:11,717
♪ You belong to me... ♪

1159
00:53:23,796 --> 00:53:25,998
(music continues faintly
in distance)

1160
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:17,050
(gasps softly)

1161
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:32,032
(gasps, exhales)

1162
00:54:39,205 --> 00:54:41,241
(breathing heavily)

1163
00:54:45,612 --> 00:54:48,048
(moaning)

1164
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:55,854
(moaning continues)

1165
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:07,067
(moans softly)

1166
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,238
GOON:
One accomplishment.

1167
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,973
Huh? Name me one.

1168
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,510
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1169
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,379
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1170
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,316
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1171
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:57,983
on a creaky porch swing

1172
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:59,686
on a warm summer evening--
crickets, so forth?

1173
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:02,988
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1174
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:04,657
trousers around your ankles,

1175
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:07,193
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1176
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:09,995
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1177
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,997
Yes, people might stroll by

1178
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,466
and see you looking foolish
up there

1179
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,000
slapping ham on the veranda,

1180
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:18,004
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1181
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:20,607
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1182
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,143
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1183
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:26,179
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1184
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,680
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1185
00:56:27,714 --> 00:56:29,982
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1186
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:31,684
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1187
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,453
that I've been carrying
on my back

1188
00:56:33,486 --> 00:56:35,921
all the way from Philadelphia!

1189
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:40,293
(faint police radio chatter)

1190
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:46,932
(grunts, moans)

1191
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:53,972
(moans)

1192
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,542
(weakly):
Help.

1193
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:06,119
"Big case."

1194
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:08,455
That woman.

1195
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:14,694
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1196
00:57:14,727 --> 00:57:16,396
(car door closes)

1197
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:18,465
(car departing)

1198
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,484
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1199
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:39,252
CHAUFFEUR:
Yes, sir.

1200
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:23,429
(water splashing gently)

1201
00:58:56,563 --> 00:58:58,598
(door slides open)

1202
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:03,169
MAN:
Honey, we eating soon?

1203
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:05,104
WOMAN:
Okay.

1204
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,275
MAN:
Oh. All right.

1205
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,182
(door closes)

1206
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,636
(Jamie gasping)

1207
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,875
Jamie?

1208
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:48,114
(panting): Waited for you
as long as I could.

1209
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,118
Jamie, no!

1210
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,393
(yelling)

1211
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:01,661
Jamie, why?

1212
01:00:01,694 --> 01:00:04,130
(gasping)

1213
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,369
Oh, my God.

1214
01:00:09,402 --> 01:00:10,703
Marian.

1215
01:00:11,771 --> 01:00:13,573
CHAUFFEUR:
Sir?

1216
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:15,274
-Sir.
-Hmm?

1217
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:18,277
Tallahassee, sir.

1218
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:20,880
-Where to, exactly?
-(sighs)

1219
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:23,282
Yes, um...

1220
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,184
The track.

1221
01:00:25,218 --> 01:00:27,253
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1222
01:00:27,286 --> 01:00:28,888
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1223
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,456
JAMIE:
Oh, come on now.

1224
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,326
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1225
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,261
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1226
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:37,563
No. I like this one.

1227
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,933
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1228
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:42,402
Last night was beautiful,

1229
01:00:42,435 --> 01:00:44,370
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1230
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:46,272
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1231
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:47,940
-Okay! -All right!
-(Jamie and Marian screaming)

1232
01:00:47,974 --> 01:00:50,643
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1233
01:00:50,677 --> 01:00:52,412
We're here for two things.

1234
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:53,680
-(screaming continues)
-(grunts)

1235
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:55,214
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1236
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:56,482
Screw you!

1237
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:58,951
-(screaming)
-We're here for two items.

1238
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:00,453
Whoa. She's naked.

1239
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:02,689
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1240
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:04,323
We're here for two items.

1241
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,392
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1242
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:08,494
-And the head box.
-Head box!

1243
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:10,496
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1244
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,398
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1245
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:14,400
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1246
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:16,936
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1247
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,305
Let's get this show on the road.

1248
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:20,873
(screaming continues)

1249
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:23,242
Yeah, baby.

1250
01:01:23,276 --> 01:01:27,780
You're such a big, bouncy,

1251
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:31,484
beautiful baby.

1252
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:34,587
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1253
01:01:35,888 --> 01:01:37,690
Whoa.

1254
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:40,293
This is so groovy.

1255
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:42,995
Now I can love you forever.

1256
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,731
Whoa.

1257
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:46,933
And ever

1258
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:50,737
and ever and ever

1259
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:55,808
-and ever and ever.
-And ever and ever.

1260
01:01:55,842 --> 01:02:00,379
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1261
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:04,484
BOTH: Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1262
01:02:04,517 --> 01:02:09,022
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1263
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:13,426
(echoing): Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1264
01:02:13,459 --> 01:02:17,030
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1265
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:20,767
Never to wilt...

1266
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,035
(bell rings)

1267
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:24,771
(snarling)

1268
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:26,006
Took 'em straight here.

1269
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:27,473
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1270
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:29,575
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1271
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:34,781
This is all they had?

1272
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:36,582
What's all they had?

1273
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:42,089
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1274
01:02:42,122 --> 01:02:44,357
GOON:
What are you talking about?

1275
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,526
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1276
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,928
-Not in the...
-Well, that just figures.

1277
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:50,830
Come on, girls.

1278
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:52,465
Where's the last phallus?

1279
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:55,601
(muffled chattering)

1280
01:02:55,635 --> 01:02:57,837
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1281
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,539
I-I...

1282
01:02:59,572 --> 01:03:01,507
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1283
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,409
What have you done, jerk-off?

1284
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:05,344
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1285
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:06,679
They gave you the combination,

1286
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:08,681
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1287
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:10,449
-FLINT: I never slip up.
-GOON: Right, left,

1288
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:12,351
-past the first number.
-(yells)

1289
01:03:12,985 --> 01:03:15,388
(snarling)

1290
01:03:24,597 --> 01:03:28,634
The senator is a good man.

1291
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,438
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1292
01:03:32,471 --> 01:03:33,739
Many of us did.

1293
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:36,109
-It was a different time.
-(muffled muttering)

1294
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:39,412
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1295
01:03:39,445 --> 01:03:41,881
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1296
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:49,156
Housekeeping.

1297
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:51,124
(snarling)

1298
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:55,628
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1299
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,664
...thing.

1300
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:03,870
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1301
01:04:03,903 --> 01:04:05,738
(beeping)

1302
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,009
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1303
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:12,411
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1304
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:14,914
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1305
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,118
He was just a kid.

1306
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:21,554
(humming an upbeat tune)

1307
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:25,591
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1308
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,660
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1309
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:30,596
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1310
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,966
(hushed):
You saw him, sort of.

1311
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:40,539
(continues humming)

1312
01:04:41,908 --> 01:04:43,943
(stops humming)

1313
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,848
<i>(housekeeper screaming)</i>

1314
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:52,085
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1315
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:54,820
Think of it: eBay,

1316
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:59,059
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1317
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,627
Comments, reviews.

1318
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:04,097
Think of what
it would do to him.

1319
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:08,501
His children, his family,
his career.

1320
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:11,071
(gasps)

1321
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:14,207
-(goons yelling in distance)
-We're not unreasonable.

1322
01:05:14,241 --> 01:05:16,943
We'll gladly pay for it.

1323
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:18,211
We just...

1324
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:20,180
Will you please shut up!

1325
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:21,514
That wasn't my idea!

1326
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:23,050
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1327
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,117
I was experimenting.

1328
01:05:24,151 --> 01:05:25,551
But you liked it.

1329
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:26,852
-FLINT: No, I didn't!
-I could tell.

1330
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,554
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1331
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:29,855
Drunk on cock.

1332
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:31,524
-FLINT: No! I didn't.
-It's not my thing.

1333
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:33,260
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1334
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:35,195
-To understand life.
-No!

1335
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:37,863
-The stuff of life!
-No, no, no!

1336
01:05:37,897 --> 01:05:39,099
(groaning)

1337
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:40,566
(screaming)

1338
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:43,502
CHIEF:
God, man, what are you doing?!

1339
01:05:43,536 --> 01:05:45,671
-(both screaming)
-(Flint yelling)

1340
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,642
(Marian and Jamie whimpering)

1341
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:02,788
(Marian and Jamie
whimpering loudly)

1342
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:08,594
(gun clicks)

1343
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:12,932
(clicking)

1344
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:17,937
Mommy.

1345
01:06:20,073 --> 01:06:22,109
(crying)

1346
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:31,218
(door opens, closes)

1347
01:06:31,251 --> 01:06:33,919
(dogs barking, yelping
in distance)

1348
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:38,025
(dogs barking in distance)

1349
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:41,627
MARIAN: All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1350
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,030
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1351
01:06:43,063 --> 01:06:44,630
Then we switch hotels.

1352
01:06:44,663 --> 01:06:46,333
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1353
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:47,867
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1354
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,170
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1355
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,638
-Where are you going?
-Art store.

1356
01:06:57,877 --> 01:06:59,712
(barking)

1357
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,847
WOMAN:
Next customer, please.

1358
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:04,884
SUKIE: Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1359
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,286
Don't ask me why.

1360
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,322
(line ringing)

1361
01:07:09,356 --> 01:07:10,923
MAN (over phone):
Committee to Reelect.

1362
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,825
JAMIE:
I need to speak to the senator.

1363
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:16,263
MAN: Well, who should I say
is calling?

1364
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:18,798
Someone who has his...

1365
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,568
...personal effects.

1366
01:07:36,116 --> 01:07:38,651
-(airplane engine whirring)
-(barking)

1367
01:07:53,433 --> 01:07:55,901
-(line clicks)
-GARY (over phone): Who is this?

1368
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:57,170
Senator?

1369
01:07:57,204 --> 01:07:59,705
Yes. Who is this?

1370
01:07:59,738 --> 01:08:02,775
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1371
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:06,113
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1372
01:08:06,146 --> 01:08:07,813
Everybody's things.

1373
01:08:07,847 --> 01:08:10,417
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1374
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,651
If you're not alone,

1375
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,687
believe me, I'll know it.

1376
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,889
(Alice barking)

1377
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:25,432
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1378
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:27,367
made a phone call
from here last night.

1379
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,801
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1380
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:32,139
Well, this is for her.

1381
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:33,273
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1382
01:08:33,306 --> 01:08:34,874
You've missed them.

1383
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,776
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1384
01:08:57,464 --> 01:08:59,199
JAMIE:
Done.

1385
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,302
With what?

1386
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,703
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1387
01:09:05,372 --> 01:09:07,174
Want to join me?

1388
01:09:07,207 --> 01:09:09,142

1389
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:14,080
(shower running)

1390
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:38,038
Jamie.

1391
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:41,941
I want...

1392
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:43,276
Uh-huh?

1393
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,346
I... I-I want...

1394
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:48,981
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1395
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,386
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

1396
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:21,747
