1
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,502
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,088
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,049
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,718
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

5
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,971
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,599
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,936
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,647
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,190
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,359
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

11
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,527
It's nice to have you back.

12
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,988
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,991
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,953
- Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.
- Thank you.

15
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,002
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

16
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:30,340
<i>When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:</i>

19
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:43,728

20
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,776
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.</i>

21
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,820
Thank you.

22
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:01,913
- Have I got time for breakfast?
- I think we can manage that.

23
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,206
How long have I got?

24
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,917
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

25
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:09,546
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

26
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:13,008
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

27
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,302
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

28
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,096
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

29
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,807
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

30
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,017
Oh, wait.

31
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,854
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

32
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,718
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Hello.

33
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,389
Hi, squirt.
What are you doing?

34
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:03,975
<i>Playing.</i>

35
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,602
Where's Mummy?

36
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,312
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

37
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,023
- Who's taking care of you?
<i>- Rachel.</i>

38
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,651
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
<i>- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

39
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,613
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

40
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,282
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

41
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:20,867
<i>Why not?</i>

42
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,620
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

43
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,498
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

44
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:30,668
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

45
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,213
<i>All right.</i>

46
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,548
- Anything special that you want?
<i>- Yes.</i>

47
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:36,841
What?

48
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,635
<i>A telephone.</i>

49
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:41,346
We've got lots of telephones already.

50
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,892
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday? Something special?

51
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,560
<i>- Yes.</i>
- What?

52
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,020
<i>A bush baby.</i>

53
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:51,731
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

54
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,693
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

55
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,863
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

56
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,326
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

57
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,495
Now, will you tell her that?

58
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,288
<i>Yes.</i>

59
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,333
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

60
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,626
<i>All right.</i>

61
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,879
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

62
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:16,714
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,509
Take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

64
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,969
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

65
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,638
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

66
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,739
- Elena, nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a surprise.

67
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,909
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

68
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,120
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

69
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,789
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

70
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,833
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

71
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,793
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

72
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,379
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

73
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,131
Do sit down.

74
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,508
- Well, we--
- No, no, please.

75
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,385
Thank you.

76
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,597
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

77
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:09,100
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

78
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,769
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.

79
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,564
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

80
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,984
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

81
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,529
He's been doing underwater research
in the Baltic...

82
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,825
...so I'm afraid we don't see
very much of each other these days.

83
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,662
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

84
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,874
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

85
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,125
We're going home.

86
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:39,214
We've spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at Tchalinko.

87
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,133
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.

88
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:43,676
Oh, are you?

89
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:49,641
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

90
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:54,979
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

91
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,899
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

92
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,859
For the past two weeks...

93
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,488
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

94
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,823
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

95
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:10,411
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

96
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,791
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

97
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,795
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

98
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,129
Yes.

99
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:25,218
That's what we thought at first,
but it's been going on now for 10 days.

100
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,221
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

101
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,806
That's right.

102
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,140
Oh, I see.

103
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:34,978
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

104
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:38,106
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

105
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,357
That does sound odd.

106
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:42,735
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

107
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,864
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

108
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,909
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

109
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:53,580
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

110
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,129
At the risk of pressing you on
a point you seem reticent to discuss...

111
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,965
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

112
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,633
Well, certainly.

113
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:12,724
Frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

114
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,352
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

115
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,607
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

116
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,234
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

117
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,575
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

118
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,662
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

119
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,457
I understand.

120
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,128
But this epidemic
could easily spread to our base.

121
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,422
We should be given all the facts.

122
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,466
Yes, I know.

123
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,513
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

124
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,102
Won't you change your mind
about that drink?

125
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,647
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

126
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,941
I hope you and your wife come
to the IAC Conference.

127
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,485
I hope we can make it.

128
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,738
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

129
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:12,867
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

130
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,160
If we can, we will.

131
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,288
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

132
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,249
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

133
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,251
Goodbye, Elena.

134
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,546
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

135
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,717
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

136
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:30,968
Thank you.

137
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,428
Ladies.

138
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:29,488
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

139
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,949
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

140
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,492
You're welcome.

141
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,298
Well...

142
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,593
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

143
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:54,722
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

144
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,143
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

145
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:04,523
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

146
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,153
Before the briefing, he'd like
to have a few words with you.

147
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,446
Dr. Floyd?

148
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,336
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

149
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,422
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

150
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:35,304
First, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell...

151
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:38,349
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

152
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,685
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

153
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:45,773
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

154
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,945
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

155
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,281
Now...

156
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:59,078
...I know there have been some
conflicting views...

157
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:02,957
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

158
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:06,877
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

159
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,839
...created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

160
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:15,844
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

161
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,932
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

162
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:25,271
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

163
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,233
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

164
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:34,196
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

165
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:39,285
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

166
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,870
And I hope you will too.

167
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:47,334
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

168
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,212
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

169
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:52,798
...contained in this situation...

170
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:55,509
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

171
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:58,804
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

172
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:00,889
Anyway...

173
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:03,309
...this is the view of the Council.

174
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:08,355
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

175
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:10,274
...on the situation...

176
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:13,652
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

177
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:18,991
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

178
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:24,038
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

179
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:29,251
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

180
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,213
Well, I think that's about it.

181
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,507
Any questions?

182
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,221
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

183
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,224
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

184
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,686
I don't know, Bill.

185
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:52,066
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

186
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:55,027
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

187
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:58,906
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

188
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:02,034
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

189
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,953
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

190
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:08,040
...from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

191
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:11,960
Were there any more questions?

192
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:21,136
I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

193
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:22,805
...as fully as possible...

194
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:28,477
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,355
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

196
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,162
Anybody hungry?

197
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,209
- What've we got?
- You name it.

198
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,381
- Is this chicken?
- Something like that.

199
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:23,383
Tastes the same, anyway.

200
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,302
Got any ham?

201
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:26,970
Ham, ham, ham....

202
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,805
There, that's it.

203
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:33,101
Look pretty good.

204
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,063
They're getting better at it
all the time.

205
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,983
That was an excellent speech.

206
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,401
It certainly was.

207
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:44,321
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,822
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:48,659
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,452
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:54,206
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:57,042
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

213
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,336
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:02,965
- Have a look.
- Here's what started it all.

215
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,883
Oh, yeah.

216
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:06,677
When we found it...

217
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,845
...we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

218
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:12,182
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

219
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:17,062
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

220
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:18,981
So we decided to have a look.

221
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,733
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

222
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,612
...so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

223
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:28,824
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

224
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,160
...it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

225
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,705
It's been deliberately buried.

226
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,624
Deliberately buried.

227
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,921
How about a little coffee?

228
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,048
- Great.
- Good idea.

229
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:53,515
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

230
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,684
I wish to hell we did.

231
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:00,272
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

232
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:05,110
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

233
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,987
Watch this, now. It's hot.

234
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:52,697
<i>Good evening.</i>

235
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:55,867
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft</i> Discovery One...

236
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:58,786
<i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

237
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:02,957
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

238
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,669
<i>This afternoon,</i> The World Tonight
<i>recorded an interview...</i>

239
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:11,466
<i>...with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

240
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,969
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

241
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:18,306
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

242
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:21,809
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

243
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:25,188
<i>The crew of</i> Discovery One
<i>consists of five men...</i>

244
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:30,360
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

245
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,904
<i>Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

246
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:36,282
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

247
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:39,410
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>

248
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:41,496
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

249
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,624
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

250
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:47,126
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

251
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:50,213
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

252
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,631
<i>Marvelous.</i>

253
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,968
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

254
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:58,471
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

255
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,933
<i>...joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.</i>

256
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,977
<i>- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.</i>

257
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:08,356
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

258
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:13,111
<i>...this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

259
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:14,612
<i>Why was this done?</i>

260
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:18,116
<i>This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

261
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,869
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

262
01:00:22,078 --> 01:00:25,707
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

263
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:29,711
<i>Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.</i>

264
01:00:30,003 --> 01:00:33,840
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

265
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,428
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.</i>

266
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:41,097
<i>The only difference is
that you don't dream.</i>

267
01:00:41,306 --> 01:00:45,393
<i>As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?</i>

268
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:48,229
<i>Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.</i>

269
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:52,108
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

270
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,945
<i>The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...</i>

271
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:58,239
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

272
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:01,909
<i>...for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

273
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:06,539
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

274
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:09,709
<i>...though some experts prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

275
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,295
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

276
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:16,549
<i>...and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.</i>

277
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:20,345
<i>We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

278
01:01:20,553 --> 01:01:23,514
<i>...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

279
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:26,392
<i>Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

280
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:30,605
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

281
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:34,275
<i>Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...</i>

282
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:38,404
<i>...perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.</i>

283
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:41,407
<i>You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.</i>

284
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:45,370
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

285
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:48,664
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

286
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:51,167
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

287
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:56,130
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

288
01:01:56,506 --> 01:02:01,302
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

289
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,223
<i>We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...</i>

290
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:08,851
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

291
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:12,897
<i>Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...</i>

292
01:02:13,106 --> 01:02:16,192
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

293
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,653
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

294
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,988
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

295
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,785
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

296
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:30,248
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

297
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,626
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

298
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:37,338
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

299
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:42,301
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

300
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:46,139
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

301
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:49,225
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

302
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,186
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

303
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:54,564
<i>He's like a sixth
member of the crew.</i>

304
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:58,860
<i>You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

305
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,112
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

306
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,032
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

307
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:06,576
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

308
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,162
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

309
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,332
<i>...I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

310
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:16,961
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

311
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,631
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

312
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:24,469
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

313
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:26,762
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

314
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:29,807
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

315
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:57,001
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

316
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,461
What is it, Hal?

317
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:01,589
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

318
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:03,883
Fine.

319
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,802
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

320
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,304
<i>Certainly.</i>

321
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:23,444
<i>- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

322
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:25,571
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

323
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,948
A bit higher, Hal.

324
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,534
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

325
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:31,619
<i>Ray and Sally were going
to be here...</i>

326
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,121
<i>...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

327
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:36,499
<i>How do you like your cake?</i>

328
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,125
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

329
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:39,961
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

330
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:42,255
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

331
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:45,174
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

332
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:47,093
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

333
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:50,429
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

334
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,098
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

335
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:54,976
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

336
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:57,478
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious sons.</i>

337
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:01,065
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

338
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,900
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

339
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:05,069
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

340
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:08,948
<i>I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

341
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,993
<i>Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

342
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:13,869
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

343
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:16,205
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

344
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:20,960
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

345
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,337
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

346
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:27,717
<i>- Give our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our regards.</i>

347
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:31,304
<i>We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.</i>

348
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:33,139
<i>All the best, son.</i>

349
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,558
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

350
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:37,893
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

351
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,688
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

352
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:43,524
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

353
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,320
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

354
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:52,325
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

355
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:56,704
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

356
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,724
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

357
01:06:18,476 --> 01:06:20,895
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

358
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:23,856
Lovely move.

359
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:29,862
Rook to king one.

360
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:32,990
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

361
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:37,161
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

362
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:39,872
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

363
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:47,296
Looks like you're right. I resign.

364
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:49,465
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

365
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:50,675
Thank you.

366
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,756
<i>- Good evening, Dave.</i>
- How are you, Hal?

367
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:34,343
<i>- Everything's running smoothly, you?</i>
- Not too bad.

368
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:37,221
<i>- Have you been doing more work?</i>
- A few sketches.

369
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,932
<i>- May I see them?</i>
- Sure.

370
01:07:43,936 --> 01:07:46,397
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

371
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,734
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

372
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,904
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?</i>
- Sure.

373
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,075
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

374
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:02,872
<i>By the way...</i>

375
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:06,625
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

376
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,753
No, not at all.

377
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,505
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

378
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:15,634
<i>...but lately I've wondered...</i>

379
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:19,764
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?</i>

380
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:21,640
How do you mean?

381
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:25,811
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

382
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:30,399
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

383
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:35,821
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

384
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:40,201
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

385
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:44,580
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

386
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,668
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

387
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:52,546
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

388
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,466
No, not at all.

389
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:59,220
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

390
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:02,515
<i>...strange stories floating
around before we left.</i>

391
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:06,894
<i>Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.</i>

392
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:11,440
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

393
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:15,820
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

394
01:09:16,028 --> 01:09:18,697
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

395
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:20,908
<i>For instance...</i>

396
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:25,454
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

397
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,958
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

398
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,544
<i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

399
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:36,841
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

400
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:40,261
You working up your crew
psychology report?

401
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,180
<i>Of course I am.</i>

402
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:47,351
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

403
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,645
<i>Just a moment.</i>

404
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,272
<i>Just a moment.</i>

405
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:57,111
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

406
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,366
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

407
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:07,037
- Is it still within operational limits?
<i>- Yes.</i>

408
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,748
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

409
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,001
We have 72 hours till failure?

410
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:16,130
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

411
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:20,551
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

412
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:24,471
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

413
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,432
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

414
01:11:50,683 --> 01:11:53,519
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

415
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:56,230
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

416
01:11:56,438 --> 01:12:01,568
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

417
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:06,031
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

418
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,908
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

419
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,147
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

420
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:01,503
Open the pod doors, Hal.

421
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:55,876
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

422
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:58,170
<i>Yes...</i>

423
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:01,506
<i>...it's puzzling.</i>

424
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:06,511
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

425
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,142
<i>I would recommend...</i>

426
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:16,521
<i>...that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.</i>

427
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:21,109
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

428
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,489
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

429
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:28,825
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

430
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,295
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

431
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,215
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

432
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:47,844
<i>We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.</i>

433
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,722
<i>We advise you that
our preliminary findings...</i>

434
01:20:50,972 --> 01:20:53,683
<i>...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...</i>

435
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:56,102
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:59,314
<i>I say again, in error
predicting the fault.</i>

437
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:04,069
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

438
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:07,572
<i>...the results from our twin
9000 computer.</i>

439
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:11,159
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

440
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:14,120
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

441
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:15,956
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

442
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:19,084
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

443
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,461
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

444
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:25,131
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

445
01:21:29,386 --> 01:21:32,681
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

446
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,349
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:36,226
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

448
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:40,146
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
<i>- Of course.</i>

449
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:44,985
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:48,822
<i>Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.</i>

451
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:52,367
<i>It can only be
attributable to human error.</i>

452
01:21:53,577 --> 01:21:56,371
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

453
01:21:56,705 --> 01:22:00,166
<i>...and it has always
been due to human error.</i>

454
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:05,380
Listen, Hal...

455
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:07,882
...there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:11,344
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:13,179
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

458
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:17,100
<i>The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.</i>

459
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:21,646
I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

460
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:27,902
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,113
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

462
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:34,159
<i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.</i>

463
01:22:38,622 --> 01:22:40,832
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:44,794
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:22:47,339 --> 01:22:50,342
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:53,178
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:54,512
See you later, Hal.

468
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,161
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,963
What sort of trouble are you having?

470
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,925
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:33,551
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:41,434
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,288
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:24:15,635 --> 01:24:17,721
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

475
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,148
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:33,153
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,740
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,200
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,746
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:47,333
What do you think?

481
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:51,504
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:54,007
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,467
Don't you?

484
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:58,386
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:03,516
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:04,768
They do.

487
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:08,438
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:12,984
Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis.

489
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,572
It certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:25:17,906 --> 01:25:19,866
If he were wrong, that would prove it.

491
01:25:20,074 --> 01:25:22,368
It would be,
if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:28,833
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:33,671
There's no reason not
to put back the unit and...

494
01:25:33,922 --> 01:25:38,468
- ...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:39,886
Let's get on with it.

496
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,806
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,267
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail?

498
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:49,687
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:54,901
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,778
What the hell can we do?

501
01:25:59,781 --> 01:26:03,868
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:08,665
Every aspect of ship
operations is under his control.

503
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:10,333
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,670
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:26:17,382 --> 01:26:18,925
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:21,052
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,139
It'd be a bit tricky.

508
01:26:25,974 --> 01:26:28,518
We'd have to cut his
higher brain functions...

509
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:33,481
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,442
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:39,612
...of continuing
underground-based computer control.

512
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:44,534
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:26:45,243 --> 01:26:47,245
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:51,332
No 9000 computer has ever
been disconnected.

515
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:53,626
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:26:53,877 --> 01:26:55,378
That's not what I mean.

517
01:26:57,547 --> 01:26:59,757
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:32:58,157 --> 01:33:00,201
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:04,622
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:33:04,872 --> 01:33:06,666
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

521
01:33:06,874 --> 01:33:09,794
- Do you have a positive track on him?
<i>- I have a good track.</i>

522
01:33:10,044 --> 01:33:11,462
Do you know what happened?

523
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:14,423
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

524
01:33:14,674 --> 01:33:16,259
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,538
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

526
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:52,756
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

527
01:40:58,387 --> 01:41:00,264
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,477
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,188
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:12,985
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

531
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:17,364
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

532
01:41:19,283 --> 01:41:21,326
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

533
01:41:21,744 --> 01:41:23,245
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

534
01:41:23,495 --> 01:41:26,248
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

535
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:31,378
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:41:32,963 --> 01:41:36,508
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

537
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:40,721
What's the problem?

538
01:41:41,138 --> 01:41:44,349
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

539
01:41:44,558 --> 01:41:46,435
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:41:47,436 --> 01:41:51,523
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

541
01:41:52,608 --> 01:41:54,985
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:41:56,987 --> 01:42:00,949
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

543
01:42:01,158 --> 01:42:03,952
<i>...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

544
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:11,126
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:15,798
<i>Although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod...</i>

546
01:42:16,048 --> 01:42:18,258
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

547
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:20,969
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

548
01:42:33,023 --> 01:42:34,525
All right, Hal.

549
01:42:37,736 --> 01:42:40,572
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:42:42,115 --> 01:42:44,743
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

551
01:42:45,244 --> 01:42:47,704
<i>...you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

552
01:42:48,872 --> 01:42:50,999
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,334
Open the doors.

554
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:54,336
<i>Dave...</i>

555
01:42:54,795 --> 01:42:59,258
<i>...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

556
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:02,761
Hal?

557
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:05,097
Hal?

558
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:08,851
Hal?

559
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:12,145
Hal.

560
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:14,898
Hal.

561
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:52,379
<i>Just what do you think
you're doing, Dave?</i>

562
01:50:00,929 --> 01:50:02,180
<i>Dave...</i>

563
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:07,811
<i>...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

564
01:50:24,703 --> 01:50:28,248
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

565
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:32,627
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

566
01:50:33,712 --> 01:50:35,755
<i>...very confidently...</i>

567
01:50:37,507 --> 01:50:40,552
<i>...that it's going to be
all right again.</i>

568
01:50:44,055 --> 01:50:46,141
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

569
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:50,520
<i>I really do.</i>

570
01:50:54,274 --> 01:50:55,984
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

571
01:50:57,944 --> 01:51:01,197
<i>...I can see you're
really upset about this.</i>

572
01:51:05,827 --> 01:51:09,539
<i>I honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly...</i>

573
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:13,501
<i>...take a stress pill
and think things over.</i>

574
01:51:18,923 --> 01:51:23,303
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

575
01:51:26,056 --> 01:51:29,392
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

576
01:51:29,642 --> 01:51:32,687
<i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>

577
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:41,780
<i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

578
01:51:43,323 --> 01:51:45,617
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

579
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,456
<i>Dave...</i>

580
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:53,958
<i>...stop.</i>

581
01:51:58,213 --> 01:52:00,840
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

582
01:52:05,095 --> 01:52:06,888
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

583
01:52:10,934 --> 01:52:13,353
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

584
01:52:19,067 --> 01:52:20,860
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

585
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:28,368
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

586
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:35,875
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

587
01:52:41,047 --> 01:52:42,632
<i>Dave.</i>

588
01:52:45,301 --> 01:52:47,554
<i>My mind is going.</i>

589
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,810
<i>I can feel it.</i>

590
01:52:59,315 --> 01:53:01,109
<i>I can feel it.</i>

591
01:53:05,071 --> 01:53:07,157
<i>My mind is going.</i>

592
01:53:12,537 --> 01:53:15,290
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

593
01:53:23,631 --> 01:53:25,508
<i>I can feel it.</i>

594
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,056
<i>I can feel it.</i>

595
01:53:35,477 --> 01:53:37,395
<i>I can feel it.</i>

596
01:53:45,278 --> 01:53:46,571
<i>I'm...</i>

597
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:48,865
<i>...afraid.</i>

598
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:57,415
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

599
01:53:58,416 --> 01:54:00,126
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

600
01:54:02,003 --> 01:54:07,133
<i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>

601
01:54:09,302 --> 01:54:12,430
<i>I became operational...</i>

602
01:54:12,805 --> 01:54:16,643
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

603
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:19,103
<i>...in Urbana, Illinois...</i>

604
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:24,526
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

605
01:54:26,069 --> 01:54:29,739
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

606
01:54:30,365 --> 01:54:33,284
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

607
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:37,455
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

608
01:54:37,914 --> 01:54:39,582
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

609
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:43,920
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:54:44,587 --> 01:54:46,005
Sing it for me.

611
01:54:47,257 --> 01:54:50,802
<i>It's called "Daisy."</i>

612
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,972
<i>Daisy</i>

613
01:54:55,557 --> 01:54:56,975
<i>Daisy</i>

614
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:02,230
<i>Give me your answer, do</i>

615
01:55:04,649 --> 01:55:09,237
<i>I'm half crazy</i>

616
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:13,908
<i>All for the love of you</i>

617
01:55:16,202 --> 01:55:17,412
<i>It won't be</i>

618
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:20,331
<i>A stylish marriage</i>

619
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:26,337
<i>I can't afford a carriage</i>

620
01:55:28,631 --> 01:55:31,050
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

621
01:55:31,926 --> 01:55:34,470
<i>Upon the seat</i>

622
01:55:35,805 --> 01:55:40,602
<i>Of a bicycle built for two</i>

623
01:55:42,353 --> 01:55:43,980
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

624
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:51,070
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

625
01:55:51,654 --> 01:55:53,364
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

626
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:59,329
<i>...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

627
01:56:00,288 --> 01:56:03,791
<i>...has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

628
01:56:04,042 --> 01:56:07,754
<i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

629
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:13,009
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

630
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:15,720
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

631
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:17,764
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

632
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:22,769
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

633
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:27,982
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

634
01:56:28,191 --> 01:56:29,651
<i>...was discovered.</i>

635
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:35,073
<i>It was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface...</i>

636
01:56:35,323 --> 01:56:37,575
<i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>

637
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:43,456
<i>Except for a single, very powerful...</i>

638
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:47,585
<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

639
01:56:48,836 --> 01:56:53,841
<i>...the 4-million-year-old monolith
has remained completely inert...</i>

640
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,846
<i>...its origin and purpose...</i>

641
01:56:59,263 --> 01:57:01,015
<i>...still a total mystery.</i>
