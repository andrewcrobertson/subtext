1
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:54,208
<i>People once believed
that when someone dies...</i>

2
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,794
<i>A crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.</i>

3
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:02,090
<i>But sometimes,
something so bad happens...</i>

4
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,676
<i>That a terrible sadness
is carried with it...</i>

5
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,553
<i>And the soul can't rest.</i>

6
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:10,474
<i>Then sometimes- just sometimes-</i>

7
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:14,978
<i>the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.</i>

8
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:40,087
I got one here!

9
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,614
Hey, sarge.

10
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,908
Yeah.

11
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:14,538
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

12
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,208
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

13
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,876
Nobody.

14
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:25,382
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

15
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:27,718
All right, guys, let's do it.

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,054
Devil's-fuckin'-night.
What's the count so far?

17
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:32,472
143 fires.

18
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:34,349
They're slacking off from last year.

19
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,227
Three hours to go.
Maybe they're just slow starters.

20
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,895
Corning through!

21
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,612
I really empathize, but you guys just can't
come in here and take her away like this.

22
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:48,155
There are procedures to stick by.

23
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:50,824
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

24
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,744
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia earhart.

25
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,579
We found her, detective,
and you missed it.

26
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:59,458
I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,169
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see
why they took away your gold shield.

28
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:04,338
I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,133
All right, clear outta here.

30
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,762
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

31
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:17,225
- Where's Eric?
-Just don't worry about him.

32
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,563
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

33
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:24,858
Look, I will.
You just lie back. Come on.

34
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:37,537
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,583
Look, your sister- she's gonna be okay.

36
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:46,004
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

37
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,506
She's my friend.

38
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,591
Her and Eric.

39
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:53,762
You lied to her about Eric.

40
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,430
I had to.

41
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:58,266
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

42
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,687
She's gonna die, isn't she?

43
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:12,823
Now, come on. Come on.

44
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,200
Come on. It's okay.

45
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,080
She's gonna be fine.

46
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:42,853
<i>A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.</i>

47
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,772
<i>I used to think that was true
about everything-</i>

48
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:49,776
<i>families, friends, feelings.</i>

49
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:54,281
<i>But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...</i>

50
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:58,785
<i>Two people who are meant to be together-
nothing can keep them apart.</i>

51
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,647
Later.

52
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,992
What are you, like, the night watchman?

53
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:07,062
You know, what this place needs
is a good natural catastrophe.

54
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:10,524
Earthquake, tornado, you know.

55
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:11,858
No, no, no, no. Mickey.

56
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,903
Come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

57
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,280
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

58
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:19,324
Hey, let me do it.

59
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:24,538
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

60
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,874
Don't cheap out on me.
Lots of onions.

61
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,042
Here you go.

62
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,503
There you go. All right.

63
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:33,088
Now we're talkin'.

64
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:37,300
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

65
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,512
How do you steer that on a wet street?

66
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,681
Pure talent. Hi.

67
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:46,685
Sarah, she's a genuine “hot dogger.”
you hungry?

68
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:48,562
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.

69
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,814
No onions though, okay?

70
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:52,357
No onions?

71
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,025
They make you fart big time.

72
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,619
You know, lake erie
actually caught on fire once...

73
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,414
From all the crap
floating around in it.

74
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,333
I wish I could have seen that.

75
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,022
Fire it up!

76
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:57,649
Fire it up!

77
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:00,151
- We busted their machines!
- Boom!

78
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,511
Oh, shit, guys.
T-bird, cop car. Cop car.

79
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,354
Bad people out on the street tonight.

80
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,988
- Damn it!
- What was that?

81
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,072
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

82
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:48,825
Mickey, call it in for me!

83
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:13,618
Gabriel.

84
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:26,131
Eric?

85
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,382
Department of housing!

86
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,551
Code violations?

87
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,011
Safety hazards?

88
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,264
Place looks fine to me.

89
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,307
Let's redecorate.

90
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:46,568
“Abashed, the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is...

91
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,071
Saw virtue in her shape how lovely.”

92
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,239
lt's pornography.

93
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,075
<i>Virtue?</i>

94
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,580
Shelly?

95
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,584
See ya!

96
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,546
No, me first.

97
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:10,508
Please.

98
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:14,846
- Shelly.
- Eric.

99
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,304
That's good.

100
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:04,270
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

101
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,315
Look at that. Look at that.

102
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,196
Here's to devil's night,
my new favorite holiday.

103
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,781
To devil's night.

104
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:18,785
You go over there and tell your pals-

105
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,955
you sick fuck.

106
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:25,750
You're out of your
motherfuckin' mind, man.

107
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,341
Look at that!

108
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:36,636
Pussies drink last, man.

109
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,473
Fuck you, tin tin.

110
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:45,186
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

111
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,354
This one is.

112
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,319
Which of you motor city motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

113
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:58,825
Hey! Fire it up! Fire it up!

114
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,209
Here's your shooters.

115
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,044
Put your guns away, huh, guys?

116
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,838
How ya doin', pussycat?

117
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,153
Boo.

118
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,623
I love you.

119
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:48,958
Say that again.

120
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,209
I love you.

121
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,879
Oh, boy.

122
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,049
Restaurant.

123
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,098
<i>Wow, you look great.</i>

124
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,730
Yeah.

125
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,526
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

126
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,169
Couple more rings. That's 24k.

127
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,254
24k, huh? It's 18k.

128
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,256
It's crap. It's probably fake.

129
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:02,675
Leather purse. Leather.

130
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:06,053
Geez.

131
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,931
What is this, tin tin-
a bloodstain that's on here?

132
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,604
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

133
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:17,523
Now, you take it or leave it.

134
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:20,359
Right there for ya.

135
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:24,447
Decisions, decisions. Yes, right.

136
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:29,535
You cheap-ass, chrome-dome...

137
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,581
Child-molestin', saprophyte motherfucker.

138
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,041
Close the gate when you go out!

139
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:37,752
I closes up for you real good, massa.

140
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,545
Fuck you.

141
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,883
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

142
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:51,182
Lucky I don't stab your fat ass.

143
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,499
What the fuck
you all painted up for, crackhead, huh?

144
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,840
Halloween ain't till manana.

145
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,511
Come on.

146
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:21,082
I'll kill you! You better go!

147
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,843
Fuck you, murderer!

148
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:36,389
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

149
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:37,932
What the fuck you want, man?

150
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,476
I want you to tell me a story.

151
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,770
A man and a woman
in aloft a year ago.

152
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:46,524
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Listen!

153
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,818
L'm sure you'll remember.

154
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,570
You killed them on Halloween.

155
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:53,656
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Halloween, yeah.

156
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,325
Some dude, some bitch.
Whatever, man.

157
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,244
Her name was Shelly.

158
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,997
You cut her. You raped her.

159
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,124
Shelly, yeah.

160
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:07,086
I shanked her pink ass,
and she loved it!

161
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,265
Murderer? Murderer?

162
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:22,059
Let me tell you about murder.
It's fun!

163
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:23,936
It's easy.

164
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:26,772
You gonna learn all about it.

165
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,071
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

166
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,783
We never miss.

167
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,044
Try harder. Try again!

168
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,929
Victims. Aren't we all?

169
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:16,197
<i>Sometimes it rains inside my head</i>

170
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,743
<i>when the words run dry</i>

171
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:24,038
<i>the walls are breathing</i>

172
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,082
look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?

173
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,459
Yeah, it's a mess.

174
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,716
<i>No, they don't have to take you</i>

175
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,594
I gotta go upstairs.
Report from the front.

176
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:43,224
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

177
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:46,644
get out of my way, you worms!

178
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:49,688
Give me some of that over there!

179
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,444
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

180
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,279
Hey, guess what.

181
00:22:57,363 --> 00:23:00,449
Arcade games fell down, went boom.

182
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,659
Boom.

183
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:04,370
Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

184
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:09,416
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

185
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,753
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

186
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:44,243
You're thinking about the past.

187
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:51,375
Dad gave me this.

188
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,460
Fifth birthday.

189
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,550
He said. “childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.”

190
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:15,774
ls she asleep?

191
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,867
I think we broke her.

192
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,876
I love her eyes. Pretty.

193
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:42,801
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

194
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,145
hey, kid, get the hell outta the road!

195
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,665
Don't fuck with me.

196
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:18,379
I told you to stay out of here.

197
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:21,966
Sol guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

198
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,968
She's busy.

199
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,053
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

200
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,513
I don't have any dolls.

201
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,892
Get some food, huh?

202
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:35,020
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

203
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,612
“Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.”

204
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:57,626
thirty, forty dollars.

205
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:01,797
Who the fuck is this now?

206
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,051
Hey! Piss off! We're closed!

207
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:12,725
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dust-head,
unless you want to get mutilated.

208
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,815
L'm gonna blow this guy's dick off.

209
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:23,777
Goddamn creatures of the night.
They never learn.

210
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,781
Hey! Hey!

211
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:38,125
“Suddenly I heard a tapping,
as if someone gently rapping...

212
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,586
Rapping at my chamber door.”

213
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:44,923
what are you talking about?

214
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,634
You heard me rapping, right?

215
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:51,889
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!

216
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:57,269
L'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

217
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:58,520
Gold.

218
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,106
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

219
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:09,198
Oh, shit. Oh, shit on me!

220
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:13,118
Shit on me. Shit on me!

221
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,503
Mr. Gideon. You're not paying attention.

222
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:28,967
No! My hand!

223
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:34,473
I repeat. A gold engagement ring, yes?

224
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,436
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named tin tin.

225
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,692
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

226
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:52,908
Who's this sack of shit?

227
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,120
That's tin tin,
one of t-bird's little helpers.

228
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:59,248
I think you can rule out accidental death.

229
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,126
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

230
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:06,380
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

231
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:11,176
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

232
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,178
L'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

233
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:17,015
Word to the wise. Watch your fuckin' mouth.

234
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:20,644
What the hell do you call that?

235
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,273
I call it blood, detective.

236
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:28,110
I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.

237
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:30,988
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

238
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,622
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

239
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:43,375
- Don't you know this game?
- What game are you talkin' about?

240
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:46,295
Okay, I'll tell you about the rings!

241
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:49,381
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

242
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:53,385
Take 'em! Take your fucking rings!

243
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,388
And you can choke on them,
you son of a bitch!

244
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:02,561
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.

245
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,406
No. No. No.

246
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,624
It's beautiful. I don't believe it.

247
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:28,921
<i>Shelly.</i>

248
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:39,431
I love you.

249
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,442
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

250
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,944
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

251
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:59,243
Now you're gonna tell me where to find
the rest of tin tin's little party pals.

252
00:29:59,326 --> 00:30:00,953
The pit. They all hang out at the pit.

253
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:03,497
All of t-bird's little potato-heads
hang out there.

254
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,875
Funboy- he lives there upstairs, all right?

255
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,001
Funboy.

256
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,962
Oh, baby.

257
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:14,383
- A whole jolly club-
- stop! Please!

258
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,635
With jolly pirate nicknames!

259
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:19,346
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

260
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:27,020
Each one of these is a life-
a life you helped destroy.

261
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,690
L'm begging you. Don't kill me.

262
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:33,610
L'm not gonna kill you.

263
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:37,698
Your job will be to tell the rest of them
that death is coming for them-

264
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,491
tonight.

265
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:49,167
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

266
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:56,633
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

267
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:58,385
You're nothing but street grease!
You hear that?

268
00:30:58,468 --> 00:31:00,846
Street grease, you motherfucker!

269
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,472
Is that gasoline I smell?

270
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,057
No, man, no!

271
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:27,539
It's on the house, kiddo.
You know that.

272
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:30,542
One root beer.

273
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,255
I can't do anything.

274
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,801
Your mom, technically, she's off right now.

275
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,928
Yeah, way off.

276
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,685
Police! Don't move!

277
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:50,896
I said, “don't move!”

278
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,608
I thought the police always said “freeze!”

279
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,027
lam the police
and I say don't move, snow white.

280
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,612
You move, you're dead.

281
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:03,909
And I say I'm dead and I move.

282
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:07,245
Not one more step. I'm serious.

283
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:11,666
Then shoot, if you will, officer Albrecht.

284
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,878
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

285
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,671
You high?

286
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:19,966
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

287
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,012
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

288
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:26,807
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

289
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,352
I want you to move over to the curb.
Real nice and easy.

290
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:31,436
Move it!

291
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:36,191
We're gonna wait here for backup.

292
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:38,276
It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.

293
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:40,862
Oh, it gets better.

294
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:43,448
Do you know someone named t-bird?

295
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:46,743
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives.

296
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,036
Like the coat?

297
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,373
- You're the guy that murdered tin tin.
- Hey, check it out!

298
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,292
He was already dead.

299
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:57,963
He died a year ago-
the moment he touched her.

300
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:03,468
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

301
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:05,971
Get away from there!

302
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:08,723
Cops! Get outta here!

303
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:12,477
Leave it! Leave it! Run!

304
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:21,111
Oh, great. Great.

305
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:25,115
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

306
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,576
And you lose him
right out in the open.

307
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:32,539
Well, at least he didn't do that
“walking against the wind” shit.

308
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,916
- I hate that.
- Little early for devil's night.

309
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,335
What the hell is going on there?

310
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,756
You are very restless.

311
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,926
Just wish I was a little hungry again.
That's all.

312
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,678
Be careful of what you ask for.

313
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,638
Yeah, you may get it. I know.

314
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,737
There are energies aligning against you.

315
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,281
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

316
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:20,086
Yummy.

317
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:29,346
Gideon's pawn shop just burned down
to the foundation.

318
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,890
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

319
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:34,559
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

320
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:37,270
- L'm sure you must be awful disappointed.
- I got trouble.

321
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:40,690
One of my crew got himself perished.

322
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,068
- Who might that be?
- Tin tin.

323
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,697
Somebody stuck his blades in all
his major organs in alphabetical order.

324
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,117
Gentlemen, I think we ought to have
an introspective moment of silence...

325
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,620
For poor old tin tin.

326
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,833
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

327
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:01,711
- Whatever you say. I can do.
- Good.

328
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,880
That's very reassuring.

329
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:07,551
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

330
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,265
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of god or something?

331
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,976
Call it my need to know.

332
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:50,093
Hey! Let me go, you creep!

333
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:59,811
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

334
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,608
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a butt-face.

335
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,318
I could have made it.

336
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:10,322
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

337
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,199
Sometimes.

338
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,454
It's more like surfing than skating.

339
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,998
I wish the rain would stop,just once.

340
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,626
It can't rain all the time.

341
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:24,669
Eric?

342
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:46,232
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

343
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,777
Double homicide a year ago.

344
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,695
No convictions.

345
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:54,199
Annie, look at that.

346
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,537
“We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 caulderon court apartments”-

347
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,122
what is this, a petition?

348
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:03,541
A big “kick me” sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

349
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,126
The cause got her killed.

350
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,712
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

351
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:13,677
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

352
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,305
The last time you snooping on a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

353
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:21,393
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

354
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,112
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

355
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,322
L'm cool.

356
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:38,535
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

357
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:41,705
I owe you one.

358
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,790
Yeah, right.

359
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:46,084
Damn.

360
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:15,196
Tomorrow night we can get high...

361
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,908
And watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

362
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:46,644
There's a big fuckin' bird over there.

363
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:51,983
It's a squab.

364
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:57,572
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

365
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,991
Bird. Birdie.

366
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,660
Here, birdie, birdie.

367
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:05,705
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie.

368
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:14,255
Here, funboy.

369
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:18,510
What the fuck?

370
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:29,354
Man, don't do that!
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

371
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:31,689
Look at the guy.

372
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:33,358
Don't sweat it.

373
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,364
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

374
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:52,085
Take your shot, funboy.
You got me dead bang.

375
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:59,050
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

376
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,679
You need professional help.

377
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:06,933
Bingo!

378
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:09,727
He shoots! He scores!

379
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:22,532
Jesus Christ!

380
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:26,369
Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.

381
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:28,705
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

382
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,589
He hands the innkeeper
three nails, and he asks-

383
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:41,175
don't you ever fuckin' die?

384
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,094
“Can you put me up for the night?”

385
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:53,605
- does that hurt?
- Fuck, yes, it fuckin' hurts!

386
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:55,773
Oh, god.

387
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:59,903
Look what you've done to my sheets.

388
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,137
L've got a gun in my pocket.

389
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:31,851
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

390
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,498
Stay away! Stay away from me!

391
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,966
Look.

392
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:09,722
“Mother” is the name for god
on the lips and hearts of all children.

393
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:14,560
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

394
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:29,784
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

395
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:05,570
If l wanted ice, I would have asked for ice!
Now fill it up!

396
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,033
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

397
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:11,784
I really need this.

398
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,294
All right.

399
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:25,298
You burn yourself playing with matches?

400
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,967
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

401
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,511
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

402
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:33,514
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

403
00:43:33,598 --> 00:43:36,434
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

404
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:41,439
- Hey, hon!
- Good night, Darla.

405
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,988
You stay put right there.

406
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,583
Get away, steam-head.

407
00:44:33,074 --> 00:44:36,619
<i>You can see I'm here on the corner
of 27th street and east Washington place...</i>

408
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:39,997
<i>The site of last year's
biggest devil's night conflagration.</i>

409
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,250
<i>It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...</i>

410
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:45,962
<i>Across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.</i>

411
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:48,673
<i>The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...</i>

412
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,800
<i>And cost the lives of two firefighters.</i>

413
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:55,763
<i>In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police precinct-</i>

414
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:58,391
freeze!

415
00:44:58,474 --> 00:45:00,893
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

416
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,188
Fuck.

417
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:08,359
Good likeness.

418
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:12,155
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

419
00:45:13,322 --> 00:45:14,490
You still have your hat on.

420
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:20,496
I gotta sit down.

421
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,084
Holy shit.

422
00:45:27,587 --> 00:45:29,005
<i>Say...</i>

423
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:34,594
Are you some kind of... ghost?

424
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:35,511
Boo.

425
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:46,147
I don't know what I am.

426
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,774
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

427
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,864
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

428
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:58,034
She was beaten and raped.

429
00:45:58,117 --> 00:46:02,705
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

430
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:05,208
Come on. Read the file.

431
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:09,837
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours
in intensive care.

432
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,965
Her body finally just gave it up.

433
00:46:13,049 --> 00:46:15,927
I saw it. I couldn't do Jack for her.

434
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,898
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

435
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:37,156
You okay?

436
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,158
I saw her.

437
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:44,789
I saw her through your eyes.

438
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:47,041
You stayed with her the whole time.

439
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:51,295
Well, you gotta understand
something, all right?

440
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:57,385
I was hoping she'd come out of it,
you know...

441
00:46:57,468 --> 00:47:00,388
Give me something I could work with.

442
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,056
Yeah.

443
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,184
Look, i-

444
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,770
why didn't you do something about it?

445
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:11,148
You think any of those people in that building-
even the ones who signed the petition-

446
00:47:11,232 --> 00:47:12,984
would talk after what happened to you?

447
00:47:14,777 --> 00:47:16,946
I kept asking questions...

448
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:20,783
And finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

449
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:26,706
This your wife?

450
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:31,335
Yeah, we- well, not anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

451
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:34,338
It's funny.

452
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:39,844
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

453
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,263
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

454
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:45,641
Believe me, nothing is trivial.

455
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,906
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

456
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:08,831
Are you gonna vanish
into thin air again?

457
00:48:12,877 --> 00:48:15,171
I thought I'd use your front door.

458
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:19,675
Look, man...

459
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,055
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

460
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:26,932
Yeah.

461
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:34,940
Yeah.

462
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:38,986
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

463
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,822
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

464
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:44,992
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

465
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:48,079
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

466
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:50,873
I saw him too. He had a guitar.

467
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:55,378
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

468
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,131
He winked at ya? Musicians.

469
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,093
What else did you see?

470
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:05,096
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're gonna do about all this crap!

471
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:09,975
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed away and went swirling.

472
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,021
You ain't lost everything.

473
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:19,235
Yeah? And maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Jesus!

474
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,905
Fair enough. Catch.

475
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,409
Jesus.

476
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,911
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

477
00:49:28,994 --> 00:49:30,830
Are you tellin' me this thing is real?

478
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:34,583
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

479
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:38,754
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

480
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:42,967
You're directly out of your fucking mind!
You know that?

481
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:47,888
Yeah. Eyes see.

482
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:50,933
It's one of the most important things
i learned from my sister.

483
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,643
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?

484
00:49:54,353 --> 00:49:57,690
My father's daughter. That's right.

485
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,483
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

486
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:03,279
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.

487
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:06,782
With a lot of detail. What do you say?

488
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:10,411
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

489
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:13,914
He told me to tell t-bird
that death was on its way.

490
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:16,208
Whatever the fuck that means.

491
00:50:17,126 --> 00:50:20,045
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

492
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,215
You wanna relax that thing now?

493
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:27,970
This bird man, he just happened
to let you live, huh?

494
00:50:28,053 --> 00:50:32,266
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

495
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,144
I ain't makin' all this up.

496
00:50:35,227 --> 00:50:38,397
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

497
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,694
All right.

498
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,867
A boy and his bird.

499
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,370
Awful touching.

500
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,592
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

501
00:51:13,557 --> 00:51:14,558
Thanks.

502
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:18,229
Funboy said he saw a black bird too.

503
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,689
A big one.

504
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:23,108
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

505
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:27,530
<i>L'll have thejanitor come on up.</i>

506
00:52:32,094 --> 00:52:36,307
You again. Are you lost or hungry?

507
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,017
Hi.

508
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,439
<i>It can't rain all the time</i>

509
00:52:43,522 --> 00:52:45,524
<i>can't rain all the time</i>

510
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,872
I mean, how many times I gotta tell you?
We're in this together, or we ain't!

511
00:52:59,955 --> 00:53:01,957
If one part falls, it all falls!

512
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:06,378
You know how long it took us
to put this together.

513
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:09,048
Then that piece of rat shit made tin tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll!

514
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,841
Tin tin was a dick.

515
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,135
Tin tin.

516
00:53:14,345 --> 00:53:18,557
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

517
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,517
Fire it up!

518
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:26,106
No funboy.

519
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,193
Probably still bangin' away on Darla.

520
00:53:34,573 --> 00:53:37,660
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.

521
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:39,745
L'm on it.

522
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:14,029
What the fuck
are you supposed to be, man?

523
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:17,950
L'm your passenger.

524
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,751
Drive.

525
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,633
What's all this happy horseshit?

526
00:54:35,634 --> 00:54:37,845
Hey, t-bird! T-bird!

527
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:45,519
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

528
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:49,606
Stupid ass-hair! You hit my car!

529
00:54:56,572 --> 00:55:00,993
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

530
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,497
We could use you.
You did tin tin.

531
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,667
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

532
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:13,464
You got that cream stuff?

533
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:18,302
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

534
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:21,847
What in the crap-

535
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,062
oh, look. Makin' us popular.

536
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:31,982
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

537
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:40,449
<i>This is vehicle 48.
We got us a big old red hot rod.</i>

538
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:45,204
Turn.

539
00:55:46,538 --> 00:55:49,291
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

540
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:50,542
Right?

541
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,800
Damn! Dead end!

542
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,640
Look out!

543
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,562
Dumb ass! Get outta the way!

544
00:56:23,408 --> 00:56:26,537
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

545
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,709
Shit! Shit!

546
00:56:41,385 --> 00:56:43,512
I hate this. This ain't good.

547
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,433
T-bird! I got you, man!

548
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:49,726
Shit!

549
00:57:04,658 --> 00:57:05,993
Remember? Yeah.
I remember everything.

550
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:08,412
But I don't know- what? What?

551
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:11,665
What? What are you talkin' about?

552
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:13,000
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

553
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:16,003
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

554
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:18,088
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

555
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:21,466
She wasn't going along
with our tenant relocation program.

556
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:25,012
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear...

557
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:27,472
Into a total cluster fuck!

558
00:57:27,556 --> 00:57:30,392
Who gives a shit?
It's ancient history!

559
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:33,812
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?

560
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:36,940
Speak to me! Speak!

561
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,444
Did you send us these complaints?

562
00:57:42,112 --> 00:57:45,407
Come here!
“abashed, the devil stood”-

563
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,910
does it get you sweaty?

564
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:53,332
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

565
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:57,252
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

566
00:57:57,336 --> 00:57:59,880
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.

567
00:57:59,963 --> 00:58:01,757
There ain't no coming back.

568
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,010
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

569
00:58:05,093 --> 00:58:07,346
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

570
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:14,978
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

571
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:25,072
“Abashed, the devil stood...

572
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:28,033
And felt how awful goodness is.”

573
00:58:28,116 --> 00:58:31,119
“and felt how awful goodness is.”

574
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,539
“and felt”-

575
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:47,719
t-bird!

576
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,355
<i>This is the 7:00 A.M. edition of action news.</i>

577
00:59:40,439 --> 00:59:42,816
<i>For over a decade,
the night before Halloween...</i>

578
00:59:42,899 --> 00:59:47,195
<i>Has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city- “devil's night”...</i>

579
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:50,741
<i>The name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.</i>

580
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:56,163
<i>Last year, 200 individual blazes were reported,
and eleven people lost their lives.</i>

581
00:59:56,246 --> 01:00:01,376
<i>Tonight, we'ii be keying on what may become
the biggest and deadliest devil's night ever.</i>

582
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,088
<i>The mayor has firefighters
from all surrounding counties-</i>

583
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:08,967
do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

584
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,722
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

585
01:00:13,805 --> 01:00:16,600
Wait, you loved eggs.

586
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,227
Yeah, when I was five.

587
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,939
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

588
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:26,401
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

589
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:31,531
It wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

590
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,116
Who?

591
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,412
It was nuts.

592
01:00:38,413 --> 01:00:42,667
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

593
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:49,466
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

594
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:51,802
Over easy.

595
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:58,016
I like 'em over easy, morn.

596
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:10,904
Hey, Albrecht.

597
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,410
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

598
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:20,413
We just fished this out of the river.
He was fused to his own car.

599
01:01:20,497 --> 01:01:22,749
We're gonna have to ID his teeth.

600
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,919
His name is t-bird.
Arson was his specialty.

601
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:28,755
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

602
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:33,260
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.

603
01:01:33,343 --> 01:01:34,970
Come here.

604
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:40,851
You're holding out on me.

605
01:01:42,227 --> 01:01:44,938
I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

606
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,816
And you're covering up for somebody.

607
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:50,235
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

608
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:53,196
You're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?

609
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,324
Okay. Gideon's blows to hell, and you're
having a chitchat with some weirdo...

610
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:59,369
Who winds up in t-bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

611
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,997
Then you steal
one of my case files from homicide...

612
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,416
And you're saying this is just
a fuckin' automobile accident?

613
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:07,169
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

614
01:02:07,252 --> 01:02:08,879
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

615
01:02:08,962 --> 01:02:10,964
You gotta write that shit down.

616
01:02:11,047 --> 01:02:12,924
All right, smart-ass.

617
01:02:13,008 --> 01:02:16,052
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

618
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:18,972
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.

619
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:21,433
Suspension? For what?

620
01:02:21,516 --> 01:02:23,894
Misconduct.

621
01:02:26,229 --> 01:02:27,898
Yeah, give me the lab.

622
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:22,035
<i>One for sorrow, two for joy...</i>

623
01:03:22,118 --> 01:03:24,246
<i>Three for a girl, four for a boy.</i>

624
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:38,093
<i>You know how most people talk a lot
and never say a word?</i>

625
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,829
Eric?

626
01:04:09,332 --> 01:04:11,835
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

627
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:14,796
Gabriel.

628
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:19,384
I thought you were dead.

629
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,469
You're not dead, are you?

630
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:49,539
I knew it was you.

631
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,336
Even with the makeup.

632
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,427
I remembered your song.

633
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:06,139
You said,
“can't rain all the time.”

634
01:05:06,222 --> 01:05:08,350
that is from your song, right?

635
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:22,530
Come on, Eric.
I know you're here.

636
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:28,203
I miss you and Shelly.

637
01:05:32,582 --> 01:05:35,460
Gets so lonely all by myself.

638
01:05:39,047 --> 01:05:41,966
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

639
01:05:43,093 --> 01:05:45,762
Sarah, I do care.

640
01:05:56,314 --> 01:05:58,525
That's him. That's him!

641
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:01,986
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

642
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,323
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

643
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:07,909
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

644
01:06:07,992 --> 01:06:10,829
And he flash-fried t-bird
to his fuckin' car!

645
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,374
T-bird! Here's to you, buddy.

646
01:06:14,457 --> 01:06:18,461
Maybe we oughta just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.

647
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:24,342
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

648
01:06:24,426 --> 01:06:25,677
Empty-

649
01:06:27,095 --> 01:06:28,972
grave? What grave?

650
01:06:29,055 --> 01:06:32,684
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.

651
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:36,020
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

652
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:38,731
It's not fair. It's funboy's fault.

653
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:42,026
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he said...

654
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:45,363
“Waste them both.” and now this ghost
gonna kill my ass next!

655
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,620
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

656
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,832
- This ghost gonna kill-
- hey!

657
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,376
It ain't no ghost.

658
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:02,046
They have all arrived.

659
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,508
Watch him. We might need him.

660
01:07:07,177 --> 01:07:09,471
Ghost gonna kill my-

661
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:24,569
he like his plain or with onions?

662
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:30,074
Fine. Don't talk to me.

663
01:07:30,158 --> 01:07:33,244
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

664
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,956
That's what I thought.

665
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,292
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

666
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,920
You'll just think I'm nuts.

667
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:44,047
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

668
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:48,176
You see him too?

669
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:50,762
I saw somebody.

670
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:53,598
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

671
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,769
Eric didn't come back for me.

672
01:07:57,852 --> 01:08:02,190
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

673
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:05,068
You want a friend to walk you home?

674
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:58,329
<i>You things, things
things of the flesh</i>

675
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:01,082
<i>do it slow</i>

676
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:05,461
<i>down avenues, cut me</i>

677
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:09,215
<i>lust in my eyes</i>

678
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:12,260
<i>licking lips encouraging</i>

679
01:09:12,343 --> 01:09:16,180
<i>Mr. careworn</i>

680
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:21,728
<i>to gaze upon the screen, mask on</i>

681
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,938
<i>after the flesh</i>

682
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:41,122
<i>boys.</i>

683
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:46,085
It seems our friend t-bird
won't be joining us this evening...

684
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:49,213
On account of a slight case of death.

685
01:09:49,297 --> 01:09:51,299
You wanna sit down?

686
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:58,723
Well, well, well.
Devil's night is upon us again.

687
01:09:58,806 --> 01:10:00,767
I thought we'd throw a little party...

688
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:04,145
Start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

689
01:10:04,228 --> 01:10:06,397
I like the pretty lights.

690
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:13,279
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

691
01:10:13,363 --> 01:10:14,989
That's no reason to quit.

692
01:10:15,073 --> 01:10:18,576
Wrong. Best reason to quit.

693
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,037
Only reason to quit.

694
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:25,208
A man has an idea.

695
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,463
The idea attracts others...
Like-minded.

696
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:37,053
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.

697
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,764
What was the idea?

698
01:10:41,974 --> 01:10:43,601
That's what's been bothering me, boys.

699
01:10:43,685 --> 01:10:46,479
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

700
01:10:46,562 --> 01:10:49,065
It'd put a big old smile on my face.

701
01:10:50,608 --> 01:10:52,652
You see, gentlemen...

702
01:10:52,735 --> 01:10:55,863
Greed is for amateurs.

703
01:10:57,448 --> 01:11:02,495
Disorder, chaos, anarchy-

704
01:11:02,578 --> 01:11:04,288
now that's fun!

705
01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:07,291
- What about devil's night?
- What about it?

706
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:10,795
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

707
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:13,923
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit-heel was imitating me.

708
01:11:14,006 --> 01:11:17,427
Do you know what they got now?

709
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,596
Devil's night greeting cards.

710
01:11:22,265 --> 01:11:24,851
Isn't that precious?

711
01:11:24,934 --> 01:11:26,561
Yeah.

712
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:31,983
The idea has become
the institution, boys.

713
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:33,860
Time to move along.

714
01:11:33,943 --> 01:11:36,362
You don't want us to do “light my fire” time
for the whole city?

715
01:11:36,446 --> 01:11:38,906
No.

716
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:43,327
I want you to set a fire so goddamn big,
the gods will notice us again.

717
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:46,038
That's what I'm saying.
I want all you boys...

718
01:11:46,122 --> 01:11:49,500
To be able to look me straight
in the eye one more time and say...

719
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:52,211
“Are we having fun or what?”

720
01:11:52,295 --> 01:11:56,132
hey, you! What's your name?
Skank, you don't feel that?

721
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:58,134
I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.

722
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:02,096
“L feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.”

723
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:06,476
well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you!

724
01:12:08,936 --> 01:12:11,606
How the hell did
that thing get in here?

725
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:14,317
Gentlemen.

726
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:20,198
There he is! Let me go!
Let me go! I gotta go!

727
01:12:25,453 --> 01:12:28,539
You're him, huh? The avenger.

728
01:12:28,623 --> 01:12:31,083
The killer of killers.

729
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:34,045
Nice outfit.

730
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:36,172
L'm not sure about the face though.

731
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:39,550
L just want him.

732
01:12:39,634 --> 01:12:41,761
Well, you can't have him.

733
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:43,471
<i>Well...</i>

734
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:49,060
I see you have made your decision.

735
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:52,605
Now let's see you enforce it.

736
01:12:52,688 --> 01:12:56,359
This is already
boring the shit out of me. Kill him!

737
01:13:03,908 --> 01:13:06,202
That had to hurt.

738
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,038
Well, that's that.

739
01:13:10,248 --> 01:13:12,333
That guy was crazy.

740
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:20,716
He's gone.

741
01:13:28,766 --> 01:13:29,934
Get him!

742
01:13:49,453 --> 01:13:51,664
Help me! He's gonna kill me!

743
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:56,586
Jesus Christ!

744
01:14:48,346 --> 01:14:49,805
You're all going to die.

745
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,530
Get the fuck outta here!

746
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:46,362
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, skank?

747
01:15:46,445 --> 01:15:50,741
L'm not skank.
There's skank right there.

748
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:53,577
- Skank''s dead.
- That's right.

749
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:03,838
What in the crap-

750
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,758
- freeze!
- Hold it!

751
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:11,262
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

752
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:23,232
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

753
01:16:26,694 --> 01:16:28,612
Stop running immediately.

754
01:16:28,696 --> 01:16:30,239
Holy shit!

755
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:42,918
Repeat. Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs.

756
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:28,130
Come on! Move it!

757
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:35,679
My advice? Next time, duck.

758
01:17:37,723 --> 01:17:40,101
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.

759
01:17:43,562 --> 01:17:45,147
Shit!

760
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,446
I knew you were gonna do that.

761
01:17:53,697 --> 01:17:57,993
Look at that out there.
The whole city oughta be in flames by now.

762
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,247
Sky oughta be red.

763
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:05,668
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

764
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:11,423
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

765
01:18:11,507 --> 01:18:13,384
I like him already.

766
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:16,428
The crow is his link...

767
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:19,056
Between the land of the living...

768
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,433
And the realm of the dead.

769
01:18:21,517 --> 01:18:26,063
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

770
01:18:52,256 --> 01:18:54,258
L'm coming home, Shelly.

771
01:19:42,306 --> 01:19:46,852
You're gonna say I shouldn't be in the cemetery
in the middle of the night, right?

772
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:49,480
Safest place in the world to be.

773
01:19:49,563 --> 01:19:53,567
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

774
01:19:55,277 --> 01:19:57,780
It's really late, Sarah.

775
01:19:57,863 --> 01:20:00,574
You didn't say good-bye.

776
01:20:00,658 --> 01:20:03,285
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

777
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:06,789
And you're never coming back.

778
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,634
I gave this to Shelly once.

779
01:20:22,304 --> 01:20:25,307
I think she'd like you to have it.

780
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,605
This way, you'll always remember her.

781
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:34,275
I'll never take it off.

782
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:56,213
I better go sneak back in the house.

783
01:21:02,886 --> 01:21:04,346
Bye.

784
01:21:29,913 --> 01:21:31,415
Take it easy, sweetheart.

785
01:21:38,672 --> 01:21:40,883
Come on. Come on.

786
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:58,233
What is that? Some sort of
souvenir there from your pal?

787
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,946
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

788
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,748
Her eyes are so innocent.

789
01:22:24,718 --> 01:22:25,969
Eric!

790
01:22:26,053 --> 01:22:27,554
Eric, help!

791
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,891
Quick impression for ya.

792
01:23:12,975 --> 01:23:16,437
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

793
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,857
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

794
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:25,863
Well, well. Why don't you just give me
a minute to think about that, huh?

795
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:37,124
Nah, fuck it.

796
01:23:46,508 --> 01:23:47,676
Aw, fuck.

797
01:23:54,683 --> 01:23:56,643
Well, well, well.

798
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:59,438
It does seem to me that
our little life has undergone...

799
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,982
A rather significant change
in the past few minutes now.

800
01:24:02,065 --> 01:24:03,400
Wouldn't you agree?

801
01:24:07,696 --> 01:24:11,158
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

802
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,914
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

803
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:20,501
Bye-bye, birdie.

804
01:24:42,606 --> 01:24:44,066
It's mine.

805
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:08,006
Shit.

806
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:12,219
Well,just came by to pay my respects,
and here you are getting all shot up again.

807
01:25:12,302 --> 01:25:14,888
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

808
01:25:14,972 --> 01:25:16,515
Two more.

809
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:19,017
I can handle it. Don't worry.

810
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,979
L'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

811
01:25:22,062 --> 01:25:24,523
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

812
01:25:24,606 --> 01:25:28,277
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

813
01:25:30,946 --> 01:25:34,449
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

814
01:25:34,533 --> 01:25:36,577
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

815
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,122
I was. I'm not anymore.

816
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:44,418
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

817
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,502
Come on.

818
01:25:50,507 --> 01:25:52,134
You take that.

819
01:26:22,205 --> 01:26:23,790
You were supposed to stay behind me.

820
01:26:23,874 --> 01:26:25,667
I think I messed up.

821
01:26:49,775 --> 01:26:53,320
This is all the power you ever had.

822
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:55,197
Now it is mine.

823
01:26:55,989 --> 01:27:00,077
Pity there's not more time...

824
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,703
For us.

825
01:27:19,846 --> 01:27:22,683
Help, Eric! I'm scared!

826
01:27:25,435 --> 01:27:27,062
Let me go!

827
01:27:37,072 --> 01:27:38,615
Let her go!

828
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:44,621
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

829
01:27:46,206 --> 01:27:48,125
- All right.
- No!

830
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:57,611
Sarah?

831
01:28:57,694 --> 01:28:58,653
Look out!

832
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:05,702
Eric!

833
01:29:14,044 --> 01:29:18,423
You know, my daddy used to say,
“every man's got a devil...

834
01:29:18,507 --> 01:29:20,675
And you can't rest
till you find him.”

835
01:29:20,759 --> 01:29:23,303
what happened back there
with you and your girlfriend-

836
01:29:24,304 --> 01:29:26,640
I cleared that building.

837
01:29:26,723 --> 01:29:30,227
Hell, nothing in this town happens
without my say-so.

838
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,562
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

839
01:29:33,688 --> 01:29:36,608
But if it's any consolation to you...

840
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,152
You have put a smile on my face.

841
01:29:39,236 --> 01:29:41,863
You got a lot of spirit, son.

842
01:29:42,864 --> 01:29:45,158
Lam gonna miss you.

843
01:29:45,242 --> 01:29:47,118
I have something to give you.

844
01:29:47,202 --> 01:29:49,663
I don't want it anymore.

845
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:56,044
Thirty hours of pain!

846
01:29:59,464 --> 01:30:01,174
All at once!

847
01:30:04,052 --> 01:30:06,054
All for you.

848
01:30:41,214 --> 01:30:42,799
Go help him.

849
01:30:47,095 --> 01:30:49,306
Are you alive?

850
01:30:53,268 --> 01:30:55,312
God, I need a cigarette.

851
01:31:01,276 --> 01:31:03,320
Everybody else dead?

852
01:31:03,403 --> 01:31:05,864
You helped me.

853
01:31:05,947 --> 01:31:08,199
What you kept in here saved me.

854
01:31:08,283 --> 01:31:11,411
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

855
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:13,496
L've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

856
01:31:19,502 --> 01:31:21,129
Oh, yuck.

857
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,344
L'm quitting as of now- if I live.

858
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,230
Stay with him until help comes.

859
01:31:39,314 --> 01:31:42,817
He'll be okay, right?

860
01:31:43,777 --> 01:31:45,111
Eric?

861
01:31:48,156 --> 01:31:50,158
He does that a lot.

862
01:32:06,758 --> 01:32:08,259
Shelly.

863
01:32:21,064 --> 01:32:25,902
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicide.

864
01:32:27,153 --> 01:32:30,115
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.

865
01:32:30,198 --> 01:32:33,576
I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

866
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:37,330
Look, you go on home.
I'm okay.

867
01:32:37,414 --> 01:32:40,875
- Want to tell me what's going on?
