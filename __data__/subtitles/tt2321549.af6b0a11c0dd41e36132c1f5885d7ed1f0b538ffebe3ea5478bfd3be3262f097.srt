1
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:27,359
Mum!

2
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,294
Mum!

3
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,757
Mummy!

4
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:54,470
Mum!

5
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:57,973
Mum!

6
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:01,227
I had the dream again.

7
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:13,007
"And he climbed down
that chimney,"

8
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:16,427
"straight into
the huge black pot."

9
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:20,704
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

10
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,813
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

11
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,398
I'm sure they did.

12
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:31,901
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

13
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,093
I'll smash its head in.

14
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,491
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

15
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:40,034
It's very late.

16
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:42,977
Can we read it again?

17
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:49,710
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact -"

18
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:54,780
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

19
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,039
What have you done?

20
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,874
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

21
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:12,251
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

22
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:15,421
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

23
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,653
Please don't!

24
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,677
Nothing in my hands.

25
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,305
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

26
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,890
Look at me, Mum!

27
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,141
Come on, Samuel.

28
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,477
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

29
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,395
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

30
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,980
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

31
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,982
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

32
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:38,217
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

33
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,982
Don't do that!

34
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,153
Ready?

35
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,032
Come on.

36
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,140
Quick. You're late already.

37
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:09,934
What have you got in there?

38
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,458
See you later, alligator.

39
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,614
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

40
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:24,782
What?

41
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,742
One with your milk in it.

42
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,619
I don't want milk.

43
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:31,520
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

44
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,129
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

45
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,571
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

46
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:42,591
Do you want a cuppa?

47
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,659
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

48
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:48,830
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

49
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,415
Right?

50
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,106
Amelia?

51
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,881
Your son's school
is on the phone.

52
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,489
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:06,907
Did he hurt anyone?

54
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,349
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

55
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,455
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

56
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,790
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

57
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,500
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

58
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:20,671
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

59
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:21,964
Monitor?

60
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,924
He'll be separated
from the other children.

61
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,761
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

62
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,137
Samuel won't cope with this.

63
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,597
He already feels so different.

64
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:32,475
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

65
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:33,601
Mrs Fanning,

66
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,062
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

67
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,940
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

68
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,193
What he needs
is some understanding.

69
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:44,904
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

70
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:47,406
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

71
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,033
I think I'll just find
another school.

72
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:51,535
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

73
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,579
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

74
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,372
that sees my son
as a human being

75
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,374
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

76
00:06:57,398 --> 00:07:00,377
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

77
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,838
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

78
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:05,072
His name is Samuel.

79
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:15,184
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

80
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,353
You can play
on that swing you like

81
00:07:17,377 --> 00:07:19,271
for as long as you like, OK?

82
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,316
Mrs Bruen hates me.

83
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,966
No, she doesn't.

84
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,427
Just need a break, that's all.

85
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,723
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

86
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,978
I'll tell her later.

87
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:41,108
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

88
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,588
Sam, don't bother the lady.

89
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,215
No, no, no. That's alright.

90
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,092
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

91
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,718
My dad's in the cemetery.

92
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:50,928
Oh. That's...

93
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:53,931
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

94
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,642
Samuel.

95
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,060
I'm sorry. He just...

96
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:00,938
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

97
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,066
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

98
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,860
We have to go.

99
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,093
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

100
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,157
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

101
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,825
Right in front of
his own installation.

102
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,827
Lost all these sales.

103
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,871
You're not listening.

104
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,622
I am. I am.

105
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:21,750
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

106
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:23,752
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

107
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:26,338
Mum! Mum!

108
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:29,197
I'm gonna smash its head!

109
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:34,536
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

110
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,852
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

111
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,045
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

112
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,341
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

113
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,447
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

114
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:54,742
Mum! Mum!

115
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,327
She wants to have
a princess party.

116
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,579
Mum! Mum!

117
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,080
That's OK.

118
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,333
We don't have to come.

119
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:04,293
You can still come.

120
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:05,419
Mum!

121
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,630
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

122
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,715
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

123
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:13,075
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

124
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,140
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

125
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,433
this year, anyway.

126
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,792
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

127
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,522
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

128
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:27,524
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

129
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:28,734
and I end up feeling awful.

130
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,343
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

131
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,239
We'll be fine.

132
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,406
We'll be absolutely fine.

133
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,181
Mum! Look at me!

134
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,480
Mama!

135
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,840
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

136
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,842
You look tired, little one.

137
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,178
Have you been in the wars today?

138
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:57,596
A few wars.

139
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,266
He's had a big day, that's all.

140
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,892
He's just exhausted.

141
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,727
Poor little sweetheart.

142
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,145
Bugsy.

143
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,897
Come here, little girl. Hello.

144
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,525
You look tired too, love.

145
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:10,943
You OK?

146
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,176
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

147
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,073
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

148
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:18,826
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

149
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,434
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,434
You can choose one tonight.

151
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,919
Where did you get this?

152
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,444
On the shelf.

153
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:21,805
"If it's in a word
or it's in a look,"

154
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:24,623
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook."

155
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:31,065
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,"

156
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,068
"then you can make friends
with a special one -"

157
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,634
"a friend of you and me."

158
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:45,496
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book."

159
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,209
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -"

160
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,754
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

161
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,799
"That's when you'll know
he's around."

162
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,157
"You'll see him if you look."

163
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:05,766
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

164
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,726
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

165
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,626
But you said I could choose.

166
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:16,902
"This is what he wears on top."

167
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:19,094
"He's funny, don't you think?"

168
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:24,432
"See him
in your room at night..."

169
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,645
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

170
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,042
Mum?

171
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,860
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

172
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:37,946
Mummy?

173
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,658
Mummy?!

174
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,971
"How sweetly they sung,

175
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,722
"telling of the happiness
and loveliness

176
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:47,891
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

177
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,458
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

178
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,799
It's that time of night again.

179
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:03,467
Time...

180
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,928
If that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

181
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:08,328
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

182
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,843
Do you...

183
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,282
Mum!

184
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:52,117
- It's in my room!
- What is?

185
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:53,910
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

186
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:58,624
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

187
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:01,376
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

188
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,378
It's just a book.

189
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,756
It can't hurt you.

190
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,508
You've had a big day.

191
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,159
You're just exhausted.

192
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,914
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

193
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,605
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

194
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,172
I'm gonna protect you.

195
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,995
Mum, it's 9:00.

196
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,193
He's not running a fever
anymore.

197
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:54,573
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

198
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,431
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

199
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:59,661
Sorry. What was that?

200
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:03,206
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

201
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,084
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

202
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,485
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

203
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:14,741
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

204
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,103
88. Number 88.

205
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,022
Two fat ladies.

206
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:28,648
Good, Elaine!

207
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,299
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

208
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,114
Number 11.

209
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,866
Who has number 11?

210
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,951
Legs 11.

211
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:42,810
Hey? See what else we've got.

212
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,125
5 billion.

213
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:49,567
Anyone got 5 billion?

214
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:03,414
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

215
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:09,105
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

216
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,858
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

217
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:15,093
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

218
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,575
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

219
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,995
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

220
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,853
Why don't you go home?

221
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:30,418
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

222
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,336
I can cover for you.

223
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,987
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

224
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,676
I'll give you my pay.

225
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,594
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,888
You've got a sick boy.

227
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,765
Life's too short.

228
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,666
You're so sweet, Robbie.

229
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:50,188
- You should go.
- Yeah.

230
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:53,423
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

231
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:47,579
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

232
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:48,830
Rung you a million times.

233
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:49,873
What happened?

234
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,958
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

235
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:55,128
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

236
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:57,380
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

237
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:58,423
I'm so sorry.

238
00:20:58,447 --> 00:20:59,883
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

239
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,801
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

240
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,261
It's not rubbish. It's real!

241
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,411
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

242
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,809
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

243
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,728
You got them for me
on the internet.

244
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,253
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

245
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,360
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

246
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:21,988
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

247
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,823
Well, I'm not scared.

248
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,952
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

249
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,620
That's enough.

250
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:31,206
You will be
when it eats your insides.

251
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,040
I've decided

252
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:33,917
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

253
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:35,650
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

254
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:41,864
Samuel.

255
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:55,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

256
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,024
life is not always as it seems.

257
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:01,277
It can be a wondrous thing.

258
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:05,721
But it can also be
very treacherous.

259
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:17,085
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

260
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,111
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

261
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:26,219
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

262
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,327
Samuel.

263
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,524
I was just
putting something back.

264
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:40,942
All your father's things
are down there.

265
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:41,985
He's my father.

266
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:44,135
You don't own him!

267
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,097
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

268
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,894
Can I come in?

269
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:57,333
Hey, matey. This is for you.

270
00:22:57,357 --> 00:23:00,128
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

271
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:01,652
I'm not sick.

272
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh. I-I thought... No,
he's not, actually.

273
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:10,346
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

274
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,389
You said that's not true.

275
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,932
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

276
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,100
who still believe in monsters?

277
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,268
I hate you!

278
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,811
She won't let me have
a birthday party

279
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,879
and she won't let me have a dad!

280
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:34,745
Don't eat it.

281
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,677
The Babadook did it, Mum.

282
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,907
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

283
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,450
The Babadook did it!

284
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:56,244
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

285
00:24:56,268 --> 00:25:00,999
Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

286
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:06,462
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

287
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:09,549
Life is not always as it seems.

288
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:13,678
It can be a wondrous thing.

289
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:17,724
But it can also be
very treacherous.

290
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,059
In this DVD,

291
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:24,689
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

292
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:30,343
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

293
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:55,493
Do you think this is funny?

294
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,789
Oh, no. No. No!

295
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,501
Give it to me!

296
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:07,713
Do you wanna die?

297
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,765
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

298
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,477
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

299
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,294
Don't let it in!

300
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:42,576
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

301
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,483
I've already got this doll, Mum.

302
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:56,818
Now she's got a twin.

303
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,093
They can go shopping together.

304
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,284
Off you go.

305
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,685
He's just really tired.

306
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:15,025
Go and play right now.

307
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:24,178
Claire tells me you're a writer.

308
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:26,889
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

309
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:29,392
What kind of writing did you do?

310
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:33,354
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

311
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:35,773
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

312
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:37,233
It must be difficult.

313
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:40,695
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

314
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:43,448
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

315
00:29:43,472 --> 00:29:46,140
and they find it very hard.

316
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,662
How's Richard's merger going?

317
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:53,916
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

318
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,711
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

319
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:57,879
Tell me about it!

320
00:29:57,903 --> 00:30:00,214
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

321
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:01,841
That's a real tragedy.

322
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:05,178
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

323
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:07,263
You must have so much
to talk about

324
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:08,954
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

325
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:24,071
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

326
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:25,554
I'm not hurting anybody.

327
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,934
Bye.

328
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:33,938
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

329
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,839
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

330
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,883
She never comes to our house.

331
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:46,385
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

332
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,262
'cause it's too depressing.

333
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:51,265
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

334
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:53,809
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

335
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:57,021
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

336
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,440
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

337
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:02,026
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

338
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,486
Isn't it time you moved on?

339
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,029
I have moved on.

340
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,491
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

341
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:10,618
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

342
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:13,412
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

343
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,456
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

344
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,124
I do have a dad!

345
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:20,002
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

346
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:23,089
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

347
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,340
I do!

348
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,050
I want to know how you are.

349
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,760
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

350
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:29,971
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

351
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:32,598
I can't believe
you just said that.

352
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:35,142
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

353
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,645
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

354
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,146
That's not true!

355
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,356
And your mum doesn't want you.

356
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,715
No-one wants you.

357
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,996
What did you do?!

358
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,688
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

359
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,918
Is she alright?

360
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:03,546
Stay here
and look after the children

361
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,631
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

362
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:10,720
Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!

363
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:13,222
Mummy! Mummy!

364
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:15,141
Mummy!

365
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:19,168
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

366
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:23,047
There is no Babadook!

367
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,051
Get out!

368
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:32,366
- Get out!
- Samuel?

369
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,619
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

370
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:37,519
Get out! Get out! Get out!

371
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:57,933
Please help me!

372
00:32:57,957 --> 00:33:00,125
There's something wrong
with my son.

373
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:15,201
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

374
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:17,078
That's when the brain overheats.

375
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:18,412
It always looks worse
than it is.

376
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:20,289
I've never seen
anything like this.

377
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:22,375
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

378
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,168
All his other results
are normal.

379
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:28,339
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

380
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:30,091
Very committed to
the monster theory.

381
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:31,490
That's an understatement.

382
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:35,221
All children see monsters.

383
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:36,995
Not like this.

384
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:40,393
And it's getting worse.

385
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,104
He's becoming aggressive.

386
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:44,689
He could see a psychiatrist.

387
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,315
I can refer you.

388
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:47,900
Takes a few weeks to get in.

389
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,133
That'd be great.

390
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:54,365
But can you just give me
something for now,

391
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:56,849
just to make him sleep?

392
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,601
Um, just until...

393
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:03,063
just until
we get an appointment.

394
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,419
Please?

395
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:11,215
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

396
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,633
and when we go home tonight,

397
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:14,635
this whole nightmare
will start up again

398
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,787
and I am really... I'm
really not coping.

399
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,646
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

400
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,065
Just until the tests come back.

401
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:32,945
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

402
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,970
It's really bad.

403
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:46,751
These can make children
feel foggy.

404
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,003
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

405
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:52,214
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

406
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:55,824
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

407
00:34:57,952 --> 00:35:00,306
Why don't people like me?

408
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,391
Why do you say that?

409
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:06,335
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

410
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:11,548
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

411
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:19,200
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

412
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:20,599
and not worry.

413
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,871
I don't want you to die.

414
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,999
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

415
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:31,276
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

416
00:35:35,406 --> 00:35:39,011
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

417
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:41,347
I've got the day off tomorrow.

418
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,390
Maybe we could do something,

419
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:46,769
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

420
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:48,479
I think so

421
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,356
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

422
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,401
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

423
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,237
Then I won't mention it.

424
00:35:56,261 --> 00:36:00,574
I promise to protect you.

425
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,307
Come on.

426
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,736
Come on.

427
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,722
Can you stay here with me?

428
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,641
Yes.

429
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:27,977
I love you, Mum.

430
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:29,793
Me too.

431
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:34,496
Her nose
is broken in two places.

432
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,330
She may need surgery.

433
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:36,707
I'll pay for everything.

434
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:38,459
You can't even pay
your own bills.

435
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:39,835
Look, I really have to go.

436
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:43,630
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

437
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:45,007
What?

438
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:47,051
A book turned up at our place.

439
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:50,679
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

440
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,473
and put it on our doorstep.

441
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:55,893
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

442
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,854
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

443
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:01,106
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

444
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,965
I have to go.

445
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,402
Claire!

446
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,656
Hello?

447
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:37,325
Mmm, Babadook... dook... dook.

448
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,236
Hi.

449
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,198
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

450
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:52,533
Can you tell us what happened?

451
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:55,517
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

452
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,581
And?

453
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:02,751
And it contained violent
and graphic images

454
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:04,795
of my child and me
being murdered.

455
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,797
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

456
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,049
I burnt it.

457
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:11,760
You burnt it?

458
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:12,886
Yes.

459
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,412
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

460
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:21,061
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

461
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:22,354
What's he been saying?

462
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:26,024
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

463
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,860
How do you know
it's the same person?

464
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:30,320
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

465
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,072
The book you burnt?

466
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,264
Yes.

467
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:51,740
OK.

468
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:55,327
Don't worry about it.

469
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:07,107
Did you get your things done?

470
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:09,276
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

471
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,069
That's why she shakes like this.

472
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,821
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

473
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:14,072
that goes through your head.

474
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,658
Oh, it's alright, love.

475
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:21,663
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

476
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:24,333
He sees things as they are,
that one.

477
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:26,043
Oskar was the same.

478
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,753
He always spoke his mind.

479
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:30,654
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

480
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,138
Hey, Bugsy.

481
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:41,183
Hey.

482
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:43,583
Hey!

483
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,433
Eugh!

484
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,651
Don't come in here.

485
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:06,476
I don't want to buy anything.

486
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,562
Are you Amelia Vanick?

487
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:09,604
Yes.

488
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:12,190
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

489
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:13,984
from the Department of
Community Services.

490
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:16,028
My son's only been
away for two days.

491
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:19,573
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

492
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:21,783
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

493
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,976
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

494
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:28,457
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

495
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:30,042
at the moment.

496
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:34,027
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

497
00:44:36,655 --> 00:44:39,009
Hello, Samuel.

498
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:43,036
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

499
00:44:44,538 --> 00:44:46,058
How are you?

500
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:49,770
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

501
00:44:49,794 --> 00:44:53,857
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

502
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:55,734
He had a fit yesterday.

503
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:59,154
I'm really tired, actually.

504
00:44:59,178 --> 00:45:00,887
That's no good.

505
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,911
May I have a glass of water,
please?

506
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:10,271
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

507
00:45:17,154 --> 00:45:19,132
It's a real mess.

508
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:21,551
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

509
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:23,095
I normally have
the house sprayed.

510
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,971
I did actually already
have it sprayed

511
00:45:24,995 --> 00:45:27,808
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

512
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:29,499
and that's why I...

513
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:36,983
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

514
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,486
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

515
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,780
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

516
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,972
We've caught you at a bad time.

517
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:46,952
I'll leave you with this.

518
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:49,579
We're required
to come back in a week

519
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:51,373
to talk through your options.

520
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:53,606
Here's my card.

521
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:59,571
Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.

522
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,611
What was that noise I heard?

523
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:24,489
I didn't hear any noise.

524
00:46:24,513 --> 00:46:26,783
Wind howling, doors slamming.

525
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:29,767
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

526
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:34,040
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

527
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:36,042
Are you sick?

528
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:37,358
Oh, no, Granny.

529
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:41,047
It's only 6:00.

530
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,800
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

531
00:46:43,824 --> 00:46:45,260
No.

532
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:48,328
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

533
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,501
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

534
00:47:10,392 --> 00:47:12,454
Where's its mother, Skip?

535
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:14,039
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

536
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:16,082
Are you off now, Dad?

537
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:17,792
Yep. Soon as I fuel up.

538
00:47:17,816 --> 00:47:19,753
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

539
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:22,112
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

540
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,800
"And the Prince and the Princess"

541
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:28,762
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace"

542
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:31,287
"for the rest of their days."

543
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:21,731
Babadook... dook... dook.

544
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,662
What are we doing?

545
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:00,497
We're going downstairs.

546
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:02,897
- Why?
- Because we are.

547
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:24,646
Iris, Iris, Iris.

548
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,504
No.

549
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:17,907
Glass and mirror attachment.

550
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:19,909
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

551
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,453
for a streak-free shine.

552
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:22,829
As part of
your steaming special,

553
00:51:22,853 --> 00:51:24,664
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

554
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:28,191
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

555
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:32,964
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

556
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:34,322
That's just what I need.

557
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:37,594
I can't help it if I'm sick.

558
00:51:37,618 --> 00:51:39,035
What do you expect me to do?

559
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:41,829
You do that!

560
00:51:56,303 --> 00:52:01,057
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

561
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:05,519
I need to eat something.

562
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,361
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

563
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:18,426
You said to have them with food.

564
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:22,388
I'm really hungry, Mum.

565
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:26,518
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

566
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,478
Don't you ever stop?

567
00:52:28,502 --> 00:52:32,106
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

568
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,610
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

569
00:52:35,634 --> 00:52:39,887
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

570
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:15,066
I'm so sorry.

571
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,259
I don't know why I said that.
It was terrible.

572
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:23,116
I've had absolutely no sleep.

573
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,516
I didn't know what I was saying.

574
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:29,270
I'll cook you something. Hey?

575
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:31,916
What would you like?

576
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,899
I'm not hungry anymore.

577
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:42,844
We really need to get
out of this house.

578
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:45,328
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

579
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,043
Do you want to go to Wally's?

580
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,690
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

581
00:53:55,714 --> 00:53:59,425
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

582
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:04,949
Give it back!

583
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:09,037
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

584
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,997
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

585
00:54:11,021 --> 00:54:12,438
Sit down, please.

586
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:19,881
Where are we going?

587
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:22,990
I just want to drive
for a little while.

588
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:37,023
Aarggh!

589
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:39,048
Mummy! Mummy!

590
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:43,636
Babadook.

591
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,959
You ran straight into me!

592
00:54:55,983 --> 00:55:00,361
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

593
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:04,217
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

594
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,177
You could've killed someone!

595
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:08,930
Hey!

596
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:09,973
Hey, what are you doing?

597
00:55:09,997 --> 00:55:11,956
Hey! Crazy bitch!

598
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:21,132
Hi, sweetheart.

599
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:30,850
Mum?

600
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,770
I can call Aunty Claire.

601
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:40,734
I can call
and she can come over.

602
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:45,591
Mum?

603
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:50,202
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

604
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,957
Mum. Mum, look at me.

605
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:23,819
It's nice and warm in here.

606
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:29,575
I don't want you to go away.

607
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:33,954
I'm not going anywhere.

608
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:47,760
Mum?

609
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:59,647
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

610
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,127
I can call Mrs Roach.

611
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:06,987
I don't want you to call anyone.

612
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:12,451
I just need to sleep.

613
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:18,749
- Mum...
- Leave it!

614
00:57:50,115 --> 00:57:52,157
There's something in the house.

615
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,716
There's someone in the house!

616
00:59:04,064 --> 00:59:05,750
Mrs Roach...

617
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:07,858
can we come and stay the night?

618
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:19,263
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

619
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:21,682
Has someone
broken into the house?

620
00:59:21,706 --> 00:59:24,769
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

621
00:59:24,793 --> 00:59:26,687
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

622
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:28,981
Oh, I was so worried.

623
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,524
I told him not to call anyone.

624
00:59:30,548 --> 00:59:32,443
He asked
if you could stay the night.

625
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:35,279
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

626
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:37,304
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

627
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:40,409
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

628
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:41,994
Yes. Talk soon.

629
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:43,560
No worries. Talk soon.

630
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:48,668
I told you not to call anyone

631
00:59:48,692 --> 00:59:50,651
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

632
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,006
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

633
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,217
An old lady who can hardly walk?

634
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:57,783
Do you want to make her sick?

635
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:01,829
Get that bloody thing off!

636
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:11,065
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

637
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:12,589
in front of our neighbours?

638
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:18,887
Is this what I have to do?

639
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:31,669
I'm sorry, Mummy.

640
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:33,921
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

641
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,923
What'd you say?

642
01:00:35,947 --> 01:00:37,591
I said the Babadook...

643
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:39,218
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

644
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:43,055
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

645
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,599
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

646
01:00:45,623 --> 01:00:49,312
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

647
01:00:49,336 --> 01:00:50,896
Alright, Samuel?

648
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,441
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

649
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:55,007
Nothing!

650
01:01:32,212 --> 01:01:34,648
I feel sick.

651
01:01:34,672 --> 01:01:39,028
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

652
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:40,654
Mum, I don't think I need...

653
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:43,722
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

654
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:09,414
Good boy.

655
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:33,438
Mum!

656
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:54,167
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

657
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:58,714
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

658
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:01,258
Hey.

659
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:03,969
Hey!

660
01:03:24,908 --> 01:03:26,617
Here we go.

661
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,666
There's more
where that came from.

662
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,245
Aarggh!

663
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:54,519
What's the secret?

664
01:03:57,106 --> 01:03:58,792
Letter of Max's, didn't you?

665
01:03:58,816 --> 01:04:00,336
No, not for a minute.

666
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,213
Don't lie.
You called me a Jezebel. Why?

667
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:04,423
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

668
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:05,906
With fresh meat.

669
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:11,138
Only five...

670
01:04:11,162 --> 01:04:13,580
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

671
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,853
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

672
01:04:17,877 --> 01:04:19,438
to stab her son.

673
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:21,607
His body was found
in their basement.

674
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:24,360
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

675
01:04:24,384 --> 01:04:28,614
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

676
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:30,574
Little is known about the tragedy

677
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:34,537
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

678
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:36,979
He had just turned seven.

679
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:52,953
Samuel?

680
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,792
Wake up, Mummy.

681
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:05,007
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

682
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,305
Don't go down there.

683
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,729
It's not safe.

684
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,769
Ohh... I thought you were dead.

685
01:05:59,896 --> 01:06:02,439
I thought you were dead.

686
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:18,955
We're gonna be together.

687
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:23,960
You just need to bring me
the boy.

688
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:48,837
You mean Samuel?

689
01:06:48,861 --> 01:06:51,154
You can bring me the boy.

690
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:55,408
You can bring me the boy.

691
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:59,056
You can bring me the boy.

692
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,474
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

693
01:07:00,498 --> 01:07:02,685
I think it's going to rain.

694
01:07:02,709 --> 01:07:04,126
No.

695
01:08:36,052 --> 01:08:39,179
It isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

696
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,568
Oh, no.

697
01:08:59,075 --> 01:09:00,909
No! No!

698
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,460
Bugsy!

699
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,990
Samuel!

700
01:11:09,372 --> 01:11:10,914
Samuel.

701
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:16,920
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

702
01:11:19,507 --> 01:11:21,966
You don't want him to die,
do you?

703
01:11:25,972 --> 01:11:27,741
Samuel.

704
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:30,809
Are you listening to me?

705
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:37,167
Let me in, you little shit!

706
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:39,628
Let me in!

707
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:40,921
Let me in!

708
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:42,464
Let me in!

709
01:11:42,488 --> 01:11:45,448
Let me in!

710
01:12:07,763 --> 01:12:09,992
You little pig!

711
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:13,829
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

712
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:15,998
You don't know how many times

713
01:12:16,022 --> 01:12:19,918
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

714
01:12:19,942 --> 01:12:21,670
I just want you to be happy.

715
01:12:21,694 --> 01:12:24,821
"I just want you to be happy."

716
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,678
Sometimes...

717
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:33,515
I just wanna smash
your head against a brick wall

718
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:36,768
until your fucking brains
pop out.

719
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:38,854
You're not my mother.

720
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:40,439
What did you say?

721
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:43,066
I said you're not my mother!

722
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,634
I am your mother!

723
01:12:48,512 --> 01:12:52,265
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

724
01:12:55,644 --> 01:12:56,997
Get away!

725
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:58,938
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

726
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:50,926
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

727
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,095
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

728
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:56,098
I'm OK.

729
01:13:56,122 --> 01:14:02,020
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

730
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:06,316
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

731
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,443
But I just wanted you to know

732
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:11,530
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

733
01:14:11,554 --> 01:14:13,596
I love you both.

734
01:14:16,892 --> 01:14:18,643
Samuel.

735
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:23,189
I'm sorry.

736
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,004
I understand you're scared.

737
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:32,008
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

738
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:35,118
I haven't been good at all.

739
01:14:37,913 --> 01:14:41,416
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

740
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:48,423
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

741
01:14:51,302 --> 01:14:53,780
We're going to
stay there tonight.

742
01:14:53,804 --> 01:14:56,723
Do you want that?

743
01:15:01,187 --> 01:15:04,272
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

744
01:15:15,409 --> 01:15:17,452
I want you to meet your dad.

745
01:15:19,246 --> 01:15:21,789
It's beautiful there.

746
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:26,002
You'll be happy.

747
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:34,302
Sorry, Mummy!

748
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:24,871
Mum!

749
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:27,540
Mum!

750
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:29,774
I'm not leaving you.

751
01:16:32,695 --> 01:16:35,613
Mum? Mum?

752
01:16:42,538 --> 01:16:45,498
You said
we'd protect each other.

753
01:16:51,297 --> 01:16:53,631
I know you don't love me.

754
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,279
The Babadook won't let you.

755
01:16:57,303 --> 01:16:59,637
But I love you, Mum.

756
01:17:01,056 --> 01:17:03,433
And I always will.

757
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:17,113
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

758
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:24,014
I don't want you to go away.

759
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:25,598
No! No! No!

760
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:27,790
Mummy!

761
01:18:17,883 --> 01:18:19,361
Mummy!

762
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:21,446
Mummy!

763
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,406
Mummy!

764
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,867
Mummy! Mummy!

765
01:18:25,891 --> 01:18:28,036
Mummy!

766
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,644
Mummy!

767
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:08,910
What is it?

768
01:19:08,934 --> 01:19:10,768
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

769
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,508
What do you want?

770
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:47,847
What do you want?

771
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:27,447
No.

772
01:20:27,471 --> 01:20:30,473
Keep breathing.

773
01:20:33,727 --> 01:20:36,896
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

774
01:20:41,276 --> 01:20:43,319
No.

775
01:20:48,116 --> 01:20:49,511
I think it's gonna rain.

776
01:20:49,535 --> 01:20:51,535
Stop!

777
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,003
You are nothing.

778
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:55,725
You're nothing!

779
01:22:05,152 --> 01:22:07,695
This is my house!

780
01:22:11,742 --> 01:22:15,202
You are trespassing in my house!

781
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:29,675
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

782
01:22:38,435 --> 01:22:40,603
No!

783
01:23:24,398 --> 01:23:25,606
Mummy, don't!

784
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,864
Don't!

785
01:25:19,971 --> 01:25:22,533
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

786
01:25:22,557 --> 01:25:24,535
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

787
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:26,370
What time's the party?

788
01:25:26,394 --> 01:25:27,705
Any time after three is fine.

789
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:29,624
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

790
01:25:29,648 --> 01:25:31,209
Bye.

791
01:25:31,233 --> 01:25:33,002
Bye, Sam.

792
01:25:33,026 --> 01:25:35,379
That school's a good choice.

793
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:37,548
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

794
01:25:37,572 --> 01:25:39,258
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

795
01:25:39,282 --> 01:25:40,968
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

796
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,012
It's time to get back.

797
01:25:43,036 --> 01:25:46,455
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

798
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,602
Are you having a party?

799
01:25:49,626 --> 01:25:51,354
It's Sam's birthday today.

800
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:54,690
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

801
01:25:54,714 --> 01:25:56,192
That's not true.

802
01:25:56,216 --> 01:25:58,820
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

803
01:25:58,844 --> 01:26:01,136
That's unusual.

804
01:26:03,557 --> 01:26:06,953
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

805
01:26:06,977 --> 01:26:10,229
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

806
01:26:12,357 --> 01:26:14,418
Sam's just like his dad was.

807
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,546
Always speaks his mind.

808
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:20,883
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

809
01:26:20,907 --> 01:26:25,703
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

810
01:26:28,081 --> 01:26:30,082
I'll take that for you.

811
01:26:49,603 --> 01:26:50,955
Good shot.

812
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:53,249
Look, there's another one!

813
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:55,357
Where's your bowl?

814
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,530
Wow. You've got a lot today.

815
01:27:03,116 --> 01:27:05,177
Am I ever gonna see it?

816
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:08,620
One day, when you're bigger.

817
01:27:14,336 --> 01:27:18,464
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

818
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:05,279
It's alright.

819
01:28:05,303 --> 01:28:06,989
It's alright.

820
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,056
It's alright.

821
01:28:43,508 --> 01:28:45,194
How was it?

822
01:28:45,218 --> 01:28:47,719
It was pretty quiet today.

823
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:51,348
Come here.

824
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,938
It's getting much better, Mum.

825
01:29:01,818 --> 01:29:03,170
Wait!

826
01:29:03,194 --> 01:29:05,320
I have a new trick.

827
01:29:08,783 --> 01:29:11,762
Life is not always as it seems.

828
01:29:11,786 --> 01:29:14,746
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

829
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:22,796
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

830
01:29:32,307 --> 01:29:35,517
Abracadabra!

831
01:29:38,021 --> 01:29:39,813
How did you do that?

832
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:46,881
Come here, you.

833
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:48,113
Come here.

834
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:01,168
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
