831
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,664
I thought you were
a military man.

832
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,999

00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,471
Can I get my arm?

839
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,233
And these are the hands

841
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,197
For the record,
this was not my idea.

842
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,782
