1
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:46,923
On your feet!

2
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,237
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,531
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,205
You were alone?

5
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,752
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,336
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,381
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,718
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,178
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,015
To the victor
belongs the spoils.

11
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,434
To the victor?

12
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:41,895
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,730
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,649
You lost.

15
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,030
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,574
What? What? Hey!

17
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:55,825
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

18
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,285
A moment. Please!

19
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,579
Stop!
I must speak to the commander.

20
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,748
Colonel. I found it!

21
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,210
Do as he says. Open it.

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,591
Doctor.

23
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,601
The Lance of Longinus.

24
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,438
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

25
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,315
The Holy Lance.

26
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,036
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

27
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,079
Colonel, we need to talk.

28
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,413
No time, Doctor.

29
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,040
The train to Berlin is waiting.

30
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,292
Search the woods!

31
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,377
Take the dogs.

32
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,921
Do you think that spy was alone?

33
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,048
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,091
On the double!

35
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,159
Looks like they're leaving

36
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,536
without you guys.

37
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,956
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,083
Story...

39
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,794
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,713
Well...

41
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,256
It all started

42
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:38,011
once upon a time,
when this village

43
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:42,724
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together

44
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,893
and follow this sweaty
little pied piper

45
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,728
named Adolf...

46
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,996
This man was with the American.

47
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,832
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:33,668
What have I done?

49
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,590
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,268
Careful. This is the Führer's
special relic!

51
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,537
Heil Hitler!

52
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,132
Stay seated.

53
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,342
So...

54
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,139
You are a birdwatcher?

55
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,686
Yes. Because of the bombing,

56
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,606
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

57
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,278
We caught your accomplice.

58
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,989
The American.

59
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,181
Oh, my!

60
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,000
Get off of me!

61
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,487
There's one reason

62
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,072
you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

63
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,160
Who sent you?

64
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,494
What was your mission?

65
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,663
Please, Colonel, no.
I beg you.

66
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,124
My name is Basil Shaw.

67
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,336
I'm a professor at Oxford.

68
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,837
An archeologist.

69
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,429
There you are.

70
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,560
There is a problem.

71
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,021
I must speak to the Colonel.

72
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,522
It's urgent.

73
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,569
I have a daughter. I beg you.

74
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,948
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

75
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,246
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

76
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,798
Sieg heil!

77
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,020
We were told
that the Lance of Longinus

78
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,939
could be found
at the fortress.

79
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,275
We were looking for it.

80
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,776
Why?

81
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,362
Because of its power?

82
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,199
It has no power.

83
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,496
My friend and I
were trying to save history.

84
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,583
I must speak with the Colonel.

85
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,919
It's about the Lance.

86
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,051
I only had a moment to look at it.

87
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,969
Of course,
my training is in physics...

88
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,430
For God's sake, spit it out!

89
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,224
The Lance...

90
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,645
It's a fake.

91
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,064
It's a fake.

92
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,648
A fake?

93
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,444
The blade is an alloy.

94
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,945
Fifty years old,

95
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,281
the engravings recent,
it's a replica.

96
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,491
We're dead.

97
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,244
Twelfth century.

98
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,537
Thirteenth century.

99
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,831
Ramesses II.

100
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,959
None of this stuff is fake.

101
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,381
I gotta stop this train.

102
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,049
There is another relic on this train.

103
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,635
One with real power.

104
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,220
What are you talking about?

105
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,181
The Antikythera.

106
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,557
The Antikythera?!

107
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,810
Enough about that old dial!

108
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,229
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

109
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,022
and his mind!

110
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,567
Let me explain.

111
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,030
The Antikythera's power
is not supernatural.

112
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,366
It is mathematics.

113
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,577
Whoever harnesses it...

114
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,164
will not be King...

115
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,916
nor Emperor...

116
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,502
or Führer.

117
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,799
He will be God.

118
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,861
Too many Nazis.

119
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,325
And how do you propose
we tell him this?

120
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:04,702
My Führer,

121
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,413
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

122
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,831
But here is...

123
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,002
half of something you've never heard of.

124
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,504
Tell me,

125
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,465
have you ever met Hitler?!

126
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,135
A saboteur aboard.

127
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,636
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

128
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:03,928
Sieg heil!

129
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,221
That way!

130
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,184
What are you doing here?!

131
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,817
What the hell?

132
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,111
Indy?

133
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,196
Baz?

134
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,531
You're alive!

135
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,241
So far.

136
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,327
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

137
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,454
What sort of a man
hides in a hedge

138
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,540
while his friend
is facing death?

139
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,515
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

140
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,726
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

141
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,812
Did you at least
find the Lance?

142
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,021
At least?

143
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:57,481
Well, have you got it?

144
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,400
- It's a fake.
- What?

145
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,402
A reproduction.

146
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:04,905
Who are you?

147
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,619
Indy?

148
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,838
The Antikythera.

149
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,674
Archimedes' Dial.

150
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,218
Bring it.

151
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,070
Hurry up, Baz.

152
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,366
Give me that.

153
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,659
Come on.

154
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,884
Get up, Baz.

155
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,260
Follow me.

156
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,220
Towards the gun?

157
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,680
Away from the Nazis!

158
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,058
Those are Nazis!

159
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,602
Get down! Down! Down!

160
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,027
This way. Come on!

161
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,612
I can't do that!

162
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,698
You wanna stop
for a little lie-down?

163
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,869
They have the Antikythera!

164
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,288
Easy.

165
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,195
Tunnel!

166
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,541
Got you! No!

167
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,208
Indy!

168
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,467
Get the gun!

169
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,061
Shoot him!

170
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,065
Not me!

171
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,192
Sorry.

172
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,505
To the victor go the spoils.

173
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,204
Drop the gun.

174
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,500
Give me the Antikythera.

175
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,971
Indy!

176
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,774
Hey!

177
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,196
- Here!
- They can't hear you, Baz.

178
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,115
We gotta jump!

179
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,617
What about my dicky knee?

180
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,583
Baz!

181
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,501
Baz!

182
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,379
Baz!

183
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,382
- Indy!
- Baz!

184
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,306
Go! Move! Move it!

185
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,810
Bit rum to go home
empty-handed after all that.

186
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,604
Empty-handed?

187
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,897
Not exactly.

188
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,026
Archimedes' Dial.

189
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,235
Well, half of it.

190
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,613
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

191
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,285
<i>Roll up, roll up
for the Magical Mystery Tour</i>

192
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,204
<i>Step right this way</i>

193
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,082
<i>Roll up</i>

194
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,960
<i>Roll up for the Mystery Tour</i>

195
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,754
<i>Roll up</i>

196
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,590
<i>Roll up for the Mystery Tour</i>

197
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,468
<i>- Roll up
- That's an invitation</i>

198
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,886
<i>Roll up for the...</i>

199
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,597
Larry! Turn it down!

200
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,891
Turn it down!

201
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,893
Hey, Larry!

202
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:37,107
<i>The Magical Mystery Tour
is waiting to take you away</i>

203
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,360
<i>Waiting to take you away</i>

204
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:46,533
<i>Roll up, roll up
for the Mystery Tour</i>

205
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,617
Larry!

206
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,120
Larry!

207
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,747
- Hi, Mr. Jones.
- Where's Larry?

208
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,083
- Who is this guy?
- It's the old guy next door.

209
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,877
Larry, it's 8:00 in the morning.

210
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,421
- It's 8:00 in the morning.
- We talked about this, Larry.

211
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,630
Yeah, but that was

212
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,175
- a workday, Mr. Jones.
- This is a workday too, Larry!

213
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,719
Turn on the news.

214
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,929
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

215
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,598
Moon day?

216
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:27,866
<i>And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear</i>

217
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:35,415
<i>Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare</i>

218
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:42,005
<i>This is Major Tom
to Ground Control</i>

219
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,967
<i>I'm stepping through the door</i>

220
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:53,225
<i>And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way</i>

221
00:23:54,601 --> 00:24:00,649
<i>And the stars look
very different today</i>

222
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,069
Thanks.

223
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,251
All you really
need to remember

224
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,004
is that Assyrian ceramics
of this period are characterized

225
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:27,134
by this complex
blue-line pattern.

226
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,301
Okay?

227
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,764
I assigned pages 131
through 171

228
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,558
in Winford for today.

229
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,226
Anybody do the reading?

230
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,521
Anyone?

231
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,359
This is on the test.

232
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:45,735
Okay.

233
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,947
Guess I'll spoon-feed it
to you.

234
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,452
In 213 BC,

235
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,621
Roman forces led by Marcellus

236
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,624
laid siege
to the city of Syracuse.

237
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,459
Syracuse.

238
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,505
Not the Syracuse
in New York, Tonya.

239
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,257
The one in Sicily.

240
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,427
Amongst the defenders
of the city

241
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,680
was its most famous resident,
who was...

242
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,601
Come on, guys.
This is on the final.

243
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,895
Archimedes.

244
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,813
Archimedes.

245
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,315
Archimedes, who was a...

246
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,608
A mathematician.

247
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,942
A mathematician.

248
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,695
But more than that,
an inventor,

249
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,364
a brilliant engineer

250
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,949
who conceived of a way

251
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,827
to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun

252
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,747
on concave mirrors
and focus it

253
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,583
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

254
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,212
Who devised giant iron claws

255
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,964
that could snatch hostiles
from the sea.

256
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,428
But how do we know
it really happened?

257
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:58,558
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence

258
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,062
- is there of these inventions?
- The Antikythera.

259
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,607
- The Antikythera.
- For starters.

260
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,776
They're here!
They're downtown!

261
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,071
The astronauts.

262
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,657
Giant parade
this morning will be seen

263
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,450
by about
two and a half million people

264
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,868
lining the sidewalks...

265
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,331
He's coming.
He's come. See?

266
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,916
Oh, here he comes.

267
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,876
Hide the cake.

268
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,672
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

269
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,971
For over a decade now,
our colleague Dr. Jones

270
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,640
has been a loyal servant
of Hunter.

271
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,643
A token of our gratitude.

272
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,199
Thanks for putting up with me.

273
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,715
Here.

274
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,392
Astronauts Neil Armstrong,
Mike Collins,

275
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,353
and Buzz Aldrin will not be
able to avoid the spotlight.

276
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,439
At 11:00 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time,

277
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,232
a grateful nation
will pay homage

278
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,027
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago,

279
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,695
climaxed by a dinner
in Los Angeles...

280
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,196
What would the ancients say?

281
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,449
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

282
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,368
If they knew
we walked on the moon?

283
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,078
Speaking as an ancient,

284
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,706
going to the moon
is like going to Reno.

285
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,166
Middle of nowhere

286
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,835
and no blackjack.

287
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,504
You don't recognize me,
do you?

288
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,884
Whatever I did, I apologize.

289
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:57,886
It's Helena.

290
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,513
Helena Shaw.

291
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,641
Wombat?

292
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,352
I haven't heard that
in a while.

293
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,645
- You got tall.
- I did.

294
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,105
It's fair to say.

295
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,317
I'm celebrating.

296
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,653
I'm retiring.

297
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,655
Well, in that case,
what are we drinking?

298
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,829
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

299
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,385
Put that away.

300
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:41,012
I was asking how you broke
your ankle.

301
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,098
- None of your business.
- Are you Mr. Schmidt?

302
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,392
Doctor Schmidt.
He's in there.

303
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,060
And he don't eat anything
on wheels,

304
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,353
so put it on a table.

305
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:51,106
When I was a little boy,

306
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,774
I always imagined

307
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:56,653
that one day
man would walk on the moon.

308
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,321
And by golly...

309
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,663
Quite a celebration
out there, hmm?

310
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,543
The man you're servin',

311
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,003
he's the one who put
those astronauts on the moon.

312
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,213
Built the rockets
they rode in.

313
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,882
Congratulations.

314
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,134
Where are you from?

315
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,136
The Bronx, sir.

316
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,179
No, no. I mean originally,
your people.

317
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,347
Do you know?

318
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,687
I was born
by Yankee Stadium, sir.

319
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,108
And you fought
for your country?

320
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,485
320th Battalion.

321
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,029
Set up balloons to stop
the planes bombing Normandy.

322
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,370
And are you enjoying
your victory?

323
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,254
Will there be
anything else?

324
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,008
You didn't win the war.

325
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,802
Hitler lost it.

326
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,517
Yeah.

327
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,229
My field agent,
she found Shaw.

328
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,440
Yeah, I'm comin'.

329
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,608
Let's go, Hauke.

330
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,196
Where are we here?

331
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,781
Oxford. In the garden.

332
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,368
He was an original.

333
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,206
I just graduated.

334
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,373
In Archeology.

335
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,460
Archeology.

336
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,170
Apple didn't fall far.

337
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,048
Well, now I'm researching
a doctorate.

338
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,258
What's your subject?

339
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,053
The Archimedes Dial.

340
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,138
The Antikythera.

341
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,434
What do you know about that?

342
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,311
Well, for starters,

343
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,856
in 1902, Greek sponge divers
found a wrecked Roman warship,

344
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,399
huge, off the coast of Greece.

345
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,735
Below deck, sealed in wax,

346
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,445
was a clock-like mechanism,

347
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,406
finely tooled,
purpose unknown.

348
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,450
Nothing approximating
its complexity

349
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,536
appears in the world
for 1,000 years.

350
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,830
- You've done your homework.
- Well, not me.

351
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,415
Dad. He had
all these journals,

352
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,000
reams of notes about it.

353
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,002
He was obsessed till the end.

354
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,841
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

355
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,388
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

356
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,350
Well, that was a long time ago.

357
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:33,977
And it was only half the Dial.

358
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,186
- Archimedes...
- Archimedes broke the Dial...

359
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,813
- disassembled it.
- in two, and then hid

360
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,982
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

361
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,358
I know. Look.

362
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,319
You don't remember the last
time I saw you, do you?

363
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,114
Remember what?

364
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:47,198
These are the Alps.

365
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,243
Yeah, I see.

366
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,161
And this is the route
that your train took

367
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,288
from the Nazi stronghold

368
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:54,372
- in '44.
- Right.

369
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,332
It went through
this mountain pass,

370
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,001
and then here.

371
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,003
Here, it's the only river
on the route.

372
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,629
- Right.
- Under a bridge.

373
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,172
It's down there.
It's got to be.

374
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,758
- And nobody knows except us.
- Us?

375
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,552
Well, I mean, you.

376
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,262
And me. So, yeah.

377
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,264
- Us.
- Us.

378
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,767
And what were you
thinking exactly?

379
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,312
Well, that maybe...

380
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,690
we could go there.

381
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:21,899
And?

382
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,151
And find it. And...

383
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,695
And I'd become...

384
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,489
famous.

385
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,950
Oh, well, not famous.
Renowned. Feted.

386
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,328
A feted archeologist.

387
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,204
And you, a final triumph!

388
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,414
Indiana Jones!

389
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,541
Out with a bang!
Back in the saddle!

390
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,004
I'm not selling this, am I?

391
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,716
Wombat...

392
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,678
why are you chasing the thing

393
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,515
that drove your father crazy?

394
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,898
Wouldn't you?

395
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,125
I got it.

396
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,210
Parade's comin' soon.

397
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,253
So, what we got?

398
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,383
She's in there, third floor,
with an old guy.

399
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,676
Who is he, a Russian?

400
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,761
No, a professor.
Dr. Henry Jones.

401
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,846
Klaber!

402
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,432
Klaber, get back here!
You're not an agent!

403
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,892
God damn it! Go.

404
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,645
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

405
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,542
This way.

406
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:41,789
Basil became obsessed
by this German theory.

407
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,709
Conjecture, really.

408
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,880
Archimedes had figured out

409
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,966
that the movements
of the moon and planets

410
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,051
weren't perfect.

411
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,805
There were irregularities
in their rotations.

412
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,267
He thought these
irregularities might

413
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,812
explain fluctuations
in temperature, tides.

414
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,232
Storms, even.

415
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,487
So, he set about building
a device to predict them.

416
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,990
But then, he stumbled upon

417
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,117
a method to predict
even larger

418
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:19,869
disturbances.

419
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,164
Larger disturbances?

420
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,000
Your father
thought this thing could

421
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,961
predict fissures in time.

422
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,480
Hauke, if you don't...

423
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,109
Found 'em.

424
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,743
Hello.

425
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,996
Are you looking for...

426
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,331
Dr. Jones?

427
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,253
Excuse me, can I help you?

428
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:11,838
No, thank you.

429
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,631
Just a routine investigation,
ma'am.

430
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,218
Are you the police?

431
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,719
It'll just be a few moments.

432
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,596
- Professor Plimpton.
- Ma'am.

433
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,681
- Professor Plimpton!
- Ma'am!

434
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,395
Drop your weapon.

435
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,771
What the hell are you doin'?

436
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,233
What the doctor tells me,
Miss Mason.

437
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,317
Mandy?

438
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,991
Yeah, no witnesses.

439
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,455
Jesus. What the hell?

440
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,124
Your father wrote
so many letters

441
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,042
about the Dial,
I stopped reading 'em.

442
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,171
You really don't remember

443
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,882
the last time
I was at your house?

444
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,719
I took that from him then.

445
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,930
I thought he'd stopped
thinking about it.

446
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,015
But your father was convinced

447
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,101
this thing was real
and dangerous.

448
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,228
Do not shoot.

449
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:13,065
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

450
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,358
the Grafikos...

451
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,526
The tablet
containing directions

452
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,694
to the rest of the Dial.

453
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:17,987
And if they found
the Grafikos,

454
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,614
they might acquire
the other half of the Dial

455
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:20,698
and put the two together.

456
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,576
I knew
you wouldn't destroy it.

457
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,040
How did you know
he asked me to destroy it?

458
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,918
- What?
- You do remember that night.

459
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,587
I was 12 years old, Indy.

460
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,088
You knew we didn't drop it
in a river.

461
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,841
- Baz didn't tell you that.
- See, listen.

462
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,176
- I didn't...
- No, he never lied.

463
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:41,969
- No...
- What was all that crap

464
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:43,095
- about the map?
- You...

465
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,305
No, you've had
too many whiskeys.

466
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,182
What are you doing, Wombat?

467
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,600
Stay where you are.

468
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:49,810
Don't move.

469
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,063
- Who are these people?
- We need to get out of here.

470
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,147
Are they with you?

471
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,482
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

472
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,692
Miss Shaw, stop!

473
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:01,364
Helena!

474
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,161
Stop!

475
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,122
Sorry.

476
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,167
- Helena!
- Dr. Jones. It's over.

477
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,543
Who are you people?

478
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,795
What do you want?

479
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,631
Stop!

480
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:21,717
Helena Shaw!

481
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,260
She's on the roof.
Find another way up.

482
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,428
Dr. Jones!

483
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,263
Dr. Jones,
we're not gonna hurt you.

484
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,083
Move.
We gotta follow 'em.

485
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,292
Go. Hurry up.

486
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:23,863
Fan out!

487
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,169
All right, let's go.
Move, move, move! Pack it up!

488
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,253
Come on,
get everything.

489
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,546
Found her!

490
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,285
- Operator.
- I need the police.

491
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,746
Hunter College.
People are dead.

492
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:14,997
- Please...
- Hang up, fella.

493
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:21,962
Stand up.

494
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,511
Okay, okay.

495
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,328
She's gone. You blew it,

496
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,746
you trigger-happy cracker.

497
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,374
- She had it in her hand.
- We got the professor.

498
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,129
Here's the file on Jones.

499
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:04,213
Yes.

500
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,524
Who are you?

501
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,151
That's my question.

502
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,121
You're CIA.

503
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,039
Oh, not me, man.

504
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,167
I don't take government jobs.

505
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,418
Okay.

506
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:45,880
How are you acquainted
with Miss Shaw?

507
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,506
She's my goddaughter.

508
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:49,884
I haven't seen her
in 18 years.

509
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,135
Why did you
meet with her today?

510
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,219
To give her the Dial?

511
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,056
Lady, it's an ancient
hunk of gears.

512
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:58,058
Half a hunk.

513
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,810
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

514
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,064
Where do you think
you're going?

515
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,608
I got a parade going on.

516
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,234
And a demonstration
coming down here.

517
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,444
Hey! Hey, hey!

518
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,154
- Hey...
- Shut up.

519
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,740
I can't go this way.
Gotta go back.

520
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,496
Hell no!
What is wrong with you, man?

521
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,290
Damn it! Let's go on foot.

522
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:22,541
You heard her.

523
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,294
What the hell
were you thinking?

524
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,670
- Walk! Come on.
- What is your problem?

525
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:27,755
You don't look
when you're backin' up?

526
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,381
- Take care of that guy.
- Who's gonna pay for that?

527
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,591
Easy, fella. Easy.

528
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:31,675
Keep movin'.

529
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,510
Can't you see my cab?
It's yellow.

530
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,179
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man.

531
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,263
I don't...

532
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,434
Peace now! Peace now!

533
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:44,688
Stop the war!
Stop the fighting!

534
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,607
- Where are we going, Mason?
- This way.

535
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,236
- Hell no, we won't go.
- Shut up.

536
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,820
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no!

537
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,698
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

538
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:55,783
We won't go!

539
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,327
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

540
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,329
- Hell no...
- Shut up!

541
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:01,497
Hell yeah!

542
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,666
Hell no, we won't go!

543
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,584
Hell no, we won't go!

544
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:09,129
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

545
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:11,465
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

546
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,549
Hell no...

547
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,512
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

548
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,770
Hey!

549
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:27,231
Officer! Help me!

550
00:43:27,982 --> 00:43:29,566
Officer,
there was a shooting...

551
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,485
- All right, all right.
- This morning at Hunter.

552
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,404
People are dead. God damn it.

553
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:35,197
Some rogue maniacs
broke in and...

554
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:36,907
Sir, you need to calm it down.

555
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:38,284
Please listen to me.

556
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,577
There was a shooting
this morning, and the...

557
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:44,164
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

558
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,377
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

559
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,890
- Watch out!
- What's he doin'?

560
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,941
Move, out the way!

561
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:01,533
Watch out!

562
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:04,620
Move! Quickly!

563
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,302
Move! Move!

564
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,231
Go, go, go!

565
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,962
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

566
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,547
- It's a horse.
- Come on.

567
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,884
- Hey, mister.
- Move! Out of the way!

568
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,011
- Hold my horse.
- Move! Move!

569
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:04,096
Transfer is available

570
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,265
for IND Queens Boulevard.

571
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:18,694
Next stop, 59th,
Lexington Avenue.

572
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,865
Subway is faster.

573
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:25,117
People tend
to romanticize science,

574
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,161
when it is, in fact,
quite cold.

575
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,829
So, what's next,
Dr. Schmidt?

576
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,039
Mars?

577
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,250
No, we've conquered space.

578
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,795
I'm moving
to the next frontier.

579
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,674
What's beyond space?

580
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:46,221
You might wanna
get that suit pressed,

581
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:47,306
Dr. Schmidt.

582
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,558
We leave for the airport
in an hour.

583
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,018
He's gonna meet the President.

584
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,686
If the President objects
to a few creases,

585
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:55,105
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

586
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,941
- Can I use that?
- No.

587
00:46:58,317 --> 00:46:59,401
Yes.

588
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,528
Baxter.

589
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,825
It's for you, Doctor.

590
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,706
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

591
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:15,042
I'm expecting
a delivery shortly.

592
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,213
Speak.

593
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:20,797
Your goons made a mess.

594
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,132
Did they?

595
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,718
Miss Shaw met
with a professor. Jones.

596
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,095
She acquired the device
from him.

597
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,097
Then we lost her.

598
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,434
Dr. Jones got away as well.

599
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,019
Is that so?

600
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,521
Most unfortunate.

601
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,356
I gotta clean things
up here, Doctor.

602
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,440
And as a representative

603
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:39,983
of the United States
government,

604
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,777
I urge you to cooperate.

605
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,153
Get on that plane
to Los Angeles,

606
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:45,322
and get your medal
from the President.

607
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:54,039
Hello?

608
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,708
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

609
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,127
To Morocco.

610
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,379
Yes, sir.

611
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,548
The university murders

612
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:04,591
took place at the height
of the parade.

613
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:05,759
Police are searching

614
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:08,095
for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

615
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:11,265
A colleague told ABC that
Jones recently lost his son

616
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,433
and was in the middle
of a divorce.

617
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,855
This guy,
he looks like you.

618
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,192
Nah. No.

619
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,154
- It is you.
- No, no, no. Hey.

620
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:27,864
- Go home, pal. You're drunk.
- This is the guy!

621
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:29,283
- Hey!
- It's the killer!

622
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,370
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

623
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:34,955
Bridge traffic.

624
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,010
Boy, am I glad
to see you, Sallah.

625
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:50,846
I wish I could say the same,
old friend.

626
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,059
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

627
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:02,149
Your goddaughter, Helena,

628
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,985
was arrested in Tangier
last year

629
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,904
for auctioning contraband.

630
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,450
There's more.

631
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:15,912
She was bailed out
by Aziz Rahim.

632
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,583
Aziz Rahim is the son
of Big Rahim,

633
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,419
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

634
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:27,633
Big Rahim
owns the Hotel Atlantique

635
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,385
in Tangier, and this week,

636
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:34,681
the hotel is hosting
its annual auction

637
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,725
of stolen antiquities.

638
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:40,395
All the big players
are already there.

639
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,356
Alia, Jabari.

640
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,775
This is the great man
who brought our family

641
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,693
to America during the war.

642
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,237
Quick, when was
the Suez Crisis?

643
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:51,782
1956.

644
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,617
Very impressive, Jabari.

645
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:56,203
My grandchildren watch
too much TV,

646
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,914
but they know their history.

647
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:03,210
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

648
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,254
I need a ride
to the airport, Sallah.

649
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,841
If you run, the police will
assume that you're guilty.

650
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,885
Without Helena or the Dial,

651
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,887
I'm gonna get framed
for murder.

652
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,682
Have you thought
about calling Marion?

653
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,101
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

654
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,483
Welcome to New York's

655
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,860
John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

656
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:31,988
The upper level is
for Pan American Airlines...

657
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,990
I took something else
from your apartment.

658
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,367
It was under the bed.

659
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,623
Thanks, Sallah.

660
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,669
I also brought my passport.

661
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:48,922
I could help you.

662
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:50,090
In Tangier?

663
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,800
Wherever chance takes us.

664
00:50:52,718 --> 00:50:53,802
Indy, I...

665
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,179
I miss the desert.

666
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,056
I miss the sea.

667
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,393
And I miss waking up
every morning

668
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,978
wondering what
wonderful adventure

669
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:04,688
the new day will bring to us.

670
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,649
This is not
an adventure, Sallah.

671
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,695
Those days have come and gone.

672
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:12,904
Perhaps.

673
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,406
Perhaps not.

674
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:21,288
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

675
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,176
Champagne?

676
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,428
We've got four more hours
to Tangier.

677
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:45,604
Your scotch, sir.

678
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,230
Thanks.

679
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:55,530
Basil. Come on, Baz!

680
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,449
- Open the door!
- No!

681
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,117
- Stay out, Indy!
- Open the door.

682
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,206
The Germans were right, Indy.

683
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,666
- What?
- It's too big. It's too much.

684
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,502
Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!

685
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:09,586
- Give me...
- No.

686
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:10,670
What are you doing?

687
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:11,963
You've listened
to nothing that I said.

688
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:13,840
I don't understand it, Baz!

689
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,134
Well, I was trying to
explain it to you downstairs.

690
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:17,511
You've just
ignored everything.

691
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:18,595
You're terrifying
your daughter.

692
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:22,849
Indy, Archimedes

693
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:25,227
discovered
a temporal meteorology.

694
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:28,063
Archimedes was
a mathematician, Baz,

695
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,439
not a magician.

696
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:32,067
He could predict
fissures in time.

697
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:33,777
Fissures in time?

698
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,197
- Baz, you can't prove that!
- Well, not yet.

699
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:39,241
Proving it
is what makes it science!

700
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,715
Oh, Baz.

701
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:58,969
I never should've
given you the thing.

702
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:01,179
It... It belongs in a museum.

703
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:03,807
Give it to me. Please.

704
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:08,770
If I give you this,

705
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,439
it must be destroyed.

706
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:14,025
I will.

707
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,071
I'll destroy it, Baz.

708
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:21,575
Promise.

709
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:29,207
I'm sorry about this.

710
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:30,584
It's all my fault.

711
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:34,254
- Are you gonna be here?
- Yes, sir.

712
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,423
Okay. I've gotta catch
an airplane.

713
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,384
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

714
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,802
Some things
should stay buried.

715
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:41,887
I know, Baz.

716
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,179
It's vital
that you destroy it.

717
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:44,681
- I will, Baz.
- Do you understand?

718
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,391
- I'll destroy it. Yes.
- Say you will, Indy.

719
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,475
I will... Yes.

720
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:49,185
You promised me.
Remember that.

721
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:50,312
I will... I promise.

722
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,438
There's a reason,

723
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:54,107
a reason that Archimedes
broke it in two.

724
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:55,984
I know, Baz.

725
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:58,278
Indy.

726
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:00,322
Thanks, Wombat.

727
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,449
He's gonna be all right
in a few days.

728
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:05,952
I'll call you
as soon as I land.

729
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,375
Ladies and gentlemen,

730
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:14,920
we are 20 minutes
from landing in Tangier.

731
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,080
- Stop drinking!
- What are you doing?

732
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:51,831
No more champagne!
How many more...

733
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:52,958
I'm staying.

734
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,501
Go home. Go home!

735
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,101
Rahim.

736
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,520
Miss Shaw, she's here.

737
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:18,942
Forged in bronze.

738
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,068
Nearly complete.

739
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,861
It is an astrological clock.

740
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:24,656
Dating third century BC

741
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:28,743
and built
by Archimedes himself.

742
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,205
All right,
let's start at 20,000.

743
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:33,456
20,000, thank you very much.

744
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:34,958
30. 30.

745
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,794
Gauges green, power full,

746
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,296
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

747
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,881
What next?

748
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:43,258
Louis, help him! He's so cute.

749
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,385
- Pull back on the yoke.
- I did, man. I'm airborne.

750
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,469
Yeah, he's airborne.

751
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:47,846
- Can I have a sip?
- Do I pick up the flaps?

752
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,931
Don't touch the flaps
under 400 feet.

753
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:51,766
Decrease your pitch
to get to 120.

754
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:52,934
All right.

755
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,772
- Private auction, old timer.
- I've gotta get in there.

756
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,442
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

757
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,320
And what is the current bid?

758
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,406
- The bid is 50,000.
- Then I bid 55.

759
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,033
Who'll give me 60?

760
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:09,659
- 60.
- 60. 65?

761
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,077
65. 70?

762
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,495
- 75.
- 75. 80?

763
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:13,580
- 80.
- 85.

764
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:14,873
How about 90?

765
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,882
- This auction is private.
- This auction's over.

766
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:25,633
Au contraire,
it's hardly begun.

767
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:27,177
- 100.
- 100,000.

768
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,887
I like the hat, by the way.

769
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,305
Makes you look
at least two years younger.

770
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:31,639
Thanks.

771
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:32,724
- 110, bravo.
- I told you that

772
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,768
- this auction is over.
- Excuse me, who is this man?

773
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,394
- I'm her godfather.
- He's mildly related.

774
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:38,396
And she's up past her bedtime.

775
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:39,773
- Come on, Wombat.
- I wouldn't do that.

776
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,441
You want to explain it
to the cops at the bar?

777
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:42,942
The ones I paid off?

778
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:45,070
You're out of your depth,
Jonesy.

779
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,654
- Jonesy?
- He thinks I'm a criminal.

780
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,490
He's the one
wanted for murder.

781
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,700
Nice big picture
in the New York Herald. 130?

782
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,452
I didn't kill anyone.

783
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:53,536
No entry,
it's a private auction.

784
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,829
And you know it,
Helena.

785
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,500
But whoever did
was looking for this.

786
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:01,044
What you've got here
is Pandora's Box.

787
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,505
No, actually.

788
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,840
It's my box.

789
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,469
You.

790
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,305
Have we met?

791
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,598
No.

792
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,100
My memory
is a little fuzzy,

793
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:16,893
but your face rings a bell.

794
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:18,520
Are you still a Nazi?

795
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:24,818
You're confused.
My name is Schmidt.

796
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,570
Professor Schmidt
of Alabama University.

797
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,574
Professor Schmidt. How nice
to meet you in person.

798
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:33,201
150.

799
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,369
After our conversation,
Miss Shaw,

800
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:36,496
I thought we'd come to
an agreement about the Dial.

801
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,580
Funny. The last time

802
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:38,957
I saw the other guy
who looks like you,

803
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,792
he was also after this.

804
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,002
Your numbers were light,
Professor Schmidt.

805
00:57:43,086 --> 00:57:45,004
But good news is, you're here
now. The bid is 160.

806
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:46,923
You don't seem
to understand, Miss Shaw.

807
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,299
This relic is my property.

808
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:50,885
- It's not yours. You stole it.
- Then you stole it.

809
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,637
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

810
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,763
The bid is 160.

811
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:54,848
- 160.
- 170?

812
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:55,932
You should've
stayed in New York.

813
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,016
- 170?
- You should've stayed

814
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,894
- out of Poland.
- 170. Anyone? Anyone?

815
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,354
Going, going...

816
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:02,730
Gone!

817
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:04,357
Stay away!

818
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,110
Get the Dial.

819
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,782
Stay away!

820
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,084
Oh, hello, Claude.

821
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:24,544
You should not
have come back, Helena.

822
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:34,929
Get back.

823
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,649
Teddy!

824
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,165
Rahim says you stay.

825
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:14,969
Thank you.

826
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,525
See you in the past,
Dr. Jones.

827
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:57,553
It's my cab!

828
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,310
Tell them to back off.

829
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,853
I just told them to shoot you.

830
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,148
All right, guys.

831
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:11,901
Put the guns down.

832
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:13,278
Put 'em down.

833
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,239
All right.

834
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,200
That's better.

835
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,706
Oh, dear.

836
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:35,883
Rahim.

837
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:38,469
You're in pajamas.

838
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,638
I was sleeping, Helena.

839
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:41,806
Peacefully.

840
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,809
My father woke me.

841
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:47,603
He told me you'd
returned to our hotel.

842
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:51,357
Then he handed me
this scimitar

843
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:54,360
and told me to come home
with your head.

844
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,488
Does it have to be that bit?

845
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,041
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

846
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,334
Rahim,

847
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,669
I had an item to sell.

848
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,713
Excuse me. The item
she's talking about

849
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:14,797
- actually belongs to me.
- No.

850
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:16,174
You do not need to intrude
in this conversation.

851
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:17,383
And some very bad people,
worse people...

852
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:18,676
You do not need to get
involved with my business.

853
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,219
- Have run off with it.
- Is this your new man?

854
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:22,013
- No. No, no, no, no.
- It's complicated.

855
01:01:23,348 --> 01:01:24,849
What exactly
do you owe this guy?

856
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:27,101
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

857
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,936
I presume you sold the ring.

858
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,438
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

859
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:31,939
I'll do it!

860
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:33,107
What are you... Hey!

861
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:40,948
You just got me killed!

862
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,701
Well, I'm not the one that's
engaged to a mobster!

863
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,788
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

864
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,164
I'm not a grave robber.

865
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:50,333
Your father and I
did important work together.

866
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:54,587
Don't tell me
all your escapades were noble,

867
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,297
selfless quests.
You did it for the buzz!

868
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,051
Oh, good work, Teddy!

869
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,221
- Move over, kid.
- Hey!

870
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,817
- Helena!
- Back up! Back up!

871
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:34,710
Not this way!

872
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,462
You don't know where you're
going, Indy! Listen to him.

873
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:37,880
- He knows this town!
- I know Tangier!

874
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:43,428
There he is!

875
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:50,685
Faster. Go faster!

876
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:52,770
Ten minutes
to the airport, boss.

877
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,107
I'm not sure
Professor Schmidt

878
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,483
is an actual professor,
by the way.

879
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,860
- He's a Nazi!
- Turn left!

880
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:00,486
Turn left! Turn left!

881
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,737
- Oh, no!
- No!

882
01:03:16,419 --> 01:03:18,379
Helena! Don't do this!

883
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,889
- Hey, this way!
- That way!

884
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:29,849
No!

885
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,310
Helena!

886
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:35,480
No!

887
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,616
What the hell?

888
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,499
Helena!

889
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:58,336
Hey! Hey!

890
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,505
What the hell?

891
01:04:03,216 --> 01:04:04,258
Come on!

892
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,889
Come on. Come on!

893
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:45,633
You think
he'd be proud of this?

894
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:47,552
Who?

895
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,012
Your father!

896
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:53,140
His only daughter selling
her soul for bail money!

897
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:54,767
Sounds quite cool
when you put it like that.

898
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,477
And it's not all bail money.

899
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:57,853
Some of it's gambling debt

900
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,021
- and some...
- Thank you, Teddy.

901
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:00,898
Helena! No!

902
01:05:00,982 --> 01:05:01,983
Helena!

903
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:05,570
How did you end up like this?

904
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,071
Well, you mean resourceful?

905
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:09,574
Daring? Beautiful?
Self-sufficient?

906
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,350
Hold on!

907
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:40,438
Go this way!

908
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:50,823
There he is.

909
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:04,045
Stop!

910
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:05,921
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop!

911
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:19,810
On the left!

912
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:21,937
Take the wheel, Teddy!

913
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,191
What are you doing?

914
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:26,901
Getting what's mine.

915
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,861
Helena!

916
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:35,201
Damn it! You crazy?

917
01:06:36,661 --> 01:06:39,163
Hey! Helena!

918
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,752
- Take the gun!
- Miss Shaw.

919
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,838
Let go, Miss Shaw!

920
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,696
Let go.

921
01:07:11,779 --> 01:07:14,156
Come on! Give me the Dial!

922
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,951
Helena!

923
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:19,787
Damn.

924
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:27,670
Turn back! They went that way!

925
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,754
He's gone!

926
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:30,673
- Move over!
- Hey!

927
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:37,054
I didn't come here to
rescue you from your fiancé!

928
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:38,139
Rescue me?

929
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,937
I just want the Dial back.

930
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,000
Put your hands
above your head.

931
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,586
Not the smoothest
break-up I ever had.

932
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:09,920
If your father
was still alive...

933
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:11,046
Well, he's not, Indy.

934
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,631
Hey, something's wrong
with the engine.

935
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:13,924
If only there'd been
someone there for me,

936
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:15,509
some father figure, someone

937
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:17,720
specifically anointed
for the job.

938
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:19,180
You have no idea
about the kind...

939
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,264
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

940
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,391
I mean,
what even is a godfather?

941
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,436
Anyway, family never
was your strong suit.

942
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,439
- What is the time, by the way?
- It's...

943
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:29,607
Hey, no fair.

944
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:31,358
Give me that back.

945
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:32,651
That was my father's watch!

946
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,071
Give it back to him.

947
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:41,952
You're gonna have
to leave town with me.

948
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,621
Rahim will be
looking for you too.

949
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:44,997
They'll go to
Tangier airport first,

950
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,081
so we'll need to catch a train

951
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,333
and get a plane
from Casablanca.

952
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:50,419
What was that?

953
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:56,509
Damn.

954
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,012
Yeah.

955
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,222
I know, sir.

956
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:04,433
Yes...

957
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:06,685
Copy.

958
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:13,067
They pulled the plug.

959
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,527
You got them scared.

960
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,070
Because they don't understand.

961
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,738
No. Because your associates

962
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:19,156
killed three
American civilians

963
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,575
and blew up
a nationally televised parade.

964
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:22,910
Because you stood up

965
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,703
the President
of the United States,

966
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,038
ran to Morocco,

967
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,582
and created an incident that
required military extraction!

968
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,419
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

969
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:33,921
They want you to vanish.

970
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:36,215
We have half the Dial now.

971
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:37,716
They were just trying
to keep you happy,

972
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,386
letting you chase that thing.

973
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:41,595
They never cared about it.

974
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,763
They will, Miss Mason,

975
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:44,473
when they understand
what it can do.

976
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,766
You put them on the moon.

977
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:47,726
They got what they wanted.

978
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,938
All right, buckle up.
We're landing in Spain.

979
01:09:51,564 --> 01:09:53,566
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

980
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,192
I'm not going back to Alabama!

981
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,611
All we need is a vessel to
take us to the Mediterranean.

982
01:09:58,279 --> 01:09:59,697
The Grafikos
will take us to the other...

983
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,866
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

984
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,075
Let go of me, Schmidt.

985
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:04,869
I'm asking you personally.

986
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,204
You're a piece of work, Doc.

987
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:09,748
Hey!

988
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,278
Schmidt...

989
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,822
My name is Voller.

990
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:45,993
Jürgen Voller.

991
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,050
That's a Sea Stallion.

992
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,635
American helicopter.

993
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:05,346
Did you know
the Wright Brothers?

994
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,264
- What?
- The Wright Brothers.

995
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,515
Orville and Wilbur.

996
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,935
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

997
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,645
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

998
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:15,230
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

999
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:17,942
And the Wright Brothers were
born during the Civil War.

1000
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:20,235
Oh, I thought maybe you went
to school with them.

1001
01:11:21,654 --> 01:11:24,114
Oh, come on, Indy.
That was funny.

1002
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:25,574
Funny?

1003
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,534
I'm stuck in Tangier

1004
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:29,954
with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

1005
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,330
I'm wanted for murder.

1006
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,415
Nazis have
half of Archimedes' Dial

1007
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:35,000
and your father's notebooks.

1008
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,378
I have a copy.

1009
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:39,672
Dad's notebooks.
I made a copy.

1010
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:41,674
Where?

1011
01:11:41,757 --> 01:11:43,717
You memorized five notebooks?

1012
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:45,094
Seven. And of course not.

1013
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,887
Half of them were
as dull as ditchwater.

1014
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,182
Just the really
important bits.

1015
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,059
Like what?

1016
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:53,644
The location of the Grafikos.

1017
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,521
Nobody knows
where the Grafikos is.

1018
01:11:55,688 --> 01:11:57,022
- Dad did.
- No, he didn't.

1019
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:58,357
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

1020
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:00,150
- Yes, he did.
- What's a Grafikos?

1021
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,610
It's directions
to the rest of the Dial.

1022
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:03,278
Ask her if she knows
what language it's in.

1023
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:05,364
It isn't in a language.
It's in a code.

1024
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:06,740
What code?

1025
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,367
Archimedes used two codes.

1026
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:10,077
Linear B and Polybius Square.

1027
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:11,870
So, even if you find
the Grafikos,

1028
01:12:11,954 --> 01:12:13,580
without me, you can't read it.

1029
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:15,416
Please.

1030
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:17,418
Dad taught me Polybius
when I was nine.

1031
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,253
Used to leave little notes
around the house.

1032
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:20,337
Tidy your room.

1033
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:21,714
Stay away from my brandy.

1034
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,882
What if it's Linear B?

1035
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:26,218
50 quid it's Polybius.

1036
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:28,387
Give me that.

1037
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,471
Hey.

1038
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,098
That won't work.

1039
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:33,517
Moroccan chewing gum's made
from the sap of the Manilkara.

1040
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:34,977
Heat resistant.

1041
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:37,688
Try and start it.

1042
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,777
- Start it.
- I am.

1043
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:49,742
It won't hold.

1044
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,827
It'll get us
to the train station.

1045
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:53,120
Us?

1046
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:54,496
- You goin' home?
- No.

1047
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,457
I'm going to Casablanca.

1048
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,375
Then I'm gonna hop a plane
to the Aegean.

1049
01:12:58,459 --> 01:12:59,460
Just like you.

1050
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:01,420
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

1051
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:04,673
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

1052
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,925
Archimedes was
surrounded by Romans.

1053
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,844
Where else would it be?

1054
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:10,012
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

1055
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,305
And you don't
have coordinates.

1056
01:13:11,472 --> 01:13:13,015
And you don't have a boat.

1057
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,353
I've got an old friend
in Greece.

1058
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,897
An expert diver.

1059
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,899
With a big, beautiful boat

1060
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,109
that'll get us there
before they will.

1061
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:27,029
You need me,

1062
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:28,405
and you know it.

1063
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:19,790
Renny!

1064
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:22,918
Indy?

1065
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:24,795
Indy!

1066
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:32,219
So, that's the expert diver?

1067
01:14:32,386 --> 01:14:34,596
Spain's greatest frogman.

1068
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:38,392
Hey!

1069
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:40,644
So, Spain's greatest frogman
has a shit boat

1070
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,020
and only one good frog leg?

1071
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:43,230
Stop it.

1072
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,235
You got
a different boat.

1073
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,528
Stop it.

1074
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:04,835
We're going here.

1075
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,922
Where they found the first
part of the Antikythera.

1076
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,008
But...

1077
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,635
we're going deeper.

1078
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,222
Dad tracked down
the old sponge diver

1079
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:18,932
who found the Dial.

1080
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:20,267
He told him

1081
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:23,395
that the wrecked Roman ship
broke up under the sea

1082
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:24,688
70 feet below.

1083
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:27,816
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1084
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:30,152
That's where they found it.

1085
01:15:30,903 --> 01:15:34,823
But he said that most
of the ship had broken off

1086
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,742
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1087
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,286
Too deep for sponge divers.

1088
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:43,165
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship

1089
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:46,710
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1090
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:53,800
They weren't taking
half a Dial for a joyride.

1091
01:15:57,638 --> 01:15:59,223
They had the Grafikos...

1092
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,269
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1093
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,191
Your dad was a genius.

1094
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:10,859
Yeah.

1095
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,320
He was.

1096
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,174
Seven of spades.

1097
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:38,553
How do you do that?

1098
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:41,431
Do it again.

1099
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,312
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1100
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,946
Seven of spades!

1101
01:16:58,073 --> 01:16:59,116
She's magic.

1102
01:16:59,283 --> 01:17:00,450
Trick deck.

1103
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:01,618
No.

1104
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:04,204
I force the card.

1105
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:05,664
I offer the mark,

1106
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:06,999
you,

1107
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,166
the feeling of a choice,

1108
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,544
but ultimately, I make you
pick the card I want.

1109
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:13,839
The mark.

1110
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,802
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1111
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,721
I have to check the lines.

1112
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:27,853
Good night.

1113
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:34,109
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1114
01:17:35,444 --> 01:17:36,820
Dates?

1115
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,280
What dates?

1116
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:40,198
These dates.

1117
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,371
Written over and over again
in this letter.

1118
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,624
August 20th, 1969.

1119
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,335
That's three days from now.

1120
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,754
And the same date in 1939.

1121
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,340
Two weeks before
Hitler invades Poland.

1122
01:17:58,175 --> 01:17:59,760
Wait.

1123
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:02,888
Now you believe the Dial
has magical powers?

1124
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:06,224
I don't believe in magic,
Wombat.

1125
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,479
But a few times in my life,
I've seen things.

1126
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:15,359
Things I can't explain.

1127
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:19,071
And I've come to believe
it's not so much

1128
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:21,365
what you believe.

1129
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,784
It's how hard you believe it.

1130
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,246
I've seen things too, Indy.

1131
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:31,708
The only thing
worth believing in, ever,

1132
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,543
is cash.

1133
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:36,922
Right.

1134
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,845
What if you could
go back in time?

1135
01:18:46,181 --> 01:18:47,224
What would you do?

1136
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,018
Witness the Trojan War?

1137
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,646
Check in on Cleopatra?

1138
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:58,402
I'd stop my son
from enlisting.

1139
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,281
Did he sign up to please you?

1140
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,576
No, he signed up
to piss me off.

1141
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:11,748
How would you
have stopped him?

1142
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,463
I'd tell him
he was gonna die.

1143
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:27,389
I'd tell him
that his mother would...

1144
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,852
find no end to her grief.

1145
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,439
And that his father
would be...

1146
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:40,193
helpless to console her.

1147
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:45,991
And that the loss would put
an end to their marriage.

1148
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:01,214
You're still wearing the ring.

1149
01:20:23,904 --> 01:20:25,322
Promising.

1150
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:35,457
More promising.

1151
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:42,339
Hello.

1152
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:46,551
Get your gear on.
They're waiting.

1153
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:52,265
Hey.

1154
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,267
Come here.

1155
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:56,478
Okay.

1156
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:57,562
I'm gonna show you something.

1157
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:00,649
Gosh, this looks important.

1158
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:03,818
Around the rope...

1159
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:06,029
Now, we are going deep.

1160
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,032
Descend fast, and breathe
through these hoses.

1161
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,242
Okay?

1162
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:12,035
Ah, stay separate.

1163
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:14,162
No crisscross. All right?

1164
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:15,497
We cannot stay long.

1165
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:19,000
I have a method that
usually prevents the bends.

1166
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,127
- Usually?
- Yeah.

1167
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:22,420
I call it the bounce.

1168
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:23,588
You know, fast down,

1169
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:25,674
three minutes on the bottom,
and then up.

1170
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,883
Three minutes!

1171
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,885
No one more second.

1172
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:31,805
- Three minutes.
- Yeah, that's right.

1173
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:33,807
- Where is my lighter?
- I don't know, capitán.

1174
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,976
We have to go.

1175
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,771
Quick question.

1176
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:41,273
What's that?

1177
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:42,816
- They're sharks?
- No.

1178
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:45,277
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1179
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:48,655
- Eels?
- Anguilas.

1180
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:49,739
Most are small.

1181
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,491
Sometimes they are big.
Two meters.

1182
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:53,702
But if you see them,
stay still.

1183
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:57,080
They bite you,
they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1184
01:21:57,247 --> 01:21:58,665
They look like snakes.

1185
01:21:59,374 --> 01:22:00,375
No, they don't.

1186
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,627
Private Brandy
reporting for duty.

1187
01:22:03,128 --> 01:22:04,129
You're not coming, Teddy?

1188
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:06,006
I can't swim.

1189
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,299
Lucky him.

1190
01:22:07,465 --> 01:22:08,758
Everyone can swim.

1191
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:12,512
Reach and pull.
Reach and pull.

1192
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:15,640
All right.
You stay here

1193
01:22:15,724 --> 01:22:17,017
with Hector
and watch our lines.

1194
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,938
It is time, camarada.

1195
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,297
Two minutes?

1196
01:26:24,556 --> 01:26:25,557
Hey.

1197
01:26:57,422 --> 01:26:58,423
Hurry up!

1198
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,981
Helena!

1199
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,741
Come on.

1200
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:26,451
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

1201
01:27:27,285 --> 01:27:28,494
That's it.

1202
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,019
Who are these people?

1203
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:56,272
Nazis.

1204
01:27:56,356 --> 01:27:58,816
First, you return my Dial,
Dr. Jones,

1205
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,111
and now,
you bring me the Grafikos.

1206
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:05,198
I'm very happy you're not
wasting in retirement.

1207
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,951
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1208
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,243
Where are your sponsors?

1209
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,995
I'm on my own now.

1210
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,830
Things move forward,
Dr. Jones.

1211
01:28:12,914 --> 01:28:13,915
And sometimes...

1212
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,585
they go backward.

1213
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:23,091
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1214
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,536
What language is that?

1215
01:28:51,703 --> 01:28:53,287
It's not a language.

1216
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:55,623
It's a code.

1217
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:57,458
Polybius.

1218
01:28:58,292 --> 01:28:59,585
You owe me 50 quid.

1219
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,715
Not familiar
with Polybius cipher?

1220
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:04,882
No.

1221
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:07,051
But it appears you are.

1222
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:12,640
Read it, please.

1223
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:21,774
No.

1224
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,531
Indy...

1225
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,918
Feeling helpful now?

1226
01:29:44,172 --> 01:29:45,173
I am.

1227
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,594
I know this stuff backwards.

1228
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:50,845
No!

1229
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,431
Sorry, Indy.

1230
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:55,224
I don't do noble death.

1231
01:29:55,892 --> 01:29:56,976
Just

1232
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:58,561
cold, hard maths.

1233
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,938
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1234
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:03,983
One hundred grand. Cash.

1235
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:05,151
Helena...

1236
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:06,819
Take it or leave it.

1237
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:09,363
You have a deal.

1238
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,670
He'll never pay you.

1239
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:27,548
I think
you will find this is worth

1240
01:30:27,632 --> 01:30:29,092
more than your asking price.

1241
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:40,103
- Teddy.
- Helena,

1242
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:41,437
don't do this.

1243
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:48,277
Let's see what we've got here.

1244
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:51,823
My Makhana...

1245
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:53,324
that's machine...

1246
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:58,121
lies with me,
in the city I left.

1247
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,665
Where wolves
teach men to walk.

1248
01:31:00,832 --> 01:31:04,961
Under one of nine, I lie.

1249
01:31:07,797 --> 01:31:09,507
Only one thing
lies anywhere forever.

1250
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:12,385
The dead. So, if the Dial lies
with him, then...

1251
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:15,763
then this is directions
to his tomb.

1252
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:17,598
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1253
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:20,810
Undiscovered
for two millennia.

1254
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:25,982
The city I left.

1255
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:28,651
Archimedes lived two places
his entire life,

1256
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,069
so he only left one.

1257
01:31:30,945 --> 01:31:32,947
Anyone? At the back?

1258
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,366
Come on, Indy.
Everyone knows this.

1259
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:37,368
- Even this clown.
- Alexandria.

1260
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,871
Full marks.

1261
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:42,498
Now, wolf
in Greek is lycos.

1262
01:31:42,582 --> 01:31:44,917
Root of the word
lycaeum or school.

1263
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:47,712
And the Doric
for walking is...

1264
01:31:48,963 --> 01:31:49,964
peripatio.

1265
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:54,010
Which also happens to be
the word for...

1266
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:01,225
I thought you were
a bright spark.

1267
01:32:03,811 --> 01:32:06,939
Peripatio means walking,

1268
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:09,525
but it also means counting.

1269
01:32:09,692 --> 01:32:12,820
So, where wolves
teach men to walk

1270
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:15,865
- could be...
- The School of Mathematics.

1271
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,784
Is correct.

1272
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,494
Now, the next bit is easy.

1273
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:23,372
Beneath one of nine?

1274
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,875
There are nine Muses.

1275
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:27,168
The Museon.

1276
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:29,795
The Greek word for the
Great Library of Alexandria.

1277
01:32:29,879 --> 01:32:31,005
Which, as we all know,

1278
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:33,758
has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1279
01:32:33,925 --> 01:32:34,926
May I?

1280
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:37,220
Thank you.

1281
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:41,140
The nine Muses,
in reverse order,

1282
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,101
are Calliope,

1283
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:45,853
Urania,

1284
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,481
Polymnia,

1285
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,983
- Erato...
- Polymnia.

1286
01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:53,569
And Meli whasisname,

1287
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:54,946
that other one,

1288
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:56,697
Thalia,

1289
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:58,658
Euteroe,

1290
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,910
but the first is...

1291
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,161
Clio.

1292
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:05,164
The Muse of history and time.

1293
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:06,540
That Archimedes,

1294
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:07,959
- what a clever bugger.
- The entrance

1295
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:10,169
to the tomb is by
the School of Mathematics,

1296
01:33:10,336 --> 01:33:12,046
under a statue of Clio,

1297
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:14,966
in the ruins of the Great
Library of Alexandria.

1298
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,425
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1299
01:33:17,802 --> 01:33:18,803
Teddy!

1300
01:33:28,729 --> 01:33:30,314
The Grafikos, get it!

1301
01:33:57,967 --> 01:34:00,678
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1302
01:34:00,845 --> 01:34:03,472
When you're
in a tight spot, dynamite.

1303
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:06,767
My friend was just murdered.

1304
01:34:12,273 --> 01:34:13,274
Sorry.

1305
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:15,192
You told them everything.

1306
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:17,987
Word for word.

1307
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:20,531
But Archimedes
didn't make it that easy.

1308
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:23,242
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1309
01:34:32,293 --> 01:34:33,294
Go!

1310
01:34:36,756 --> 01:34:37,757
So, what do you see?

1311
01:34:38,424 --> 01:34:40,217
Polybius square.

1312
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,886
Made of?

1313
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:45,639
Wax and wood.

1314
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:48,517
Anything else?

1315
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:52,980
It's heavy.

1316
01:34:56,025 --> 01:34:57,151
Too heavy.

1317
01:34:59,278 --> 01:35:00,404
Give me that.

1318
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:42,321
This is solid gold?

1319
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:43,697
Ancient gold.

1320
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,200
From the Nile.

1321
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:48,869
Hold it, Teddy.

1322
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:01,465
Sell this thing

1323
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:03,300
and we are out of the hole
and then some.

1324
01:36:03,384 --> 01:36:04,385
I have just the customer.

1325
01:36:04,552 --> 01:36:05,928
Cranky, old Duchess
in Gibraltar...

1326
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:07,972
This is going in a museum.

1327
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:12,143
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1328
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,025
What does it say?

1329
01:36:22,153 --> 01:36:25,030
Search where Dionysius

1330
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:28,576
hears each whisper

1331
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:31,454
like a hurricane.

1332
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:35,708
The Ear.

1333
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:38,210
The cave of Dionysius.

1334
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:40,045
Where is that?

1335
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:42,548
In Sicily.

1336
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:46,135
- How much fuel have we got?
- It's full.

1337
01:36:55,144 --> 01:36:56,145
They're heading west.

1338
01:36:57,521 --> 01:36:58,522
Not east.

1339
01:37:27,468 --> 01:37:29,595
- I want the papaya.
- How much is it?

1340
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:34,058
Take this.

1341
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,979
Look at that kid
with the straw hat.

1342
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,065
This way.

1343
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:45,653
Hey.

1344
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:49,156
What do you think?

1345
01:37:54,954 --> 01:37:56,205
What are we doing?

1346
01:37:57,831 --> 01:37:59,500
Waiting for closing time
at the caves.

1347
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:01,168
It's crawling with tourists.

1348
01:38:01,335 --> 01:38:03,754
Okay, so he's, like,
running the show now?

1349
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,549
He's not running
the show, Teddy.

1350
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:11,053
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1351
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:12,805
We are.

1352
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:17,268
Most assuredly.

1353
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:20,104
You know he's never gonna
let us sell any of that stuff.

1354
01:38:21,647 --> 01:38:23,274
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1355
01:38:23,357 --> 01:38:24,400
Helena, get over here!

1356
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:25,484
Give me a hand!

1357
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:32,533
Oh, you splurged.

1358
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:34,910
Here's your backpack.

1359
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:36,036
Where's the kid?

1360
01:38:49,967 --> 01:38:51,552
Hey, watch it!

1361
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:52,886
What's wrong with you?

1362
01:39:21,415 --> 01:39:22,583
Hello.

1363
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:25,002
Hey.

1364
01:39:27,755 --> 01:39:29,006
Let me go!

1365
01:39:30,299 --> 01:39:31,342
Let me go!

1366
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:41,894
Get off me! Let me go!

1367
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:46,231
Hey, hey, hey!

1368
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:58,160
Helena!

1369
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:00,954
They've got Teddy.

1370
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:04,667
They took him
up the hill somewhere.

1371
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,552
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1372
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:25,854
What are they
gonna do to him?

1373
01:40:26,021 --> 01:40:28,691
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1374
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:31,527
They're not gonna hurt him.

1375
01:40:31,694 --> 01:40:32,861
They're gonna use him

1376
01:40:33,612 --> 01:40:35,864
to get the other half
of the Dial.

1377
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:36,990
We gotta get there first.

1378
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:54,216
Colonizing queens
built many cities in Sicily.

1379
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:55,884
- The temple...
- Let's go.

1380
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:59,096
Is the oldest
of the Greek temples.

1381
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,557
The cave's over there.

1382
01:41:11,942 --> 01:41:13,694
Could we go
a little faster, please?

1383
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:24,371
The Ear of Dionysius.

1384
01:41:47,311 --> 01:41:49,021
Search where Dionysius hears

1385
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:50,814
each whisper
like a hurricane.

1386
01:41:52,024 --> 01:41:53,025
That's some echo.

1387
01:41:54,777 --> 01:41:57,362
Keep making noise till we
find out where it's loudest.

1388
01:42:14,797 --> 01:42:15,964
Stop.

1389
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,681
This is it.

1390
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:31,146
Greek pediment.

1391
01:42:31,814 --> 01:42:32,815
An entrance.

1392
01:42:34,233 --> 01:42:35,234
Used to be.

1393
01:42:38,529 --> 01:42:39,530
A crescent.

1394
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:43,492
Just like on the Grafikos.

1395
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:52,918
I think there's
an opening up there.

1396
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:00,551
You okay up there?

1397
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:02,886
Yes.

1398
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:06,431
You're not moving.

1399
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:10,143
I'm thinking.

1400
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:13,981
About?

1401
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:18,068
About what the hell I'm doing
up here, 40 feet in the air,

1402
01:43:18,402 --> 01:43:19,987
with crap shoulders,

1403
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:21,947
crumbling vertebrae,

1404
01:43:22,114 --> 01:43:24,616
a plate in one leg,
screws in the other.

1405
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,034
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1406
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,786
No, you don't get it.

1407
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,830
You're half my age.

1408
01:43:30,873 --> 01:43:33,542
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1409
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:34,960
No. Fair enough.

1410
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:37,546
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1411
01:43:38,922 --> 01:43:39,923
And I'm just guessing,

1412
01:43:40,007 --> 01:43:41,675
but I don't think
you've been shot nine times,

1413
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:44,303
including once by your father.

1414
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:47,389
Dad shot you?

1415
01:43:48,098 --> 01:43:49,266
Don't talk to me.

1416
01:43:49,433 --> 01:43:50,601
Just go ahead.
I'll follow you.

1417
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:01,945
No, no, no. We are close.
We are close.

1418
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:03,113
Look around you.

1419
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,781
- We are close.
- The Cave of Dionysius.

1420
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,826
No, no, no. The cave
is closed for renovation.

1421
01:44:09,912 --> 01:44:10,954
Let me ask again.

1422
01:44:11,038 --> 01:44:12,956
Where is
the Cave of Dionysius?

1423
01:44:32,601 --> 01:44:34,770
What's the matter?
You worried about the kid?

1424
01:44:36,063 --> 01:44:37,731
Are you sure
they won't hurt him?

1425
01:44:37,898 --> 01:44:39,107
He'll be fine.

1426
01:44:39,274 --> 01:44:40,317
He's smart.

1427
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:43,570
Where'd you find him?

1428
01:44:44,363 --> 01:44:47,407
He... He tried to steal
my purse outside a casino

1429
01:44:47,491 --> 01:44:49,952
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1430
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:51,954
I hit him repeatedly
with my car door,

1431
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,623
but he didn't let go
and neither did I.

1432
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,333
So, been together ever since.

1433
01:44:57,459 --> 01:44:59,419
Thought you were
all about the money.

1434
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:01,546
I am.

1435
01:45:04,633 --> 01:45:06,468
Nobody memorizes every page

1436
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,679
of their
dead father's notebooks

1437
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:09,930
for the money.

1438
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:18,021
Herr Voller!

1439
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:29,574
They went that way.

1440
01:45:39,918 --> 01:45:41,670
Why?

1441
01:45:44,881 --> 01:45:46,717
Come on, come on.

1442
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:50,387
Let's go.

1443
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,101
Oh, my...

1444
01:45:59,146 --> 01:46:00,647
Oh, my God!

1445
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:02,816
Oh, my God!

1446
01:46:03,025 --> 01:46:04,401
- Oh, God!
- No, no.

1447
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:06,695
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1448
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:12,868
Are they off me? Get 'em off!

1449
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:14,619
- No, no. Wait.
- Get 'em off!

1450
01:46:27,674 --> 01:46:28,759
What is that?

1451
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,221
Methane.

1452
01:46:34,264 --> 01:46:35,474
Don't breathe.

1453
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,641
Don't breathe?

1454
01:46:40,353 --> 01:46:41,730
We've gotta get outta here.

1455
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:51,573
Athena.

1456
01:46:53,325 --> 01:46:54,618
Goddess of war.

1457
01:46:57,496 --> 01:46:58,705
And reason.

1458
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,377
Under the moon...

1459
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:08,673
life lies at her feet.

1460
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:17,766
Water displacement.

1461
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:19,893
Get in the pool!

1462
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,062
Why?
Help me open the door.

1463
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:23,855
Well, they didn't
get out the doors!

1464
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:24,940
Get in the pool!

1465
01:47:25,982 --> 01:47:27,859
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1466
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,152
Help me.

1467
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:33,907
Archimedes was fascinated

1468
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:37,369
by water displacement!

1469
01:48:18,368 --> 01:48:20,662
Hey! Get back here! Klaber!

1470
01:48:34,885 --> 01:48:36,052
You don't need to do that.

1471
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,163
Hey!

1472
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:06,291
Give me that!

1473
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,793
No!

1474
01:49:15,342 --> 01:49:16,635
Leave them.

1475
01:49:17,344 --> 01:49:18,970
I said leave them.

1476
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:44,955
Reach and pull.

1477
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:46,706
Reach and pull.

1478
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:49,042
Reach and pull.

1479
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:19,030
Archimedes' tomb.

1480
01:50:47,976 --> 01:50:49,269
Grab that corner.

1481
01:51:35,607 --> 01:51:36,608
Indy.

1482
01:51:38,902 --> 01:51:40,278
This frieze...

1483
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:44,199
It's a phoenix.

1484
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:45,367
A common icon.

1485
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,118
No. Look, it isn't.

1486
01:51:48,703 --> 01:51:50,413
This phoenix has propellers.

1487
01:51:59,297 --> 01:52:00,757
What's this doing here?

1488
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:12,560
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years,

1489
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:14,687
much less watches.

1490
01:52:17,232 --> 01:52:18,441
Archimedes used it.

1491
01:52:21,986 --> 01:52:23,363
Dad was right.

1492
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,031
It works.

1493
01:52:25,115 --> 01:52:26,741
Of course it works,
Miss Shaw.

1494
01:52:29,452 --> 01:52:30,703
Mathematics works.

1495
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:34,833
As it conquered space,
it will conquer time.

1496
01:52:42,715 --> 01:52:44,634
You've already
lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1497
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:45,802
Your wife is gone.

1498
01:52:45,885 --> 01:52:47,804
Do you really
want to lose your godchild?

1499
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:51,975
For what?

1500
01:52:52,392 --> 01:52:54,561
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1501
01:53:05,905 --> 01:53:06,906
Thank you.

1502
01:53:45,612 --> 01:53:46,988
History's greatest moment.

1503
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:55,371
Its end.

1504
01:54:03,046 --> 01:54:04,047
Throw me the gun!

1505
01:54:14,432 --> 01:54:16,684
- Get him outta here.
- Teddy.

1506
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:18,853
Teddy! Teddy!

1507
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,063
Come on! Go!

1508
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:21,147
This way. Come on.

1509
01:54:25,235 --> 01:54:26,778
Go!

1510
01:54:30,365 --> 01:54:31,366
Indy!

1511
01:54:33,368 --> 01:54:34,536
Go!

1512
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:35,954
Go!

1513
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,205
Stop!

1514
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:42,001
Now what?

1515
01:54:43,628 --> 01:54:44,629
Bring him.

1516
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,721
Helena, come on!

1517
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:55,181
Teddy, we can't
just leave him.

1518
01:54:55,265 --> 01:54:56,599
We're not! Follow me!

1519
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,561
Come on!

1520
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:04,566
Come on.

1521
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:20,707
Teddy. Come on.
We've got a car.

1522
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:26,588
Ah, crap.

1523
01:55:32,802 --> 01:55:33,845
Stay there.

1524
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:53,740
Hop on.

1525
01:55:57,368 --> 01:56:00,288
The first hemisphere
sets the destination.

1526
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:05,376
The second calculates
the location of the fissure

1527
01:56:06,628 --> 01:56:08,463
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1528
01:56:09,047 --> 01:56:11,924
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude,

1529
01:56:12,967 --> 01:56:14,844
and transmit waypoints
to the pilots.

1530
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:28,483
Shortcut.

1531
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:35,740
You got coordinates for 37.07.

1532
01:56:35,823 --> 01:56:37,158
So, who is it?

1533
01:56:37,909 --> 01:56:39,160
Churchill?

1534
01:56:40,495 --> 01:56:41,496
Ike?

1535
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:46,334
Who are you gonna kill
to win the war?

1536
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:50,046
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes,

1537
01:56:50,213 --> 01:56:52,090
we shall fly
into the eye of this storm

1538
01:56:52,882 --> 01:56:55,134
and cross into
Sicilian airspace

1539
01:56:55,301 --> 01:56:58,805
on August 20th, 1939.

1540
01:56:59,555 --> 01:57:01,391
We will head north
over friendly skies

1541
01:57:01,474 --> 01:57:03,101
with enough fuel
to reach Munich.

1542
01:57:04,394 --> 01:57:06,020
My quarry
will be waiting for me

1543
01:57:06,562 --> 01:57:09,023
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz

1544
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:11,609
for an update
on his V-1 rocket.

1545
01:57:18,616 --> 01:57:22,578
What kind of Nazi
kills the Führer?

1546
01:57:24,205 --> 01:57:26,874
The kind that believes
in victory, Dr. Jones.

1547
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:35,967
Hitler lit a fire that could
have burned 1,000 years.

1548
01:57:36,134 --> 01:57:37,635
I saw every mistake.

1549
01:57:38,428 --> 01:57:39,721
Every blunder.

1550
01:57:39,887 --> 01:57:41,556
And I will correct them all.

1551
01:57:41,723 --> 01:57:44,350
History is a long list
of losses, Dr. Jones.

1552
01:57:45,393 --> 01:57:46,644
It's just a question of whose.

1553
01:57:59,323 --> 01:58:00,616
Stop!

1554
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:14,315
Teddy.

1555
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:17,151
You think you can fly
one of those?

1556
01:59:19,153 --> 01:59:20,154
A Nord?

1557
01:59:22,865 --> 01:59:23,866
Sure.

1558
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:25,743
It's not a ringing response.

1559
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:27,537
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1560
01:59:27,703 --> 01:59:29,247
You've never flown any plane.

1561
01:59:30,456 --> 01:59:32,250
I'll get it started.

1562
01:59:32,416 --> 01:59:33,668
No, Teddy.

1563
01:59:34,836 --> 01:59:35,837
Crap.

1564
02:00:03,239 --> 02:00:04,824
Fasten your seat belt,
Dr. Jones.

1565
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:06,284
There might be
some turbulence.

1566
02:00:07,535 --> 02:00:09,745
You're German, Voller.

1567
02:00:09,912 --> 02:00:11,914
Don't try and be funny.

1568
02:00:35,313 --> 02:00:37,148
Come on, big talker.

1569
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:52,955
Okay.

1570
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:11,390
Okay. Okay.

1571
02:01:11,557 --> 02:01:14,101
Gauges green. Power full.

1572
02:01:14,769 --> 02:01:17,271
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1573
02:01:55,017 --> 02:01:56,435
Okay, wings down.

1574
02:01:58,521 --> 02:02:00,523
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1575
02:02:00,982 --> 02:02:02,066
Rotate.

1576
02:03:09,842 --> 02:03:11,177
Time to destination?

1577
02:03:12,386 --> 02:03:13,929
60 seconds.

1578
02:03:19,268 --> 02:03:20,728
Continental drift.

1579
02:03:24,148 --> 02:03:25,357
Continental drift!

1580
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:29,695
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1581
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:32,698
He couldn't have!

1582
02:03:32,782 --> 02:03:34,700
It hadn't been observed yet.

1583
02:03:35,701 --> 02:03:37,495
You're off target.

1584
02:03:37,953 --> 02:03:39,830
Your coordinates
are based on markers

1585
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:43,793
that have been moving
for 2,000 years!

1586
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:46,796
You could be off
by 10 degrees, by...

1587
02:04:02,353 --> 02:04:03,938
30 seconds.

1588
02:04:05,106 --> 02:04:06,107
Herr Voller...

1589
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:08,234
Your calculations are wrong!

1590
02:04:09,485 --> 02:04:11,237
- Herr Voller...
- Will you shut up?

1591
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,321
I'm thinking!

1592
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:16,200
20 seconds.

1593
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:20,079
Hold the flight path!

1594
02:04:22,081 --> 02:04:23,374
15 seconds.

1595
02:04:26,919 --> 02:04:28,963
I don't know
where we're going, Jürgen.

1596
02:04:29,046 --> 02:04:30,047
10 seconds.

1597
02:04:30,172 --> 02:04:31,132
9!

1598
02:04:31,215 --> 02:04:32,758
But it sure as hell...

1599
02:04:33,175 --> 02:04:34,635
- 7!
- Ain't 1939!

1600
02:04:34,802 --> 02:04:35,427
6!

1601
02:04:35,594 --> 02:04:36,387
Turn around!

1602
02:04:37,721 --> 02:04:38,597
Abort!

1603
02:04:38,931 --> 02:04:39,682
Turn around!

1604
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:41,308
Abort!

1605
02:04:41,767 --> 02:04:43,727
We're being pulled in!

1606
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:55,072
What are you doing?!

1607
02:04:55,281 --> 02:04:56,115
This is my plane!

1608
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,783
You're flying my plane!

1609
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,767
We're going to die!

1610
02:05:25,102 --> 02:05:26,812
We need to pull up!

1611
02:05:48,667 --> 02:05:49,835
Restart engines!

1612
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:19,698
That's Sicily.

1613
02:06:19,782 --> 02:06:20,991
1939.

1614
02:06:22,743 --> 02:06:24,161
I did it.

1615
02:06:24,328 --> 02:06:25,829
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1616
02:06:25,996 --> 02:06:27,706
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1617
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:36,715
Yesterday belongs to us,
Dr. Jones.

1618
02:07:01,615 --> 02:07:03,784
Those are Roman triremes.

1619
02:07:32,021 --> 02:07:33,230
Keep it in the air!

1620
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,084
Master...

1621
02:07:54,335 --> 02:07:56,754
The Romans are getting closer.

1622
02:07:58,505 --> 02:07:59,381
They have dragons!

1623
02:08:04,553 --> 02:08:05,929
Amazing.

1624
02:08:14,897 --> 02:08:15,898
Open the door!

1625
02:08:20,861 --> 02:08:21,862
What are you doing?

1626
02:08:22,821 --> 02:08:24,531
What are you doing,
you idiots?

1627
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:26,492
They think we're a monster!

1628
02:08:32,956 --> 02:08:34,458
You have to turn around.

1629
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:36,543
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1630
02:08:37,669 --> 02:08:39,004
214 BC.

1631
02:08:39,171 --> 02:08:40,381
You got the wrong war.

1632
02:08:44,134 --> 02:08:44,843
Master...

1633
02:08:48,389 --> 02:08:49,640
Don't ride out there, Master!

1634
02:08:50,224 --> 02:08:51,433
The dragons!!

1635
02:09:01,693 --> 02:09:05,197
We must take down their dragons!

1636
02:09:12,204 --> 02:09:13,288
Boss!

1637
02:09:13,372 --> 02:09:14,206
Change course!

1638
02:09:14,456 --> 02:09:15,833
The portal closes in minutes!

1639
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,167
I have to go back!

1640
02:09:17,626 --> 02:09:18,752
I can't be here!

1641
02:09:18,961 --> 02:09:20,045
I can't stay here!

1642
02:09:20,212 --> 02:09:21,672
The plane won't make it!

1643
02:09:51,368 --> 02:09:52,369
Get out of the way!

1644
02:09:58,709 --> 02:10:00,836
How do you like that,
you savages?

1645
02:10:03,881 --> 02:10:06,633
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1646
02:10:16,685 --> 02:10:18,770
What are you doing here?

1647
02:10:18,937 --> 02:10:20,481
Rescuing you!

1648
02:10:31,116 --> 02:10:32,910
Get him off!

1649
02:10:34,286 --> 02:10:35,370
Indy!

1650
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:42,211
Parachute!

1651
02:10:45,005 --> 02:10:46,173
I got a parachute!

1652
02:10:47,674 --> 02:10:49,092
Hang on!

1653
02:10:52,095 --> 02:10:53,180
Let go!

1654
02:10:55,516 --> 02:10:56,892
Give me the parachute!

1655
02:11:02,981 --> 02:11:05,108
Grab it. Hang on!

1656
02:11:06,652 --> 02:11:08,403
Indy!

1657
02:11:35,764 --> 02:11:37,224
We're losing altitude!

1658
02:11:38,475 --> 02:11:39,393
We're going down!

1659
02:11:41,311 --> 02:11:42,896
I've lost control!

1660
02:12:01,123 --> 02:12:03,584
Hey, those are my friends.

1661
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,794
Those are my friends.
We need to help them!

1662
02:12:06,962 --> 02:12:08,547
Those are my friends!

1663
02:13:10,442 --> 02:13:11,818
Eureka.

1664
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:30,003
He's trying to land.

1665
02:13:30,087 --> 02:13:32,047
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1666
02:13:32,798 --> 02:13:34,841
Get up. Yeah.

1667
02:13:35,008 --> 02:13:37,302
We need to get you
out of here. Okay.

1668
02:13:39,221 --> 02:13:40,514
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1669
02:13:41,390 --> 02:13:42,641
Sit up. You need to help me.

1670
02:13:42,808 --> 02:13:44,685
I know it hurts,
but we gotta get you back.

1671
02:13:44,851 --> 02:13:47,562
This is incredible, Wombat.

1672
02:13:48,105 --> 02:13:50,065
Incredible.

1673
02:13:51,608 --> 02:13:53,318
Yeah, it very well is.

1674
02:13:53,485 --> 02:13:55,070
But we have to
get you out of here.

1675
02:13:57,197 --> 02:13:58,323
My God.

1676
02:13:59,991 --> 02:14:01,868
We're witnessing history.

1677
02:14:08,959 --> 02:14:10,752
Reverse these numbers.

1678
02:14:10,919 --> 02:14:12,003
They'll get you home.

1679
02:14:13,672 --> 02:14:14,673
What?

1680
02:14:17,592 --> 02:14:18,802
I'm going to stay.

1681
02:14:19,553 --> 02:14:21,555
No. You're not serious.

1682
02:14:24,391 --> 02:14:25,434
Wow, you are serious.

1683
02:14:29,521 --> 02:14:31,148
Indy, you've been shot.

1684
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:32,232
You're bleeding.

1685
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:34,151
You can't stay here.

1686
02:14:34,234 --> 02:14:35,235
Yes, I can.

1687
02:14:35,902 --> 02:14:36,945
But for what? For...

1688
02:14:37,028 --> 02:14:40,574
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1689
02:14:41,616 --> 02:14:43,744
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1690
02:14:44,828 --> 02:14:46,663
Studied it.

1691
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:48,874
- All my life.
- Yeah.

1692
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:52,043
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1693
02:14:52,127 --> 02:14:53,128
And die.

1694
02:14:53,879 --> 02:14:55,505
Please, get up.

1695
02:14:57,257 --> 02:14:58,425
Helena!

1696
02:14:58,759 --> 02:14:59,760
I did it!

1697
02:14:59,926 --> 02:15:02,262
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1698
02:15:02,429 --> 02:15:04,055
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.
Get up.

1699
02:15:04,139 --> 02:15:05,599
I need to get you
into that plane, okay?

1700
02:15:05,682 --> 02:15:06,683
- We need to.
- No. No.

1701
02:15:06,850 --> 02:15:09,186
Get up. You can... We can!

1702
02:15:21,656 --> 02:15:22,282
Master!

1703
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:26,953
We have to leave, Master.

1704
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:29,581
It's him.

1705
02:15:38,548 --> 02:15:40,592
He's asking
how far we've come.

1706
02:15:44,012 --> 02:15:46,765
Two thousand years.

1707
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,558
We've come...

1708
02:15:49,142 --> 02:15:52,145
two thousand years.

1709
02:15:54,481 --> 02:15:57,609
But we didn't expect to meet...

1710
02:15:58,151 --> 02:16:00,654
the great...

1711
02:16:01,196 --> 02:16:03,240
Archimedes.

1712
02:16:08,912 --> 02:16:09,830
You...

1713
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:12,374
were always...

1714
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,292
going to...

1715
02:16:14,876 --> 02:16:16,461
meet me.

1716
02:16:17,212 --> 02:16:19,047
That dial
is a forced deck.

1717
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:20,590
It doesn't take us
anywhere but here.

1718
02:16:20,757 --> 02:16:22,050
He built it to get help.

1719
02:16:22,217 --> 02:16:24,761
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy,

1720
02:16:24,845 --> 02:16:25,846
so I think
we've helped enough.

1721
02:16:26,054 --> 02:16:27,681
Apologies, Archimedes.

1722
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:29,224
I'm a fan...

1723
02:16:29,474 --> 02:16:32,185
- but we need to leave. He's hurt.
- Helena...

1724
02:16:32,811 --> 02:16:33,812
He can't keep that,
by the way.

1725
02:16:33,895 --> 02:16:34,896
He needs to build his own one.

1726
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:36,648
Helena, we need to go!

1727
02:16:37,107 --> 02:16:39,234
Indy, the window is closing!

1728
02:16:39,401 --> 02:16:40,527
We cannot get stuck here!

1729
02:16:42,028 --> 02:16:42,654
I want...

1730
02:16:42,863 --> 02:16:43,947
to stay...

1731
02:16:44,322 --> 02:16:46,074
with you.

1732
02:16:46,241 --> 02:16:48,201
No, no, no!
Do not say yes!

1733
02:16:48,785 --> 02:16:51,037
You are a brilliant man...

1734
02:16:51,288 --> 02:16:53,290
a wise man...

1735
02:16:53,832 --> 02:16:55,083
a genius...

1736
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:56,167
Helena...

1737
02:16:56,334 --> 02:16:58,670
a hero to your people.

1738
02:16:59,379 --> 02:17:02,924
But he can't help you.

1739
02:17:04,092 --> 02:17:05,260
This is your time.

1740
02:17:05,343 --> 02:17:06,678
This is your time.

1741
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,722
He must be in his own time...

1742
02:17:08,805 --> 02:17:10,056
He needs to be in his.

1743
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:12,434
His work is not done.
He needs to go home.

1744
02:17:12,517 --> 02:17:14,185
There is medicine at home.

1745
02:17:14,269 --> 02:17:16,146
He cannot die here. He can't.

1746
02:17:17,814 --> 02:17:20,650
Helena, get on the plane.

1747
02:17:23,236 --> 02:17:24,321
I'll be all right.

1748
02:17:26,156 --> 02:17:27,490
No, you won't.

1749
02:17:30,452 --> 02:17:32,203
I need to do this.

1750
02:17:33,288 --> 02:17:34,289
Me too.

1751
02:18:28,802 --> 02:18:29,803
Good morning.

1752
02:18:34,683 --> 02:18:36,059
How's the shoulder?

1753
02:18:38,728 --> 02:18:41,231
Better than my jaw.

1754
02:18:44,859 --> 02:18:45,860
Right.

1755
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:49,364
You should've let me stay.

1756
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,449
I couldn't do that.

1757
02:19:00,458 --> 02:19:01,459
Why not?

1758
02:19:03,336 --> 02:19:05,880
Well, for starters, you'd have
changed the course of history.

1759
02:19:10,218 --> 02:19:12,012
That's supposed to be
a bad thing?

1760
02:19:16,141 --> 02:19:17,934
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1761
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:22,731
Here.

1762
02:19:27,861 --> 02:19:28,987
For who?

1763
02:19:56,306 --> 02:19:57,891
Marion.

1764
02:19:59,142 --> 02:20:00,185
Hey.

1765
02:20:19,454 --> 02:20:20,455
Teddy.

1766
02:20:22,082 --> 02:20:23,083
Marion.

1767
02:20:25,794 --> 02:20:26,795
What are you doing?

1768
02:20:28,338 --> 02:20:29,506
Putting groceries away.

1769
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,511
There wasn't a scrap of food
in this place.

1770
02:20:35,428 --> 02:20:37,430
No. Really.

1771
02:20:42,227 --> 02:20:44,437
Someone told me you were back.

1772
02:20:51,903 --> 02:20:53,530
Are you back, Indy?

1773
02:20:55,156 --> 02:20:56,866
It was explosives,

1774
02:20:57,033 --> 02:20:59,160
and Indy was running,
Marion was running,

1775
02:20:59,327 --> 02:21:01,996
and suddenly
the plane exploded.

1776
02:21:05,708 --> 02:21:07,752
Indy, you're up and about.

1777
02:21:08,962 --> 02:21:10,338
Yes, I am.

1778
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:12,465
Yes.

1779
02:21:13,091 --> 02:21:15,135
Why don't we go
and get some ice cream, kids?

1780
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:16,636
But Marion
just bought some.

1781
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:17,804
Oh, I know a better place.

1782
02:21:17,971 --> 02:21:20,181
You can never have too much
ice cream, can you?

1783
02:21:23,893 --> 02:21:24,894
See you later.

1784
02:21:28,481 --> 02:21:31,401
<i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>

1785
02:21:31,568 --> 02:21:34,404
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

1786
02:21:34,571 --> 02:21:36,406
<i>His energetic fist</i>

1787
02:21:36,573 --> 02:21:38,992
<i>Should be ready to resist...</i>

1788
02:21:40,869 --> 02:21:42,162
That looks bad.

1789
02:21:43,663 --> 02:21:44,914
Does it hurt?

1790
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,918
Everything hurts.

1791
02:21:51,796 --> 02:21:53,423
I know how that feels.

1792
02:21:59,512 --> 02:22:02,140
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1793
02:22:10,732 --> 02:22:11,733
Here.

1794
02:22:12,525 --> 02:22:13,776
It doesn't hurt here.

1795
02:22:22,035 --> 02:22:23,578
And here.

1796
02:22:47,185 --> 02:22:49,562
Jabari, Alia, slow down!

1797
02:22:49,729 --> 02:22:51,856
Helena! Hurry up!

1798
02:22:52,023 --> 02:22:54,692
I scream, you scream...

1799
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,986
Everybody, slow down.

1800
02:22:57,153 --> 02:22:59,155
- I scream, you scream...
- I scream, I scream...

1801
02:22:59,322 --> 02:23:01,032
We all scream for ice cream!

1802
02:23:01,199 --> 02:23:03,284
Slow down.
