1
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,744
Do you think we're close?

2
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,955
They're almost
impossible to find.

3
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:51,750
No one's ever
captured one alive.

4
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,671
I agreed
to provide security for you...

5
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:59,382
because I thought you were close
to finding the spider.

6
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:02,010
Well, it's worth the wait.

7
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,637
Dead specimens show that

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,889
the peptides
in the spider's venom, they...

9
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,977
Basically, they supercharge
their cellular structure.

10
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:15,315
That spider can give
superhuman strength and power...

11
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,692
like <i>Las Arañas.</i>

12
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,319
<i>Las Arañas?</i>

13
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:23,323
The mythical spider people
who run across the treetops...

14
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:24,532
and punish evil men

15
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:26,701
with their black,
poisoned touch?

16
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:28,954
I like to base my research
in science,

17
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,705
not legends, Mr Sims.

18
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,499
Those powers are wasted here.

19
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,001
These little spiders

20
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,295
have the potential
to cure hundreds of diseases.

21
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,380
It could...

22
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,716
- Are you okay?
- No.

23
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,511
She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

24
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,722
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

25
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,016
Not when I'm this close.

26
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,312
Perhaps you should rest.

27
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,440
I don't have time.

28
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:00,735
Thank you.

29
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,821
For the umbrella.

30
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:47,949
I found it.

31
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,576
I found the spider.

32
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:55,707
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Wow.

33
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,500
- Incredible, isn't it?
- Constance.

34
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,794
Something so small
yet have so much power.

35
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,755
Okay.

36
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:03,465
Okay.

37
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:06,509
What are you doing?

38
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,720
I don't...

39
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:09,888
I don't understand.

40
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,307
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

41
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,726
No, don't...
We could help so many people.

42
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,249
I'm not interested
in helping people.

43
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,356
No one helped me
when my family was starving.

44
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:21,233
My road was
not as clear as yours.

45
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,817
We didn't have the same choices.

46
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,194
You're making
the wrong decision.

47
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,317
- Give me the spider!
- No.

48
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,589
You're making
the wrong decision.

49
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,114
- Give it to me.
- No.

50
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,325
- Give it to me.
- No. Ezekiel.

51
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,008
- No. Please.
- You could just walk away.

52
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:42,837
No.

53
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,292
Her journey will not be easy...

54
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,919
but she is strong.

55
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,212
She will come back
when she needs answers.

56
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:07,839
And when she does...

57
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,009
I will be here for her.

58
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,028
Come on!

59
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,453
Move!

60
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,746
All right! All right!

61
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,793
This is 2-10
with a 42-year-old female.

62
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,253
Code three.

63
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,546
Cassie, I lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

64
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,966
Ben, what are you
even doing back there?

65
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,842
Oh, you wanna come take over?
I can drive.

66
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,636
She's not going
room temp on my watch.

67
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:06,273
Come on.

68
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,160
How you doing back there?

69
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,264
You know, last time I was
in a vehicle driven like this,

70
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:22,330
I was being shot at.

71
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,624
I wouldn't want you
to be homesick for the Army.

72
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,918
Never thought I'd be this happy
to be back in Queens.

73
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,642
What, you've never been
shot at in Queens?

74
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:41,641
Shouldn't you be in school?

75
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:45,604
Who flips off an ambulance?

76
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:46,938
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

77
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,440
Jesus.

78
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,067
Kids.

79
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,409
- I'm gonna get roped in.
- No, you're not.

80
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,329
You're gonna be in the backyard
grilling with us.

81
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,539
I know how
these things work, Ben.

82
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:05,957
Oh, do you? How do you know?

83
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,310
I bet you've never even
been to a baby shower.

84
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:10,545
Because, yeah,
I'm careful not to get roped in.

85
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,549
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

86
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,132
She's gonna be okay.

87
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,344
Who?

88
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,304
Your patient.

89
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:21,848
Her little boy
wanted to say thank you.

90
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,269
You know what,

91
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,993
Mr Ben Parker here
did all the work, so...

92
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:30,065
Just take it.

93
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:31,691
Take it.

94
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,068
Just take it.

95
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,071
- That's... I mean...
- Thank you.

96
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:37,530
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:40,492
I'll take you in to see her.

98
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,261
- Are you all immediate family?
- Oh, my God.

99
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,578
I'm her stepdaughter.

100
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,247
I think she might prefer...

101
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,874
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

102
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,377
I'll see you guys
back at your apartment?

103
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,295
Okay.

104
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,380
Come on, buddy.

105
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,257
Let's go see Mommy.

106
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,134
Okay. This one is for you.
This is for me.

107
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,970
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

108
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,307
What am I supposed
to do with this?

109
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,101
Just put it in your pocket

110
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:08,311
and then throw it away
somewhere else.

111
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,315
Can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

112
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,319
Come on.

113
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,614
We both hate family stuff.

114
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,826
I think I have plans
anyways, so...

115
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,411
Plans? Since when
do you have plans?

116
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,329
You're, like,
impossible to pin down.

117
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,248
Well, I like
to keep my options open.

118
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,499
You know, I might sleep in.

119
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,835
I might go to the museum.
I might walk the dog.

120
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:32,961
You don't have a dog.

121
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,546
I might adopt one.

122
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:35,714
Return the favour.

123
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,675
I suspect you were a bit more
of a handful than a puppy.

124
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:40,654
I don't know
what you're talking about.

125
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,721
I was a model foster kid.

126
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:44,347
I peed outside and everything.

127
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,517
So...

128
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,188
I kinda met someone.

129
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,940
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:55,358
What's this one's name?

131
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:03,867
Serious.

132
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,167
She's a lucky lady, Ben.

133
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:14,753
Thank you.

134
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,507
"You have
a winning personality."

135
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,831
I guess I got yours by mistake.

136
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:23,011
You're an asshole.

137
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,095
Here.

138
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,474
Let's see what
your future holds for you.

139
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,186
What if I don't wanna know?

140
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,479
Well, it's just a cookie.

141
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:38,777
"You will."

142
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:40,820
You will what?

143
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,532
- Apparently, I have no future.
- Cassie.

144
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,118
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

145
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,997
It means that
their printer is broken.

146
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,290
We can't eat here any more.

147
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,587
Yeah, I'll meet you at
the coffee shop at the corner.

148
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,847
You think
I can manage both of these?

149
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:08,932
I think so, yeah.

150
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,267
<i>We'll have it for you tomorrow.</i>

151
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,143
My dad just needs
to pick up his paycheque.

152
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,038
Well, let me come in
and talk to your dad.

153
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:15,122
I haven't seen him in a while.

154
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:16,374
Maybe we can work something out.

155
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,650
He's not
home right now, actually.

156
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,151
Look, I'll be back tomorrow.

157
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,945
But no more excuses.

158
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,446
I swear. We'll have it.

159
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,407
All right.

160
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,780
Us strays
need to stick together.

161
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,450
{\an8}Somebody's hungry.

162
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,826
Hope the spiders
were worth it, Mom.

163
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,749
For your own safety,
please stay where you are.

164
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,171
You gotta get, like,
Jaws of Life for that.

165
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,924
MVA, three vehicles.

166
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,677
<i>One vehicle
flipped over with entrapment.</i>

167
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,470
<i>Copy that. Sending backup
to your location.</i>

168
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:53,638
It won't open.

169
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,993
All right, sir. We're gonna
get you out of there, okay?

170
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,768
Just don't move.

171
00:13:58,852 --> 00:13:59,853
Hi, sir.

172
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,980
Can you tell me your name?

173
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:03,440
Robert.

174
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,609
Robert, I'm Cassie.

175
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,652
I'm gonna help you out
today, okay?

176
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,987
You're gonna be all right.

177
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,214
All right,
I'm gonna cut your seat belt.

178
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:11,382
And when I do,
you're gonna fall...

179
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,966
and my partner Ben
is gonna help you out

180
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,117
on that side, okay?

181
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,536
Three, two, one.

182
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:19,748
All right, Robert.
We're gonna move on three.

183
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:20,871
- Okay? Here we go.
- Yeah.

184
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,334
One, two, three.

185
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,754
Okay. You're gonna be okay, sir.

186
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,957
Just try and lay still.
We're gonna get you checked...

187
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,050
- Hey! Cassie!
- Ben!

188
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:31,968
- Cassie!
- Ben!

189
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:58,870
<i>79 over 55.</i>

190
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,372
<i>Dial it back, I'm fine.</i>

191
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,290
<i>You need a real workup
at a real hospital.</i>

192
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,292
<i>No, you were right.
They're roping ya in.</i>

193
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:05,835
<i>Games!</i>

194
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,504
<i>You guys are ice-cold.</i>

195
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,257
<i>Cassie!</i>

196
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:12,968
<i>This place has always
been a death trap.</i>

197
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,475
<i>You can't save all three!</i>

198
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,560
<i>you can use the web</i>

199
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:24,521
<i>to be in more than one place
at the same time.</i>

200
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:27,440
<i>You are the only one
who can change the future.</i>

201
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:28,692
<i>No!</i>

202
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:29,776
<i>Cassie!</i>

203
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,236
<i>That's it, Cassie, breathe!</i>

204
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,445
Come on!

205
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,533
You're okay. You're okay.

206
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:39,744
Did I die?

207
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:40,870
Yeah.

208
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:43,373
You were down three minutes
before I fished you out.

209
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,292
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,795
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

211
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,307
You're not goin' anywhere.

212
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,892
79 over 55.

213
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:05,103
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

214
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,813
with a real doctor.

215
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:07,981
I don't need a doctor.

216
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:10,025
I trust you.

217
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,194
Ah, 80%. No, it's great.

218
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,322
Slightly above that
of a dead fish.

219
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,494
All right.
Well, O2 is going up to 89.

220
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:24,706
Jump back in the water anytime.

221
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:32,047
You're not goin' anywhere.

222
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,757
79 over 55.

223
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,801
You need a real workup
at a real hospital

224
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:38,720
with a real doctor.

225
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,473
Seriously, Ben, dial it back.

226
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:42,641
I'm fine.

227
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:46,561
Wait, wait, wait. I need
to get your oxygen levels.

228
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,771
Again?

229
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,415
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,857
My O2 is 89.

231
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,985
- Okay, stay back, stay back.
- No, it's...

232
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,364
Oh, you're right.

233
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,285
Are you okay?

234
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:03,689
What the hell
happened down there?

235
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:04,745
I'm fine.

236
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,375
I just wanna go home
and watch <i>Idol.</i>

237
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,210
Please stay where you are.

238
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:36,338
Wow.

239
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:39,215
Great apartment.

240
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:08,578
<i>Where's my spider?
They took my spider.</i>

241
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,589
<i>Who are you?</i>

242
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,913
No!

243
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:05,135
Bad dream?

244
00:20:05,218 --> 00:20:06,344
It's not a dream.

245
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,347
I'm gonna be murdered one day.

246
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,517
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

247
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,064
The same three faces.

248
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,027
Every night, the same vision.

249
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:24,654
It's a curse.

250
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,698
But we all die someday.

251
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,867
Nothing we can really do
to stop that.

252
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,244
But if you saw
who was going to murder you...

253
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,247
you'd try to stop them.

254
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:36,958
Okay...

255
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:41,296
You have no idea
of the torment and torture...

256
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:44,174
of dying over and over again.

257
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,592
And I can't escape it.

258
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,678
So I'm not gonna sit back
and let it happen.

259
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,101
I will find them
and kill them first.

260
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,313
So you know who did it...

261
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:01,775
I mean, will do it?

262
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:05,987
It's always those three faces.

263
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:10,283
Can you imagine
how frustrating it's been?

264
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,788
Trying to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

265
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,209
But as the years pass...

266
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,212
there have been
technological advances.

267
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:26,299
New ways to find people,
if you know their faces.

268
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:30,512
The kind of technology
I've heard...

269
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,431
the National Security Agency
has been pursuing.

270
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:51,032
What are you doing?

271
00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,661
How are you poisoning me?

272
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,162
What's your password?

273
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:58,957
I can't tell you. Oh, please!

274
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,168
Is "please" your password?

275
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:06,590
Tell me quickly before
the paralysis reaches your lips

276
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,049
and I'll stop the poison.

277
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:22,147
Q-9-2-0...

278
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:25,984
B-3-7-5.

279
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,282
Oh, God.

280
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:39,706
Believe me, it's a good thing
you had no idea...

281
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,083
today was the day
you were going to die.

282
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:56,932
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey.

283
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,855
I'm serious. You should
open, like, a barbecue.

284
00:22:58,892 --> 00:22:59,893
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

285
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,037
You know what you're doing.

286
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,520
- I saw him leave.
- Yeah, I...

287
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,605
Cassie!

288
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,732
- Hey!
- Hi.

289
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:07,609
Hey, the next time
you wanna go swimmin',

290
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:09,402
maybe you should
stick to Astoria Park.

291
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:12,197
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

292
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,741
Are you pressing the burgers?

293
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:16,117
I'm releasin' the fat.

294
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,452
That's called flavour, man.

295
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:19,120
Plus, it's, like,
really flammable.

296
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:20,497
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

297
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:23,392
You don't think that maybe
in light of recent events

298
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,459
I could use a beer?

299
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,462
Well, as you know,
the protocol is...

300
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:30,882
no booze within
24 hours of your death. So...

301
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,134
- Is that protocol?
- Yeah, it's protocol.

302
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:34,261
That's boring.

303
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:36,096
I feel like
there's more of a story there.

304
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,180
No, there's...

305
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:39,057
You guys,
we've seen this a hundred times.

306
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,141
It was cardiac arrest.

307
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:42,852
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

308
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,771
Really?

309
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,773
Dead, huh?

310
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,442
Did you see a white light or...

311
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:54,447
Well, actually, I saw Jersey...

312
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,741
- so you tell me.
- Oh, come on, you saw...

313
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:57,826
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:59,494
She hit me with a Jersey joke.

315
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:00,888
Has he been
pressin' the burgers again?

316
00:24:00,912 --> 00:24:02,163
Yeah, they're ruined now.

317
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:03,582
Take that. For you, sir.

318
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,376
- Oh, now they're really ruined.
- Oh, okay.

319
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,378
- We're ready to start.
- What?

320
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,713
What?

321
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,923
They're starting,
so you should get in there.

322
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,009
No, you were right,
they're roping ya in.

323
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,812
- Yeah. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

324
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:16,845
Have fun.

325
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,600
- for you, okay.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

326
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:23,810
- Hi.
- Look at you. Hi.

327
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,228
Okay. This is crazy.

328
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:26,581
Well, I couldn't decide,
so I got two.

329
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:27,772
Yeah, that's like...

330
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:29,983
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:31,818
Cassie Webb.

332
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,528
Thanks for having me.

333
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:36,823
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law, Mary.

334
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,450
Nice to meet you.

335
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:41,119
Ben is so excited
about being an uncle.

336
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:42,746
I don't know
what we'd do without him.

337
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,831
- Especially with Richard away.
- Again.

338
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:46,833
Where is it this time?

339
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,418
He's in Mumbai...

340
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,629
Shanghai... I can't keep track.

341
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:56,259
Never stops
leaping around in there.

342
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:57,344
And always hungry.

343
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,597
Does it have a name? The...

344
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,870
We're saving that
for one of the games.

345
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,437
- Games?
- Games!

346
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:12,359
Games!

347
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:15,528
Okay.

348
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:20,158
"My mother always cut the crusts
off my sandwiches."

349
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,370
Chloe, is that you?

350
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:24,454
Yes.

351
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:29,292
My mom said the crusts
would make my hair go curly.

352
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:31,086
It was years
before I figured that one out.

353
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:36,091
Hold up. Hold up. Bernie!

354
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,593
Whose is this?

355
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,264
Oh, it's mine.

356
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:45,350
You must have at least
one fond memory of your mother.

357
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:49,312
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

358
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:53,483
Well, but it wasn't that bad.
It wasn't like...

359
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,319
I mean, obviously,
it was bad, you know.

360
00:25:56,403 --> 00:25:57,571
She died.

361
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,492
But, I grew up totally healthy.

362
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:05,412
Death in childbirth
is super rare.

363
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean, she chose to be, like,
way deep in the Amazon...

364
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,127
for the last month
of her pregnancy...

365
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,130
hundreds of miles away from
any medical facilities, so...

366
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,132
Okay, so let's...

367
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:18,455
let's move on to the next game.

368
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:22,637
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

369
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:24,139
Oh, yes!

370
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:26,016
Okay, I'll kick things off.

371
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,311
- Sam.
- Nope.

372
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:30,604
Steven.

373
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,606
- He's not named Steven.
- Shoot.

374
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,316
- Baby sausage?
- You guys are ice-cold.

375
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:39,779
Baby sausage?

376
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:41,781
Richard Junior?

377
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,158
Richard wishes.

378
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,012
Get your hamburger.
Get your hamburger.

379
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,954
Cassie... what's your guess?

380
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:55,545
Do that thing
where you throw it up

381
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:56,630
and catch it on the...

382
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,257
- Oh, my God.
- Ben?

383
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,592
- Look at that.
- The name is...

384
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,058
Baby sausage?

385
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,686
Richard Junior?

386
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,979
Richard wishes.

387
00:27:15,357 --> 00:27:16,417
Come on, get your hamburger.
Get your...

388
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,984
Cassie... what's your guess?

389
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:19,348
Put five dollars down, let's go.

390
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:21,071
Wait. We just did this.

391
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,781
Do that thing
where you throw it up

392
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:23,865
and catch it on the...

393
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:28,662
What, seriously,
is this part of the game?

394
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,666
Sorry.
They're calling everyone in.

395
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,251
Fire down at the docks.

396
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,335
So...

397
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:39,214
You okay?

398
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:43,260
Yeah. I just got
a weird sense of déjà vu.

399
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,387
I got you, man.

400
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:47,281
I don't...
I don't think it's broken.

401
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:48,932
The ones who got out, come on.
This way.

402
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,058
Get her out. Come on.

403
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,560
Grabbin' a woman on A-side here.

404
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:54,354
Go. Go. Go.

405
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:55,706
We need more pressure
in the line.

406
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,148
Keep pressure on the leg
here, okay?

407
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:00,360
Okay, looks like
a fractured left radius.

408
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:01,444
Otherwise stable.

409
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,574
Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.

410
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,246
Okay, and internal injuries.
Good catch.

411
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,455
Let's go. Come on.

412
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:19,462
Hey, I need
to get my guys in there.

413
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,148
No, it's not safe.
The structure's unstable.

414
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:22,292
Hey, the people are trapped.

415
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,175
We need to treat 'em
before we move them.

416
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:26,511
The place is
packed with explosives.

417
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:28,346
Industrial grade fireworks.

418
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:30,265
It could blow up any minute.

419
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:35,395
It could blow up any minute.

420
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,539
<i>- Cassie!</i>
- It could blow up any minute.

421
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:39,941
<i>Cassie!</i>

422
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,490
This place has
always been a death trap.

423
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:49,385
- I got you, man.
- Come on. This way. Get her out.

424
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:50,410
Otherwise stable.

425
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:52,579
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Check his abdomen.</i>

426
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:56,374
And internal injuries.
Good catch.

427
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,459
Let's go. Come on.

428
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:03,882
I gotta get my guys in there.

429
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,050
The structure's unstable.

430
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,259
Hey, the people are trapped.

431
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,470
The place is
packed with explosives.

432
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:09,888
Industrial grade fireworks.

433
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,365
This place has
always been a death trap.

434
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:12,390
Cassie!

435
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:13,683
Cassie! Cassie.

436
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,435
I need you at the triage.

437
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:17,121
- Come down to the staging area.
- We're ready to go.

438
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:18,980
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

439
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:20,899
He's stable. Ready to transport.

440
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,752
Yeah, copy that. We need
every able body down here.

441
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:23,777
You're gonna be okay.

442
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,546
Stabilise the head while
I get the longboard set up.

443
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,572
- Yeah. I'll give you a hand.
- Wait. O'Neil!

444
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:28,823
Copy that.

445
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,107
Hey, what is it? I gotta roll.

446
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:31,701
Will you let me drive?

447
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:32,869
What are you talking about?

448
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,830
I don't know.
I just have a weird feeling.

449
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,165
Cassie, I need you over here.

450
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,793
Will you just let me drive?

451
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,962
Look, you had
a bad experience on the job.

452
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:44,693
I don't think
that's what's happening.

453
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,510
Don't let it
mess with your head.

454
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:50,637
Cassie, come on!

455
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:01,815
<i>This is O'Neil.
Clear of dock side.</i>

456
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:02,899
<i>Headed back...</i>

457
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,050
O'Neil, come on.

458
00:30:33,138 --> 00:30:34,639
Come on. O'Neil.

459
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,141
Come on!

460
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:39,227
Let's get it! Come on, let's go!

461
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:41,479
Wake up!

462
00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:43,857
O'Neil, come on.

463
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,650
<i>Did you see a white light or...</i>

464
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:47,027
<i>O'Neil, come on.</i>

465
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:49,654
<i>Cassie! Cassie!</i>

466
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,867
Come on. Come back.

467
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:56,661
Come on, come on.

468
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,372
- Ben, help me.
- Cassie, Cassie, it's okay.

469
00:30:59,456 --> 00:31:01,499
It's all right. It's okay.

470
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,377
It's okay. Okay?

471
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,796
There's nothing
you could have done. Okay?

472
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,419
So, was it worth the trouble?

473
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:47,963
The scale
of the NSA surveillance

474
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,422
is unprecedented.

475
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,216
They can access everything.

476
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,010
There's nowhere to hide.

477
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,345
That's the idea.

478
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:57,597
The potential is infinite.

479
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,808
It's intoxicating.

480
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:03,228
But, in the wrong hands,
I mean...

481
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:05,855
people can be tracked
wherever they go.

482
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:07,649
It's gonna change everything.

483
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,778
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now...

484
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:13,863
before they get their powers.

485
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:15,740
This is what
they look like in your visions

486
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:17,158
as well as you can recollect.

487
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:20,662
Their faces have been
taunting me for years.

488
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:22,956
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place...

489
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,334
so I'm giving us
a 10-year range just to be safe.

490
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,337
Here's what
they should look like now.

491
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:35,844
They're younger than I thought.

492
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:39,402
I didn't know
we'd be targeting teenagers.

493
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:42,225
They're teenagers now,
but in the future...

494
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:44,978
they have powers,
and they will try to destroy me.

495
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,397
I came from nothing,
less than nothing.

496
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,066
I will not give up
everything I've built...

497
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,776
and have my life cut short.

498
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:56,615
Well, if they ride
public transportation...

499
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:58,074
go to a museum...

500
00:32:58,158 --> 00:32:59,701
get money from an ATM...

501
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,786
wherever they are
in the world...

502
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,080
Find them.

503
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:06,291
I pay you a fortune.

504
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,001
Yeah, I'll find them.

505
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:12,839
Still no blurriness.

506
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,507
No double vision.

507
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:15,717
No discolouration at all.

508
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,012
Your eyesight is good,

509
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:20,847
and all your other vitals
check out.

510
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:24,517
But what about the visions?

511
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:27,520
How am I seeing that stuff?

512
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:30,190
Sometimes when
we experience trauma,

513
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,733
it can have a lasting effect.

514
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:33,652
This isn't trauma.

515
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,445
I knew he was gonna die.

516
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:37,906
I saw it.

517
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,699
Cassie, I have
all your reports here

518
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:41,243
from your other consultations.

519
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:45,121
Your head CT was normal.
Your MRI was clear.

520
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:46,665
The scan showed
no abnormalities.

521
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,500
I know that it sounds crazy,
I know,

522
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,460
but I don't understand
what's happening.

523
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:52,712
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

524
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,172
Get some rest.

525
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:55,340
Watch old movies.

526
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:57,109
If you still have concerns,

527
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,261
I can run some bloods
or refer you to psych.

528
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:00,637
But I'm sure

529
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,800
everything will be back
to normal before you know it.

530
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,811
<i>I am in the presence</i>

531
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:09,563
<i>of the Spirit of Christmas
Yet-to-Come.</i>

532
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:13,334
<i>And you're going to show me
shadows of things</i>

533
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,569
<i>that have not yet happened
but will happen.</i>

534
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:18,488
<i>Spirit of the Future,</i>

535
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:20,782
<i>I fear you more than
any other spectre I've seen.</i>

536
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:24,744
<i>But even in my fear,
I must tell you, I am too old.</i>

537
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:26,204
<i>I cannot change.</i>

538
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,997
<i>Whose funeral
were they talking about?</i>

539
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,088
<i>Hey, Cass, it's me again. Ben.</i>

540
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,465
<i>I know you're there.
Just pick up.</i>

541
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,277
<i>I ought to be there
this time of day.</i>

542
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:43,805
<i>Okay, well, O'Neil's funeral
starts at 2:00 in Poughkeepsie.</i>

543
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:45,098
<i>Everyone's going.</i>

544
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,310
<i>I know it's the last place
you wanna be...</i>

545
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:51,438
<i>but it would help Susan
if you came.</i>

546
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:53,398
<i>It might help you too.</i>

547
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,400
<i>Look, if you leave now,
you can still make it.</i>

548
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,611
<i>Cassie?</i>

549
00:34:58,904 --> 00:34:59,905
<i>Cass?</i>

550
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,496
<i>Before I draw
nearer to that stone,</i>

551
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,831
<i>answer me one question.</i>

552
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:12,709
<i>Are these the shadows
of things that must be...</i>

553
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:16,338
<i>or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

554
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:18,131
Hate to break it to you,
Scrooge...

555
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:21,718
but you can't change anything.

556
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,590
<i>Are these the shadows of things
that must be?</i>

557
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,885
<i>Or are they only shadows
of things that might be?</i>

558
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,603
This isn't gonna
change anything.

559
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:38,211
Guess you didn't die after all.

560
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,450
<i>Please keep all

Come on. Let's go down the ramp.

564
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:17,876
Yeah, awesome.

565
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,102
Can I have one
to Poughkeepsie, please?

Shit.

575
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:02,587
What are the odds of them

576
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,273
all being in the same place
at the same time?

577
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:05,674
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

578
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,468
<i>There must be something
that connects them.</i>

579
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:09,678
Or...

580
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,347

- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.

635

We don't have
tickets for this train.

636
00:42:55,046 --> 00:42:56,381

Go.

654
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:02,864
Hey, help. Over here.

655
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:04,217
I've never been so happy
to see cops.

656
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,426
You guys
need to call for backup.

657
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,490
That will not be necessary
as long as you cooperate.

658
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:08,596
Wait. What?
No, it's not for me. Ow.

659
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,621
No. You don't understand.

660
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:11,349
- Don't worry, don't worry. Calm down.
- We're being attacked. We're being attacked.

661
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:12,540
You're safe.

662
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,043
Run! Go!

663
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,544
Run!

664
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:23,051
Run! Run!

665
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:24,469
Go! Go! Go!

666
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,161
Come on.

667
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,292
- Get in.
- What?

668
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,435
- Here you go. Thank you so much.
- Get in.

669
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:57,520
Thank you so much.
This is for you.

670
00:44:57,544 --> 00:44:58,729
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move. Slide over.

671
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:00,380
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

672
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,216
Oh, wow, thank...
Hey!

673
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,570
That guy was nuts. Do you guys
think he killed those cops?

674
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:07,304
He could climb on walls
and dodge bullets.

675
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,139
- How is that even possible?
- It's not.

676
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:10,533
There's not enough
frictional force

677
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:12,034
in the bare human foot
to overcome gravity...

678
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:13,119
and keep him
stuck to the wall...

679
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,162
- What the hell is going on?
- much less the ceiling.

680
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,622
Yeah, well,
science didn't seem to stop him,

681
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:17,647
so what good is it?

682
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,816
- What good is science?
- Okay, enough.

683
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,443
- Please, don't fight.
- Enough.

684
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,445
- No, I was just telling them...
- Enough!

685
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:24,571
Your voices are, like,

686
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,281
drilling in the centre
of my skull...

687
00:45:26,364 --> 00:45:27,365
and I need to think.

688
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,916
I'm Cassie. Okay?

689
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,042
What are your names?

690
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:38,960
What are your names?

691
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:40,086
I'm Julia Cornwall.

692
00:45:41,212 --> 00:45:42,589
My dad lives here in New York,

693
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:43,983
and my mom lives
back in LA, but...

694
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,550
We don't need
your whole life story.

695
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,638
I'm Anya Corazón.

696
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:51,306
Mattie Franklin.

697
00:45:52,057 --> 00:45:53,701
- Thank you for protecting us.
- No, no, no.

698
00:45:53,725 --> 00:45:54,726
I'm not... That's not...

699
00:45:54,809 --> 00:45:56,269
That's not
what's happening here.

700
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,064
I'm not protecting you.
I am, I am...

701
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:01,107
Your parents can handle this.

702
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,859
My parents
are on a business trip.

703
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:04,653
Yeah.
My parents are out of town too.

704
00:46:04,736 --> 00:46:06,988
- My dad is busy working, so...
- Oh, my God.

705
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:08,299
I was gonna go
stay with some friends.

706
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:09,699
Well, where do
your friends live?

707
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:10,843
- I'll drop you off first.
<i>- are asking</i>

708
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,012
<i>for the public's help...
in finding a person of interest</i>

709
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,081
<i>seen in the attack
on multiple NYPD officers...</i>

710
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:17,725
<i>at Grand Central Terminal
this afternoon.</i>

711
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:19,668
That's great. Good.

712
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:23,380
I hope they find his crazy ass.
That was insane.

713
00:46:23,463 --> 00:46:25,507
They better lock him up.
Right? I mean...

714
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,883
<i>She is also the same person</i>

715
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,069
<i>police are
seeking to question...</i>

716
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:29,153
<i>in the possible abduction...</i>

717
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,179
- She?
<i>- of the three teenage girls.</i>

718
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:34,015
<i>Eyewitnesses have identified
the woman in her early 30s.</i>

719
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,535
<i>The public has been asked
for any information...</i>

720
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,560
What?

721
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:37,828
<i>and to keep an eye out
for these girls.</i>

722
00:46:37,852 --> 00:46:40,689
What? That's...
But you guys... What about them?

723
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:41,874
And he was
crawling on the ceiling.

724
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:42,899
What about that guy?

725
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:44,484
I mean, you saw. I...

726
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:45,694
No one saw ceiling guy.

727
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:47,237
Everyone thinks
you're the kidnapper.

728
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,738
Yeah, because
you told them I was.

729
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:50,282
I didn't know
what was happening.

730
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:51,491
Okay, guys.

731
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:53,970
My uncle, Jonah, can totally
help us. I'm gonna call him.

732
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:55,412
You have a phone?

733
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:57,265
You know they can
track those nowadays, right?

734
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,748
No, you can't...

735
00:46:58,832 --> 00:47:01,209
- Hey! You can't do that.
- She's right.

736
00:47:01,293 --> 00:47:02,562
It's okay.
Daddy will buy you a new one.

737
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,753
What is your problem?

738
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:04,897
- What do you mean?
- Please.

739
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:06,423
- I'm just trying to help.
- Okay.

740
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:09,009
Anyone who wants to leave
can leave right now.

741
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,510
- Yo, watch out!
- Okay.

742
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,012
- Wait.
- Lady, drive!

743
00:47:12,512 --> 00:47:14,848
Sorry.
No, you can't actually leave...

744
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:16,892
because you guys
are the only ones

745
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:18,435
that know
what actually happened.

746
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:24,357
Okay, well, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

747
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,818
We're just gonna, like,
lay low for a little bit.

748
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,029
And...

749
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,550
I'll figure out
how to get out of this.

750
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,244
You know...

751
00:47:38,747 --> 00:47:39,998
This is still not a kidnapping.

752
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:41,541
Okay?

753
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,210
Feels like a kidnapping.

754
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,381
How did they get away?

755
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,592
It's like
they knew I was coming.

756
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:53,178
<i>No hits at the train station,
bus depot,</i>

757
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:54,387
<i>or any of the bridges.</i>

758
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,908
Wherever they went,
there aren't any cameras.

759
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,100
<i>The police don't have
this technology.</i>

760
00:47:59,184 --> 00:48:02,312
<i>You have access
to every camera in the city.</i>

761
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:03,456
<i>We should be ahead of them.</i>

762
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,025
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

763
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:08,985
Use them better.

764
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:11,488
I've always
wanted to be a Girl Scout.

765
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:12,572
Of course you did.

766
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,408
Anybody else starving?

767
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,993
All I have is gum.

768
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:21,206
Here. I found this
in the glove compartment.

769
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,643
Wait. That bag's
already been opened.

770
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,894
We don't know
how long it's been in there.

771
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:27,796
Okay, I hope you're
good at catching squirrels.

772
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,299
Okay, so what's the deal
with ceiling guy?

773
00:48:31,383 --> 00:48:33,385
I told you, I don't know.

774
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:34,761
I've never seen him before.

775
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:35,905
Then how did you know
he was coming?

776
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:36,930
Oh, my God.

777
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:39,724
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

778
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:42,018
I don't know.

779
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:44,646
Crazy shit's been happening,
and I don't know why.

780
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:46,690
Stop asking me. Okay?

781
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,775
Wait. You're the paramedic.

782
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,570
You saved my stepmother,

783
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:53,572
then you were
super awkward about it.

784
00:48:55,115 --> 00:48:58,243
That does sound like me.

785
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,453
Wait. I recognise you too.

786
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:01,746
What?

787
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,915
Yeah. You live in my building.

788
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,668
You leave your junk mail
in the lobby...

789
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,751
and then everybody else
has to clean it up for you.

790
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:11,339
Okay. Well, there should be
a recycling bin there.

791
00:49:11,756 --> 00:49:13,133
You don't think this is weird?

792
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,385
That we both know you?

793
00:49:15,468 --> 00:49:16,469
It's honestly, like,

794
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,680
the least weird thing
that's happened all day.

795
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:23,310
What?

796
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:26,813
Total stranger.

797
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,441
No.

798
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,693
You flipped me off.

799
00:49:32,444 --> 00:49:33,921
That's not really
narrowing it down much.

800
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:35,655
You guys, this is so freaky.

801
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:37,908
Who are you? What is going on?

802
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,370
I can see the future.

803
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:44,831
Kind of.

804
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:51,838
I mean...

805
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:54,507
What the hell?

806
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,593
See? She didn't see that coming.

807
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:58,678
It doesn't work like that.

808
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,931
You guys,
just give her a chance, please.

809
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,099
Wait. When you were looking
into the future...

810
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:05,101
did you see us...

811
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,705
in the middle of nowhere
eating glove-compartment jerky?

812
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:10,815
Okay, look. Believe me or don't.
I don't care.

813
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:13,401
I didn't ask
to be doing this with you.

814
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,737
And I didn't ask for this
to happen to me, either.

815
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:19,199
Also, I'm pretty sure
I saved all of your lives.

816
00:50:19,824 --> 00:50:21,952
So, you're welcome.

817
00:50:24,204 --> 00:50:25,330
How does it work?

818
00:50:27,999 --> 00:50:29,251
It just happens.

819
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:31,211
Can you do it now?

820
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:33,922
I can't control it.

821
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,967
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right?

822
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,510
No, he can't.

823
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:41,429
He was using his hands.

824
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:43,348
Why are you like this?

825
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,767
I'm just saying
it was more of a crawl.

826
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,727
It was like a spider...

827
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:50,355
person.

828
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,158
I'm gonna be back
in a few hours.

829
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,453
Where are you going?

830
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:08,456
I need to check some things out
about all of this.

831
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,251
You can't just leave us here.

832
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,503
We'll be okay, Julia.
We don't need a babysitter.

833
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:15,523
Yeah, sure. Just three teenagers
alone in the woods.

834
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:17,632
Definitely not the opening
of a horror film.

835
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,843
You are way safer out here.

836
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:24,556
Just, you know,
be like a Girl Scout girl.

837
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,600
Be that. Just be that.

838
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,768
Can you bring us
some sandwiches?

839
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,853
Cassie.

840
00:51:32,564 --> 00:51:33,940
Can we trust you?

841
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:37,319
Three hours. Okay?

842
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:40,572
Just stay here.
And don't do anything dumb.

843
00:51:44,993 --> 00:51:48,204
Seriously. Don't do dumb things.

844
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,834
She was talking to you.

845
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:55,003
Okay, well,
you're just a bitch, so...

846
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:03,428
I know tae kwon do.

847
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:05,096
You?

848
00:52:06,097 --> 00:52:08,266
Yeah, I had
a few rough years in school

849
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,643
when my parents were divorcing.

850
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,021
So I wanted to feel like I could
fight back if I needed to.

851
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,653
That's what I thought.

852
00:53:33,101 --> 00:53:34,477
One second, cat.

853
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:38,982
Come on.

854
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:45,488
Research on Amazonian spiders...

855
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:49,451
peptides, more peptides.

856
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:50,911
Come on. Where is it?

857
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,706
Spider people.

858
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:56,917
<i>Las Arañas.</i>

859
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:00,295
Have you ever heard
of <i>Las Arañas?</i>

860
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,006
Me neither.

861
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,886
"According to local folklore...

862
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:12,724
"they possess powers
derived from spider venom...

863
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:17,646
"and are incredibly fast,
incredibly strong...

864
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:20,941
"and they can
climb like spiders."

865
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:24,611
Just like ceiling guy.

866
00:54:31,076 --> 00:54:32,577
How would you know...

867
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:36,539
if you could climb a wall
if you've never tried?

868
00:54:53,473 --> 00:54:55,892
Okay, let's not
mention that to anybody.

869
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:08,029
<i>"Las Arañas</i> are said to possess
a sixth sense...

870
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,241
"as if they had the ability
to glimpse the future."

871
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,423
Oh, my God.

872
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,568
Hey, who's got the jerky?

873
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:47,652
You ate it all.

874
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:49,988
I had, like, three pieces.

875
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:52,198
- Out of five.
- You counted?

876
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,242
You also ate all mine.

877
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:58,288
- What's this?
- Stop.

878
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,539
Stop. Just...

879
00:56:00,665 --> 00:56:01,666
Jeez.

880
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,337
Okay, forget jerky.

881
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:08,715
Did you guys see that diner
like a half-mile down the road?

882
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,234
Let's just go there
and get real food.

883
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:12,677
- Cassie told us to stay here.
- Come on, Julia.

884
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:13,887
She bailed on us.

885
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,097
We don't have any money, genius.

886
00:56:16,181 --> 00:56:17,933
Well, I have money, so...

887
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,402
You have money
so we should do what you want?

888
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,978
You got something to say?

889
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:25,482
You know,
I bet your dad is a senator

890
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:27,205
and your mom
sits on the board at the Met.

891
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:29,444
And you summer in the Hamptons
next to Martha Stewart.

892
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,446
So sad about Martha Stewart.

893
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,243
My parents are in Beijing...

894
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,637
where my dad
is raking in a ton of money

895
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:39,579
for making plastics
that pollute the ocean...

896
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,790
and my mom is spending it all
on hideous art.

897
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:43,250
So...

898
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,626
I talk to them on Mondays.

899
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:45,835
So who do you live with?

900
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,921
The housekeeper.

901
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:51,758
Well, on the upside, no curfew.

902
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,344
I bet you have
your own room at least.

903
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:58,139
I live with my dad and his wife
and their kid.

904
00:56:58,223 --> 00:57:00,475
- What about your mom?
- She's...

905
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,228
not really around.

906
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:04,604
She bailed on you?

907
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:07,774
Right. So, diner?

908
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,962
We spend some of Mattie's
daddy's pollution money?

909
00:57:10,986 --> 00:57:11,987
Yay.

910
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,155
I'm going to order
everything on the menu.

911
00:57:16,992 --> 00:57:18,159
Julia, you in?

912
00:57:19,828 --> 00:57:21,121
Hey.

913
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,789
We have
to take care of ourselves.

914
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:31,298
Yeah.

915
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:34,634
You're right.

916
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:37,470
Let's go do this.

917
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,141
She's kind of cute
when she's mad.

918
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,392
I heard that.

919
00:57:44,185 --> 00:57:46,521
You are making
the right decision, Julia.

920
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:48,315
You will not like me
when I'm hangry.

921
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:50,734
Who says we like you now?

922
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:53,653
God! I knew
we shouldn't have done this.

923
00:57:58,283 --> 00:57:59,409
Shit.

924
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:00,827
Do you think there's ticks?

925
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:03,705
Can we walk

926
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:05,415
- a little faster, please?
- Julia.

927
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:07,334
You said this was a shortcut.

928
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,544
Are we lost?
Do you know where you're going?

929
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,922
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah. Actually, I do.

930
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:16,009
Ow! Shit!

931
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:22,265
Okay. Don't talk
to anybody except to order.

932
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:23,910
We're in the middle of nowhere.

933
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,268
No one's gonna
track us down here.

934
00:58:25,352 --> 00:58:27,062
Just don't make eye contact.

935
00:58:27,646 --> 00:58:29,314
I hope they have cherry pie.

936
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:41,576
Let's sit at the bar.

937
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:49,668
There you go.

938
00:58:51,169 --> 00:58:52,170
Here.

939
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:54,839
Should we make a game plan?

940
00:58:54,923 --> 00:58:57,050
Eat first, strategise later.

941
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:01,846
Okay. Here you go.

942
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:05,767
Keep it coming.

943
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:09,604
Let's just eat quickly
and then get out of here.

944
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:11,147
Absolutely, great idea.

945
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,232
Right after cherry pie.

946
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,819
No. No cherry pie.

947
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,490
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

948
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:24,244
Yeah, whatever you guys
are arguing about...

949
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,038
I'm sure you're both
making really good points.

950
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:28,975
We have minestrone, we have clam
chowder, and we have tomato.

951
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,039
- Watch out, watch out.
- Ooh, she's lookin' at you.

952
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,091
We should go over there
and talk to them.

953
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:39,759
Really?

954
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:42,637
No. We...

955
00:59:42,721 --> 00:59:44,222
Should we? We can't.

956
00:59:44,306 --> 00:59:46,099
Come on. You know you want to.

957
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,183
No.

958
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,853
- This is not a good idea.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

959
00:59:49,936 --> 00:59:51,205
- What're you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

960
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:52,522
Just hold on a second.

961
00:59:52,606 --> 00:59:53,648
What is this?

962
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:54,733
Do you want the Reuben?

963
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,194
{\an8}It's just
a little confidence boost.

964
00:59:58,278 --> 00:59:59,905
This isn't really my style.

965
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,158
So what? You look cute. Come on.

966
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,660
This is not a good idea.
Seriously, guys.

967
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,370
Okay.

968
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:08,872
Hi. Hey, guys.

969
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,715
- I'm Mattie. This is Julia.
- Oh, hey. Good.

970
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:12,042
- Can we sit?
- Yeah, of course.

971
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:13,603
We've been
saving these seats for you.

972
01:00:13,627 --> 01:00:14,753
Awesome.

973
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:17,130
Oh, hey, what's up?
How you doin'?

974
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,214
Nice to meet you too.

975
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:19,299
<i>for your information.</i>

976
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,092
<i>Can you just
confirm your location?</i>

977
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:23,553
<i>4 Star Diner.
Daves Road, Route 206.</i>

978
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:24,739
- Hey.
<i>- Church Hill, New Jersey.</i>

979
01:00:24,763 --> 01:00:26,890
Possible sighting
in Church Hill, New Jersey.

980
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:28,975
<i>Connect me with
the Church Hill police dispatch.</i>

981
01:00:29,476 --> 01:00:30,894
Yeah. Patching you in now.

982
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:43,573
2-2-3 dispatch.
On scene at 4 Star Diner.

983
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:45,200
Route 206 at Daves Road.

984
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:46,576
<i>Go ahead, 2-2-3.</i>

985
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,078
No need to send backup.

986
01:00:50,497 --> 01:00:52,207
These aren't
our missing persons.

987
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,502
Code four. Repeat.

988
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,963
These are not
our missing persons.

989
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,516
Girls!

990
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,110
Girls!

991
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:25,991
Oh, God damn it.

992
01:01:44,009 --> 01:01:45,010
Girls!

993
01:01:53,768 --> 01:01:55,353
Let's go. Let's go!

994
01:01:55,854 --> 01:01:57,623
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

995
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,687
I know you know the words.

996
01:01:58,732 --> 01:02:00,692
- Come on, get up here.
- You should get up there.

997
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:02,569
So much
for not attracting attention.

998
01:02:12,537 --> 01:02:14,372
No. Please. Please, stop.

999
01:02:14,456 --> 01:02:15,957
Don't touch me, okay?

1000
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,292
Can you...

1001
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:19,461
What are you doing?

1002
01:02:19,544 --> 01:02:20,730
- What are you...
- What is that?

1003
01:02:20,754 --> 01:02:22,088
We have to go.

1004
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:26,885
I'm so sorry.

1005
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:30,722
Get down!

1006
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:33,743
- This isn't what you think.
- Get your stuff.

1007
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:34,809
You left us.

1008
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:37,479
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:02:40,232 --> 01:02:41,483
Julia!

1010
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:42,567
Julia!

1011
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,694
Julia, get back!

1012
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:56,957
Come on!

1013
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,166
No! Mattie!

1014
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,293
No.

1015
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:49,175
<i>This track is going to be huge.</i>

1016
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,469
<i>Are you in the zone?
This is Britney Spears.</i>

1017
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,349
Let's try that again.

1018
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,571
I love this song.

1019
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:14,075
Guys.

1020
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:16,870
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I have to dance.

1021
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,376
- Come on, Julia.
- Mattie, no.

1022
01:04:24,419 --> 01:04:25,879
Right. Okay.

1023
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,972
Oh, my God. Come on.

1024
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:41,311
Seriously, dude.

1025
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:53,615
Come on. Let's go.

1026
01:04:53,698 --> 01:04:55,593
Don't even pretend
that you're cooler than Britney.

1027
01:04:55,617 --> 01:04:56,660
I know you know the words.

1028
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:58,536
Come on, get up here.

1029
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,914
Hey!

1030
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,437
You should totally
get up there, dog.

1031
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,042
Come on.

1032
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:15,136
Hey!

1033
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:21,184
Guys. Guys, guys.
We have to go, we have to...

1034
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:31,611
Girls, get in! Get in! Get in!

1035
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:33,154
Leave everything. Run!

1036
01:05:33,947 --> 01:05:35,716
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!
- Mattie, come on!

1037
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,367
- Get in!
- I'm so sorry, Cassie.

1038
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:57,095
God!

1039
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,683
So much
for not needing a babysitter.

1040
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:04,019
Do you guys think of anybody
but yourselves?

1041
01:06:04,102 --> 01:06:06,146
You're so impulsive
and entitled,

1042
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:07,230
and you don't listen!

1043
01:06:07,314 --> 01:06:08,634
- We didn't mean to...
- Whatever!

1044
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,774
Don't even say anything!

1045
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:11,610
God!

1046
01:06:12,193 --> 01:06:13,904
Your futures were almost...

1047
01:06:14,696 --> 01:06:15,822
so different.

1048
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:19,409
You're lucky I saw them.

1049
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:20,619
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:21,703
Yes.

1051
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:25,790
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

1052
01:06:28,126 --> 01:06:29,127
God!

1053
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:54,569
Amaria, where did they go?

1054
01:06:54,653 --> 01:06:56,446
<i>I'm running checks now.</i>

1055
01:06:57,656 --> 01:06:59,449
I don't understand
how they're doing this.

1056
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:01,332
I've got a match on the woman
who's with them.

1057
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,036
I'm not interested in her.

1058
01:07:03,536 --> 01:07:05,372
Focus on finding those girls.

1059
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:06,706
Cassandra Webb.

1060
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:09,626
Daughter of Constance Webb, deceased.

1061
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:11,378
Did you say, "Webb"?

1062
01:07:12,754 --> 01:07:14,172
Yeah. Do you know her?

1063
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:15,674
That's not possible.

1064
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,261
Come on.

1065
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:26,017
He's not gonna stop
until he kills us, is he?

1066
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:29,980
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know anything.

1067
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:33,775
But you can see the future.

1068
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,195
Can't you stop him
with your visions?

1069
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:39,114
I don't know
how to control them.

1070
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,199
It's useless.

1071
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:43,076
Well, we're alive.
Maybe that's a plus.

1072
01:07:43,535 --> 01:07:44,536
Is your hand okay?

1073
01:07:46,288 --> 01:07:47,289
It's fine.

1074
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,459
First thing in the morning,
I'm taking you all home.

1075
01:07:54,796 --> 01:07:56,214
Your parents can deal with this.

1076
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:58,717
No, they can't.

1077
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:04,014
My mom's in a psych ward.

1078
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:08,202
She didn't really cope well
after my dad left...

1079
01:08:08,226 --> 01:08:10,937
and so, I got sent to live
with him and his new family...

1080
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:12,731
and I don't think
that they want me there.

1081
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:17,943
I wondered if they missed me...

1082
01:08:19,654 --> 01:08:20,864
if I ran away.

1083
01:08:22,616 --> 01:08:23,617
So you did.

1084
01:08:24,326 --> 01:08:25,660
My parents aren't around either.

1085
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:28,955
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

1086
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:30,600
I don't think they're gonna

1087
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:32,017
fly back from China
to deal with this.

1088
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,044
And I really
don't wanna find out, so...

1089
01:08:34,753 --> 01:08:35,754
I'm on my own.

1090
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:40,634
Well, fine.
Then you guys can just...

1091
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:43,637
- go to the police.
- No.

1092
01:08:47,182 --> 01:08:49,851
My dad got deported
six months ago.

1093
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,146
I came home from school,
and he was gone.

1094
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:54,688
What about your mom?

1095
01:08:54,773 --> 01:08:56,566
My mom died when I was five.

1096
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,235
It's just me and my dad.

1097
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:01,172
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers.

1098
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:03,114
So, I've just been
living by myself

1099
01:09:03,197 --> 01:09:04,366
at our apartment since then.

1100
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:05,450
You're on your own?

1101
01:09:06,785 --> 01:09:09,161
I don't need anyone else
to look out for me.

1102
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:12,609
And I don't
have a curfew, either.

1103
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:17,920
So, I can't go to the police.

1104
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:19,005
Okay?

1105
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:21,883
Until I'm 18, I can't exist.

1106
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:25,512
And there's no way
I'm getting deported too.

1107
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,931
Or going into the foster system.

1108
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:31,809
Well...

1109
01:09:33,103 --> 01:09:35,688
Foster system
isn't always that terrible.

1110
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,193
Things didn't turn out
so bad for me.

1111
01:09:41,736 --> 01:09:42,737
Right.

1112
01:09:46,116 --> 01:09:47,534
Cassie, please help us.

1113
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:12,304
No one survives once enough
poison enters their system.

1114
01:12:12,387 --> 01:12:14,264
You won't be so lucky next time.

1115
01:12:14,973 --> 01:12:16,600
Why are you doing this?

1116
01:12:17,475 --> 01:12:19,394
I need to stop them
from killing me.

1117
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:23,023
They're not killers.
They're just teenagers.

1118
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,275
In the future,
they become much more.

1119
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:29,571
In the future, they will destroy
me and everything I've built.

1120
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:32,782
Those girls cannot exist.

1121
01:12:33,742 --> 01:12:35,285
How come you get to decide?

1122
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:37,746
Because I'm the one
with the powers.

1123
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,170
If you knew what I knew,
you'd do the same thing.

1124
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:48,214
Would I?

1125
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:51,509
If I knew the price to pay
was the lives of three girls?

1126
01:12:51,593 --> 01:12:53,261
The only thing I know is that,

1127
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:55,555
in the future,
they also have powers.

1128
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,936
The girls? The girls have powers
in the future?

1129
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:03,271
Did you think you could beat me
with your mind?

1130
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:06,191
Your mother underestimated me.

1131
01:13:08,109 --> 01:13:09,402
The power of the spider.

1132
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:12,280
Don't make the same mistake.

1133
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:13,865
Tell me where they are!

1134
01:13:14,574 --> 01:13:15,854
They don't mean anything to you.

1135
01:13:17,452 --> 01:13:18,870
You could just walk away.

1136
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:16,344
What is this?

1137
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:21,933
Rise and shine.

1138
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:24,978
Okay, so this guy's hands

1139
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,647
somehow release
an acute neurotoxin...

1140
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:30,275
and it is painful. I was lucky.

1141
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:31,902
The longer he holds on to you,

1142
01:14:31,985 --> 01:14:34,070
the more poison
gets into your system.

1143
01:14:34,154 --> 01:14:35,155
Then what happens?

1144
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:37,908
Then your heart stops.

1145
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:42,537
But you can offset
cardiac arrest with CPR.

1146
01:14:43,163 --> 01:14:46,249
So you interlock your hands
like this.

1147
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,293
You lock your elbows...

1148
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:50,962
and then you place
the heel of your hand

1149
01:14:51,046 --> 01:14:53,298
right on the sternum. Okay?

1150
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:54,382
And then you pump.

1151
01:14:54,466 --> 01:14:56,718
And you wanna go,
like, two inches down.

1152
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:59,930
And you wanna keep
a rhythm like a heartbeat. Okay?

1153
01:15:00,555 --> 01:15:01,640
You ready?

1154
01:15:01,723 --> 01:15:03,850
Okay, begin compressions.
Go. Good.

1155
01:15:05,894 --> 01:15:07,229
Okay. And when do I stop?

1156
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:09,064
You don't stop.
If you stop, they die.

1157
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:11,358
And if you get tired,

1158
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:13,068
then you need
somebody to take over.

1159
01:15:13,902 --> 01:15:15,213
- I'm getting kinda tired.
- Okay.

1160
01:15:15,237 --> 01:15:17,322
- Anya, get ready to take over.
- Mmm-hmm.

1161
01:15:17,405 --> 01:15:20,283
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

1162
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,368
- Yeah.
- Ready?

1163
01:15:21,451 --> 01:15:22,702
- Yep.
- And go.

1164
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:28,124
Great. Nice, Mattie.

1165
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:29,209
Not cool.

1166
01:15:31,962 --> 01:15:33,797
Julia, you wanna take over?
Okay.

1167
01:15:35,006 --> 01:15:36,007
Get ready.

1168
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:41,263
Okay. One, two, three. Perfect.

1169
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:42,639
Nice job, Anya.

1170
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:47,352
I've never said this before
in my entire life...

1171
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,437
but you're a good teacher.

1172
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:55,569
Well, I've been
learning some things too.

1173
01:15:57,779 --> 01:15:59,072
About my mom.

1174
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,163
Wait, so you do know this guy.

1175
01:16:07,872 --> 01:16:09,374
My mom did. I think.

1176
01:16:09,457 --> 01:16:10,709
That's her.

1177
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,085
She's really pretty.

1178
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:18,216
So this is because of you?

1179
01:16:20,594 --> 01:16:23,513
All I know is that
she was researching spiders.

1180
01:16:24,472 --> 01:16:26,349
In her notebook,
there's some stuff...

1181
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:31,187
about a local tribe in Peru
that can do, like, crazy stuff.

1182
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:32,981
What kind of crazy stuff?

1183
01:16:34,482 --> 01:16:36,359
Climb like spiders.

1184
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:40,697
So is he one of them?

1185
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:43,116
I need more information.

1186
01:16:46,912 --> 01:16:47,913
You're leaving.

1187
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,127
I have to go and figure out
what is going on.

1188
01:16:54,628 --> 01:16:55,629
How?

1189
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:00,008
You have to go to Peru.

1190
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,471
I'll be gone a week.

1191
01:17:04,554 --> 01:17:05,555
I don't wanna leave them,

1192
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:07,033
but he's out there
looking for them...

1193
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:08,097
and they're relying on me,

1194
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:09,493
and I don't know how else
to protect them.

1195
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:11,811
Okay, look, I'm staying
with Mary for a few weeks

1196
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:13,021
while Richard's out of town.

1197
01:17:13,104 --> 01:17:15,232
He won't find them there.
But, Cassie...

1198
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:19,152
I can't pretend to understand
what's going on here.

1199
01:17:19,236 --> 01:17:21,613
Just be careful, okay?

1200
01:17:21,696 --> 01:17:22,948
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1201
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:25,033
Thank you, Ben.
You didn't ask for any of this.

1202
01:17:25,116 --> 01:17:26,952
Okay, well, neither did you.

1203
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:56,560
You have come back
looking for answers.

1204
01:20:00,605 --> 01:20:01,606
Back?

1205
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:03,775
I promised your mother
I would be here.

1206
01:20:07,237 --> 01:20:09,739
My mom thought
<i>Las Arañas</i> were a myth.

1207
01:20:09,823 --> 01:20:11,032
What do you think?

1208
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,743
I think she was crazy
for coming here alone.

1209
01:20:13,827 --> 01:20:15,245
She came here

1210
01:20:15,328 --> 01:20:18,123
hoping to extract healing
properties from the spiders.

1211
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:20,250
She thought
she was being protected.

1212
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:21,543
By Ezekiel Sims?

1213
01:20:21,626 --> 01:20:23,545
His motives were selfish.

1214
01:20:23,628 --> 01:20:25,422
He used your mom to find us.

1215
01:20:25,505 --> 01:20:27,132
But, because
he stole the spider...

1216
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:28,341
he was cursed.

1217
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:32,053
And he's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

1218
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,562
This is where my mom died?

1219
01:20:41,438 --> 01:20:43,064
And where you were born.

1220
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:51,823
I don't understand why
she risked my life to come here.

1221
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:54,951
To see the future clearly...

1222
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:57,245
you have
to heal the wounds of your past.

1223
01:20:57,329 --> 01:20:58,371
That sounds like literally

1224
01:20:58,455 --> 01:21:00,790
every therapy session
I've ever avoided.

1225
01:21:00,874 --> 01:21:03,335
You have to go
back to your beginning

1226
01:21:03,418 --> 01:21:04,711
and keep going past that.

1227
01:21:04,794 --> 01:21:05,837
There are powers

1228
01:21:05,921 --> 01:21:08,089
you don't even know
you're capable of.

1229
01:21:09,257 --> 01:21:12,385
Your thread did not start
when you were born.

1230
01:21:16,097 --> 01:21:17,265
Do you trust me?

1231
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:21,645
Not really sure at this point
I have a choice.

1232
01:21:30,195 --> 01:21:31,529
<i>You could just walk away.</i>

1233
01:21:31,613 --> 01:21:34,115
<i>Your thread did not start
when you were born.</i>

1234
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:37,285
<i>They're almost
impossible to find.</i>

1235
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:40,622
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

1236
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:41,915
<i>Not when I'm this close.</i>

1237
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:43,416
But I'm not
gonna let her do that.

1238
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,585
Why did you hate me so much?

1239
01:21:45,669 --> 01:21:46,670
Thank you.

1240
01:21:46,753 --> 01:21:48,004
<i>For the umbrella.</i>

1241
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:50,423
<i>- Give it to me.
- No.</i>

1242
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:52,175
I found it.

1243
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:53,260
I found the spider.

1244
01:21:54,135 --> 01:21:55,553
Incredible, isn't it?

1245
01:21:57,639 --> 01:21:59,558
- Give it to me.
- No, please.

1246
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:00,642
Give it to me.

1247
01:22:00,725 --> 01:22:01,786
<i>You're making
the wrong decision.</i>

1248
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:04,170
- You could just walk away.
<i>- No, you're making the wrong...</i>

1249
01:22:16,366 --> 01:22:18,743
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm...

1250
01:22:19,536 --> 01:22:22,205
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1251
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:26,167
Las Arañas <i>could not stand by.</i>

1252
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:28,878
<i>We tried to save you both.</i>

1253
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:48,732
Her journey will not be easy...

1254
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:51,276
but she is strong.

1255
01:23:00,285 --> 01:23:02,495
Your test results came back.

1256
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:03,663
I'm sorry to tell you

1257
01:23:03,747 --> 01:23:06,333
that your baby has
myasthenia gravis.

1258
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,419
It's a genetic
neuromuscular disorder.

1259
01:23:09,502 --> 01:23:11,212
<i>But I don't have
a neuromuscular disorder.</i>

1260
01:23:11,296 --> 01:23:14,007
Life expectancy varies.

1261
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,842
Do you need a tissue?

1262
01:23:15,926 --> 01:23:17,636
No. No. I need a cure.

1263
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:20,221
I'm afraid there is no cure.

1264
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,891
Single target
nucleotide intervention.

1265
01:23:23,391 --> 01:23:24,809
<i>It's experimental...</i>

1266
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:27,312
but there are some promising
leads in the Amazon.

1267
01:23:27,395 --> 01:23:29,022
That's why you went there?

1268
01:23:29,522 --> 01:23:30,523
For me?

1269
01:23:30,607 --> 01:23:33,026
I have to advise you against
travelling in your condition.

1270
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:36,112
I'm sorry, what are you offering
besides tissues?

1271
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:38,031
I know this is hard to accept.

1272
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:39,616
No, no, I am...

1273
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:43,703
I'm unwilling to accept
a diagnosis of helplessness.

1274
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:47,040
And I'm not gonna
teach my daughter to either.

1275
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:57,676
You did it.

1276
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:00,637
You did it.

1277
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:04,015
I never knew I was sick.

1278
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:07,227
The spider venom
did have healing properties.

1279
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:12,649
I'm so sorry I spent so long
being mad at you.

1280
01:24:57,319 --> 01:24:59,571
I always thought my mom
didn't care about me.

1281
01:25:00,322 --> 01:25:03,909
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for those you love.

1282
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:10,206
I was there.
I was in the room...

1283
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:13,251
I was in the room with her.
How did you do that?

1284
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,711
<i>You</i> did that.

1285
01:25:14,794 --> 01:25:17,756
Now you're starting to see
what you're capable of.

1286
01:25:17,839 --> 01:25:20,842
You came here to learn the truth
about your past.

1287
01:25:21,635 --> 01:25:23,970
But you will leave ready
to embrace your future.

1288
01:25:25,722 --> 01:25:28,558
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

1289
01:25:28,642 --> 01:25:31,645
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

1290
01:25:31,728 --> 01:25:33,355
But I can't do what he can do.

1291
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:37,901
I can't do the leapy, crawly,
like, death poison.

1292
01:25:37,984 --> 01:25:40,946
You didn't get the gift of
the greater physical strength...

1293
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:43,365
or the ability
to release poison...

1294
01:25:43,448 --> 01:25:48,161
but seeing into the future
is only the start.

1295
01:25:48,245 --> 01:25:50,956
Your mind
has infinite potential.

1296
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:54,376
If you master your power,
you can use the web...

1297
01:25:54,459 --> 01:25:57,545
to be in more than one place
at the same time.

1298
01:25:58,171 --> 01:26:01,341
You are the only one
who can change the future.

1299
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:05,011
And when you take on
the responsibility...

1300
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:08,390
great power will come.

1301
01:26:25,657 --> 01:26:26,908
Every day that goes by,

1302
01:26:26,992 --> 01:26:29,327
my appointment with death
gets closer.

1303
01:26:30,662 --> 01:26:32,372
And you still
have found nothing?

1304
01:26:32,956 --> 01:26:33,957
How can she have kept

1305
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,167
three teenagers
hidden for a week?

1306
01:26:36,251 --> 01:26:38,086
I'm running checks
every three minutes,

1307
01:26:38,169 --> 01:26:39,963
scanning CCTV camera.

1308
01:26:40,046 --> 01:26:41,047
I have hacked

1309
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:42,882
police and emergency services
frequencies.

1310
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:44,884
I have eyes
on all of their houses,

1311
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:46,845
including friends and family.

1312
01:26:48,763 --> 01:26:49,806
Still nothing.

1313
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,892
Do you understand?

1314
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,269
Huh?

1315
01:26:54,352 --> 01:26:56,479
Those girls cannot exist.

1316
01:26:56,563 --> 01:26:58,273
They will try to destroy me,

1317
01:26:58,356 --> 01:27:01,067
as I will you
if you don't find them.

1318
01:27:02,861 --> 01:27:04,279
She can't hide them forever.

1319
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,911
Okay, it's still
pretty quiet out there.

1320
01:27:11,786 --> 01:27:13,496
- What'd I miss?
- Ben said words.

1321
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,332
- Oh, boring.
- Okay, let's try and remember

1322
01:27:15,415 --> 01:27:16,475
- to pick up...
- Nice nails.

1323
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:17,685
- After ourselves. Okay, guys?
- Thank you.

1324
01:27:17,709 --> 01:27:18,853
- Hey!
- I mean, this is really...

1325
01:27:18,877 --> 01:27:19,979
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rude!

1326
01:27:20,003 --> 01:27:21,355
- All right, throwing popcorn...
- Guys?

1327
01:27:21,379 --> 01:27:22,979
- Is super fun.
- I cannot wait for that.

1328
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:24,859
- But I also think...
- Guys, either I peed myself...

1329
01:27:24,883 --> 01:27:26,760
or my water broke.

1330
01:27:29,137 --> 01:27:30,221
Ew!

1331
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:31,908
Well, honestly,
you probably peed yourself...

1332
01:27:31,932 --> 01:27:33,683
because that isn't
supposed to happen yet.

1333
01:27:33,767 --> 01:27:34,768
Richard's not here,

1334
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:37,562
and the baby
isn't due for four weeks.

1335
01:27:37,646 --> 01:27:40,023
I don't think the baby
got the memo, Ben.

1336
01:27:40,106 --> 01:27:41,316
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1337
01:27:41,733 --> 01:27:44,653
Looks like we may have to wait
a little while for...

1338
01:27:45,862 --> 01:27:46,863
the ambulance.

1339
01:27:46,947 --> 01:27:48,949
The baby is not waiting.

1340
01:27:49,032 --> 01:27:51,243
He's coming now.

1341
01:27:51,326 --> 01:27:52,327
Now.

1342
01:27:53,161 --> 01:27:55,163
Like, here? In the dining room?

1343
01:27:55,247 --> 01:27:57,958
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

1344
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,042
Okay.

1345
01:28:01,378 --> 01:28:02,379
Get in the car.

1346
01:28:06,049 --> 01:28:07,050
Keep your head down.

1347
01:28:11,471 --> 01:28:12,472
It's gonna be okay.

1348
01:28:13,765 --> 01:28:14,766
Okay. Come on.

1349
01:28:14,849 --> 01:28:15,850
Okay, okay.

1350
01:28:18,812 --> 01:28:19,813
Everyone okay?

1351
01:28:20,272 --> 01:28:21,773
Okay, seat belts, everybody.

1352
01:28:22,357 --> 01:28:23,358
Seriously?

1353
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:25,193
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1354
01:28:25,277 --> 01:28:26,403
Never mind.

1355
01:28:30,365 --> 01:28:32,284
All right, let's step on it.

1356
01:28:50,218 --> 01:28:52,053
<i>10-58 in progress. 30-relo-5.</i>

1357
01:28:52,137 --> 01:28:53,138
I might have something.

1358
01:28:53,221 --> 01:28:54,389
<i>Woman in labour.</i>

1359
01:28:55,599 --> 01:28:57,142
<i>20-Edward copy. En route.</i>

1360
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:58,393
<i>- 13-Edward, go ahead.
- 10-4.</i>

1361
01:28:58,476 --> 01:28:59,519
<i>Possible D&D in progress.</i>

1362
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:03,064
I've intercepted
a call to the hospital.

1363
01:29:03,148 --> 01:29:04,149
St Timothy's.

1364
01:29:04,232 --> 01:29:05,400
Track the route.

1365
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:06,484
Tracking.

1366
01:29:44,522 --> 01:29:45,523
<i>The baby is not waiting.</i>

1367
01:29:45,607 --> 01:29:47,247
<i>doesn't get me
to the hospital, then...</i>

1368
01:29:47,275 --> 01:29:48,315
<i>Get out, get out, get out!</i>

1369
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,653
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!</i>

1370
01:29:50,028 --> 01:29:51,029
<i>What? What?</i>

1371
01:29:51,655 --> 01:29:52,822
<i>Mattie, Mattie, Mattie!</i>

1372
01:29:52,906 --> 01:29:53,907
Shit!

1373
01:30:05,877 --> 01:30:07,087
Sorry, guys.

1374
01:30:10,298 --> 01:30:11,299
Hey!

1375
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:16,930
Thank you.

1376
01:30:22,686 --> 01:30:23,895
So the last one was

1377
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:26,606
three minutes and 24 seconds
after the previous one.

1378
01:30:27,566 --> 01:30:28,567
So that means

1379
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,570
the time between contractions
is reducing at a rate of...

1380
01:30:32,696 --> 01:30:34,281
21.6 seconds.

1381
01:30:35,782 --> 01:30:37,325
That's pretty fast.

1382
01:30:38,034 --> 01:30:39,762
You better hurry up 'cause
I'm not sticking around...

1383
01:30:39,786 --> 01:30:40,826
- if it gets gross.
- Okay.

1384
01:30:41,496 --> 01:30:43,331
<i>He's heading southwest
on Vernon Avenue.</i>

1385
01:30:43,415 --> 01:30:45,917
I'll cut them off at
the Second Avenue intersection.

1386
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:47,627
Drive faster.

1387
01:30:47,711 --> 01:30:50,088
Let's go. Let's go, please.

1388
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,223
Hack into traffic control.

1389
01:31:01,224 --> 01:31:02,434
<i>Turn the lights green.</i>

1390
01:31:04,311 --> 01:31:05,645
<i>Amaria, now.</i>

1391
01:31:05,729 --> 01:31:07,439
Turning all traffic lights
to green.

1392
01:31:10,817 --> 01:31:12,235
Why is no one stopping? Hey!

1393
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:13,570
Ben, watch out!

1394
01:31:15,155 --> 01:31:16,716
- They're not stopping.
- What's happening?

1395
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,866
Whoa, whoa.

1396
01:31:18,658 --> 01:31:19,659
Ben!

1397
01:31:22,537 --> 01:31:23,538
Everyone okay?

1398
01:31:23,622 --> 01:31:24,623
Yeah.

1399
01:31:24,706 --> 01:31:25,999
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1400
01:31:26,082 --> 01:31:27,083
I'm fine.

1401
01:31:32,422 --> 01:31:33,506
What is that?

1402
01:31:37,552 --> 01:31:39,137
Oh, my God, it's him.

1403
01:31:39,888 --> 01:31:40,889
Guys.

1404
01:31:53,568 --> 01:31:54,921
- Ben, go, go, go!
- Everybody get out right now!

1405
01:31:54,945 --> 01:31:56,425
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Go, go!

1406
01:32:27,519 --> 01:32:28,520
Cassie!

1407
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,620
Get out. Go on.
Get in the ambulance. Go.

1408
01:32:30,689 --> 01:32:32,148
- Come on.
- It's not over. Go.

1409
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:35,443
Ben, I need you to get Mary
as far away from us as possible.

1410
01:32:35,527 --> 01:32:37,821
Okay? Ezekiel,
he won't care about you now.

1411
01:32:37,904 --> 01:32:39,197
Well, what about you?

1412
01:32:39,823 --> 01:32:41,950
I liked it better
when you didn't make plans.

1413
01:33:05,098 --> 01:33:06,224
You're showing off.

1414
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:08,351
Not yet.

1415
01:33:09,269 --> 01:33:10,645
I think we lost him.

1416
01:33:15,942 --> 01:33:17,944
Get in the back
and charge the AED.

1417
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:19,738
- For what?
- Just do it. Go.

1418
01:33:22,282 --> 01:33:23,867
Okay, press "charge."

1419
01:33:24,284 --> 01:33:25,577
Am I having a heart attack?

1420
01:33:26,578 --> 01:33:27,722
I think
I'm having a heart attack.

1421
01:33:27,746 --> 01:33:29,205
You're not gonna
have a heart attack.

1422
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:30,457
Hey, man!

1423
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,167
Okay, get ready.

1424
01:33:33,919 --> 01:33:35,462
Get it close to the ceiling.

1425
01:33:35,545 --> 01:33:37,464
Nobody touch the sides
or anything.

1426
01:33:38,924 --> 01:33:40,258
- Ready?
- Okay. Yep, yep.

1427
01:33:43,511 --> 01:33:44,971
Wait. Wait.

1428
01:33:45,722 --> 01:33:47,098
Now.

1429
01:33:54,522 --> 01:33:55,690
Sorry.

1430
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:56,900
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1431
01:33:56,983 --> 01:33:58,276
- You okay?
- You okay?

1432
01:34:00,904 --> 01:34:01,905
Okay.

1433
01:34:03,031 --> 01:34:04,241
Now you're showing off.

1434
01:34:05,116 --> 01:34:06,117
Maybe a little.

1435
01:34:36,022 --> 01:34:37,023
Now what?

1436
01:34:37,857 --> 01:34:39,359
<i>Those girls cannot exist.</i>

1437
01:34:39,442 --> 01:34:41,003
<i>- doesn't look safe.
- It's a death trap.</i>

1438
01:34:41,027 --> 01:34:42,237
<i>infinite potential.</i>

1439
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:44,656
<i>This place has
always been a death trap.</i>

1440
01:34:44,739 --> 01:34:46,032
<i>packed with explosives.</i>

1441
01:34:46,116 --> 01:34:47,325
<i>Get down!</i>

1442
01:34:49,452 --> 01:34:50,453
<i>Go! Run!</i>

1443
01:34:52,205 --> 01:34:53,456
<i>Jump! Come on!</i>

1444
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:54,666
<i>Get in the helicopter.</i>

1445
01:35:02,048 --> 01:35:05,385
I have a code 30. PD-36-307.

1446
01:35:05,468 --> 01:35:08,388
Requesting airlift support.
Dockside, Queens.

1447
01:35:09,389 --> 01:35:10,390
<i>Copy that.</i>

1448
01:35:10,849 --> 01:35:11,850
Okay.

1449
01:35:16,104 --> 01:35:17,439
It's gonna get a little crazy.

1450
01:35:17,522 --> 01:35:18,940
It's already crazy.

1451
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:20,609
You didn't bail on us.

1452
01:35:21,443 --> 01:35:22,485
Whatever happens,

1453
01:35:22,569 --> 01:35:24,154
I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

1454
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:26,239
We'll protect each other.

1455
01:35:26,323 --> 01:35:27,483
Yeah, we're in this together.

1456
01:35:28,074 --> 01:35:29,075
Right?

1457
01:35:29,534 --> 01:35:30,535
Yeah.

1458
01:35:31,661 --> 01:35:33,288
Okay. We are still
not doing a high five.

1459
01:35:34,414 --> 01:35:36,333
I know. It's not cool.

1460
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:37,792
Let's go. Out the back.

1461
01:35:37,876 --> 01:35:39,002
- What?
- Go, go, go.

1462
01:35:49,888 --> 01:35:51,514
This doesn't look safe.

1463
01:35:51,598 --> 01:35:54,517
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

1464
01:35:54,601 --> 01:35:56,436
That doesn't <i>sound</i> safe.

1465
01:35:56,519 --> 01:35:58,063
It's a death trap.

1466
01:35:58,897 --> 01:36:00,440
And that's a good thing?

1467
01:36:00,523 --> 01:36:02,359
As long as we're not the ones
who get trapped.

1468
01:36:03,818 --> 01:36:05,320
No matter what happens...

1469
01:36:05,403 --> 01:36:07,822
we need to work together, okay?

1470
01:36:09,491 --> 01:36:11,451
We're listening this time,
Cassie.

1471
01:36:11,534 --> 01:36:13,328
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

1472
01:36:14,162 --> 01:36:15,163
Are we ready?

1473
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:23,463
We have to get to the roof.
He's gonna be here any minute.

1474
01:36:23,546 --> 01:36:25,799
Here. Take these.

1475
01:36:25,882 --> 01:36:28,134
Put them in
as many crates as you can.

1476
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:34,140
Okay?

1477
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:36,518
You two, go that way.

1478
01:36:36,601 --> 01:36:38,311
We need to slow him down.

1479
01:36:38,395 --> 01:36:40,647
- Mattie, this way.
- You come with me. Come on.

1480
01:36:46,278 --> 01:36:47,445
I got this one.

1481
01:36:48,071 --> 01:36:49,364
Come on, Julia. Let's go.

1482
01:37:02,085 --> 01:37:03,169
Anya, go.

1483
01:37:06,881 --> 01:37:07,924
Go.

1484
01:37:19,352 --> 01:37:21,897
Go straight ahead.
When I say "now," get down.

1485
01:37:26,776 --> 01:37:28,778
What do you mean?
It's a dead end.

1486
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:32,449
Now!

1487
01:37:36,202 --> 01:37:37,329
Whoa!

1488
01:37:37,412 --> 01:37:38,413
Go! Run!

1489
01:37:39,706 --> 01:37:41,124
Now you're really showing off.

1490
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:42,834
Come on, upstairs.

1491
01:37:54,512 --> 01:37:55,764
I knew. I knew she had a plan.

1492
01:37:55,847 --> 01:37:56,848
- Hey!
- Hey!

1493
01:37:57,349 --> 01:37:58,350
- Hey!
- We're here!

1494
01:37:58,808 --> 01:38:00,185
Down here!

1495
01:38:01,853 --> 01:38:04,147
<i>Make your way to the south side.</i>

1496
01:38:06,608 --> 01:38:07,651
Come on.

1497
01:38:10,612 --> 01:38:11,780
Wait. Get down!

1498
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:16,910
Let's go. He said south side.
We can go this way.

1499
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:19,120
Anya, stop!

1500
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,465
- Let's go!
- Mattie!

1501
01:38:38,181 --> 01:38:39,975
- We need to go this way.
- Go down here.

1502
01:38:40,058 --> 01:38:41,476
Get down!

1503
01:38:43,228 --> 01:38:45,063
Go to the ladder. Go!

1504
01:38:47,107 --> 01:38:48,108
Come on, come on!

1505
01:38:52,737 --> 01:38:54,072
<i>Use the web.</i>

1506
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:08,712
Get to the helicopter.

1507
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:11,464
- Hey!
- Wait! Girls! Get down!

1508
01:39:13,717 --> 01:39:16,803
<i>It's not safe to land.
You'll have to get higher.</i>

1509
01:39:16,886 --> 01:39:18,179
Guys, this way.

1510
01:39:18,263 --> 01:39:20,265
We can get to the chopper
from up there.

1511
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:26,146
Anya, jump.

1512
01:39:27,647 --> 01:39:29,441
Jump now! Julia, get back!

1513
01:39:36,823 --> 01:39:37,824
Julia, get down!

1514
01:39:50,754 --> 01:39:51,755
Oh, God!

1515
01:39:52,839 --> 01:39:54,341
You should have walked away.

1516
01:39:56,593 --> 01:39:57,719
You can't protect them.

1517
01:39:57,802 --> 01:39:58,803
Cassie!

1518
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,477
Over here, asshole.

1519
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:09,522
Mattie!

1520
01:40:20,116 --> 01:40:21,618
Don't hurt her!

1521
01:40:29,084 --> 01:40:30,210
Anya!

1522
01:40:33,046 --> 01:40:34,381
Cassie!

1523
01:40:51,982 --> 01:40:53,441
You can't save all three.

1524
01:40:56,319 --> 01:40:58,572
<i>And when you take on
the responsibility...</i>

1525
01:40:59,197 --> 01:41:00,991
<i>great power will come.</i>

1526
01:41:07,455 --> 01:41:09,833
Julia, I got you.

1527
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:10,917
Come on.

1528
01:41:12,335 --> 01:41:14,546
Mattie. You're gonna be okay.

1529
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:16,548
Anya. Anya, give me your hand.

1530
01:41:48,204 --> 01:41:50,248
You still can't beat me
with your mind.

1531
01:41:53,835 --> 01:41:55,337
What makes you so sure?

1532
01:42:02,677 --> 01:42:04,679
Come on. Come on, come on.

1533
01:42:04,763 --> 01:42:06,139
You're just like your mother.

1534
01:42:06,223 --> 01:42:07,974
Yes, I am.

1535
01:42:30,747 --> 01:42:32,707
You've been trying
to change your future.

1536
01:42:34,459 --> 01:42:36,711
But the girls
were never your future.

1537
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,422
I was.

1538
01:42:53,478 --> 01:42:55,355
No!

1539
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:20,255
No. Cassie!

1540
01:44:14,017 --> 01:44:15,310
She's not breathing.

1541
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:17,273
- Her heart's not beating.
- We know what to do.

1542
01:44:17,771 --> 01:44:18,772
Beginning compressions.

1543
01:44:19,898 --> 01:44:22,317
Interlock your fingers.
Come back, Cassie.

1544
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,693
Come on, guys. Come on!

1545
01:44:25,278 --> 01:44:26,821
Keep going. We don't stop.

1546
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:28,740
Come on, Cassie.

1547
01:44:29,824 --> 01:44:31,034
I'm getting a little tired.

1548
01:44:31,117 --> 01:44:32,452
Okay. I'm right here.

1549
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,955
Cassie, wake up! Please.

1550
01:44:35,038 --> 01:44:36,706
- Cassie!
- Come back, Cassie.

1551
01:44:38,541 --> 01:44:40,335
We're here, Cassie.
We're not leaving you.

1552
01:44:41,044 --> 01:44:42,964
Cassie, you got this.
Please. I need you. Please.

1553
01:44:45,298 --> 01:44:46,508
Oh, my God!

1554
01:44:47,217 --> 01:44:48,218
Cassie.

1555
01:44:49,552 --> 01:44:51,137
- It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1556
01:44:51,221 --> 01:44:52,222
Oh, my God. We did it.

1557
01:44:57,227 --> 01:44:58,478
We did it.

1558
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:20,584
Hi.

1559
01:45:23,044 --> 01:45:24,296
Hello.

1560
01:45:24,379 --> 01:45:25,380
Hi.

1561
01:45:27,674 --> 01:45:29,384
Oh, he's perfect.

1562
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,261
He is.

1563
01:45:31,761 --> 01:45:33,388
- He's perfect.
- Yeah.

1564
01:45:41,104 --> 01:45:42,397
We're still here, Cassie.

1565
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:44,691
Yeah. We're not leaving you.

1566
01:45:45,692 --> 01:45:46,693
I wouldn't be here

1567
01:45:46,776 --> 01:45:48,194
if it weren't
for the three of you.

1568
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:50,196
Right back at ya.

1569
01:45:50,697 --> 01:45:51,698
Ben said to tell you

1570
01:45:51,781 --> 01:45:53,199
that the baby
is doing really well.

1571
01:45:53,992 --> 01:45:55,577
And he's loving being an uncle.

1572
01:45:56,703 --> 01:45:59,706
Yeah. All the fun
and none of the responsibility.

1573
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:02,292
That's what he thinks.

1574
01:46:05,503 --> 01:46:07,839
Are you all immediate family?

1575
01:46:08,298 --> 01:46:09,507
Yes.

1576
01:46:10,717 --> 01:46:12,135
They're all mine.

1577
01:46:19,226 --> 01:46:20,727
Can we get you anything?

1578
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,811
No.

1579
01:46:22,729 --> 01:46:24,814
I have everything I need
right here.

1580
01:46:54,469 --> 01:46:55,470
No.

1581
01:46:59,057 --> 01:47:02,269
You left your junk mail
downstairs again.

1582
01:47:02,352 --> 01:47:05,522
And we got takeout.
But we didn't know...

1583
01:47:05,605 --> 01:47:07,232
Kung Pao chicken is perfect.

01:47:07,315 --> 01:47:08,608
How'd you know?

1585
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:10,443
Bless you, Anya.

1586
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:11,528
What?

1587
01:47:14,072 --> 01:47:15,073
Thank you.

1588
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:19,911
Mattie!

1589
01:47:19,995 --> 01:47:22,414
What? I told you I'm starving.

1590
01:47:22,497 --> 01:47:24,165
And I told you guys
that you wouldn't...

1591
01:47:24,249 --> 01:47:26,001
wouldn't like you
if you were hangry.

1592
01:47:26,084 --> 01:47:27,877
Well, you wouldn't, so...

1593
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:30,171
How's your eyesight?

1594
01:47:30,714 --> 01:47:32,382
I can see better
than I ever have.

1595
01:47:32,465 --> 01:47:33,466
Oh, yeah?

1596
01:47:34,092 --> 01:47:36,386
Can you see us in the future?

1597
01:47:37,304 --> 01:47:38,430
Yes.

1598
01:47:39,681 --> 01:47:40,891
I can see you.

1599
01:47:42,809 --> 01:47:44,769
<i>Standing up
for what you believe.</i>

1600
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,610
<i>Never giving up.</i>

1601
01:47:57,157 --> 01:48:00,076
<i>Discovering you were always
more powerful than you thought.</i>

1602
01:48:01,828 --> 01:48:03,622
Nothing I didn't already know.

1603
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:07,751
I don't know about you two...

1604
01:48:08,335 --> 01:48:10,545
but that totally
makes sense to me.

1605
01:48:11,129 --> 01:48:13,048
- What? I'm serious.
- Wow.

1606
01:48:15,634 --> 01:48:17,135
What? I'm being serious.

1607
01:48:21,056 --> 01:48:23,391
Oh, wow. Okay. Wow.

1608
01:48:32,692 --> 01:48:34,236
<i>Whatever the future holds...</i>

1609
01:48:40,283 --> 01:48:41,493
<i>we'll be ready.</i>

1610
01:48:43,787 --> 01:48:45,664
<i>And you know the best thing
about the future?</i>

1611
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:49,709
<i>It hasn't happened yet.</i>
