1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,270
[upbeat rock music playing]

2
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,220
[PJ] {\i1}Tonight is{\i0}
{\i1}the fucking night, okay?{\i0}

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,850
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,810
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,020
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,480
We're getting out there.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,020
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,730
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

9
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,400
Man, speak for yourself.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,530
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,990
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,450
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,530
I think that it's time.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,740
Oh, really? It's time?

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,990
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,540
we've all been going
to school together?

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,830
I've been building tension.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,210
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,330
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,830
And just what would I say?

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,300
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,130
How's his penis?

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,130
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,840
They could have broken up,
you never know.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,310
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,560
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,560
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,860
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,070
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,530
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,610
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,820
It's probably white, okay?

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,330
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,410
What the fuck happened to her?

36
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,950
She's washed up.

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,920
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

38
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,040
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,630
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,130
Josie, tick-tock.

41
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,220
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,180
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

43
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,430
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

44
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,510
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

45
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,100
I might have a good shot
that way.

46
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,540
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,290
What the fuck are you wearing?

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,570
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

49
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,360
I think you wanna be here.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,780
Who said that?

51
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,280
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,450
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,950
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,830
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,120
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,420
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,000
You have Munchausen's.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,710
Look, just follow my lead.

59
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,090
- Hello, ladies.
- [girl 1] Oh.

60
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,420
[girl 2 chuckles] Oh.
You know what?

61
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,670
- Just keep going.
- [PJ] How was your summer?

62
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,470
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

63
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,930
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,930
This school has such
a gay problem.

65
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

66
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,100
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,020
Like, look at Matthieu.

68
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,810
[boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.

69
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,110
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,920
- Thanks, bitch.
- [Matthieu and boy chuckle]

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,110
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,610
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

73
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,580
- Every show.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,910
- [Isabel giggles]
- [PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.

75
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,090
Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,310
- [gentle music playing]
- [laughing]

77
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,970
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

78
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,510
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

80
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,910
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

81
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,350
yeah, it was good.

82
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,770
What are you guys doing here?

83
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,850
You guys never come
to the fair.

84
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,150
What happened to your arm?

85
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,520
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,980
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

87
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,150
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

88
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,860
[Josie] No, I just tripped
and I--

89
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,870
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

90
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,410
Did you go to juvie?

91
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,040
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- [man] {\i1}Ladies and gentlemen...{\i0}

92
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,580
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ... {\i1}it's time to get ready,{\i0}

93
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,250
{\i1}get wild, and get horny{\i0}
{\i1}for our very own Vikings!{\i0}

94
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,080
Oh, my God, what did you do?

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,670
- [Josie yelping]
- [man] {\i1}And the man{\i0}
{\i1}who will lead us to victory{\i0}

96
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,760
{\i1}against the evil, maniacal,{\i0}

97
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,130
{\i1}shit-eating{\i0}
{\i1}Huntington Ferrets,{\i0}

98
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,550
{\i1}let's hear it for Jeff!{\i0}

99
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,220
[girl 3] Jeff! Have my babies!

100
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,930
[girl 4] Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

101
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,390
- [crowd cheers]
- [PJ groans]

102
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,930
[PJ] I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

103
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,730
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

104
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,250
What's the grossest animal?

105
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,270
[girl 5] Jeff,
come sign my tits!

106
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,500
- [whistle blows]
- [girl 6] Eat my pussy!

107
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
That's right.

108
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,450
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

109
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,660
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,160
- Take this.
- [Josie] No.

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,660
Really quick.
This is the moment.

112
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
Stop yelling at me!

113
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,890
Could you give that back
really quickly?

114
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,670
[PJ] I am loving all the...

116
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,420
holes in your pants.

117
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,550
Thanks.

118
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,550
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

119
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,680
[PJ] Thank you.

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,010
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

121
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,060
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

122
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,560
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- [Brittany] No, not that.

123
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,190
[PJ] Brittany.

124
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,690
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

125
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,190
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

126
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,270
I need to pull trig.

127
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,780
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

128
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,990
I'm gonna say something crazy.

129
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,610
I think you could eat food,

130
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,200
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

131
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,530
Mmm, gross.

132
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,200
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,500
- [Brittany] Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

134
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,370
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

135
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh, I don't know.

136
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,040
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,170
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

138
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,010
- Yes, you could.
- No.

139
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,050
No bun. [clears throat] Okay.

140
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,340
Um, Isabel.

141
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,640
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
I don't think so.

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,470
[PJ] I think so.
It was really good.

144
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,990
It was super funny.

145
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,480
[PJ clears throat]

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,500
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

147
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,940
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

148
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, you're skinny--

149
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,160
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

150
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,160
You probably should eat.

151
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,580
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

152
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,140
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

153
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,830
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

154
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,060
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

155
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,760
[groans] Fuck! Fuck!

156
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,760
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,300
You know what? I'm good.

158
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

159
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,760
If it's not happening here,

160
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,510
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

161
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,730
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

162
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,810
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

163
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,400
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

164
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,860
That's the only hope for me.

165
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,400
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

166
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,820
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

167
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,610
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

168
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,820
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

169
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,900
We're going to have
to join a church.

170
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,200
He'll be the gay pastor.

171
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
My whole life's fucked!

172
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,620
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

173
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,370
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

174
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,790
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

175
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,500
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

176
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,170
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

177
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,340
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

178
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,750
And yeah, guess what?

179
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,590
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

180
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,970
He's fucking the evangelist!

181
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,890
[crying] I don't wanna
live like that.

182
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,720
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

183
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,520
- [Jeff] Isabel.
- [Isabel] Leave me alone!

185
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,900
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

186
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,150
- What?
- Look.

187
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,030
- [Isabel] Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

188
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,440
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

189
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,610
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

190
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,870
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

191
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,200
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

192
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

193
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,290
Yes, come on.

194
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,830
...Irish Catholic.

195
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,250
- And I'm regular Christian!
- [groaning in frustration]

196
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,000
- [PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.
- [Josie] PJ, stop.

197
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
[Jeff grunts]
You're hurting my head.

198
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,340
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

199
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,710
And it's giving me PTSD
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

200
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,630
- Just do it now.
- No.

201
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,570
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

202
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,450
Isabel.

203
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,220
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

204
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,640
- [Jeff] Isabel...
- [Isabel breathes heavily]

205
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,140
Get out of the car.

206
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,480
You can't tell me what to do.

207
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,350
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- [Jeff] Okay,

208
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

209
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,530
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

210
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,780
- Move, you prick!
- [groans]

211
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,820
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

212
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,990
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

213
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,740
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

214
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,000
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

215
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,500
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

216
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,170
Get out! Come on.

217
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,330
- I feel like
we should just drive.
- Drive.

218
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,630
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

219
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,210
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

220
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,550
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

221
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,670
[Isabel] He's gonna move.

222
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,090
- [PJ] We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

223
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,090
- Drive. He'll move.
- [PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.

224
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,550
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

225
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,780
[tires screech]

226
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,530
[squealing]

227
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,400
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

228
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,670
Jeff?

229
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,320
Jeff!

230
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,610
- [Jeff groaning]
- [Josie] Are you...
Are you okay?

231
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,780
When people move cars,
don't people move?

232
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,570
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

233
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,160
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

234
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,700
- Back up! Back up! [screams]
- We didn't even do anything.

235
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,040
- No, come here. [grunting]
- [groaning]

236
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,290
- Man down! Man down!
- [Jeff] You!

237
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,620
[PJ] Oh, my God.

238
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,330
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

239
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,630
[PJ] We should go. Let's go.

240
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,090
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

241
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,670
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

242
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,170
- [Josie] Fine.
- What did you do to him?

243
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,090
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

244
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,430
- [Jeff wailing]
- You fucking cowards!

245
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,650
You better fucking run!

246
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,470
[Jeff] I don't understand.
What the fuck? [sobs]

247
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,730
[yelling] They're not gonna
get away with this!

248
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,160
[Jeff crying]

249
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,400
{\an8}[Principal Meyers, over PA]
{\i1}Attention.{\i0}

250
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
{\i1}The library{\i0}
{\i1}is out of use again.{\i0}

251
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
{\i1}Huntington shot up{\i0}
{\i1}our remaining books,{\i0}

252
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,200
{\i1}so there will be no reading{\i0}
{\i1}again this year. Thank you.{\i0}

253
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,120
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

254
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,290
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

255
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,120
I know I won't even digest it.

256
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,290
I have to throw up."

257
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,340
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

258
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,460
She's like, "No, not, just...

259
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,060
Maybe, but not the bun."

260
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh, it was just really sweet.

261
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,930
You had to be there.

262
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,070
I was there.

263
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,270
Are you serious?

264
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,980
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

265
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,640
You're the sidekick, not me.

266
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,690
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

267
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,710
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

268
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,320
Thanks.

269
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,820
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

270
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,490
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

271
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,760
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

272
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,410
Hi.

273
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,540
[ominous music playing]

274
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,200
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

275
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,750
What? Yeah.

276
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,330
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- [Mr. G] All right, kiddos.

277
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,290
Welcome back to class.

278
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,170
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

279
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,460
That belongs to the school.

280
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

281
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,590
[scoffs] Nice try, PJ,

282
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,510
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

283
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,510
All right, check it out.

284
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,950
- Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

285
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,270
Do what?

286
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,450
[grunts, pants]

287
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,100
[boy] Holy shit. Is he okay?

288
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,500
[Mr. G] Hey, you good, man?

289
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,820
- [Jeff groans]
- What the fuck?

290
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,110
- [Mr. G] Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

291
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,190
[Mr. G] Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

292
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,610
Okay, so, did he fight back?

293
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,160
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

294
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,910
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

295
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,530
or anything,
just let me know...

296
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,080
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

297
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,330
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

298
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,370
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

299
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

300
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,210
That's how, okay?

301
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,040
[Jeff] Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

302
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,590
Overall bitch.

303
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,420
This is you.

304
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,380
- [students gasp]
- God damn it, Jeff.

305
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,880
What the fuck?

306
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,350
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

307
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,760
[PA chimes]

308
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,220
[over PA] {\i1}Hello,{\i0}
{\i1}this is Principal Meyers{\i0}

309
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,140
{\i1}with an important{\i0}
{\i1}Huntington update.{\i0}

310
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,770
{\i1}So, listen to this girl.{\i0}

311
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,860
[Shelly] {\i1}Last night,{\i0}
{\i1}outside the fair,{\i0}

312
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,650
{\i1}a Huntington player{\i0}
{\i1}followed me home,{\i0}

313
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,860
{\i1}pinned me against my car{\i0}
{\i1}and punched me in the face.{\i0}

314
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,860
{\i1}And now my face{\i0}
{\i1}is totally fucked.{\i0}

315
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,030
[Sylvie] Fuck.

316
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,780
[Principal Meyers]
{\i1}We haven't faced the violence{\i0}
{\i1}of Huntington for 20 years.{\i0}

317
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,450
{\i1}They think they can get{\i0}
{\i1}in our heads{\i0}

318
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,660
{\i1}by picking on our weak{\i0}
{\i1}and defenseless.{\i0}

319
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
{\i1}Well, we can't let them{\i0}
{\i1}break our spirit, folks.{\i0}

320
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,250
{\i1}Keep your heads in the game.{\i0}

321
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,330
They're gonna pork us!

322
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,750
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

323
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,090
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

324
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,760
[sarcastically]
Oh, great. More violence.

325
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,840
Just what this school needs.

326
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,260
[bell rings]

327
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,590
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

328
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,640
- That's class?
- Latte. [snaps fingers]

329
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Get my shit.

330
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,600
[PJ] Solid class.

331
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,930
[Hazel groans]

332
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,200
[Isabel] Hey.

333
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,150
Josie, right?

334
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,670
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

335
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,650
Um, weren't you there?

336
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,610
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

337
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,990
- and killed girls in juvie.
- [PJ] Really?

338
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,450
Um, what did you think
about that?

339
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,990
- [PA chimes]
- [Principal Meyers] {\i1}Excuse me.{\i0}

340
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,710
{\i1}Could the ugly,{\i0}
{\i1}untalented gays{\i0}

341
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,670
{\i1}please report{\i0}
{\i1}to the principal's office?{\i0}

342
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,670
Guess that's you guys.

343
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,300
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

344
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,920
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

345
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,630
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

346
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,090
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

347
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,930
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

348
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,010
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

349
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,680
- Shush.
- Okay.

350
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,100
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

351
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,480
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

352
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,230
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

353
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,530
- [Josie] Twenty years.
- [PJ] Couldn't be clearer.

354
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,610
[Josie] I think I can explain.

355
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,940
I can explain.

356
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,990
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

357
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,490
[Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.

358
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,950
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

359
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,290
Yeah, actually.

360
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,370
How come you can't buck up

361
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,080
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

362
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,250
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

363
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,000
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

364
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,590
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

365
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,760
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

366
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,090
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

367
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,100
- Can we just
calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

368
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,810
- You know what?
- What?

369
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,350
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

370
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,930
- No! No!
- [Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!

371
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,440
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

372
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,710
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

373
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,840
for...

374
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
for our self-defense club.

375
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,870
Self-defense-- What is that?

376
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,330
- [Josie] Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

377
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,380
- Well, here's the thing--
- Yes! Yes!

378
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,340
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

379
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,670
A fight club.

380
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,170
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

381
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,260
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

382
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,630
No, we don't. Shut up.

383
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,090
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

384
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,470
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

385
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,510
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

386
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,310
while you perform
{\i1}The Vagina Monologues.{\i0}

387
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,020
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

388
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,850
Yes, sir.

389
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,190
[Hazel] I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

390
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,570
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

391
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,070
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

392
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,150
We're doing it.

393
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,070
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

394
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,660
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

395
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,450
- [Josie groans]
- Also, you heard
the announcements.

396
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,660
Girls are terrified.

397
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,370
It's perfect. They need this.

398
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

399
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,210
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

400
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,460
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

401
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,630
That's the point of feminism.

402
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,010
That's not the point
of feminism.

403
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,880
You also don't care
about feminism.

404
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,180
Your favorite show
is {\i1}Entourage.{\i0}

405
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,720
You're missing the point!

406
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,720
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

407
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,270
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

408
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,060
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

409
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,560
- [grunts frustratedly]
- About juvie?

410
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
- [PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

411
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,810
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

412
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,230
I just didn't correct you.

413
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,530
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

414
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,820
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

415
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,990
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

416
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,240
Look, this is how we do this.

417
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,660
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

418
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,030
Which I've got covered.

419
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,160
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

420
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,250
[PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.

421
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,830
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

422
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

423
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,630
[Josie and PJ]
You know Stella-Rebecca?

424
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,380
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

425
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,500
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

426
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,670
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

427
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,760
[Josie sighs]

428
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,510
- Josie.
- What?

429
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,010
- We're doing this.
- No.

430
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,720
Yeah. Listen to me.

431
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,470
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

432
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,480
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

433
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,140
They are grateful to us.

434
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,690
We build a community, we bond,

435
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,940
we share, we connect.

436
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,940
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

437
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,400
Next thing you know,

438
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,160
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

439
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,630
- [player 1] Jeffrey!
- [PJ] Josie...

440
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,740
Isabel knew your name.

441
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,830
- [player 2] Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

442
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,040
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

443
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,670
we just run the risk
of becoming

444
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,580
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

445
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,960
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

446
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,300
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

447
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,970
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

448
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,130
We're the lowest of the low.

449
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,680
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

450
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,810
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

451
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,480
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

452
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,690
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

453
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,190
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

454
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,870
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

455
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,750
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

456
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,740
What's your plan here?

457
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,450
I don't need a plan.

458
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,630
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

459
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,100
[upbeat electronic
music playing]

460
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,390
[PJ sighs]

461
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,920
Okay.

462
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,180
What's up, lads?

463
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,380
What the fuck?

464
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,460
- These girls are ugly.
- [Josie] Okay.

465
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,970
Where is Stella?

466
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,590
She was booked
for a car convention.

467
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,220
What? It's a Monday.

468
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,890
[Josie] Um, maybe we should go

469
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,100
- before someone cool shows up?
- [door opens]

470
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,680
Before I die? Pick one.

471
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,270
[Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

472
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,230
I love David Fincher.

473
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,770
- [sighs] Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

474
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,780
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

475
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,360
and stopped huffing paint.

476
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,200
[Josie] She'll never stop
huffing paint.

477
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,360
[Hazel] So, I thought
we'd start...

478
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,510
Um...

479
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,470
- Okay.
- Sorry.

480
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,660
[PJ] All right.

481
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,910
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

482
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,670
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

483
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
Um, it's a self-defense club.

484
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,840
It's not really, "Fight."

485
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,420
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

486
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,130
and they're picking
on the weak

487
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,800
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

488
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,510
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

489
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,680
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

490
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,980
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

491
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,640
Then, punch-bucket,

492
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,650
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

493
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,810
and we punch you
until you bleed.

494
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,860
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

495
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,070
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

496
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,200
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

497
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,280
Juvie was way crazier.

498
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,370
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

499
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,490
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

500
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,330
I get up. I'm blind.

501
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,770
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

502
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,730
Broke her fuckin' nose.

503
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,550
Josie?

504
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,770
Care to share?

505
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, all right.

506
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,180
Juvie was insane.

507
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,510
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

508
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,490
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

509
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,850
So, you killed a girl?

510
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,730
Uh, no.

511
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,900
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

512
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,240
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

513
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
when she came back
to life, so...

514
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,030
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

515
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,830
She came back to life.

516
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,500
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

517
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

518
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,670
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

519
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,100
Josie, if you'll step forward.

520
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,420
No, I don't wanna do that.

521
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,420
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

522
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,010
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

523
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,590
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

524
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,760
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

525
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,100
They wanna see the punch.

526
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,180
Who am I gonna punch?

527
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,560
Punch me. Just punch me.

528
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,230
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

529
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,310
I can punch you.

530
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,810
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

531
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,190
Something people
would always say,

532
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,310
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

533
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,560
- Come on up.
- [Josie grunts]

534
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,880
Oh! [groans, thuds]

535
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,710
Oh, fuck!

536
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,010
- [Josie sighs]
- [PJ breathing heavily]

537
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,290
Will there an advisor
for this club?

538
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,040
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

539
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,120
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

540
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,180
where we punch each other
in the face?

541
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,150
The Holocaust. It happened.

542
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes, it did.

543
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,930
But how? The seeds were sown
in the {\i1}Treaty of Versailles,{\i0}

544
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,850
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

545
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,820
[PJ] I mean, he's perfect.

546
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,850
[Josie] No.

547
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,140
- What?
- No.

548
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,730
Please.

549
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,480
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

550
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,360
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

551
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,650
Fuck! When did you show up?

552
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,150
Hey, guys. [chuckles]

553
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,700
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

554
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,740
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

555
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,530
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

556
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,660
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

557
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,450
and, like, guns and stuff,

558
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,670
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

559
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,170
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

560
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,420
But, unfortunately,

561
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,130
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

562
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,920
What? Why?

563
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,010
I don't know.

564
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,800
Why? It was just
so empowering.

565
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,090
What was empowering?

566
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,060
- Oh, my God, hi. Um...
- [players groaning]

567
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,310
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

568
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,440
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

569
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,000
- [bell rings]
- Isabel, let's go.

570
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,030
[Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.

571
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,490
- I'm so strong.
- [Isabel giggles]

572
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,590
[whimsical music playing]

573
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
I mean...

574
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,510
[chuckling mischievously]

575
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,580
- [PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
- [Josie sighs]

576
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,090
Great class today.

577
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,090
Hey, uh, girl.

578
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,590
Thanks for coming in today.

579
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,880
We have to come in.
It's class.

580
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,090
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

581
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,430
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

582
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,020
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

583
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,770
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

584
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,270
[chuckles] Sure, he did.

585
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,690
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

586
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,900
- What kind of club is that?
- [PJ] It's a women's club.

587
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,840
We talk about women's issues.

588
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,010
For example,
periods,

589
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
declining egg count,

590
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,240
skirts...

591
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,490
Skirts?

592
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,370
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

593
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,670
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

594
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,750
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

595
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,340
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

596
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,340
- Makes sense.
- [PJ] Yeah.

597
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,090
Listen. I'm kind of,

598
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,340
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

599
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,010
- [PJ] Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

600
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,010
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

601
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,810
Back to the club,

602
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,690
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

603
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,400
[Josie] Can I be honest?
You're a man

604
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,020
who's not coping
with what's going on.

605
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,480
- Yeah.
- You know what?

606
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,110
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

607
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,320
And here's one thing

608
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,650
- my mom's always said to me.
- [PJ] Mmm.

609
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,780
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

610
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,410
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

611
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,740
[Josie] It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

612
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,660
- but you don't even
come to the dang club.
- No.

613
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,790
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

614
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,040
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

615
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,210
You just say
you're doing something

616
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,960
and then you don't do
any of those things.

617
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,130
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

618
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't come. Yeah.

619
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,610
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

620
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
- Amazing.
- What?

621
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,850
- Yeah.
- Really?

622
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,200
- Okay.
- [PJ] So cool.

623
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,950
[grunts]

624
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,020
How many girls go
to this school, again?

625
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,780
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

626
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,090
Hey, guys.

627
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,820
[PJ] Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

628
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,950
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

629
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,000
[Mr. G] Hey, ladies.

630
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,140
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

631
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,350
All right. Um...

632
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Hello, everybody.

633
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,670
Okay, excuse me.

634
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,130
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

635
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,420
Um...

636
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,070
[loud thumping]

637
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,650
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

638
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,290
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

639
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,740
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

640
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,210
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

641
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,090
First...

642
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
listen.

643
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,930
Second,

644
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,680
be on time.

645
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,250
Yeah.

646
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,060
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

647
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,170
What time is it?

648
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,970
- [Annie] 3:30.
- 3:30!

649
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,650
Club starts at 3:15.

650
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,240
Not 3:16.

651
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,850
[scoffs] Not 3:17,

652
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,400
but the doors close at 3:15.

653
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,210
No exceptions.

654
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,860
I don't care if you're like...

655
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,700
- [door opens]
- "Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

656
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,490
because I... I need
to get a full ride

657
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,040
because my mom
lives in a trailer

658
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,290
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

659
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,460
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

660
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,080
Shut up, okay?

661
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,730
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

662
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,640
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

663
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,930
Nice.

664
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,890
[PJ] Uh, we're just getting
started here.

665
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,580
So, um...

666
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,270
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

667
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,020
We're gonna do wrestling.

668
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,320
I think I need a volunteer.

669
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,070
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

670
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,150
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

671
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,570
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

672
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,910
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

673
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,330
Don't be late.

674
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,580
- But this week is good...
- [PJ] Yeah. No worries.

675
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,830
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

676
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,040
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

677
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
This is a self-defense
class, right?

678
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,290
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

679
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,920
against, like,
football players.

680
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

681
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,420
[chuckles nervously, sighs]
They're gonna pork us.

682
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,510
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

683
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,930
There's a cash prize, right?

684
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,890
[Isabel] I thought this was
to be part of, like,

685
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,280
a local underprivileged
female community.

686
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

687
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,730
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

688
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,900
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

689
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,440
So, uh, you know, like...

690
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,030
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

691
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,030
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

692
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,450
- Love that.
- [PJ] Yeah.

693
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

694
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,290
- [Annie grunts]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

695
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,620
I don't know about this shit.

696
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,040
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

697
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,130
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

698
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,550
- Look.
- [Josie] We can take it slower.

699
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,960
- [PJ] Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

700
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,590
Take that route.
Little slower.

701
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,140
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

702
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,400
Whatever you want, 'kay?

703
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,560
- [PJ grunts]
- Oh, fuck.

704
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,890
- [girls gasp]
- [PJ] Okay.

705
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,520
That's great.
I say that we go again.

706
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,190
- Oh!
- [Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.

707
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,270
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

708
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,860
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

709
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,480
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

710
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,400
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

711
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,400
- [Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

712
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,820
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

713
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,740
I know that,

714
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,620
you know, this is
a little messy right now

715
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,660
but, like, the only way

716
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,100
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

717
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,420
Huntington is coming.

718
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,130
[inspirational music playing]

719
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,350
We need this.

720
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,840
I know that things
might seem scary,

721
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,070
but that's okay, because...

722
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,100
because...

723
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,180
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

724
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,850
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

725
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,270
- Right?
- [Josie] Yes.

726
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,520
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

727
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,480
You are never gonna
get assaulted
on your birthday again.

728
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,240
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

729
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,780
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

730
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,370
Yeah, absolutely.

731
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,530
[Sylvie] And for me,

732
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,430
I'll be able
to kill my stepdad.

733
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,830
- Awesome.
- Okay.

734
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,160
[PJ] And if you believe
in yourselves

735
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,460
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

736
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm like,
"Let's fucking do this!"

737
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,000
- Yeah!
- [Josie] Yeah?

738
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,130
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

739
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,590
So good.

we can put our fingers

are actually liking
more than just

the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

811
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,460
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

812
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,380
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

813
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,970
it means a lot to people,

814
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,430
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

815
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,180
and actually get
to know these girls,

816
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,680
like, it would be
really important,

817
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,910
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

818
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,520
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

819
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,110
- Yeah.
- I love talking
about my trauma.

820

after every single

- therapy session.
- What?

822
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,410
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,660
- Don't say "girls." It's you.

- I just wanted to say

825
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

826
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600
It seems so supportive
of women.

827
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,750
Especially the hot ones.

828
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,590
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

829
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,550
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

830
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,550
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

831
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,890
I'm just a bit concerned

832
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,010
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

833
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,410
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

834
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Okay.

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,900
[Josie] So, we know
that the club has been a place

836
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,950
where we can feel
empowered physically,

837
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,740
but we also thought
it could be

838
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,410
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

839
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,930
and talk about our feelings.

840
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Okay, so who's been raped?

841
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,810
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

842
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,770
Gray area stuff counts too.

843
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,900
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

844
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,980
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

845
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,870
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

846
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,610
fuck, whatever.

847
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,240
You know?

848
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,570
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

849
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,780
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

850
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,870
And then the form
tells me to call,

851
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,160
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

852
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

853
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,580
but that doesn't count.

854
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,670
So, it's just, like, annoying.

855
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,100
Been there.

856
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,500
We've all been there.

857
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,300
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

858
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,590
but I'm more annoyed

859
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,890
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

860
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,980
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

861
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,950
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

862
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,980
See?

863
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,610
[Hazel] Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

864
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,570
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

865
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,240
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

866
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,160
It's been really, really dark.

867
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,160
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

868
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,670
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

869
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,180
- I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
- I can go next,

870
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,270
if that's okay.

871
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,220
I don't really like talking
about juvie

872
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,140
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

873
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,310
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

874
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,780
'cause people think
it's so badass.

875
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,600
But, really wasn't.

876
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,280
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

877
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,610
like, badass. I mean, um,

878
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,990
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

879
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,080
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

880
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,120
fight people basically
every single night.

881
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,330
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

882
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,790
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

883
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,130
and, um, pipes as well.

884
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,340
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

885
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,170
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

886
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,530
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

887
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,640
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

888
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,480
Like, I don't have
to just let things

889
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,060
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

890
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,070
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

891
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,650
for what the club
has become and...

892
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,360
Um...

893
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,970
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

894
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,040
Yeah, sorry.

895
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,660
[chuckles] I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

896
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,910
I've never really,

897
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,330
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

898
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,090
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

899
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm going through a divorce.

900
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,720
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

901
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,220
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

902
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,360
men... men need therapy.

903
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,970
[softly] Yeah.

904
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,910
[in normal voice]
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

905
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

906
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,260
Um...

907
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,050
Thank you, um, for that.

908
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,470
Um...

909
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,080
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

910
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,460
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

911
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,860
if you wanna...

912
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah.

913
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,700
Yeah, okay, sure.

914
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,430
[man and woman
moaning in pleasure]

915
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,580
Mom?

916
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,710
[woman giggles]

917
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,320
[man groans]

918
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,670
Mom?

919
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,070
Oh, hi, honey.

920
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,760
What are you doing home
so early?

921
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,500
[grunts, groans]

922
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,640
Uh...

923
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,520
Are you kidding me?

924
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,190
I had a long day. [chuckles]

925
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,230
[Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

926
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,260
[Stella-Rebecca]
First club fundraiser.

927
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,930
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

928
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,350
Hello, ladies.

929
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,850
[Stella-Rebecca]
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

930
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,980
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

931
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,600
It's so weird. [chuckles]

932
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,190
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

933
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,440
Thanks, PJ.

934
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,150
- [Hazel groaning]
- Ah. We're havin' fun.

935
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,740
We're selling panties.

936
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,130
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

937
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,780
Very nice.

938
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,160
[PJ] Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

939
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,970
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

940
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,010
Um, I can't. Uh...

941
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,710
Isabel and I have plans, so...

942
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,000
[Hazel continues groaning]

943
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

944
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,170
Yep.

945
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,430
[PJ] Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

946
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,260
I have to keep up.

947
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,600
Hazel, what is wrong?

948
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,970
Are you constipated
or something?

949
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,310
[Hazel] I'm fucking tired.

950
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,640
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

951
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

952
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,020
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

953
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,580
He's like the crybaby.

954
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,940
With the balls?

955
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,340
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

956
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,090
He's like the main guy.

957
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,260
[sputters] Jeff?

958
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,450
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

959
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,040
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

960
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,710
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

961
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,830
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

962
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,340
[Stella-Rebecca yelps]

963
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm good. [chuckles]

964
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,210
[PJ] Looking good, Stella!

965
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,510
[Isabel laughs]

966
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,650
[PJ] Are you gonna tell her?

967
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,010
[Tim] Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

968
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,410
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

969
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,560
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

970
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,700
[player] Hit me! Ow!

971
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,420
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

972
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,650
Got it. Thank you.

973
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,420
- [players shouting]
- [sighs]

974
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,170
[whistle blows]

975
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,240
Jeff!

976
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,180
[easygoing music playing]

977
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,040
[Josie laughing]

978
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,590
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

979
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,300
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

980
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,380
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

981
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,980
[Josie and Isabel laughing]

982
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,770
I wanted to...

983
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,430
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

984
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,370
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

985
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,870
Me too.

986
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,190
I think it's really impressive

987
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,410
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

988
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,870
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

989
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,340
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

990
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,580
You're really, really brave.

991
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,000
No. [chuckles]

992
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,420
No. No, no.

993
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,750
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl. [chuckles]

994
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,900
You're...

995
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Yeah, you're...

996
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,610
really, really brave.

997
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,110
What?

998
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,750
Actually, Isabel, uh...

999
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,690
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

1000
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,230
There's something
you maybe should know.

1001
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,540
Uh...

1002
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,700
I mean it's pretty insane.

1003
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,590
Okay. [chuckles]
What... what is it?

1004
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,590
I just, I...

1005
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,500
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

1006
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,640
- [music stops]
- [glasses clinking]

1007
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,770

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,140
have a different definition
of egging,

1173
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,110
but if we keep
our mouths shut,
stay calm, we'll be fine.

1174
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,540
They're gonna shut us down,
aren't they?

1175
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,320
What?

1176
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,990
No. We don't know that.

1177
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,650
- What-- Why--
- [Brittany] Principal Meyers
will believe

1178
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,410
whatever Jeff and Tim say.

1179
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,130
I don't really see how
we recover from this.

1180
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,380
[Sylvie sighs] Man...

1181
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,330
Fuck.

1182
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,000
You know,
it's been real, guys.

1183
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,210
Okay, let's not jump
to conclusions

1184
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,420
with the goodbyes and...

1185
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,310
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

1186
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,800
[Sylvie] And like, at least
we went out with a bang.

1187
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,590
I mean, that was
fucking insane!

1188
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:47,760
[girls laugh]

1189
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,550
There was just, like,
fire everywhere.

1190
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,560
[PJ] Wait. Stop.

1191
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,850
We don't-- Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1192
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,940
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1193
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,650
[PJ] All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1194
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,370
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1195
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,790
[Isabel] No matter what,

1196
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,410
this club has brought me
so much.

1197
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,550
I feel...

1198
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,720
so much more powerful
and, um...

1199
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
protected.

1200
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:18,870
- Me too.
- [PJ chuckles]

1201
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,380
- Great.
- [Hazel] Oh, my God, PJ.

1202
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,210
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1203
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,300
what you wanted
out of this group,

1204
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,260
but I think
the rest of us did.

1205
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,840
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1206
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,180
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1207
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,930
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1208
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,010
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1209
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,720
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1210
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,060
You really think
that you're the reason
that we have this club?

1211
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,310
The reason? No.

1212
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,480
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1213
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,940
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1214
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,520
You're really ungrateful.

1215
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,570
You're so lucky
that we even let you
be a part of this.

1216
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,420
PJ, you're a liar.

1217
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,570
[PJ scoffs]

1218
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,080
Yeah, well,
you have no friends,

1219
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,430
and a skank as a mom, so...

1220
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,980
- [Josie] Hazel.
- [PJ scoffs]

1221
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,740
[door closes]

1222
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,830
[Brittany] PJ...

1223
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,210
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1224
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,260
[mellow music playing]

1225
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,620
[students chattering]

1226
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,010
[crying]

1227
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,750
Hazel.

1228
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,900
[door closes]

1229
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,570
Whoa.

1230
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,570
I love God.

1231
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,910
- Yes, same.
- [chuckles]

1232
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,570
Yeah.

1233
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,840
Oh, my God,
I always wanted
one of these.

1234
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,370
But my mom says
they hide your figure
and make you look ugly.

1235
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,490
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1236
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,390
Like, as a joke or...

1237
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,540
whatever.

1238
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,710
Thanks.

1239
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,850
[Josie] Yeah.

1240
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,430
[Isabel] Wow, you and PJ

1241
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,390
really have been
friends forever.

1242
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,200
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1243
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,020
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1244
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,910
PJ called her Gay Yoda,
but I think she's kind of
like a mentor.

1245
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,690
[Josie clears throat]

1246
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,880
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1247
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,880
She's so, like...

1248
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
like...

1249
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,490
[chuckles] You know?

1250
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,640
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- And you're...

1251
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,600
You're so, like...

1252
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,100
[both chuckle]

1253
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,480
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1254
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,570
Josie...

1255
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,320
[gentle music playing]

1256
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,770
[grunts softly]

1257
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,610
[Isabel breathing heavily]

1258
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,100
[PJ] I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1259
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,770
- [Brittany] Really?
- [PJ] Yeah.

1260
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,540
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1261
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,490
Wow.

1262
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,320
This is, um, a total shithole.

1263
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,460
[Brittany chuckles lightly]

1264
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,220
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1265
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,790
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1266
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,190
they give you a tax break.

1267
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,010
[Brittany groans]

1268
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,180
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1269
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,470
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1270
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,680
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1271
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,180
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1272
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,270
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1273
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,330
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1274
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,420
[Brittany sighs]

1275
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,720
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1276
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,250
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1277
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,770
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1278
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,020
[whispering] Watch out.

1279
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,410
What?

1280
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,450
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1281
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,730
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1282
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:39,360
Your wrists are so small,
and the pen is so heavy
that I'm like,

1283
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,780
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1284
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,700
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1285
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,990
with all the surface area

1286
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,220
- that yours are taking up.
- [gasps]

1287
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,330
Wow.

1288
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,700
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1289
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,290
Okay, does this hurt?

1290
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,250
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1291
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1292
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,460
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1293
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,350
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1294
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,360
Um...

1295
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,950
Uh...

1296
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,410
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1297
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,840
Oh.

1298
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,630
Um...

1299
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,120
Yeah. Um...

1300
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,250
- I'm... I'm sorry
if you misread anything.
- No, that's all...

1301
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,230
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1302
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
[drums playing]

1303
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,950
[sighs] Um...

1304
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,540
I wanted to tell you something.

1305
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,230
What?

1306
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,960
Like, something that happened
last night.

1307
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,760
What happened?

1308
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,470
[softly] With Isabel.

1309
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Wait.

1310
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,270
Wait, seriously?

1311
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,190
[spectators cheering]

1312
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,690
That's... that's amazing.
That's...

1313
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,970
[all cheering]

1314
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,550
[Jeff] {\i1}Everybody,{\i0}

1315
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,310
{\i1}- even the fucking losers...{\i0}
- Even the fucking losers!

1316
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,140
{\i1}...make some noise!{\i0}

1317
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,160
[spectators cheering]

1318
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,690
I thought you were
super Christian.

1319
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,820
I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

1320
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,610
{\i1}All right, uh, so we're gonna{\i0}
{\i1}do the pep rally.{\i0}

1321
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,200
{\i1}First up, cheerleaders.{\i0}

1322
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,590
[cheerleaders cheering]

1323
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,890
[upbeat music playing]

1324
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,060
[yelps, giggles]

1325
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,770
Football! [giggles]

1326
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,430
{\i1}Whoo! Yeah,{\i0}
{\i1}thank you, ladies. Ooh!{\i0}

1327
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,970
{\i1}Thank you all for joining us{\i0}
{\i1}here today, folks.{\i0}

1328
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,010
{\i1}There's been some{\i0}

1329
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,100
{\i1}exciting stuff happening{\i0}
{\i1}at Rockbridge Falls recently.{\i0}

1330
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,240
Oh.

1331
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,690
{\i1}How many of you{\i0}

1332
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:23,690
{\i1}know about that little girl{\i0}
{\i1}fight club that could?{\i0}

1333
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,530
[scattered clapping]

1334
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,070
Ay, there go my girls.

1335
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:31,320
{\i1}Well, do we have{\i0}
{\i1}a surprise for you.{\i0}

1336
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,660
{\i1}We're gonna bring...{\i0}
{\i1}Where is she?{\i0}

1337
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,970
[snaps fingers] {\i1}Hazel down.{\i0}

1338
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,460
{\i1}One of the founding members.{\i0}

1339
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,790
{\i1}To show us everything{\i0}
{\i1}the club's taught her{\i0}

1340
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,300
{\i1}in a fun little challenge.{\i0}

1341
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,840
[girls cheering]

1342
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,630
- [girl 1] Let's go, Hazel!
- [girl 2] Go, Hazel!

1343
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,490
- What is this?
- I... I don't know.

1344
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,930
[exhales]

1345
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:58,030
[Tim] {\i1}Hazel will be{\i0}
{\i1}fighting Tucker,{\i0}

1346
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,790
{\i1}the school's number one boxer.{\i0}

1347
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,620
[Tucker screams]

1348
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,900
[growling]

1349
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,040
[neck cracks]

1350
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,070
Wait, I thought I was gonna be
fighting PJ?

1351
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,070
{\i1}I know what you're thinking,{\i0}
{\i1}but don't be alarmed.{\i0}

1352
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,870
{\i1}Girls can do anything{\i0}
{\i1}guys can do, right?{\i0}

1353
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,260
Yeah, kick his ass!

1354
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,930
{\i1}Ready?{\i0}

1355
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,830
- Fuck.
{\i1}- Go.{\i0}

1356
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,290
[panting]

1357
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:23,430
[screams]

1358
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,130
[groans]

1359
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,310
[breathing heavily]
[tense music playing]

1360
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,390
[yells]

1361
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,530
[spectators clamoring]

1362
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,240
- [Hazel shouts]
- [Annie] Oh, my God.

1363
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,060
[coughing]

1364
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,400
- You got this, Hazel.
- [girl 3] Come on, Hazel!

1365
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,500
- You got it.
- [grunts]

1366
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
[yelling]

1367
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,090
- [grunts]
- [Jeff gasps]

1368
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,470
[Tucker grunting]

1369
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,010
Shit.

1370
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,560
Whoo! Get him!

1371
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,850
[grunting]

1372
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,060
[Tucker exclaims, laughs]

1373
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,400
[Hazel screams]

1374
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,560
- [girl 4] The fuck
are you doing?
- Is she, like,

1375
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,810
sort of winning or...

1376
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,810
[both screaming]

1377
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,700
No, leave the skin
on his face, will you?

1378
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,820
- [grunts]
- Fuck.

1379
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,400
[PJ] Oh. Oh, my God.

1380
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,110
{\i1}I know what you're thinking.{\i0}

1381
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:35,590
{\i1}You may be wondering{\i0}
{\i1}how a girl{\i0}
{\i1}under the training of...{\i0}

1382
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,790
{\i1}of two juvie convicted killers{\i0}

1383
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,330
{\i1}can't even stand up{\i0}
{\i1}for herself{\i0}
{\i1}against a regular old guy.{\i0}

1384
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,120
[Tucker yells]

1385
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,640
[Tim] {\i1}Well, truth is, they...{\i0}

1386
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,880
{\i1}they didn't go to juvie.{\i0}

1387
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,970
[Jeff gasps]

1388
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,050
{\i1}No.{\i0}

1389
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,190
[Isabel laughs]

1390
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,700
[Tim] {\i1}There's no record{\i0}
{\i1}of them there.{\i0}

1391
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,640
{\i1}And according to Hazel...{\i0}

1392
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,780
[coughs]

1393
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,520
{\i1}...they never fought{\i0}
{\i1}anyone at all.{\i0}

1394
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,520
{\i1}And you know what else?{\i0}

1395
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,170
{\i1}They didn't start the club{\i0}
{\i1}to empower women.{\i0}

1396
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,200
{\i1}They did it{\i0}
{\i1}to fuck cheerleaders.{\i0}

1397
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,340
[Tim scoffs]

1398
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,260
{\i1}What is wrong with you?{\i0}

1399
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,470
{\i1}It is such a shame.{\i0}

1400
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,920
{\i1}We were really rooting{\i0}
{\i1}for you girls.{\i0}

1401
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,790
- [footsteps stomping]
- [Tucker yells]

1402
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,460
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1403
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,130
[Tim] {\i1}Okay.{\i0}

1404
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,380
{\i1}- Thank you for attending...{\i0}
- [Stella-Rebecca] Hazel!

1405
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,970
{\i1}- ...today's pep rally.{\i0}
{\i1}Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!{\i0}
- [Stella-Rebecca] Is she okay?

1406
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,430
- Hazel!
- [Tim] {\i1}Whoo!{\i0}

1407
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,150
- [Jeff] Yes!
- [Tim chuckles] {\i1}Yes!{\i0}

1408
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,570
[foreboding music playing]

1409
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,750
Is that true?

1410
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,230
That's why you started this?

1411
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,900
No, no, no.
[breathing heavily]

1412
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,610
Not... not entirely.

1413
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,320
Not entire-- Okay.

1414
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,330
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1415
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,970
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1416
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,290
The point of the club

1417
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:10,210
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1418
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,340
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1419
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,710
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1420
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,170
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1421
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,940
This is the second wave
all over again.

1422
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,310
Isabel, please, please, wait.

1423
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,770
PJ made me do this.
I didn't want to.

1424
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,000
I would never want to do this.

1425
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,170
[voice breaking]
You're pathetic, Josie.

1426
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,290
[PJ] Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1427
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,540
All right, look.

1428
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,920
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1429
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,210
I just look like this.

1430
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,460
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1431
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,380
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked
y'all group

1432
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,630
and what y'all stood for.

1433
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,300
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1434
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,640
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1435
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,480
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1436
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,850
Is this about the time I said

1437
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,990
Amelia Earhart
was a fake hero?

1438
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,400
Because it's true.

1439
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,650
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1440
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:17,840
but you never hear about them.

1441
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,070
And then it's like,

1442
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,450
[in high-pitched voice]
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

1443
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,120
"We, like, make less money."

1444
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,160
"We had to lose
our last names."

1445
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,620
"I love you."

1446
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,580
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1447
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,210
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1448
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:34,500
[in normal voice]
And all of a sudden,

1449
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,380
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1450
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,260
and suddenly,
the fucking kitchen
is lime green.

1451
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,720
I think...

1452
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,220
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1453
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,720
Oh, you look confused,
like how I'm confused
right now,

1454
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,470
on how you created
a fucking fight club
to get some cooch.

1455
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,730
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1456
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,690
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1457
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,940
you know what
I'm talking about?

1458
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,190
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1459
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,150
of that neck
and all type of--

1460
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:01,110
Sorry, I just don't know
if you're supposed
to be talking to us like that.

1461
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,700
Just, like, as a teacher...

1462
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,370
Man, I knew women were evil.

1463
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,470
Motherfuckers always
tellin' me like,
"No, that's not true."

1464
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,510
But time and time again...
[scoffs]

1465
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,060
[exhales]

1466
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,580
[PJ sighs]

1467
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,050
- [door opens]
- Women ain't nothing
but the fuckin' devil.

1468
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,340
[door shuts]
I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.

1469
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,610
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1470
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:30,470
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1471
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:33,810
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1472
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,110
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1473
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,650
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1474
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,360
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1475
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,150
and then he wouldn't be
so upset

1476
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,490
and then whatever the fuck
just happened
would not have happened.

1477
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,530
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1478
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,120
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1479
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,180
Well, I mean, yeah,
it was your idea
to start the whole club.

1480
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,880
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1481
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,960
You know that.

1482
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,050
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1483
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,880
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1484
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,640
about girls betting on you
to fight other girls
with shivs.

1485
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,520
You're just mad
because I did this.

1486
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,600
I... I... I got to be
with Isabel on my own.

1487
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,060
Without you.

1488
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,810
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1489
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,360
- ever.
- [chuckles]

1490
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,030
I'm the one who made it
happen for you.

1491
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:26,030
You know what's so funny
about this whole
fucking thing,

1492
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,360
all your little schemes,

1493
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,410
all your,
"Oh, we'll have our year

1494
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,700
and we'll fuck
so many girls,"
and whatever?

1495
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,170
Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1496
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,540
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1497
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,210
Yeah, no, shit,
she's straight.

1498
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:43,760
Does it even matter?

1499
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,970
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1500
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,430
Do you care about anyone

PJ has something
to say to Hazel, so...

Okay.

I'm sorry that I called
your mom a skank.

1668
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,090
And I'm sorry

1669
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:30,970
for saying that you have
no friends really loud

All of the time.

you always take notes

01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:48,420
and then you type them up
and email them to everyone...

1675
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,800
