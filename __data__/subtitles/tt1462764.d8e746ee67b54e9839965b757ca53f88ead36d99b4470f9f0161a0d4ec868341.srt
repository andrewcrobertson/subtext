1
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,341
An American, Colonel.

2
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,635
He was at the gate,
impersonating an Officer.

3
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:52,134
Take him upstairs.

4
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,389
A moment. Please!

5
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,683
Stop! I must speak to the Commander.

6
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:01,852
Colonel. I found it!

7
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,314
Do as he says. Open it.

8
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,705
The Lance of Longinus.

9
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,542
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

10
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,669
The Holy Lance.

11
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,140
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

12
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,183
Colonel, we need to talk.

13
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,517
No time, Doctor.

14
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:44,144
The train to Berlin is waiting.

15
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:46,605
Search the woods!

16
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:47,648
Take the dogs.

17
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,025
Do you think that spy was alone?

18
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,152
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

19
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:53,362
On the double!

20
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:28,100
This man was with the American.

21
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:30,936
This is the American's bag.

22
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:33,772
What have I done?

23
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,695
Bring him to my carriage.

24
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:50,372
Careful.
This is the Führer's special relic!

25
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:21,236
Stay seated.

26
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:23,447
So...

27
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,243
you are a birdwatcher?

28
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,790
Yes. Because of the bombing,

29
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,710
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

30
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,382
We caught your accomplice.

31
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,093
The American.

32
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,790
There is a problem.

33
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,125
I must speak to the Colonel.

34
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,419
It's urgent.

35
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,688
I must speak with the Colonel.

36
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,024
It's about the Lance.

37
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,155
I only had a moment to look at it.

38
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,074
Of course, my training is in physics,

39
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:19,534
For God's sake, spit it out!

40
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,454
The Lance...

41
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,251
It's a fake.

42
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:29,753
A fake?

43
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,548
The blade is an alloy.

44
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,050
Fifty years old,

45
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:37,386
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

46
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:38,512
We're dead.

47
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,153
There is another relic on this train.

48
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,739
One with real power.

49
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,324
What are you talking about?

50
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:02,286
The Antikythera.

51
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:03,829
The Antikythera?!

52
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,914
Enough about that old dial!

53
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:08,333
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

54
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,127
and his mind!

55
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,672
Let me explain.

56
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,135
The Antikythera's
 power is not supernatural.

57
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:20,470
It is mathematics.

58
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,682
Whoever harnesses it...

59
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,269
will not be King...

60
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,021
nor Emperor...

61
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,607
or Führer.

62
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,903
He will be God.

63
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:03,430
And how do you propose we tell him this?

64
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:04,931
My Führer,

65
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,517
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

66
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:08,936
But here is...

67
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:13,106
half of something you've never heard of.

68
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,609
Tell me,

69
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,569
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

70
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:21,239
A saboteur aboard.

71
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:22,741
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

72
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,325
That way!

73
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,289
What are you doing here?!

74
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:05,177
Who are you?

75
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:15,974
They have the Antikythera!

76
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,309
Drop the gun.

77
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,605
Give me the Antikythera.

78
02:03:09,953 --> 02:03:11,288
Time to destination?

79
02:03:12,497 --> 02:03:14,041
60 seconds.

80
02:04:02,464 --> 02:04:04,049
30 seconds.

81
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:16,311
20 seconds.

82
02:04:22,192 --> 02:04:23,485
15 seconds.

83
02:04:28,657 --> 02:04:29,491
10 seconds.

84
02:04:30,409 --> 02:04:31,243
9!

85
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:32,995
8!

86
02:04:33,287 --> 02:04:34,121
7!

87
02:04:34,788 --> 02:04:35,622
6!

88
02:04:35,706 --> 02:04:36,957
Turn around!

89
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:38,542
Abort!

90
02:04:39,042 --> 02:04:39,960
Turn around!

91
02:04:40,752 --> 02:04:41,628
ABORT!!!

92
02:04:41,878 --> 02:04:43,839
We're being pulled in!

93
02:04:53,849 --> 02:04:55,183
What are you doing?!

94
02:04:55,392 --> 02:04:56,226
This is my plane!

95
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:57,894
You're flying my plane!

96
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:23,879
We're going to DIE!!!

97
02:05:25,213 --> 02:05:26,923
We need to pull up!

98
02:05:48,779 --> 02:05:49,947
Restart engines!

99
02:06:26,108 --> 02:06:27,818
Setting coordinates for Munich.

100
02:07:53,487 --> 02:07:54,363
Master...

101
02:07:54,446 --> 02:07:56,865
The Romans are getting closer.

102
02:07:58,617 --> 02:07:59,493
They have dragons!

103
02:08:44,246 --> 02:08:45,080
Master...

104
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:49,751
Don't ride out there, Master!

105
02:08:50,335 --> 02:08:51,545
The dragons!!

106
02:09:01,805 --> 02:09:05,309
We must take down their dragons!

107
02:09:13,483 --> 02:09:14,318
Change course!

108
02:09:14,568 --> 02:09:15,944
The portal closes in minutes!

109
02:09:16,361 --> 02:09:17,279
I have to go back!

110
02:09:17,738 --> 02:09:18,864
I can't be here!

111
02:09:19,072 --> 02:09:20,157
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

112
02:09:20,324 --> 02:09:21,783
The plane won't make it!!

113
02:11:35,876 --> 02:11:37,336
We're losing altitude!

114
02:11:38,587 --> 02:11:39,504
We're going down!

115
02:11:41,423 --> 02:11:43,008
I've lost control!

116
02:13:10,554 --> 02:13:11,930
Eureka.

117
02:15:21,643 --> 02:15:22,561
Master!

118
02:15:25,272 --> 02:15:27,065
We have to leave, Master.

119
02:15:44,124 --> 02:15:46,877
Two thousand years.

120
02:15:47,502 --> 02:15:48,670
We've come...

121
02:15:49,254 --> 02:15:52,257
two thousand years.

122
02:15:54,593 --> 02:15:57,721
But we didn't expect to meet...

123
02:15:58,263 --> 02:16:00,766
the great...

124
02:16:01,308 --> 02:16:03,352
Archimedes.

125
02:16:09,024 --> 02:16:09,942
You...

126
02:16:11,151 --> 02:16:12,486
were always...

127
02:16:13,153 --> 02:16:14,404
going to...

128
02:16:14,988 --> 02:16:16,573
meet me.

129
02:16:26,166 --> 02:16:27,792
Apologies, Archimedes.

130
02:16:28,001 --> 02:16:29,336
I'm a fan...

131
02:16:29,586 --> 02:16:31,587
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

132
02:16:42,057 --> 02:16:42,890
I want...

133
02:16:42,975 --> 02:16:44,059
to stay...

134
02:16:44,434 --> 02:16:46,185
with you.

135
02:16:48,897 --> 02:16:51,149
You are a brilliant man...

136
02:16:51,399 --> 02:16:53,402
a wise man...

137
02:16:53,943 --> 02:16:55,279
a genius...

138
02:16:56,446 --> 02:16:58,782
a hero to your people.

139
02:16:59,491 --> 02:17:03,036
But he can't help you.

140
02:17:04,121 --> 02:17:05,831
This is your time.

141
02:17:06,872 --> 02:17:08,834
He must be in his own time!
