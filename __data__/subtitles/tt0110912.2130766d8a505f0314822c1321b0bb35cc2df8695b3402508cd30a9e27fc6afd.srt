178
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:28,581
- All right.
- Hurry up.

179
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:32,452
Fuck. OK, OK, OK.
I think it's ready.

180
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,117
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- I'll tell you what to do.

181
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,095
No, no, no.
You're gonna give her the shot.

182
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,619
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.

183
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,097
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I never done this before.

184
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:45,123
I ain't never done it before,
either. I ain't startin' now.

185
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,261
You brought her here, that means
you're gonna give her the shot.

186
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,702
The day I bring an O.D. Ing bitch
to your house...

187
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,501
then I give her the shot.
Give her the shot.

188
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,632
- Give it to me.
- Here.

189
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:52,663
Give me that.

190
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,836
Tell me what to do.

191
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,745
OK. You're giving her
an injection of adrenaline...

192
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:00,476
straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

193
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:01,744
You've got to
pierce through that.

194
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:04,981
You gotta bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

195
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,716
I gotta stab her three times?

196
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:08,587
No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

197
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,150
But hard enough to get through
her breastplate into her heart.

198
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:14,129
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

199
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:16,290
OK, then what happens?

200
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:17,629
I'm kind of curious
about that myself.

201
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,861
This ain't no fuckin' joke, man!

202
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,300
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!

203
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:22,429
She's supposed to come
out of it like that.

204
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,736
All right. Count to three.
Ready?

205
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,036

206
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:32,872

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,885
what's your thoughts on... on...

224
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:48,447
on how to handle this?

225
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:49,958
What's yours?

226
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,293
Well, I'm of the opinion...

227
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,561
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,899
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident.

229
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:03,599
If Marsellus knew
about this incident...

230
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,039
I'd be in as much trouble
as you.

231
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,600
I seriously doubt that.

232
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,340
I can keep a secret if you can.

Cool.

236
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,652
Now, if you'll excuse me...

237
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,493
I'm gonna go home
and have a heart attack.

238

239
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:39,032
Do you want to hear
my "Fox Force Five" joke?

240
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,638
Sure.

241
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,272
Except that I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

242
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:47,942
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

243
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,577
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

244
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,781
I can't wait.

245
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:53,846

Yeah?

265
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,423
We got a special visitor.

266
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,259
Now... do you
remember when I told you...

267
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,359
your daddy died
in a P.O.W. Camp?

268
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:17,304
Well... this here
is Captain Koons.

269
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,036
He was in the P.O.W. Camp
with Daddy.

271
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,479
Hello, little man.

272
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:31,544
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

273
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:34,954
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

274
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,324
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

275
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:40,761
over five years.

276
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:42,730
Hopefully...

277
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:45,256
you'll never have to experience
this yourself...

278
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,792
but when two men
are in a situation...

279
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:52,137
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were...

280
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:55,735
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

281
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,279

282
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,474
not made it...

right now to my son... Jim.

it turned out...

287
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,158
I got somethin' for ya.

288
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,203
This watch I got here...

289
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:27,471
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather...

290
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,807
during the First World War.

291
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,177
It was bought
in a little general store...

292
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,546
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

293
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:38,281
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

294
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,484
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

295
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:44,789
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

296
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:47,455
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

297
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:49,657
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

298
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,224
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

299
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,634
And when he'd done his duty...

300
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,900
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

301
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,236
took the watch off...

302
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,242
put it in an old coffee can...

303
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,606
and in that can it stayed...

304
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:04,373
Till your gr anddad,
Dane Coolidge...

305
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,971
was called upon
by his country...

306
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,950
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

307
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:13,547
This time they called it
World War II.

308
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,216
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

309
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:18,658
to your granddad for good luck.

310
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:21,720
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

311
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:24,358
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

312
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,268
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

313
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:31,671
Your granddad was facing death.

314
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:33,641
He knew it.

315
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,370
None of those boys
had any illusions...

316
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,912
about ever leaving
that island alive...

317
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:41,007
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

318
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,143
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

319
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,620
name of Winocki...

320
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:49,147
a man he had never met
before in his life...

321
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:52,456
to deliver to his infant son...

322
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,588
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

323
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,190
his gold watch.

324
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,360
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

325
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,393
but Winocki kept his word.

326
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,405
After the war was over...

327
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,839
he paid a visit
to your gr andmother...

328
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,105
delivering
to your infant father...

329
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:10,077
his dad's gold watch.

330
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,841
This watch.

331
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,285
This watch
was on your daddy's wrist...

332
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:23,382
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

333
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:26,953
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

334
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:31,057
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

335
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,533
they'd confiscate it...

336
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:33,830
take it away.

337
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:38,431
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

338
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:41,170
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

339
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:43,438
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

340
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:46,447
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

341
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:50,043
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

342
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:54,182
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

343
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:57,954
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

344
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:01,360
Then... after seven years...

345
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:04,389
I was sent home to my family.
And...

346
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,900
now...

347
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,629

It's time, Butch.

357
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,785
Floyd Ray Wilson!

[Bell dinging]

360
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:02,455
SPORTSCASTER: It's official.
It's official. Wilson is dead!

361
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,118
SECOND SPORTSCASTER: Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest...

362
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,651
and the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen.

363
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,255
Coolidge left faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer...

364
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:10,458
leave the ring.

365
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:11,932
Do you think he knew
Wilson was dead?

366
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,161
DAN:
My guess would be yes, Richard.

367
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:15,898
I could see
the frenzy in his eyes...

368
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:17,428
give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

369
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,441
I think any man would have
left the ring that fast.

370
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,840
RICHARD:
Do you feel this tragedy...

371
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,605
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing?

372
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:25,044
DAN: Such a tragedy can't help
but shake the boxing world...

373
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,479
to its very foundations...

374
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:29,040
but par amount importance is
during the sad weeks ahead...

375
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:31,086
the eyes of the WBA remain...

380

Marsellus?

381
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,627
I didn't do it, man.

382
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,629
How you doin'?

383
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:17,826
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.

384
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:20,632
What you got?

385
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:21,636
He booked.

386
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,160
His trainer?

387
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,969
Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

388
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,737
Think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

389
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,335
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

390
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,471
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

391
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:35,346
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

392
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:37,909
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

393
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:40,649
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

394
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,384
If Butch goes to Indochina...

395
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:43,914
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

396
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,826
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

397
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:48,796

ESMARELDA: Hey, mister?

401
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,514
What?

402
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:08,379
You were in that fight.

403
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,386
ESMARELDA:
The fight on the radio.

404
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,887
You're the fighter?

405
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:14,822
Now, what gave you that idea?

406
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:18,384
No, ho, come on.

407
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:19,655
You're him.

408
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,220
I know you're him.

409
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:25,800
Tell me you're him.

410
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,598
I'm him.

411
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:31,231
You killed
the other boxing man.

412
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,135
He's dead?

413
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,544
The radio said he was dead.

414
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,514
[Sighs, sniffs]

415
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,610
Sorry about that, Floyd.

[Butch sniffs]

417
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:47,488
What does it feel like?

418
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:49,718
What does what feel like?

419
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,692
Killing a man.

420
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:58,828
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

421
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,528
Are you a weirdo?

422
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,127
[Chuckles]
No.

423
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:04,731
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

424
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:09,510
You are the first person
I've met...

425
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,274
who has killed somebody.

426
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,782
So...

427
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:18,787
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

428
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,789
[Sniffs, exhales]
I'll tell you what.

429
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:23,724
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

430
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,590
and I'll tell you all about it.

431

[Butch sighs]

432
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:46,008

434
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,047
Villalobos.

435
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,246
Is that Mexican?

436
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,552
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

437
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,252
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

438
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,226
Thank you.

439
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,922
And what is your name?

What does it mean?

443
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:10,536
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

444

So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

445
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:17,069
What is it you wanna know?

446
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:20,513
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

447
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,016
I couldn't tell ya.

448
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,220
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

449
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,229
Now that I know he's dead...

450
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:37,255
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

451
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:43,995
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

452
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:51,679
[Speech inaudible]

453
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,276
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

454
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,719
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

455
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,723
the odds went through the roof.

456
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:03,418
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

457
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,926
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

458
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,258
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

459
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,524
He never laced up his gloves...

460
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,259
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

461
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,233
he'd still be alive.

462
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,495
[Spits]

463
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,469
Yeah, well...

464
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:17,597
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

465
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,233
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

466
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,073
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

467
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,213
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

468
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:28,716
All eight?

469
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,741
How long to collect?

470
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,617
[Sniffs] So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

471
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:35,987
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

472
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,821
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

473
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,055
that is great news, man.

474
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,619
Yeah, mm-hmm.

475
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:44,393
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

476
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,596
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

477
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,365
OK, my brother.

478
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:50,803
[Chuckles]

479
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,070
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

480
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,201
All right, Scotty.

481
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:57,677
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

482
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,146
Be cool, brother.

483
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:10,848

45.60.

486
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:25,234
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

487
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,434
Now...

488
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:29,342
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

489
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:30,469
what are you gonna say?

490
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:31,877
The truth.

491
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:35,748
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

492
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:40,353

FABIENNE: [French accent]
Keep the light off.

496
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,332
Is that better,
sugar pop?

497
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,377
Oui.

498
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,779
Hard day at the office?

499
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,717
Pretty hard.

500
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,088
I got in a fight.

501
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,420
Poor baby.

502
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:17,220
Can we make spoons?

503
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,887
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

504
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,623
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

505
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:25,099
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

506
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:27,033
Let me take this jacket off.

507
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,899
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

508
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,271
Uh-huh.

509
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,799
I wish I had a pot.

510
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:38,209
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

511
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:39,942
and you wish you had some pot?

512
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:41,949
A pot.

513
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,009
A pot belly.

514
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:46,213
Pot bellies are sexy.

515
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:49,190
Well, you should be happy...

516
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,714
'cause you have one.

517
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,124
[Chuckling]
Shut up, fatso!

518
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,185
I don't have a pot.

519
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,992
I have a bit of a tummy...

520
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:57,931
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

521
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,456
It's not the same thing.

522
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,264
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

523
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:03,271
between a pot belly and a tummy.

524
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,899
The difference is huge.

525
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,238
[Kisses]

526
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:09,540
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

527
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,478
No. Pot bellies make a man...

528
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:15,278
Iook either oafish
or like a gorilla.

529
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:19,344
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

530
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:20,719
The rest of you is normal.

531
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:25,090
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

532
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:29,427
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

533
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,898
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

534
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,560
to accentuate it.

535
00:25:33,602 --> 00:25:36,571
You think men
would find that attractive?

536
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:39,574
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

537
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:42,042
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

538
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,410
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

539

[Sighs]

540
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,218
If you had a pot belly...

541
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:52,220
I would punch you in it.

542
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:54,779
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

543
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,848
Ah! I'd smother you.

544
00:25:56,892 --> 00:26:00,350
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

546
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,397

00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:22,240
Yes, I did.

553
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,478
Good job, sugar pop.

554
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,713
Did everything go as planned?

555
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:27,881

You didn't listen to the radio?

558
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,550
I never listen to your fights.

559
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:33,891
Were you the winner?

560
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,295
I won, all right.

561
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:37,958
Are you still retiring?

562
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,296
Sure am.

563
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,734
So, it all worked out
in the finish?

564
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,228
We're not at the finish yet,
baby.

565
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,936
Mmm.

566
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:57,277
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

567
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:01,618
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

568
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,391
But they won't find us,
will they?

569
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,957
Do you still want me
to go with you?

570
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,765
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance, it's...
