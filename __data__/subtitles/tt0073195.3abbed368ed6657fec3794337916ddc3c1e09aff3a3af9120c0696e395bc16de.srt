1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,861
When I first hear
the word "jaws",

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,919
you know, I just think
of a period in my life

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,868
when I was much younger
than I am right now.

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,295
And I think, because I was younger,

5
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:20,883
I was more courageous, or I was
more stupid. I'm not sure which.

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,253
So, when I think of <i>Jaws</i>,
I think about courage and stupidity.

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,885
And I think of both of those
things existing underwater.

8
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,364
I had been thinking for years
about a story about a shark

9
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,512
that attacks people,

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,984
and what would happen if it
came in and wouldn't go away.

11
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,793
I hadn't done anything with it really.

12
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,429
Then, in 1964,

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,156
I read a story about a shark
fisherman off Long Island

14
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:44,809
who caught a 4,550-pound great white shark

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,903
off the beaches of Long Island.

16
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:51,224
I thought, "Wow! What would happen if one of
these things came in and wouldn't go away?"

17
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,653
Again, I didn't do anything
about it until 1970 or '71,

18
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,487
when a publisher finally said,
"That's an interesting story.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,289
"I'll pay you a couple of
dollars if you'll put it on paper."

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,806
So that's how the idea began.

21
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,977
One of the many accidents that
happened with Jaws was the title.

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,814
We had no idea of the title.

23
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:10,501
I had thought for months about titles.

24
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,505
I probably had a hundred.
Some of them were pretentious:

25
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,019
<i>The Stillness in the Water.</i>

26
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,994
<i>A Silence in the Deep.
Leviathan Rising.</i>

27
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,940
A lot of them were Françoise Sagan titles.

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,611
You know, terribly
pretentious and very personal.

29
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,638
<i>There were The Jaws of Death
and The Jaws of Leviathan.</i>

30
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,852
They all sounded dramatic or
melodramatic or weird or pretentious.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,474
We came up to 20 minutes
before production.

32
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,639
My editor and I were
lunching at a restaurant

33
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,648
called The Dallas Cowboy in New York.

34
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,851
I said to him, "Look."
This was Tom Condon.

35
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,900
"We cannot agree on a word that we like,

36
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,418
"let alone a title that we like.

37
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:53,225
"In fact, the only word that we even
think means or says anything is 'jaws.'

38
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,224
"Call the book <i>Jaws</i>".

39
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,132
He said, "What does it
mean?" I said, "I don't know.

40
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,920
"But it's short, it fits on a jacket,

41
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,672
"and it may work."

42
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,088
He said, "Okay, we'll
call the thing Jaws."

43
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,312
At first, nobody knew what they had here,

44
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,073
including myself.
It was a first novel.

45
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:12,445
It was a first novel about a fish,

46
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:15,042
and it had no great prospects.

47
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,200
But Tom Condon, the editor at Doubleday,

48
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,104
sensed that there was more here
than just a first novel about a fish.

49
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,369
So it was sent out

50
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,990
to the Book-of-the-Month Club
and The Literary Guild

51
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,724
and Bantam and other paperback houses.

52
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,574
The first response was

53
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,699
from the Book-of-the-Month Club,

54
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:38,475
which made it an "A" book, meaning
it is selected for a main selection

55
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,977
or it is in the running
for a main selection.

56
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,911
Suddenly people began to think,
whoops, we may have something more here

57
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,176
than just a first novel,
which nobody will read,

58
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,230
and a first novel about a
fish, which who cares less.

59
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,115
<i>Then the Reader's Digest
selected it as a selection</i>

60
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,922
and the Book-of-the-Month Club
made it an "A" book, main selection.

61
00:02:56,993 --> 00:03:00,679
Then Bantam bought it for what
was then an enormous sum of money,

62
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,995
$575,000.

63
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,729
Then it went out to the movie auctions.

64
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,951
And, in those days, we're
now talking many years ago,

65
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,144
it went to Zanuck and Brown
at Universal for $150,000.

66
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,261
Which was, to me, the moon.

67
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,892
I had no money at all.
I had, in the bank, $300.

68
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,896
Both Dick Zanuck and I
saw or heard about the book

69
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,906
at identical times.

70
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,854
I heard about it from a small
card in the fiction department

71
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,705
of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, edited by my wife,
Helen Gurley Brown,

72
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,446
which gave a brief description of the
plot of this novel by Peter Benchley,

73
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,794
and then said, "Might make a good movie."

74
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:44,022
We both read it overnight,

75
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,606
got on the phone with each
other the next morning and said,

76
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,544
"We don't know how we can possibly do it."

77
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:54,983
But we decided we must
have this, whatever it takes.

78
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,986
This is the most exciting
thing we've ever read,

79
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:01,638
and we'll figure out later
how we can make it.

80
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,904
Had we read it twice, in my opinion,

81
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,644
we never would have made <i>Jaws</i>.

82
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:10,377
Because anybody with a
modicum of production knowledge

83
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,419
would know there was no way to get a man…

84
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,218
Get a shark

85
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,270
to leap on the stern of a
small boat and swallow a man.

86
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,639
How were we going to do this?

87
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,644
Were we going to do it in animation?

88
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,909
Who was going to do this?
We never thought about it.

89
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,541
We just loved the book.

90
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,244
We thought it would make
a very good movie.

91
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:34,067
The deal was subject to a meeting

92
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,505
with Mr. Benchley.

93
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,941
Who we'd never met before, actually.

94
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,396
And the agency also very much wanted us

95
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:45,663
to tie a director of theirs,
one of their clients,

96
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:49,763
into this whole package.

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,868
So we had agreed to… I'm not
going to mention this person's name

98
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:56,572
because this is not a flattering story.

99
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,991
But we had agreed, in our anxiety,

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,411
to secure the rights to the book

101
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,785
to put on this person as a director.

102
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:08,848
There was a director, and I
really don't remember who it was,

103
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,596
who kept saying, "I've always
wanted to make a movie about a whale."

104
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,965
At the end of it, Zanuck
said, "That's the end of that."

105
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,083
When the director who
was going to direct a whale

106
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,634
was vanquished from our sight…

107
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:27,337
And here was Steven
Spielberg. Director, filmmaker…

108
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,607
Sugar/and Express,
right within sight of us.

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,298
Steven actually… And there
are many versions of this.

110
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,927
Steven will tell you his,
probably the true one.

111
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:41,782
I just remember seeing a very
large, you know, block of pages

112
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:45,656
that said Jaws on it, and I
didn't know what that meant.

113
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,994
What was Jaws?
Was it about a dentist?

114
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,841
Was this, you know, was it…

115
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,364
Because <i>Jaws</i> did not have a…

116
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,929
It was not in the national
consciousness at the time.

117
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,374
It was just a word. It was
kind of an unusual word.

118
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,935
I remember borrowing a
copy to read over the weekend

119
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:06,313
and discovering I was
completely uninformed,

120
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:11,230
not knowing that it was a
book about a great white shark.

121
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,399
A predator off a beach

122
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:18,359
in a kind of, you know,
Cape Cod-esque town.

123
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,179
I had no idea this was about to become

124
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,410
one of the best-selling
books in the nation.

125
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,960
I read it, and I said to myself, "Wow,

126
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,972
"this is just like a movie I just made

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,841
<i>"about a truck and a hapless driver,</i>

128
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,022
<i>"called Duel."</i>

129
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:40,706
Of course I'm young and
I'm stupid and I'm saying,

130
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,627
"Duel. Gee, that has four words…

131
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,785
"Duel has four letters
and Jaws has four letters,

132
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,802
"and they're both about these leviathans

133
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,209
"Preying upon everyman."

134
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,328
I saw such a comparison between Duel,

135
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,280
which I <i>had done previous to
Sugar land Express, and Jaws,</i>

136
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,120
I said to myself, "This is kind of the
sequel to <i>Duel,</i> only it's on the water."

137
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,640
I got very interested in it because,
coincidentally, the producers of Jaws

138
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:14,025
had just been my producers on
my first feature, Sugar/and <i>Express,</i>

139
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,182
Dick Zanuck and David Brown.

140
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,812
I asked them if this was
something I could direct next.

141
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:23,157
The first thing Dick Zanuck
and David Brown said to me is,

142
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,068
"We want to get rid of the back stories.

143
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,620
"We want to make this
an A-Z adventure story.

144
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,582
"We do not want to have
any of that involvement

145
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,303
"with a romance between
Hooper and Mrs. Brody.

146
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,490
"We don't want to talk about the
Mafia or about anything like that.

147
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,784
"We want to make this a
straight-line adventure story."

148
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,058
Peter Benchley did a very
good adaptation of his own novel.

149
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,863
Then Peter kind of turned
it over to me and said,

150
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,779
"Here it is.
Do with it what you want."

151
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,586
At that point, I didn't quite
know what to do with it,

152
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,059
'cause it wasn't the movie
I wanted to make next.

153
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:01,371
I quite didn't know the movie I
wanted to make from the novel Jaws.

154
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,240
I knew about the third act,
and I knew about the first act.

155
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,913
I just didn't know about the second
act, which was going to be a 60-page act.

156
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,673
I remember sitting down
and writing the script myself.

157
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,557
Doing an entire draft
myself, from beginning to end.

158
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,652
Which I haven't shown to very many people.

159
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,461
And I don't even think I have it anymore.

160
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,559
But I remember a few
of the scenes did survive

161
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,729
the movie, and wound up in the film.

162
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,570
But it was more of an exercise for me

163
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,725
to become familiar with what
I wanted Jaws to become.

164
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,310
It was an exercise
that was very beneficial

165
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,383
because I suddenly
had a vision of the film

166
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,602
even though I didn't
possess the skills to write it.

167
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,657
David Brown and Dick Zanuck both suggested

168
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,704
that I go to Howard Sackler,

169
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,124
<i>who had written The Great White Hope.</i>

170
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:52,597
We went from Peter Benchley to a
writer by the name of Howard Sackler.

171
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,603
Who was a Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright

172
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,746
<i>who wrote The Great White Hope.</i>

173
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:03,555
He had been working
on something else for us.

174
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,608
He also was an expert scuba diver,

175
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,024
and scuba dived all around the world.

176
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,195
Was very familiar, as is
Benchley, by the way…

177
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,397
Great diver.

178
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,204
Very familiar with sharks
and underwater activity.

179
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:23,155
Howard Sackler specifically
asked not to have credit.

180
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,528
He only had a limited time
to give to the film.

181
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,068
Therefore, he said, "I don't want credit."

182
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,479
But he was, I think…

183
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,899
Spielberg would say he was very important

184
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:39,275
in that terrible phrase
of motion picture-making:

185
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,746
He "broke the back of the story."

186
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,328
Sackler broke the back of
the movie and got me to say,

187
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,801
"Yes, I'll make this movie
next. I'm committing."

188
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,896
Then came something
that's not been recorded

189
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,657
in the history of Jaws.

190
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,341
The Screen Actors Guild contract

191
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,755
was about to expire at
the end of June of that year.

192
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:02,244
It could have been 1973,
perhaps, whenever the year was.

193
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:06,733
The studio decreed that
no movie would be started

194
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,152
that could not be finished
by June 30 of that year,

195
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,894
because they didn't want to be struck.

196
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,795
That is, that photography was completed.

197
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,680
Steven Spielberg, Richard Zanuck
and I met at the Bel-Air Hotel.

198
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,563
And Steven said,
"I don't have a script yet.

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,018
"You're asking me to
start this movie in April?"

200
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,278
Whenever it was, I don't
know, maybe this was February.

201
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,791
He said, "I don't have a script."

202
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,869
And I said, "Who can we get?"

203
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,404
He said, "There's a man
named Carl Gottlieb.

204
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,234
"I'm thinking about him for the movie.“

205
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,768
I was hired first as an actor because,

206
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,176
if I was going to be on
the set, I could at least help

207
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,864
in the improvisations and crowd scenes
and finding stuff to do in the moment,

208
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:54,768
which had been my job on stage
at the Committee as an improviser.

209
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,239
Steven thought that
would be useful to the film

210
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,674
to be able to go with the flow

211
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,086
and find things on the set and improvise.

212
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,257
In fact, some of the best lines in
the film are improvised by the actors

213
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,733
based on their characters in the script.

214
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,318
I asked Carl Gottlieb, who was a
friend of mine, to come in to do a polish

215
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,438
and to actually help me…

216
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,591
If I wanted to improvise scenes,

217
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:22,256
Carl would be there to help organize
the improvisation and put it on paper.

218
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:26,018
I said that we have a
chance to make a movie

219
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,067
that's going to do for the ocean
what the shower scene did to Psycho,

220
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:34,337
in terms of affecting a generation
with, kind of, a fear of the water.

221
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,129
To this day, when people
come up to me and learn

222
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,758
that I worked on the screenplay
of Jaws, and talk to me about it,

223
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,566
inevitably, the first thing they say is,
"That summer I didn't go swimming."

224
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,369
Or "I've been afraid of the
water ever since that movie."

225
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,870
Or "I'm always thinking of
sharks when I go swimming.

226
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:54,242
"In Hawaii, I don't go swimming
at all." I hear that to this day.

227
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,826
So, surprisingly enough,

228
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,733
that was my first reaction
to the script and the story.

229
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,931
It's the thing that appears
to have carried through,

230
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:06,055
and is one of the overwhelming
impressions that we made.

231
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,150
It's, you know, become popular culture.

232
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,678
When you do a straight-line
adventure film like <i>Jaws,</i>

233
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:15,912
anything that doesn't contribute
to the suspense or the humanity

234
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,130
or the horror, has to go.

235
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,505
I wanted to introduce
Quint, not in his boat,

236
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,237
<i>laughing at all the yahoos on shore,</i>

237
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,246
<i>in that one little visual
where the Orca goes by</i>

238
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,612
<i>with Quint laughing and chuckling</i>

239
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,402
<i>at the tiger shark that
obviously isn't the predator</i>

240
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,961
<i>that's been killing all
the people in the vicinity.</i>

241
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,258
I had another thing that
I'd written in my script.

242
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,941
As you recall, I wrote
an entire script of Jaws

243
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,678
after Benchley and before Sackler.

244
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,727
And this was one of the
scenes that I had written.

245
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,004
That Robert Shaw, or Quint, is in a
movie theater watching <i>Moby Dick</i>

246
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,272
on the island of Amity
at the local movie house.

247
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,208
He's laughing all the way
through it. He can't stop laughing.

248
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:02,544
It's so silly, the mechanical white
whale, Ahab with his big harpoon,

249
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,994
stabbing the whale as
he's lashed to the belly,

250
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,482
and the whale sounding and
coming up again, and he's still…

251
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,217
This mechanical figure is still sticking

252
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,191
the mechanical harpoon in the whale.

253
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,342
I just had Quint laughing hysterically.

254
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,195
Laughing so hard
and so sort of maliciously

255
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,759
that people get up and start
leaving the theater until he's all alone,

256
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,919
and his laughter can be
heard right down the street.

257
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,469
That was in my script.

258
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,472
But in trying to get the rights to Moby
<i>Dick,</i> which Gregory Peck controlled,

259
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,930
Greg wasn't opposed

260
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,129
to the use of that scene that way in <i>Jaws</i>.

261
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:43,764
He just claimed that he wasn't
really proud of <i>Moby Dick.</i>

262
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,004
It was not the proudest
moment in his body of work,

263
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,860
and just didn't really want
us to either make fun of it

264
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,007
or just include it at all in the movie.

265
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,410
So we could never get
the rights to use <i>Moby Dick.</i>

266
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,965
It's part of the film making process.

267
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,415
You write stuff you think you want to see.

268
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,074
Then you sit down and analyze
it, for all kinds of reasons,

269
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,545
for dramatic reasons,
it's hard to fit them in.

270
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,800
Or for production reasons, or
sometimes they're redundant.

271
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:16,078
For example, the guys on the
pier, one of them losing his leg.

272
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,033
Well, we have a guy losing
his leg elsewhere in the film.

273
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,823
So, it was, you know,
one lost leg too many.

274
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,899
It would have given
the shark a matched set.

275
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:30,727
For us, it was not <i>as</i> useful to the
plot. It would have been repetitive.

276
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,351
I had this idea that
there's a harbormaster,

277
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,050
and he's in his little shack.

278
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,542
There's all these sailboats.
It's night.

279
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,369
There's about 20 sailboats
with just their masts sticking up.

280
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,471
The harbormaster in my script,

281
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,890
he's watching a movie with Glenn Ford

282
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,741
<i>called Don't Go Near the Water,</i>

283
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,900
which I thought film
aficionados would get off on.

284
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,655
They'd say, "Clever. He's
watching Don't Go Near the Water."

285
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,692
Meanwhile, in the back you
notice, as he's watching this movie,

286
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,319
one mast starts to go like this.

287
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,909
Then the ship next to it,
that mast goes like this.

288
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,111
Then the third mast goes
like this, and the fourth mast…

289
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:06,850
Until all of a sudden you see,
in sequential order,

290
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:11,702
something is traveling beneath
the keels of all these sailboats,

291
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,506
and all the masts are moving,

292
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,126
getting closer to the harbormaster.

293
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,715
As the harbormaster goes down to
clean out his coffeepot in the harbor.

294
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,049
As he gets down there
to clean out his coffeepot,

295
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,135
he, of course, is taken by the shark.

296
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,426
That was a scene that
was in my original script

297
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,587
that we just basically
couldn't afford to shoot.

298
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,523
In its place, I wrote this other scene,

299
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,109
which was also in my original script,

300
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:39,001
that slid over to this one,
which is the pier.

301
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,587
The two fishermen who
take the Sunday pot roast

302
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:47,688
and a huge chain and a large
Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style hook,

303
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,616
and toss it into the current
and the tide takes it out.

304
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,749
Of course, the shark takes the
bait and the pier comes right off.

305
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,447
<i>The guy comes off the pier.</i>

306
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,265
<i>The reason I wanted the scene
in the movie was for one shot.</i>

307
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:03,461
<i>Not seeing the shark was important
to me because it was scarier.</i>

308
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:07,864
<i>In my opinion, seeing the pier
going off, stopping and turning,</i>

309
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:10,863
<i>and the pier itself coming
back for the swimmer…</i>

310
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,647
Charlie, take my word
for it, don't look back!

311
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,316
Swim, Charlie!

312
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,117
I've heard that Steven wanted to have
the old couple from Sugar/and Express,

313
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:34,854
whose car was stolen,
turn up in their car in Amity.

314
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,185
What's the story?

315
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,968
The missus and I just had
our car taken by an ex-con.

316
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,553
Claimed he was a workingman.

317
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,121
Was it a green Buick?

318
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,962
Seafoam green, 1956.

319
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,339
Road master, B-O-W-44.
Stole!

320
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,713
- You Alvin T. Nocker of New Frankfort?
- Oh, yes, sir.

321
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,195
Now you're talking.
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,651
You just stay put.

323
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,815
I wanted them to be passing through Amity.

324
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,896
Maybe even going to the beach
and spreading out a picnic blanket.

325
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,873
Even fantasizing and saying…

326
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,679
Perhaps Mr. Nocker blows up an inner tube,

327
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,145
and we get the idea that maybe
he'll go out in the water with his wife.

328
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,462
I thought, "This movie's too hard to make.

329
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,474
"I've got to stop making
it harder on myself."

330
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,012
We thought that

331
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,276
to legitimize the movie,

332
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,794
there should be

333
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:36,384
some real shark footage in the picture.

334
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:40,973
We had anticipated having
much more in the picture

335
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:44,274
than actually ended up being in it.

336
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:48,614
So we sent a second unit
down to Australia.

337
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,389
Ron and Valerie Taylor were
engaged in order to shoot

338
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:56,403
<i>real shark footage off of Australia.</i>

339
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,894
<i>Which they were well experienced at doing.</i>

340
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,676
My recollection is they were
involved with Peter Gimbel.

341
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,117
I may be wrong about that.
<i>Blue</i> Water, <i>White</i> Death.

342
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,298
<i>Blue Water, White Death was and</i> is

343
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,422
the finest documentary
ever made on sharks.

344
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,120
It was done by Peter Gimbel

345
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:19,045
with Ron and Valerie Taylor
and Stan Waterman.

346
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,642
They went with Rodney Fox
down south in Australia,

347
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,430
and they found the great white shark,

348
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,655
and they did a documentary that
stands alone 20-some years later

349
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,050
as the pinnacle of shark documentaries,

350
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,389
no matter what else has been done.

351
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,690
The producers asked Peter Gimbel

352
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:37,461
if he would do the camera work on <i>Jaws,</i>

353
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:41,662
and Peter said, "No, I won't do the
camera work, but I'll direct for you."

354
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,816
We said, "But, Peter, you've only
directed sharks in a documentary.

355
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,235
"We're going to have actors."

356
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:50,143
He said, "I don't care.
I want to direct."

357
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:53,307
So Peter Gimbel never got
to be associated with Jaws.

358
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,100
We joked about it many times.

359
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,796
Peter said, "Sorry, I can't
work on the production for you,

360
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,801
"but there are a couple in
Australia, Ron and Valerie Taylor,

361
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,155
"who have experience
with the great white shark.

362
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,160
"Why don't you contact them?"

363
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,256
Sure enough, Universal
Pictures contacted Valerie and I.

364
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,546
I said, "Yes, I think we can
do the underwater shooting

365
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,167
"of live sharks in South Australia."

366
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,264
So they flew me to America,

367
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:23,472
and I spoke with Steven
Spielberg and Joe Alves,

368
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,560
and met the production team over there,

369
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,134
and explained what I thought we could do

370
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,669
with the real, live great white sharks.

371
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,285
But I explained that our sharks
were only about 14 feet long,

372
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:38,817
whereas Jaws was about 26 feet long.

373
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,306
I had this idea of doing a miniature cage

374
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,679
and putting a little person into a midget…

375
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,560
Into a miniature cage.

376
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:50,082
And taking the little person…

377
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,584
That would have effectively
scaled the shark up

378
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,573
and added another, you know, nine feet

379
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,671
to the overall length of the shark.

380
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,740
That kind of made sense to me.

381
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:06,385
But I was looking for a little person
who was in scale with the cage

382
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,373
and was interviewing
a number of little people.

383
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:14,120
I remember this tenacious gentleman

384
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,427
who came in to see me, bleeding.

385
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,968
I said, "Why are you bleeding?"

386
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:22,334
He said, "I was afraid I was going
to be late. I really want this job.

387
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:25,921
"I got into a traffic accident in
front of the main gate at Universal."

388
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,892
I said, "You did?" He said, "I
came here to have the meeting."

389
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,140
I said, "Did you leave
the scene of the accident?

390
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,897
"You're not supposed to."

391
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,814
We sent him back to the accident

392
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,364
to fill out the report with the police.

393
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,519
I remember I was thinking,
"What a brave man."

394
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,839
And, "He really wants this job."

395
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,372
And I was…

396
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,061
I was young and courageous
and stupid, and I hired him.

397
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,064
His name was Carl Rizzo.

398
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,330
Hollywood sent us this little
man, and he couldn't dive.

399
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,115
He had spent most
of his life riding horses,

400
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,749
doubling for children in
films like National Velvet.

401
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,975
He'd doubled for Elizabeth Taylor.

402
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:06,547
We had to take him out
and stuff him into a cage

403
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:09,016
and dangle him into
the cold, southern ocean,

404
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:13,248
and have big, huge, monstrous
sharks swimming around him.

405
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,548
He was very much afraid,
and we had a lot of difficulty

406
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,186
getting him into the cage, which
is probably quite understandable.

407
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,862
<i>We did have two dummies,</i>

408
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,244
<i>because we were supposed
to have somebody in the cage</i>

409
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,151
<i>when the shark broke it up.</i>

410
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,072
<i>But we had Carl, and he was much better.</i>

411
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,130
<i>He looked better in the
cage, and moved around a bit.</i>

412
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,705
We'd been working for about a week,

413
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,760
and we still hadn't got the shots

414
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,983
of the shark attacking the cage.

415
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:20,989
They don't normally do that.
They'd rather attack a bait.

416
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,139
There were three sharks
in the area at the time,

417
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,292
and two of them were fairly timid,

418
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:30,412
<i>but one of them came in
and he was a big, strong shark,</i>

419
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,257
<i>and he swam around.</i>

420
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:35,736
We had the small cage, the
half-size cage, hanging on a bridle

421
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,853
attached to a winch
on the deck of the skippy.

422
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,270
He swam over it and got
his nose caught in the bridle

423
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:46,895
and tried to swim forward
and became trapped.

424
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,432
When a white shark is trapped,

425
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,913
it goes crazy, and
that's exactly what he did.

426
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,405
Ron was filming underwater,

427
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,449
and actually, that's how we
got that footage, and they used it.

428
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:01,724
They wanted someone
in the cage at the time,

429
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,491
but there was nobody in the cage.

430
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,864
So they changed the script

431
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:08,814
to suit that sequence
because it was so dramatic.

432
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:49,139
<i>It looked like the
shark was destroying the cage,</i>

433
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:51,121
and, in fact, it did.

434
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,914
It did a lot of damage to the cage.

435
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:55,349
It broke it away from the small boat,

436
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,102
<i>and the whole lot came
tumbling down past me</i>

437
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,928
<i>and crashed down onto the bottom.</i>

438
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:05,067
<i>That was the scariest thing, I
think, I've ever seen underwater</i>

439
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,238
<i>because the whole lot was crashing.</i>

440
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,088
<i>I could see the shark and the cage</i>

441
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:12,213
<i>all crashing around down on the bottom,</i>

442
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,309
<i>and I thought we were
going to lose the cage.</i>

443
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,196
<i>Of course, it had been
broken away from the boat.</i>

444
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,049
<i>The shark got out and swam away,</i>

445
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,580
but there were two other
sharks still in the area.

446
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:39,686
And there was no way that
I could swim out of my cage

447
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:40,854
and attach a rope.

448
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,173
So what we did, we lowered
my cage down onto the bottom,

449
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,493
and I put my feet through
the bottom of my cage,

450
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,723
and picked my cage up, almost
like a lady pulls her skirt up,

451
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:57,387
and walked the cage and myself
over the bottom about 50 feet

452
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:01,290
to the other broken cage,
which was lying on the bottom,

453
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,141
tied it to my cage,

454
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:07,132
and then I signaled for them to
pull us both back to the surface.

455
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,829
Then why don't we have one more drink

456
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:21,165
and go down and cut that shark open?

457
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,863
Martin?
Can you do that?

458
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,246
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

459
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:36,081
Roy Scheider was interesting,
the story of how I cast him.

460
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,445
Because here's a situation where
I was going after other actors.

461
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,287
I went after a whole series of actors
before him, a lot of them unknowns.

462
00:25:43,358 --> 00:25:47,022
People that no one had
ever heard of before,

463
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:49,076
but I was familiar with,
from seeing Serpico.

464
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,980
There was an actor in Serpico
I kind of liked,

465
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:55,395
and another actor on an
off-Broadway play I had just seen.

466
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,567
But the studio and Zanuck and Brown
were urging me to get a name in this part.

467
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,884
I was having trouble
finding a name that I liked,

468
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,463
and who would do it.

469
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,731
I remember I was at a party one night…

470
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:11,315
And my agent brought me over
to be introduced to him.

471
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:15,072
He was having a conversation with
a writer named Tracy Keenan Wynn.

472
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,489
As I approached,

473
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,744
I heard a conversation that
went something like this…

474
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:24,339
"We're going to have to have this
giant shark come out of the water

475
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,216
"and land on a boat
and crack the boat in half."

476
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:33,064
And then I was introduced
to him and he said hello.

477
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,655
He was very polite, nice, pleasant.

478
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,754
Then, as I was walking away, they
picked up this conversation again.

479
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,242
I remember saying to my
agent as we walked away,

480
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:44,616
"Those guys, they gotta be kidding.

481
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,736
"A giant shark that cracks a boat
in half?" I thought they were loony.

482
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,718
I told him the entire story.

483
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,522
At the end of the story he said,

484
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:56,576
"Wow, that's a great story.
What about me?"

485
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:01,119
I looked at Roy and I said, "Yeah,
you know, you'd be a great Chief Brody."

486
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,530
<i>'Cause</i> I <i>had</i> loved <i>Roy from
The French Connection,</i>

487
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:06,734
where he played Gene Hackman's partner.

488
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,050
And that's how that came about.

489
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,278
Could you tell me how I
could find Chief Brody?

490
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:13,542
Who are you?

491
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,856
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

492
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,482
Richard Dreyfuss wasn't
my first choice either.

493
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,216
I went to Jon Voight first,
and he said no.

494
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,850
I think I'd interviewed Timothy Bottoms.

495
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,701
I interviewed a number of actors.

496
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,711
Perhaps Jeff Bridges.

497
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,180
I was a big fan of the entire
cast from <i>Last Picture</i> Show.

498
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:34,296
I remember saying if I could
just get every member of the cast

499
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,236
to say no to me to play
the Hooper character,

500
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:40,685
at least I will have gone to one
of my favorite movies of all time,

501
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:43,211
to have gone out after that group.

502
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,354
So I think Bridges and Bottoms,

503
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,898
and I think we got turned down,

504
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,899
or there were unavailability problems.

505
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,617
In the movies these things happen.

506
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,427
People want to do it and they can't

507
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,052
because they're booked
into something else.

508
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:58,658
I remember Dreyfuss…

509
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,371
I cast Dreyfuss because
I loved American Graffiti,

510
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,699
and I had seen him in that.

511
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,918
And George Lucas was
the person who said to me,

512
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,229
"Why don't you cast Ricky
Dreyfuss? He'd be great."

513
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,290
He told me this movie
that he wanted to make,

514
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,919
and it was really a shocker.

515
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,555
Even as he was telling it to me as a tale,

516
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:23,465
it was a great, exciting story.

517
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,972
These three guys alone on the boat,
and the shark attacking the boat and…

518
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,937
At the end he said, "You
want to make this film?"

519
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,888
And I said, “No."

520
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,745
And he said, "Why not?"

521
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:42,361
And I said, "This sounds like
it's going to be a great movie.

522
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,785
"I'd rather watch this movie than shoot it

523
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,882
"because it's going to be
a bitch to shoot."

524
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:52,521
And I said… And he was surprised.

525
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:57,592
I said, "I just wouldn't do well under
these circumstances," so I said no.

526
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,606
Then a few months later, I went to see
the opening of a film I'd done in Canada.

527
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,613
<i>It was the premiere of a film</i> called
<i>The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.</i>

528
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:12,298
And I saw myself,
really for the first time

529
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:17,546
in the lead in a movie,
with my face 15 feet high,

530
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,990
on screen for 90 minutes,
and I had a heart attack.

531
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,746
I had a total nervous
collapse. I thought I was awful.

532
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,949
I figured that I'd better
get a job really soon.

533
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,053
So I called Steven.

534
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:36,270
I said, "If you still want to
offer me that job, I'll take it."

535
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,469
And he said yes.

536
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,102
So, in essence,

537
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:45,058
I came crawling to Martha's
Vineyard for the part.

538
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:49,376
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

539
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,219
There's too many captains on this island.

540
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,393
$10,000 for me, by myself.

541
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,907
For that you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

542
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,176
My first choice to play Quint
was Lee Marvin.

543
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:08,355
I wanted to go for
Lee Marvin to play Quint,

544
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,772
but Lee Marvin wasn't interested.

545
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,343
I think what I heard was, he
wanted to go fishing for real.

546
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,462
He took his fishing seriously,
and didn't want to go fishing

547
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:23,880
from a movie boat with cameras.

548
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,787
That wasn't his idea of a vacation.

549
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,452
It turned out not to be anybody's
idea of a vacation, making Jaws.

550
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,526
My second choice was Sterling Hayden,

551
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,375
who I thought would make an amazing Quint.

552
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,585
He had an Ahab quality about him,

553
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:45,502
and he had actually clone a movie
years ago, where he played a whaler

554
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,642
with a harpoon that he
carried around with him.

555
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,441
A very imposing character.

556
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,879
I was a big fan of his,

557
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:52,980
<i>certainly from Dr. Strange love</i>

558
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,861
and, you know, the
two Kubrick films he did.

559
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:59,515
And, as it turned out,
he couldn't do it either.

560
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,726
I forgot actually what the
reason was he couldn't do it.

561
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:07,362
And there were other actors
who wanted to play Quint,

562
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:11,300
and then Dick Zanuck and David
Brown suggested Robert Shaw.

563
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:15,636
It was their idea, because they had just
worked with Robert Shaw in The Sting,

564
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,210
which they produced, and loved him.

565
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:23,843
I'd screened two movies I'd already
seen of Shaw's, just to refresh my memory.

566
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,320
<i>One oi them, of course,
was A Man for All Seasons.</i>

567
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,582
He was spectacular in that.

568
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:35,005
Based on that and, of course,
From <i>Russia with</i> Love…

569
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,490
That great fight scene

570
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,499
where he played the
nemesis of 007 in the train.

571
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,482
I said, "Wow, I wish I had
thought of it. It's a great idea.“

572
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:48,080
So he, fortunately, said yes.

573
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:52,189
Robert was one of the most
powerful people I've ever met.

574
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,406
Incredibly intense.

575
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,928
I mean, it was something
that radiated out of him.

576
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,545
He was a remarkably
gifted actor and writer.

577
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,625
He was also, unfortunately,

578
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,791
the most extraordinarily
competitive person.

579
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:12,942
Unnecessarily competitive.

580
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,515
<i>I think that probably, if anything,</i>

581
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,804
<i>that was his flaw.</i>

582
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,267
You got city hands,
Mr. Hooper.

583
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,636
You been counting money all your life.

584
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,709
All right, all right.
Hey, I don't need this.

585
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,609
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.

586
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,178
You're not going to do this
aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?

587
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:36,555
Michael, did you hear your
father? Out of the water now!

588
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:37,605
Now!

589
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:41,726
The first person I cast for the
movie, in fact, was Lorraine,

590
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,558
who I'd loved in a TV
movie I'd seen her do

591
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,461
<i>called The Marcus-Nelson Murders,</i>

592
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,249
starring Telly Savalas and herself,

593
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:49,977
I believe, as Telly's in that.

594
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,395
I thought she was a very natural actress,

595
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,984
almost improvisational in her style.

596
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,615
She brought a realism to the movie,

597
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,103
and to that family, which I had wanted.

598
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,942
Ellen is very clear to me
and always has been.

599
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,732
You say Roy Scheider in his character

600
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,733
feels guilt because of the children.

601
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,211
I'm a mother, I'm a wife, and I'm Jewish.

602
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,951
What could be clearer to me than
how to make somebody feel guilty?

603
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,323
This is something that I do in
my sleep. It's what I've trained for.

604
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,863
And I have two sons,
just like Ellen Brody.

605
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,264
The suggestion that I made
to Steven at the time was

606
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,548
to try to develop the script,

607
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,654
so it had the same kind of
linear simplicity that Duel had.

608
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:35,271
I thought that was
a reasonably good prototype

609
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,975
to follow.

610
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,782
And I remember some time later,

611
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:46,302
my wife was upset with me…

612
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:47,967
I put upset in quotes.

613
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:51,525
Because a lot of the stuff that
we took out had to do with affairs

614
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,314
that this particular character,

615
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,110
as I recalled, had in the book.

616
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:57,515
Of course I was upset about it,

617
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:59,930
but I was very happy to be cast.

618
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:03,901
Martin, it's all psychological.

619
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:08,003
You yell, "Barracuda!" and
everybody says, "Huh? What?"

620
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,162
You yell, "Shark!"…

621
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:15,431
we've got a panic on our
hands on the Fourth of July.

622
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,000
Murray Hamilton I've been a fan of,

623
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:20,485
from The <i>FBI</i> Story with James Stewart

624
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:24,556
to The Graduate and that great
scene, you know, with Dustin Hoffman,

625
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:27,712
where he tells Dustin to go
off and sow some wild oats.

626
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,617
I just always wanted to work with him.

627
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,729
I was a big fan of his, and saw
him instantly as the mayor of Amity.

628
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,871
So, I didn't have to
go through nine actors.

629
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,034
He was the first choice for that part,

630
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,657
and I was lucky enough to get him.

631
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:42,561
I have to talk
to Mrs. Kintner.

632
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:44,213
Because this is turning into a contest.

633
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,399
It's not just the Gazette. She's
advertising in out-of-town papers.

634
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,200
People all over New England
are going to know about it.

635
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:52,570
<i>The most painful
thing I've ever done as a writer</i>

636
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,202
is to take my part <i>as</i> an actor
and make it smaller and smaller,

637
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,126
until it was almost gone.

638
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,863
Even though I had good billing,

639
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:03,811
I didn't follow through on screen

640
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,797
with the amount of screen time
I would have liked as an actor.

641
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:11,365
But it was better for the script that
my character not be there so much.

642
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:15,777
Amity Island has long been
known for its clean air, clear water

643
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,980
and beautiful white-sand beaches.

644
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,983
But in recent days

645
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,712
a cloud has appeared on the horizon

646
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,504
of this beautiful resort community.

647
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,188
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

648
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:30,137
One of David Brown's geniuses was
to realize he could play upon the egos

649
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,043
of writers, actors and other people

650
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,797
who are not in the movie business

651
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:37,091
by convincing us that only
by our appearing in the film

652
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,534
could the film achieve its true greatness.

653
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,630
So he came to me and said
would I consider, possibly

654
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,790
as a favor to him, being in this movie?

655
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,888
Well, to a person who's done television
for four years to be in a feature film?

656
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:53,633
This was not exactly a request

657
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,477
that I found it difficult to accept.

658
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,487
So I said, "Sure!"
This was pure ego.

659
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:58,704
Why not be in a feature film?

660
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,168
It was no stretch for me.
It was no risk for him

661
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,177
because I was a television
interviewer professionally, anyway.

662
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,395
So I could do very little wrong.

663
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,200
He wasn't asking me
to play an emotional scene.

664
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:14,028
I was doing what I did for a
living, so it worked out very well.

665
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:18,184
If there was a secondary
purpose to his request,

666
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,944
and David is so wonderfully
gracious that you never know

667
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,630
whether he's just being nice to
you or there's something underneath,

668
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:28,146
it would have been that because
of the publicity surrounding the book

669
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,417
and surrounding the movie,
it couldn't hurt to have me

670
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,736
in the movie, in some category or other.

671
00:36:35,844 --> 00:36:38,962
In Amity Island, this is Alan Cray.

672
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,941
I want to try that end again.

673
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:42,363
Okay?

674
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,215
And there you have it. Two different
opinions by two men of goodwill.

675
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,168
But here in Amity, it seems it's
the public that's making up its mind.

676
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,018
On Amity Island, this is Alan Cray.

677
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,664
All right, Murray, that'll do it.

678
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:58,073
Cut!

679
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,225
Save if!

680
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,871
When it came down to
where we would shoot this film,

681
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:08,603
we sent Joe Alves, our
production designer, out with a team

682
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:13,412
to give us some ideas and
some photographs and pictures of

683
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:17,150
where this town

684
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,716
should be shot, including Jamaica.

685
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,352
We thought of Jamaica primarily
because of the clarity of the water.

686
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:31,013
We could do underwater
work down there, do it all there.

687
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:35,804
And one of the places, obviously,
that they went, among others,

688
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,150
was the island of Martha's Vineyard.

689
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,575
Which, believe it or not,
had never been photographed

690
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:43,270
by a feature film before.

691
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:48,123
They had very strict rules
and regulations there,

692
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,959
and had always kept movie companies in.

693
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,337
So it really was a question
of talking them into letting,

694
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,649
at the height of their season,

695
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,820
letting a big movie company come in there.

696
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:05,810
Martha's Vineyard did present
the problem that this pristine place,

697
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,735
unchanged since the 18th century,

698
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,666
didn't particularly care
for a movie invasion.

699
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,836
They didn't like to see
an artificial shark

700
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,845
parked in a channel
where their homes faced it.

701
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:24,852
And the only set that we built,

702
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,416
<i>which was Quint's shack,</i>

703
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:30,618
<i>we had to post a bond
with the town authorities</i>

704
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:34,344
<i>that everything would be
replaced exactly the way it was.</i>

705
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,329
The billboard in the picture…

706
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:40,015
They put up a billboard
and some kids have come along

707
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:44,646
<i>and made a prank out of it, painted it
with the shark and "Help" and so forth.</i>

708
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:49,273
We had to put up that billboard
one morning, shoot the scene,

709
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,507
and take it down at the end of the day.

710
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,908
That was the only way we could shoot that.

711
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:58,453
There could be nothing done…

712
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,512
We could do nothing to alter the landscape

713
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:05,554
or the beautiful harmony
that existed on the island.

714
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,721
The real attraction of Martha's Vineyard,

715
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:09,524
you couldn't see with the naked eye.

716
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,481
It was the only place on the East Coast

717
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,461
where I could go 12 miles out to sea

718
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:19,740
and still have a sandy bottom only
30 feet below the surface of the water,

719
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,571
where we could put the shark sled

720
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:24,544
and the mechanical shark could function.

721
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:29,227
So Martha's Vineyard was chosen
less because it was a picturesque village.

722
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,428
I could've shot this movie in Sag Harbor

723
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,846
or Montauk or a number of places.

724
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:37,859
It was because of that sandy
bottom 12 miles offshore.

725
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:41,294
It was very important that no matter
what direction my cameras turned,

726
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:42,921
I didn't want to see land.

727
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,197
I felt…

728
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,701
My fear was, the minute the
audience saw land, they'd say,

729
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,601
"This is getting pretty intense out here.

730
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:53,050
"Just turn the boat around and go
toward that land that we keep seeing."

731
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,132
I wanted the audience
to feel very cut off,

732
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:57,109
like they couldn't run back to shore,

733
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,940
'cause there was no shore to run back to.

734
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,882
I was tipped off by somebody on the crew…

735
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,726
We were still here at the Universal lot.

736
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,418
That Steven was going to come in,

737
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:10,355
and he was really thinking
about withdrawing

738
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:13,326
'cause he was very concerned
about the way things were going.

739
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,853
The shark wasn't working.
It seemed hopeless.

740
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:20,014
The script was far from perfect.

741
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:23,545
And a few weeks before, he had

742
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,805
had some T-shirts made up

743
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:29,867
with a big shark on it saying "JAWS."

744
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:32,697
And so

745
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,592
knowing what he was
coming in to talk to me about,

746
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,130
I put on a T-shirt.

747
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:44,084
I put on this T-shirt and was sitting
behind my desk when he came in.

748
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,502
And just seeing me there, I think,

749
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,887
in front of the desk with this T-shirt…

750
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:50,715
And I was saying, "This is the greatest.

751
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,880
"We're going to kill them with this.

752
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,203
"It's great, and you're
going to be great for it."

753
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:59,570
It kind of lifted him back into it.

754
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:03,002
Steven is the most
enthusiastic man I've ever met,

755
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,358
and it brought back that enthusiasm.

756
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,272
What's your name again?

757
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,583
Chrissie.

758
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,360
Where are we going?

759
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,436
Swimming!

760
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,416
<i>I started doing
stunt work, and I specialized in water.</i>

761
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,141
<i>A lot of times when the
water stunts would come up,</i>

762
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,558
<i>I got into doing the water stunts also.</i>

763
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:24,190
<i>Steven Spielberg was a
little bit leery having me</i>

764
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,812
<i>because I wasn't an actress per se.</i>

765
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:29,604
After the first day of shooting…

766
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:32,971
We did the beach scene the
first day, the party scene at night.

767
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,339
We got along wonderful after that.

768
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,469
Whatever I did, he liked.

769
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,569
It was great. He was a
great person to work for.

770
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,616
Come on in the water!

771
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,219
I thought that what could really
be scary was not seeing the shark

772
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:55,569
and just seeing the water, because
we all are familiar with the water.

773
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,580
Very few of us have been
in the water with a shark,

774
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,480
but we've all gone swimming.

775
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,178
The idea of this girl going swimming,

776
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,261
and the audience going swimming with her

777
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:07,490
would have been too
extraordinary if, like a leviathan,

778
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,219
the shark had come out of the water

779
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,853
with its jaws agape, and come down on her.

780
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,694
It would have been a
spectacular opening for the film,

781
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,928
but there would have been
nothing primal about it.

782
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,199
It would just have been a
monster moment that we've all seen.

783
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,873
I really wanted to do it without
seeing the shark in that case.

784
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:28,071
I wanted the violent,
jerking motions to just

785
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,023
<i>start to trigger our
imaginations into either</i>

786
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:34,581
<i>thinking about what's happening
below the surface of the waterline</i>

787
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:37,445
<i>or blocking what was
happening below the surface.</i>

788
00:42:41,576 --> 00:42:44,352
The first jerk down Steven did.

789
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:48,109
He had a cable that came
to the front of my stomach

790
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,692
and went to an anchor that was
laying on the bottom of the ocean.

791
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,636
Then he just sat, and
when he wanted that pulled,

792
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,900
he just would pull.

793
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,633
I could feel him pulling down,

794
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,904
and I'd just throw my head back even more.

795
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:05,482
They wanted to put me
on an electric winch,

796
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:09,013
and I prefer not to use an electric winch

797
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:13,448
because if any of the line
overrode and came to a stop,

798
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:16,391
I might not know it and I
might not be able to get out of it.

799
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:20,021
Being they're pulling me back and
forth in the water, I wanted more control.

800
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,872
<i>So we used manpower.</i>

801
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:25,442
<i>They put cutoff Levis on and
had cables running from me,</i>

802
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,887
out to the side to two pilings,

803
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:30,003
and then all the way in to the beach.

804
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,408
What they would do is, we put
marks on the beach and the guys,

805
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,570
we'd have five or six guys on each line,

806
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,672
and they would run back
and forth from mark to mark.

807
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,376
So I didn't have the hard work to do.

808
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,647
I just sat there and got pulled around.

809
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:45,206
The guys were running
back and forth on the beach.

810
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:49,710
And that's what made my body
move back and forth in the frame.

811
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,057
When I would feel my hips
getting pulled the opposite way,

812
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:57,010
I'd just throw my arms out of
water very violently the opposite way.

813
00:43:57,168 --> 00:44:00,433
So, physically, I could make it
look more violent than what it was.

814
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,165
It hurts!

815
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:11,540
I went to a marine store
and bought a safety hook

816
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:15,318
that you'd use on a sail,
on the halyard of a sail.

817
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,202
I put it onto all the cables
that they hooked to me.

818
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,053
So that, any time during this scene,

819
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,887
if I got in trouble, if I got water,

820
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,041
if I got hurt, God knows what happen,

821
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,261
I could pull one of those strings,

822
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,095
and I was free and clear
and could come to the surface.

823
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,012
So it allowed me, if I got
in a spot, to free myself.

824
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,317
How would anybody know if I
was hurt or I needed anything?

825
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,324
I'm out there screaming like a fool.

826
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,110
Oh, my God!

827
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,205
In the scene where I
was pulled into the buoy,

828
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,815
Steven said, "Let's
have you say something.

829
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,081
"We'll have you say The Lord's Prayer.

830
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:53,715
"Don't the Catholics say
something if they're going to die?

831
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:56,869
"They say something they're
going to say in the confessional,

832
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:59,931
"asking God to forgive you
for all your sins."

833
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:03,667
Unfortunately, I hadn't been going
to church for the last few years,

834
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,247
and I could not remember it.

835
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,498
I swear there were eight Catholics on set,

836
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,199
and between the eight of us
we couldn't come up with it.

837
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:11,685
I felt very bad.

838
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:19,982
Oh, God, help!

839
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:22,698
Please help me!

840
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,030
We looped the film.

841
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:27,837
A lot of stuff we couldn't do
because of the noise made.

842
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:30,423
So you go into a looping studio.

843
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,796
The idea was, how are you going
to sound like you're in the water

844
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,332
sitting in a studio?

845
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:38,277
So we came up with the
idea of getting a baby bassinet

846
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,586
and filling it with water.

847
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,213
So I'm sitting on the sound stage,

848
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,053
with the film up on the screen,

849
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:45,343
on a stool with my little bassinet,

850
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,275
and Richard Dreyfuss came in.

851
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:50,806
I came to visit Steven or I
came to do my own looping.

852
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,816
I'm not really sure now.
It was so long ago.

853
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:59,619
I walked in and Steven had
this beautiful girl's blond head

854
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,230
reared back like this,

855
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:04,256
and he was pouring water
down her throat like this.

856
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:08,114
And telling her to scream
her bloody lungs out.

857
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,003
Which I thought was a rather
interesting way to spend the afternoon,

858
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,801
but not particularly comfortable for her.

859
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,109
But it does work for the movie.

860
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,577
The reason they were doing it
was to make the appropriate sound.

861
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,477
They couldn't do it any other way,

862
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,016
so he just poured that
water down her throat.

863
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:32,269
Oh, Jesus.

864
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,650
The problem was,
they brought the hand to me

865
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,854
and they said, "Here's
the dead girl's hand."

866
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,592
I said, "Wow, it looks like
shiny plastic. It looks fake."

867
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,228
They said, "After a
body's been decomposing

868
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,647
"for a day on the sand,
with the sun coming down,

869
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,191
"it takes on that look."

870
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:52,771
I said, "You might be clinically right,

871
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:55,676
"and a pathologist might look at that

872
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,942
"and admire that moment in Jaws,

873
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,950
"but to me, <i>as</i> an audience
member, it looks fake.

874
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,463
"It looks like plastic."

875
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:06,948
We tried putting powder on it
to get the reflective shine off.

876
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:10,210
We couldn't do that.
So I said, "Well, screw it."

877
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:14,142
I believe I turned to someone
and said, "Let me use your arm."

878
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:16,058
Kind of like we do when we're kids,

879
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,942
we bury our parents in the sand.

880
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,635
I kind of buried her in the sand,

881
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,535
and just had her hand sticking out.

882
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,483
We made up part of the arm,
so right up here,

883
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:28,176
it looked like it had been
bitten off, kind of a subtle way.

884
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,974
Then there were these sand crabs that

885
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,072
we collected and put all over the arm.

886
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,447
They were kind of lethargic
in their movements.

887
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:36,350
To this day, when I see <i>Jaws,</i>

888
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,604
I always have this different vision

889
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:42,119
of 10 times as many crabs
moving 10 times as fast,

890
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,524
trying to feed on the arm.

891
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,627
Later I was able to do that
in Temple <i>Of</i> Doom,

892
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:51,293
when I was able to get the bugs
to do what the crabs couldn't do

893
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,496
15 years earlier.

894
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:04,773
The death of the Kintner boy, and
all the paranoia, tension and suspense

895
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:08,466
leading up to the actual
attack when he's out on the raft,

896
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:11,233
I, in my mind, wanted to do in one shot.

897
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:15,491
In trying to figure out,
in a perfect world,

898
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,961
how could I have done that
in one sustained shot,

899
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,861
I came up with the idea

900
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,866
to have bathers with
different-colored bathing suits

901
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,214
walking in front of the camera

902
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:28,506
<i>that would wipe off Roy Scheider.</i>

903
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:30,571
<i>The same color in the reverse,</i>

904
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,342
<i>moving in the other direction,</i>

905
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,605
<i>would wipe on what he's looking at.</i>

906
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,612
<i>Which, even though
it wouldn't be one shot,</i>

907
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:39,513
<i>would give more of a seamless feeling</i>

908
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:43,043
<i>and much more of a clear point of view</i>

909
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,236
<i>that you knew who was looking at who.</i>

910
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:48,685
All this must be from the
police chief's point of view.

911
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,955
The scene's about him.
It's about his reaction.

912
00:48:51,045 --> 00:48:52,956
It's not about the
Kintner boy being killed.

913
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:55,960
It's about the chief of
police, his fear of the water,

914
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:58,735
his chief responsibility
to protect the public,

915
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,895
his fear that there is a shark out there,

916
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,439
and he knows it's out there,

917
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,384
<i>and these people
are going swimming anyway.</i>

918
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,060
Did you see that?

919
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,175
Hello.

920
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,658
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

921
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,299
Craig Kings bury was a local
on Martha's Vineyard,

922
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,028
and he was quite a character.

923
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,400
He himself was a movie and a book.

924
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,469
Had I not gotten Robert Shaw

925
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,944
and had I met him in an open casting call,

926
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:46,563
I might have come close to flirting
with the idea of using him to play Quint.

927
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:50,616
Because he was the purest version

928
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,905
of who, in my mind, Quint really was.

929
00:49:54,275 --> 00:49:56,573
When I met him, he came
up with this great dialogue.

930
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,760
I kept increasing his part.

931
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,639
Just by meeting him I said,
"I want you to be in my movie,

932
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,490
"and you can make up your own dialogue."

933
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,036
He made up the stuff when
he's in the boat and he says,

934
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,669
"You're gonna wish your
mothers never met your fathers

935
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,747
"when you start piling
into those reefs, boy."

936
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,234
Wait till we get them silly
bastards down in that rock pile.

937
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,345
There'll be some fun.

938
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,972
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers

939
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:19,675
when they start digging the bottoms out

940
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,610
and slamming into them rocks, boy.

941
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:21,921
There's no shortage
of drunks on the island.

942
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,234
There's no shortage
of drunks on the island.

943
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:27,673
Craig Kings bury had the
distinction of being the only guy

944
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:31,041
who was driving under the
influence a team of oxen.

945
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,048
And was loaded and smashed
and driving these cows around.

946
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,462
Just in talking about fishing
and sharking and this and that,

947
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:42,151
Craig gave me some great lines.

948
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,007
One of the lines was,

949
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:49,706
"It's not like going out there to
catch bluegills or Tommy cods."

950
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,276
That's Craig's line.

951
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,009
I'll catch this bird for you.

952
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:55,552
It ain't going to
be easy. Bad fish.

953
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,848
Not like going down to the pond

954
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:00,606
and chasing bluegills or Tommy cods.

955
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,119
This shark, swallow you whole.

956
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:08,924
Craig Kings bury, because he played
Ben Gardner, got to have his head

957
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,298
life-cast for the mold

958
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:16,455
for the severed head
that appears in the film.

959
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,214
The thing that really has lasted
through the years with Steven and me

960
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,195
is a very private code.

961
00:51:30,371 --> 00:51:33,682
At the dinner table scene,
I improvised something

962
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,302
about a Cousteau show I had seen.

963
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:39,688
And years later, 20 years later,

964
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:43,279
Sid and I were given an award
by the Wiesenthal Center,

965
00:51:43,484 --> 00:51:47,011
and Steven was the one who
presented it on their behalf.

966
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,601
He talked about Sid and
all the things he's done,

967
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,488
and presented his whatever,

968
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:57,855
and then introduced me and told
about the things that I've been doing.

969
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:02,391
Then, as he turned to me, he said,
"Lorraine, remember the sea otter?"

970
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,815
Marker.

971
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:18,196
Did you ever see the television special,

972
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,929
the Cousteau special on sea otters?

973
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,086
Sea otters, where the mother
was killed in front of the baby.

974
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:24,989
The baby saw it with his eyes.

975
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,800
You could see the tears
coming down his face.

976
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:30,057
It was the most incredible thing
I have ever seen. It was terrible.

977
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:33,259
Mikey wanted us to
adopt the sea otter. It was…

978
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:37,678
I've never been this moved by
anything on television. It was really…

979
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:39,330
It was special.

980
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:41,321
So…

981
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,536
You're going on the Aurora. You're
going to live there 18 months. Wow.

982
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:49,648
It was disappointing to me
it wasn't in the movie.

983
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:53,199
Not as disappointing as not having
a sex scene with Richard Dreyfuss,

984
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,028
but it was disappointing.

985
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:04,932
Shark! A shark!

986
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:10,587
<i>I was going to be a victim in the estuary.</i>

987
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,157
<i>I'm in a little rowboat.</i>

988
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:16,583
The way they shot it the first time,

989
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,210
I'm in the shark's mouth
with a blood pack in my mouth.

990
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,524
I'm going on top of water,
underwater, spitting blood out,

991
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,535
and I'm trying to make a lot of movement,

992
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:29,868
but it was very awkward
the way this seat was.

993
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,234
I was trying to make a lot of
movement like I was in the shark's mouth.

994
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:34,658
Going underwater, top of water.

995
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:36,287
Then I see

996
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:40,397
Roy's son staring at me.

997
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:43,715
As a last-ditch effort, the shark
is heading right towards him.

998
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:46,973
I just make a move to
grab him, and I let him just…

999
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,974
I just touched him and let him go,

1000
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,976
and then I go underwater and disappear.

1001
00:53:51,245 --> 00:53:53,407
What happened in that scene is,

1002
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:56,142
it was so violent and so horrendous

1003
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:00,583
<i>that they couldn't use it. It
was just too violent, period.</i>

1004
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:06,006
<i>I was in this bucket seat,
strapped into it,</i>

1005
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,522
<i>and the shark fin was behind me on a sled.</i>

1006
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:12,429
<i>I had the kid in my arms, and I
was gonna take him underwater.</i>

1007
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:16,060
<i>Then I let him go, and
the sled went underwater.</i>

1008
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,738
Teddy Grossman is in
the jaws of the shark.

1009
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,073
The shark's underwater.

1010
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,523
And Teddy, like the maidenhead on a ship,

1011
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,164
is traveling toward
this kid, vomiting blood.

1012
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:34,346
That's much more horrible
than what I had done,

1013
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:37,390
you know, in the first third of <i>Jaws</i>.

1014
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,851
I just didn't like it.
It was too bloody.

1015
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:41,986
I thought it was in
bad taste, so I cut it out.

1016
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:46,455
Come on, Chief. This
isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

1017
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:49,033
See you got your rubbers.

1018
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:52,811
I asked Robert to
give Lorraine a hard time

1019
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:54,716
inside the scene,

1020
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,478
'cause he's really sort of
putting down Chief Brody.

1021
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:01,012
He thinks Chief Brady's a sissy.

1022
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:04,163
He's putting down the fact
he's all in rubber.

1023
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:07,363
He says, "Are you glad you
brought your rubbers, Chief?"

1024
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:10,202
And he's always doing this to everybody,

1025
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,492
to Brady's character,
to Brody and to Hooper.

1026
00:55:14,595 --> 00:55:18,054
And so I asked him to chide Lorraine,

1027
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:20,156
and in the middle of the scene

1028
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,396
he made up this little poem that went,

1029
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,023
"There was a woman named Mary
Who lost her virginity

1030
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:30,274
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"

1031
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:31,869
Whatever it was, when it was over,

1032
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:33,771
I said, "You gotta help me clear this.

1033
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:35,315
"If that's from a song,

1034
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,134
"we just can't use that
without paying for the rights."

1035
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:42,399
He said, "I don't think we'll be sued.
I got it from a tombstone in Ireland."

1036
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,089
<i>That's where he found that little ditty.</i>

1037
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:49,827
"Here lies the body of Mary
Lee Died at the age of 103

1038
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:52,525
"For 15 years she kept her virginity

1039
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:54,852
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"

1040
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,018
If they don't like you
going out, they'll love you coming in.

1041
00:56:07,714 --> 00:56:10,991
<i>For</i> Jaws, <i>I
wanted the color red to be the blood</i>

1042
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:14,636
<i>and not to be a bandana
around someone's neck</i>

1043
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:18,815
<i>or a plaid over shirt
or the letters on a boat.</i>

1044
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,322
The only red I wanted
in the movie was blood.

1045
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:24,456
I told the production designer,
Joe Alves, at the very beginning,

1046
00:56:24,565 --> 00:56:26,363
"When you're designing the picture

1047
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,185
"and finding your colors, don't find red.

1048
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,562
"Just allow red to be the blood."

1049
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,301
And, in a sense, I think we stuck to that.

1050
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:36,183
I think that's what happened.

1051
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:40,105
We did have red wine,
but it's a bit symbolic.

1052
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,581
Keep that chum line going, Chief.

1053
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,365
We got five good miles on it.

1054
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:50,736
<i>When the shooting started at sea,</i>

1055
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,957
<i>the production got a lot more difficult.</i>

1056
00:56:53,393 --> 00:56:56,670
That's when they started
worrying about wind and weather,

1057
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:58,857
when they could spend a day on the ocean

1058
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:01,446
and get six seconds of usable film

1059
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:03,082
because of boats on the horizon,

1060
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,752
because of malfunctioning shark.

1061
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:07,904
The problems of shooting
at sea are enormous

1062
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:12,242
because the wind, the waves,
everything is moving

1063
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:17,148
and nothing stays the same
for more than 50, 60 seconds.

1064
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,296
I would set up a shot and
I'd get my camera all set.

1065
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,714
Suddenly the electrical barge
would start drifting,

1066
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:24,302
the tide would be moving this way,

1067
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,718
and the camera barge
would start drifting this way,

1068
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:29,421
and the Orca would start
moving around on its two anchors.

1069
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,714
Before you knew it,
we were all out of position.

1070
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:34,779
It took another hour and a half
to re-anchor and get set again.

1071
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:38,048
Just when we got set, sailboats
from a regatta would come in.

1072
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,806
You're shooting
towards the horizon, right?

1073
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,984
And the camera has got the horizon.

1074
00:57:47,748 --> 00:57:50,900
Then all of a sudden
we would see a little sail.

1075
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:55,816
<i>And as soon as that sail
was in the shot, we had to stop</i>

1076
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,650
and wait till it went
all the way across here,

1077
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,644
which took an hour and a half.

1078
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:05,739
And hope that at the end
of that hour and a half,

1079
00:58:05,832 --> 00:58:07,812
another one didn't come.

1080
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,112
So we were always like…

1081
00:58:10,937 --> 00:58:14,771
As the sailing ship went off,

1082
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:19,969
we were going, like, "Ready?
Speed. Action!

1083
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,573
"No, there's another one!
Oh, God damn it!"

1084
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,245
I mean, that put three hours
a day onto our schedule.

1085
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,787
I'd sit there saying,

1086
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:30,482
"Do I wait here for an
hour for the regatta to pass,

1087
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,577
"or do we turn 18 to 25 anchors,

1088
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,942
"move everything to look
in this direction?"

1089
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,061
We used to do calculations and say,

1090
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:42,210
"It'll take an hour for the
regatta to get from here to here,

1091
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,310
"and an hour and 10 minutes

1092
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:47,231
"to get all your anchors
and look back this way.

1093
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:51,424
"Let's wait for the sailboats
to move out of the shot."

1094
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,239
It was just frustrating for all of us.

1095
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,762
<i>Everyone got seasick. Sooner or later,</i>

1096
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,394
<i>everybody got seasick.</i>

1097
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:04,819
Robert was really, really seasick one day.

1098
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:09,442
And he had to shoot a line,
a very simple line.

1099
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,077
The line was, "Hooper,
you idiot, ain't you watching?"

1100
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:17,997
Okay? He had to be
helped into the chair.

1101
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:21,200
And anyone touching him…

1102
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:23,356
It hurt him just to be touched.

1103
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,826
And we were all hoping that he'd get it.

1104
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:33,477
Nobody was critical.
Nobody was mocking.

1105
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:36,579
Nobody was standing apart
and pointing fingers.

1106
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:40,741
We all knew exactly what he
was feeling. He just couldn't help it.

1107
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:45,444
But we also knew that he
wouldn't be able to do this,

1108
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:48,917
that this scene, however
small and of-the-moment,

1109
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,660
would not get done today.

1110
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,015
Steven set up the camera.

1111
00:59:56,226 --> 01:00:00,288
Robert was here, and he had to
turn into the camera to say this line.

1112
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:04,300
He was… He literally… He went…

1113
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:17,956
I mean, it hurt.

1114
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,316
Steven said, "Action."

1115
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,418
Robert turned around,

1116
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:28,151
and with a power that
put me through the wall,

1117
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:30,801
he went, "Hooper, you
idiot, ain't you watching?"

1118
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:33,886
Ho open you idiot,
starboard! Ain't you watching it!

1119
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,890
And I swear to God, everyone went…

1120
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,332
And then Steven said, "Cut!
Print!" And Robert went…

1121
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,917
Collapse.

1122
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:03,302
You're going to need a bigger boat.

1123
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:06,823
One of the most remembered
and oft-quoted lines in the movie

1124
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,161
is Roy Scheider saying,
"We gotta get a bigger boat,"

1125
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,883
which he improvised on the set,

1126
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:13,420
and I acknowledge that as a writer.

1127
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:14,783
I'm pleased that he said that.

1128
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:18,015
The line, "We're gonna
need a bigger boat,"

1129
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:21,652
has become part of the language

1130
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:25,271
for people who are faced with
an insurmountable problem.

1131
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:36,856
That's a 20-footer.

1132
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,190
Twenty-five.

1133
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,239
Three tons of him.

1134
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:44,858
The studio was overloaded with
their own effects projects at the time,

1135
01:01:45,518 --> 01:01:47,498
<i>Hindenburg and Earthquake.</i>

1136
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,767
Marshall Green, the
head of production, said,

1137
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,524
"Take it, find someone to do it."

1138
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,991
So I started interviewing
various effects people,

1139
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:59,999
and I went to Disney's and other places

1140
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:03,627
that do mechanical objects,

1141
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:06,047
animals and what have you.

1142
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,939
I wasn't having any luck.

1143
01:02:08,008 --> 01:02:09,954
Everybody was telling me,
"It can't be done.

1144
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,529
"It would take three
years in development."

1145
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:17,533
I heard about this guy that
had been retired for some time,

1146
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:21,484
<i>who did the giant squid in</i>
20,000 <i>Leagues</i> Under <i>the Sea.</i>

1147
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,555
<i>And his name was Bob Mattey.</i>

1148
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:27,169
<i>So, when I met Bob,</i>

1149
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,656
<i>I didn't get the usual
pessimistic attitude,</i>

1150
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,243
<i>"You can't do this.</i>

1151
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:36,092
<i>"You can't make this full-size
shark and shoot in the real ocean."</i>

1152
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,885
Instead I got this very enthusiastic,

1153
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,673
"Yes, we could do anything."

1154
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:44,088
Probably

1155
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,191
the reason that Steven and I decided,

1156
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:51,828
in a naive sort of way,

1157
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:55,371
that we were gonna build a full-size
shark and shoot the real ocean

1158
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,952
and not a tank or not a miniature…

1159
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:02,271
Maybe that was lack of
experience or whatever,

1160
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:05,474
but everyone kept telling us
we couldn't do it.

1161
01:03:05,899 --> 01:03:08,015
So when I found Bob Mattey,

1162
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,849
who actually had made
some of these giant creatures,

1163
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:14,504
very enthusiastic about it,
it was very encouraging.

1164
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,874
It had to be a formidable shark.

1165
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:44,448
<i>And we made various sketches of
30-foot sharks and 20-foot sharks,</i>

1166
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,783
<i>and came up with the… A
reasonable size would be 25 feet.</i>

1167
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:51,088
<i>Very formidable, yet not Moby Dick.</i>

1168
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:55,231
There have been sharks that have
been sighted that have been that size,

1169
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,063
and they've actually caught
some that were 21 feet.

1170
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,694
So it was a credible
animal we were making.

1171
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:03,956
Doing the initial studies
of the great white shark,

1172
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:06,322
I went to the Steinhardt

1173
01:04:06,393 --> 01:04:10,910
and I borrowed this set
of jaws which was huge.

1174
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,349
It's an 18, 20-foot shark.

1175
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:18,836
We made our shark larger
by another five or six feet,

1176
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,615
but we kept everything in proportion.

1177
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:25,821
Teeth. When I started
doing the actual drawings

1178
01:04:27,247 --> 01:04:30,046
for the construction of the shark,

1179
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,875
we used everything in proper proportion.

1180
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,292
Getting the right personnel
was sort of like…

1181
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,695
<i>It reminds me of The Magnificent Seven</i>

1182
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,234
where you're picking six great guys,

1183
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,552
six big guns.

1184
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:14,185
We heard of this young man
in the plastics section

1185
01:05:14,294 --> 01:05:16,137
by the name of Roy Arbogast.

1186
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,873
He was an expert

1187
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:21,144
on rubber forms and new
plastics, and things like that.

1188
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,883
So we decided he would
be perfect to make the mold.

1189
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,207
There was Richie Helmer and Bill Short,

1190
01:05:27,273 --> 01:05:29,742
who were excellent in electronics.

1191
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:35,363
All this had to be
electrically-activated valves

1192
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:38,844
that would work the rams
and various things of that type.

1193
01:05:38,918 --> 01:05:42,161
We were using hydraulics
instead of pneumatics because“.

1194
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:45,583
Excuse me. We were using
pneumatics instead of hydraulics

1195
01:05:45,658 --> 01:05:48,252
because we didn't want
an oil break in the water.

1196
01:05:48,328 --> 01:05:50,319
So we had to get hydraulic experts too.

1197
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,348
Then we had Mike and Gary
Woods, who were excellent welders.

1198
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,498
<i>So we assembled this team,</i>

1199
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:59,137
<i>and they started on
the frame of the shark.</i>

1200
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:03,923
<i>So we were working from the
outside in and the inside out.</i>

1201
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,452
<i>We were separately modeling the shark,</i>

1202
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:09,464
<i>and then, at the same time,
they were making the skeleton,</i>

1203
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,978
<i>and we hoped that
they would all fit together.</i>

1204
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,394
<i>And there was a time element.</i>

1205
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,403
<i>The time element was this…</i>

1206
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:20,352
<i>It was that it was already
the first of the year in 1974,</i>

1207
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:24,562
<i>and we knew we would have a
summer window in which to shoot this,</i>

1208
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:26,622
<i>especially that we're gonna go back east.</i>

1209
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,044
<i>We decided to shoot this in the
area it was written for, New England.</i>

1210
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,622
So we had a time element there.

1211
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,323
We built the shark
and tested the shark dry.

1212
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:55,919
We were asked to make comments
about the mechanical shark,

1213
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,764
and I think it helped them
to a certain extent.

1214
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:03,570
Because I think they had too
much animation in the shark.

1215
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:06,517
The shark, in reality,

1216
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,987
moves in a very smooth, leisurely manner.

1217
01:07:10,143 --> 01:07:14,410
I can remember it sort of coming
up out of the water like that,

1218
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,262
very fast vertically,
and they don't do that.

1219
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,698
They sort of come up…

1220
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:23,739
It's a slow… It's not really
slow, but it looks slow.

1221
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:26,424
They took our advice,

1222
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:29,735
and I know that it made a
big difference to the end result.

1223
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,926
We had a number of
different shark components.

1224
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:50,341
We had the full shark, which
I called the "great white turd."

1225
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,736
We pulled it along in the water.

1226
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,233
It was often on this huge
gantry like a crane arm.

1227
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,657
When the crane arm was
tucked at the 30-foot bottom,

1228
01:08:00,727 --> 01:08:01,819
you couldn't see the shark.

1229
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:05,563
But when the crane arm… As
quickly as they could blow the ballast

1230
01:08:05,632 --> 01:08:07,100
and force the arm out of the water,

1231
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,476
the shark would rise out of the water.

1232
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:12,362
The shark could be gimbaled
separately on the arm

1233
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:15,738
to have an attitude change
at the top of the crane arm.

1234
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:19,790
We had that. We had just a fin
that was pulled through the water.

1235
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,702
We had a left-to-right shark
and a right-to-left shark.

1236
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,750
The left-to-right shark, of course,

1237
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,436
had no left side.
It was all scooped out.

1238
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,097
<i>And vice versa for the other shark.</i>

1239
01:08:50,243 --> 01:08:53,087
Bob needed some area like this

1240
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:56,879
that he could get all those hoses

1241
01:08:57,317 --> 01:08:59,001
and wires and stuff,

1242
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:03,885
and have access to all
the mechanical stuff here.

1243
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:07,635
Whatever needed to be repaired.

1244
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:10,520
If we were shooting this
one with the hole here,

1245
01:09:10,596 --> 01:09:12,906
we could only shoot from the other side.

1246
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:15,166
So this would be the left-to-right shark.

1247
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,750
The idea still was to
try to convince the world

1248
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:21,956
that we were using real sharks

1249
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:23,901
or a great deal of real sharks.

1250
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:29,272
So we didn't want the world to know

1251
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:33,129
that the monster was really mechanical.

1252
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,921
And also, we realized

1253
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:41,775
that a mechanical monster
is only good when it moves.

1254
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,922
When you take a still photograph of it,

1255
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:49,445
it's gonna look phony under
the best of circumstances.

1256
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:59,209
Somebody snuck in somehow into
the warehouse while we were shooting

1257
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:02,376
and took a picture of one of the sharks.

1258
01:10:02,548 --> 01:10:06,109
And I remember getting
very agitated about that.

1259
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,065
And none of us could understand,

1260
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:16,059
because we really were very
careful about the secrecy element,

1261
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,963
almost became paranoid about it.

1262
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,397
But, in itself, the fact that

1263
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,931
there was such secrecy surrounding this

1264
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,334
created a great deal of interest.

1265
01:10:30,777 --> 01:10:33,895
That's a much-maligned shark,
and I'm kind of responsible

1266
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,245
for creating a lot of the
badmouthing about the shark.

1267
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,898
Because the shark was frustrating.

1268
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,783
It didn't really work all the time.

1269
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,304
It didn't work hardly at all.

1270
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:47,159
I remember, in particular,
being on our barge,

1271
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,318
watching the first shark test,

1272
01:10:51,063 --> 01:10:53,691
at which time the shark simply sank

1273
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,326
to the bottom of Nantucket Sound.

1274
01:10:56,486 --> 01:11:00,434
And we felt that our careers in
motion pictures had gone with it.

1275
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:04,704
Frogmen were delegated to recover
it and bring it back to the surface.

1276
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,295
Everything that could
go wrong with a shark

1277
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,439
went wrong with the various sharks,

1278
01:11:09,549 --> 01:11:11,643
the various types, head, fin, tails.

1279
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:14,402
The ocean was so brutal on the mechanics.

1280
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,915
All the pneumatic tubes,

1281
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:20,858
all of that special equipment
was being dashed

1282
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:23,555
and brutalized by the ocean every day.

1283
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:27,097
There were all these radio
mikes all over the island,

1284
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,812
the Universal radio mikes.

1285
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,950
So wherever you were on the island,

1286
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,200
you could hear the radio mikes.

1287
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,863
They were always saying,

1288
01:11:35,942 --> 01:11:37,307
"The shark is not working.

1289
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,835
"Repeat.
The shark is not working."

1290
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:43,675
No matter where you were, and for months.

1291
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:46,696
We just waited around.
We just waited and waited.

1292
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,738
I remember every day, about
the 50th or 60th day of shooting,

1293
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:52,331
the crew would come over
to me, and they'd all ask me,

1294
01:11:52,425 --> 01:11:54,484
"When are we going to
be done with this movie?"

1295
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:56,488
And I would honestly say to them,

1296
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:59,213
with complete sympathy for the question,

1297
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:03,351
"I don't know. I don't know when
we're going to finish this movie.

1298
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:06,895
"We could finish it if I get
fired and dragged off the movie.

1299
01:12:06,973 --> 01:12:10,238
"Somebody else could come and
finish it. Maybe they'll shut us down."

1300
01:12:11,878 --> 01:12:14,404
Show me the way to <i>go</i> home

1301
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:18,143
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

1302
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,818
<i>I had a little drink about an hour ago</i>

1303
01:12:20,887 --> 01:12:22,878
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

1304
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,620
I remember how we got tears in
our eyes when we sang the song.

1305
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:29,525
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

1306
01:12:30,062 --> 01:12:32,690
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

1307
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,659
Which is sung in the film
by the three principals.

1308
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:39,046
I remember looking around
at Charlsie, the script girl,

1309
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,749
and other people on the set
with tears in their eyes,

1310
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,702
not because it was
a sweet, emotional scene.

1311
01:12:45,177 --> 01:12:46,986
That had become their mantra.

1312
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:50,379
All they could think about
was, "What was home like?"

1313
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,810
They missed their kids, and
they missed their backyards.

1314
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:58,437
They missed their families
and their lifestyles.

1315
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:03,092
And, in a sense, that's why I
always saw myself in the negative.

1316
01:13:03,195 --> 01:13:06,392
<i>I saw myself as James Cagney
in Mister Roberts,</i>

1317
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:11,084
not letting the crew get to shore.

1318
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:13,450
By the way, the crew did get to shore.

1319
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,048
They got to shore every
Sunday that we had off.

1320
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,576
We shot six-day weeks.

1321
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,207
But I never left the island.

1322
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,303
The reason I never left the island

1323
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:24,463
in all those seven months of
shooting on Martha's Vineyard

1324
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,376
was because if I left the island,

1325
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,067
I was certain I would never come back.

1326
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,202
The delays and the ocean

1327
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:33,719
and the fact that we'd been on the
island for four or five months now,

1328
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:36,569
we were all getting a little strange.

1329
01:13:37,697 --> 01:13:39,210
There was a…

1330
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:43,309
I don't know if it was a charity
dinner or not, but it was a function,

1331
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:47,399
a splendid buffet of wonderful food.

1332
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,001
There was this tremendous
buffet of desserts,

1333
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:52,545
strawberry shortcake and Boston cream pies

1334
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:55,240
and chocolate eclairs and napoleons

1335
01:13:56,966 --> 01:14:00,812
and some Jell-O, and
also gravy and potatoes.

1336
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:03,867
I'd said to Rick Fields,
who is Verna Fields' son,

1337
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,089
"Suppose there was a food fight?"

1338
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:07,990
And he said, "What do you mean?"

1339
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:11,069
I said, "Well, you know, just
start throwing some food."

1340
01:14:11,163 --> 01:14:12,403
Roy started it.

1341
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:17,260
Roy threw a big glob of mashed
potatoes and gravy right into my face,

1342
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:21,103
and before I could recover
and throw something at him,

1343
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:24,791
Richard Dreyfuss, I think, took his
dessert and threw it into Roy's face.

1344
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:28,012
Right center, nose, eyes,
mouth, the whole thing.

1345
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,744
Roy turned and he took two or
three desserts, threw them at Richard.

1346
01:14:31,817 --> 01:14:34,127
Richard ducked and it
hit somebody behind him,

1347
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,655
and it was a bit of a Three Stooges brawl.

1348
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:39,071
I remember Dick and David
got up and left right away.

1349
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,859
They saw what was coming.

1350
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:45,272
In about 30 seconds, we were actually
standing, hurling food at each other.

1351
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:47,645
And it was a melee after that.

1352
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:50,748
Just food all over the floor, all over…

1353
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,570
The help that was there
serving dinner, they came out.

1354
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,251
They laughed like crazy.

1355
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:59,920
I don't know if some of the townspeople
appreciated it as much as we did,

1356
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:03,556
but it was a tremendous
blowing off of steam.

1357
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:06,941
I remember Richard and Roy,
covered in food,

1358
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,452
running out to the Kelley
House swimming pool

1359
01:15:09,522 --> 01:15:11,263
and diving in the water.

1360
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:14,321
And all this once-yummy food,

1361
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:17,257
like Technicolor silt,

1362
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:20,845
rising to the surface of this
otherwise turquoise pool.

1363
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,779
I remember saying, "What
the heck," and I jumped in too,

1364
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:25,530
and washed myself off.

1365
01:15:25,805 --> 01:15:27,705
But that was what happens in the Navy

1366
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,804
when you just aren't given shore leave.

1367
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,070
Let that be a lesson.

1368
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:35,438
The decision to continue filming
Jaws was a very shaky one.

1369
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:39,074
Our technical people,
what Steven Spielberg

1370
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,547
was fond of calling "our
special defects department,"

1371
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,253
wanted us to stop
so they could perfect it.

1372
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:53,658
Dick and I, battle-scarred
veterans of the movie wars,

1373
01:15:53,733 --> 01:15:57,681
knew that you never take
the film out of the camera

1374
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:00,028
because they may never
let you put it back,

1375
01:16:00,106 --> 01:16:02,040
particularly with a movie like this.

1376
01:16:02,108 --> 01:16:06,818
Even if we got one-sixteenth of a
page of script a day, you kept moving.

1377
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:12,047
Steven, at one point, considered
moving our whole crew to the Bahamas,

1378
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:14,416
where the waters were
tranquil and everything,

1379
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,421
and we weren't in favor of that.

1380
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,435
"Just keep shooting.

1381
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:21,283
"Keep shooting and make do
with what you've got."

1382
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:24,693
This whole system with the barrels,

1383
01:16:24,764 --> 01:16:26,277
that kept the shark alive.

1384
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:30,225
<i>When those barrels came up,
the shark was there,</i>

1385
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:32,237
and that really saved us.

1386
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:36,339
It saved us, or we'd still be there
waiting for the shark to work, really.

1387
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:39,503
Finally, after all this,
it was maybe September,

1388
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:42,297
we got the shark to
raise out of the water.

1389
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:45,129
That was that one shot with Roy Scheider,

1390
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,350
and it just barely worked.

1391
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,612
Okay.

1392
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:52,522
Good blood.
And action, Roy.

1393
01:16:52,591 --> 01:16:53,717
Slow ahead.

1394
01:16:53,793 --> 01:16:55,409
I can go slow ahead.

1395
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:58,572
You ought to come down
and ladle some of this shit.

1396
01:17:02,968 --> 01:17:04,060
<i>And down!</i>

1397
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,434
<i>And cut!</i>

1398
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:15,426
And then one day you heard
this, "The shark is working.

1399
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,256
"Repeat.
The shark is working."

1400
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,431
The shark worked well enough that we,

1401
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:24,297
for a while there, had
the biggest hit of all time.

1402
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,858
I really owe the shark a lot.

1403
01:17:25,925 --> 01:17:28,610
More than I want to take
away from it right now.

1404
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:30,975
And I owe Bob Mattey
and his team a lot as well.

1405
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:35,716
The shark in Jaws,
and all subsequent editions,

1406
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,400
was always called Bruce.

1407
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:41,554
The reason it was called Bruce
is because Steven named him that

1408
01:17:41,774 --> 01:17:43,924
after his lawyer, Bruce Ramer.

1409
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:48,007
I didn't make jokes about it. I
never called the shark Bruce. Ever.

1410
01:17:48,097 --> 01:17:49,565
I Still don't.

1411
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:57,681
<i>There was one Orca,
which was originally called the Warlock.</i>

1412
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:01,374
It was a boat that was purchased
by Joe Alves, the production designer.

1413
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:05,857
He chose the boat, and I liked the
boat a lot, but I didn't think it was…

1414
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,643
It didn't have enough character to it.

1415
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,596
Joe agreed, and Joe actually
replaced the entire wheelhouse

1416
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,084
with one of his own
design with larger windows,

1417
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,555
'cause they were too small.

1418
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:18,286
Joe and I both wanted larger
windows so we could see out.

1419
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,021
So everywhere you were inside the boat,

1420
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,291
the ocean was breathing down your neck.

1421
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:25,231
Rather than looking through a
porthole and saying, "The ocean."

1422
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:27,018
That could have been a processed shot.

1423
01:18:27,086 --> 01:18:29,362
So I wanted really big
windows in the wheelhouse,

1424
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,672
in the main cabin.

1425
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:33,891
Joe reconfigured the boat to
give it a little more personality,

1426
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:37,355
squared off a little bit more than
the original boat we bought was.

1427
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:42,048
We were shooting about
75 yards, I'm really not sure,

1428
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:45,432
off the coast of Chappaquiddick Island.

1429
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,957
Robert, Roy, myself,

1430
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,795
Freddy Zendar, the boat wrangler,

1431
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,694
and an ancient sound man with a Nagra.

1432
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:03,131
What happened was, we were pulling
one of the barrels away from the boat.

1433
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:07,119
They had put a little eye hook
into one of the boards,

1434
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:12,657
just below the surface, just
below the waterline, like a shiv.

1435
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:14,813
So the rope would go through the shiv,

1436
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,978
and it would seem to pull
the barrel toward the Orca,

1437
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,033
as if the shark was
heading toward the Orca.

1438
01:19:20,105 --> 01:19:22,403
The problem was,
the motorboat went so fast,

1439
01:19:22,474 --> 01:19:25,421
it pulled the shiv and the planking

1440
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,629
out from the hull of the Orca
and, of course, the water rushed in.

1441
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:31,257
And we started to sink.
No kidding.

1442
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,932
No kidding.

1443
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,838
Water started rushing onto the boat.

1444
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:40,057
Freddy Zendar jumps up from the
hold cursing and screaming in Austrian,

1445
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,537
and starts to power the boat
as fast as he could

1446
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:45,444
toward the beach of Chappaquiddick Island,

1447
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,750
hoping to be able to ground the boat

1448
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:50,376
before it sinks and we have no Orca.

1449
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:52,896
There's only one Orca.

1450
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:56,531
In the meantime, we're in six-foot swells,

1451
01:19:56,608 --> 01:20:00,294
and Steven Spielberg is
trying to send safety boats

1452
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:03,229
to get us transferred off the boat.

1453
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,393
"Get the actors off the boat!"

1454
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:06,603
I remember John Carter, who
won an Academy Award, by the way,

1455
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:09,553
I remember John Carter, who
won an Academy Award, by the way,

1456
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:12,306
for best sound for Jaws.

1457
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,759
He picked up the Nagra
and held it over his head

1458
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:19,764
and said, "Fuck the actors,
save the sound department!"

1459
01:20:19,832 --> 01:20:21,948
I have this image to this day of John

1460
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,145
sinking, holding the Nagra over his head,

1461
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,836
the water up to John's
ankles, up to his knees,

1462
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,852
boats scrambling to pull
everybody off the sinking Orca,

1463
01:20:29,942 --> 01:20:31,592
and John with his Nagra going under.

1464
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:34,891
There was a certain level
of executive indifference

1465
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:38,206
to the sound department's lifespan.

1466
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:41,120
"Get the actors off the boat!"

1467
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:46,063
It was funny.

1468
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:48,802
We lived.

1469
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:50,872
We had lost the camera. The
camera was on the boat, too.

1470
01:20:50,963 --> 01:20:52,704
It went underwater.

1471
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:55,716
Bill Butler said, "You know, in a sense,

1472
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:58,869
"the developing solution
we use is a saline solution.

1473
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:02,237
"I think this film's going to be
okay if we can rush it to the 
ab."

1474
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,441
We got on an airplane with a
bucket of water and the film in it,

1475
01:21:05,511 --> 01:21:08,037
took it to New York and developed it.

1476
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,825
Didn't lose a foot.

1477
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,733
Bill Butler created
equipment just to make Jaws.

1478
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:14,883
He created a camera platform that

1479
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,513
according to the tides or
where you wanted your lens,

1480
01:21:17,589 --> 01:21:19,455
could go just below the surface

1481
01:21:19,525 --> 01:21:21,266
or way above the surface of the water.

1482
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,369
He designed it and
had it built for the movie.

1483
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,480
He also created…

1484
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:29,279
He had to create the water
box, where you put the camera.

1485
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:33,629
<i>But he reconfigured the water
box so it was easier to get the focus.</i>

1486
01:21:33,906 --> 01:21:36,125
<i>Your hand in there so you could pull focus</i>

1487
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,126
<i>and still have the water lapping the lens.</i>

1488
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,390
I wanted this movie
to be just at water level,

1489
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,295
the way we are when we're treading water.

1490
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,926
We don't see water three feet off
the water. We see water like this.

1491
01:21:47,019 --> 01:21:48,748
I wanted to get the camera right down

1492
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,767
to where the human point of view

1493
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:53,399
is most accustomed to being
when you're swimming.

1494
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,877
That's why I shot
at least 25% of the movie

1495
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:00,142
from that water box that
Bill Butler reconfigured for us.

1496
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,445
When it came time to do Jaws…

1497
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:06,235
They hadn't done a water
picture for several years,

1498
01:22:06,305 --> 01:22:10,321
and the old-fashioned way of doing
a water picture was to use a gimbal.

1499
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:13,305
It weighs about 400 pounds.
It's very clumsy.

1500
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,262
It does keep the camera level aboard ship,

1501
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:21,487
but it's too clumsy to do a
film the way they do films today.

1502
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:24,856
And so I chose to hand-hold the camera.

1503
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:29,060
When Steven heard about this
he was rather shocked,

1504
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,977
because he didn't really
want a hand-held picture.

1505
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:35,443
But he didn't realize
that I didn't really mean

1506
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:38,111
to do a hand-held film

1507
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:41,803
in the terms that they
then used or thought about

1508
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,342
hand-held on land,

1509
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:45,172
but rather to use the knees

1510
01:22:45,244 --> 01:22:47,713
<i>and the body to take
the roll out of the film.</i>

1511
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:52,561
<i>And so we gave that a try,
and it worked very well.</i>

1512
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,921
<i>After he saw a demonstration,</i>

1513
01:22:55,988 --> 01:22:58,207
he decided that was the way to do it.

1514
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:02,084
As a matter of fact, Jaws ended up
being a film shot mostly hand-held.

1515
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,552
One thing I remember
more than anything else

1516
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:07,474
has nothing to do with
the direction of the picture,

1517
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:10,951
but has to do with the
incredible contrasts of light.

1518
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:16,365
You'd see a scene being shot.

1519
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:21,395
From one angle it's dark,
from the other angle it's light.

1520
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,228
Sunshine, fog.

1521
01:23:27,286 --> 01:23:28,868
I remember thinking to myself,

1522
01:23:28,971 --> 01:23:31,588
"My God! How are you
gonna cut this together?

1523
01:23:31,657 --> 01:23:34,501
"How are you ever gonna get the color

1524
01:23:36,662 --> 01:23:39,245
"to bear anything resembling a match?"

1525
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,975
I'd never seen…

1526
01:23:41,884 --> 01:23:44,979
The islands and oceans have
such incredible differences.

1527
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:47,886
The ocean is green, it's blue, it's black.

1528
01:23:48,006 --> 01:23:50,418
Sometimes the sky was blue instead of

1529
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,893
the overcast gray look
that we really wanted.

1530
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,139
When we got back to LA,
we had to take it into the lab

1531
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:58,779
and get rid of the blue.

1532
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:03,003
At the time, the special
effects people didn't really have

1533
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:07,690
a good way of pulling the blue out
of the film without affecting the faces.

1534
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,695
We wanted the faces to remain untouched.

1535
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:15,275
And so I decided to try something
that they hadn't tried before,

1536
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,898
which was simply to use
black-and-white film,

1537
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,278
the type they do letters with,

1538
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,334
which is either black or it's white,

1539
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:25,274
expose it for the very
bright sky with a blue filter,

1540
01:24:25,344 --> 01:24:29,190
and take only the blue of the
sky out and leave the faces alone.

1541
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:31,096
It happened to work very well,

1542
01:24:31,183 --> 01:24:34,562
and we were able to match
shots very well that way.

1543
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:37,718
Want to see something permanent?

1544
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,924
That was Robert's idea.

1545
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,943
Robert Shaw said, "I've
got this tooth that's fake."

1546
01:24:47,099 --> 01:24:50,114
He pulled his cap off and
the little nub was under it.

1547
01:24:50,202 --> 01:24:52,193
He said, "Can I take that off

1548
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:54,467
"as an addition to
the scar-comparing contest?"

1549
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:58,475
Mr. Hooper, that's
the U. S. S. Indianapolis.

1550
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:07,860
<i>You were on the Indianapolis?</i>

1551
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,995
<i>The Indianapolis speech</i>

1552
01:25:10,455 --> 01:25:14,323
about the atomic bomb that had
been taken from Tinian to Leyte

1553
01:25:14,393 --> 01:25:16,760
which, for me, is my
favorite part of Jaws,

1554
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:19,490
this speech that Shaw gives about that.

1555
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:23,230
That was conceived by Howard Sackler,

1556
01:25:23,302 --> 01:25:26,135
who only really wrote a short paragraph

1557
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:31,769
as Quint starts to talk about one
of the reasons he kills sharks today

1558
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:35,939
is what sharks did to him and
his shipmates back in 1945.

1559
01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:39,717
It was a wonderful scene

1560
01:25:39,785 --> 01:25:41,833
that I kept trying to get
Howard Sackler to expand.

1561
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,053
But Howard felt shorter was better,

1562
01:25:44,122 --> 01:25:46,216
and never would elaborate on it.

1563
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,616
One day I was talking to John Milius,

1564
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:51,254
and I said, "Could you make this longer?

1565
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,547
"Because I think it's a speech,

1566
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,231
"not just a couple of short paragraphs."

1567
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,629
John said, "Sure, I love the
speech. It's a great idea. I'll try."

1568
01:25:58,704 --> 01:26:02,390
So John sat down and wrote page
after page in long hand,I believe,

1569
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:05,108
and sent me an actual,
original longhand version

1570
01:26:05,177 --> 01:26:08,169
of a very long Quint speech,

1571
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:11,816
which was essentially too much,

1572
01:26:12,517 --> 01:26:16,078
but, pared down, it was gonna be great.

1573
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,113
When Robert Shaw read it…

1574
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:20,818
Shaw, who himself had
written Man in the <i>Glass</i> Booth,

1575
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:22,883
was an accomplished playwright.

1576
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:26,292
Shaw said, "It's too hard for me to play.

1577
01:26:26,365 --> 01:26:29,460
"There's too much John Huston
in some of this dialogue.

1578
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:32,467
"Huston could say this, but I
can't say it as well as Huston.

1579
01:26:32,537 --> 01:26:34,255
"Let me have a chance at rewriting it."

1580
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:38,008
So then Shaw rewrote Milius,
who had rewritten Sackler,

1581
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:39,960
and the speech in the movie

1582
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:43,748
is basically Shaw's version of
Milius' version of Sackler's version.

1583
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:47,582
Very first light, sharks come cruising

1584
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,700
so we formed ourselves into tight groups.

1585
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,521
You know, kind of like old squares

1586
01:26:54,593 --> 01:26:56,527
in a battle like you see on a calendar

1587
01:26:56,595 --> 01:26:59,030
like the Battle of Waterloo. The idea was…

1588
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,031
the shark comes to the nearest man

1589
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,795
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

1590
01:27:03,869 --> 01:27:06,110
Sometimes the shark would go away…

1591
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,502
but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

1592
01:27:09,574 --> 01:27:11,804
The final telling of the Indianapolis tale

1593
01:27:11,877 --> 01:27:14,141
was one of the most riveting…

1594
01:27:15,514 --> 01:27:18,779
Sometimes when you're
watching another actor tell a story,

1595
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,142
you're making up your interest.

1596
01:27:24,222 --> 01:27:26,247
When Robert told that story,

1597
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:29,690
I couldn't keep my eyes off him.

1598
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:32,990
In both the book and the
early versions of the script,

1599
01:27:34,633 --> 01:27:38,592
Quint is harpooning the shark,

1600
01:27:39,271 --> 01:27:42,286
his leg gets caught in the rope,
he gets dragged over the side

1601
01:27:42,374 --> 01:27:46,436
to his death, where he drowns and
is probably bitten too, as far as I know.

1602
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:50,539
<i>He dies the way Ahab dies</i> in <i>Moby Dick.</i>

1603
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:58,331
<i>It always seemed to us that if Quint
is gonna die, he should be bitten.</i>

1604
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:00,968
<i>The best would be if he
could go mano a mane</i>

1605
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,090
<i>and stab the shark, which he does.</i>

1606
01:28:04,396 --> 01:28:08,230
<i>His formidable human talents are no match</i>

1607
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,270
<i>for the formidable
shark talents of the fish.</i>

1608
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,870
<i>So we chose the ending
that we have in the movie,</i>

1609
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:19,377
<i>which is that he slides into the great
jaws of the fish and gets chomped.</i>

1610
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:26,950
And Scheider sees it and is terrified.

1611
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:39,525
The second Orca that was
constructed was built just to sink,

1612
01:28:39,598 --> 01:28:42,533
and then pump air back in the ballast

1613
01:28:42,601 --> 01:28:45,070
and it would come up for take two.

1614
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:49,281
And then sink a second time, or
<i>as</i> many times as we had to sink it.

1615
01:28:49,674 --> 01:28:52,609
That was for the shot
where the boat starts to sink,

1616
01:28:52,677 --> 01:28:56,045
<i>and Roy Scheider has to
climb out the flipping window</i>

1617
01:28:56,147 --> 01:28:58,081
<i>and climb the mast as the boat goes down,</i>

1618
01:28:58,149 --> 01:29:01,084
and he only has one final
opportunity to succeed.

1619
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,054
Damn it!

1620
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,984
<i>The most interesting conflict</i>

1621
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:09,652
<i>happened between me and Steven</i>

1622
01:29:09,728 --> 01:29:11,776
<i>when it came to the
discussion of the ending.</i>

1623
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,156
He said to me, "The ending
of the book is a downer.

1624
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,463
"The shark gets stabbed with a
harpoon, can't hold up the barrels,

1625
01:29:17,536 --> 01:29:20,267
"and eventually drowns,
spins slowly to the bottom,

1626
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:24,070
"and the movie or the book, the
story ends. The characters are saved.

1627
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:26,643
"That is not a big, rousing ending.

1628
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:28,907
"I need a big, rousing ending."

1629
01:29:29,714 --> 01:29:32,206
So he said, "Here is
what I propose to do."

1630
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,161
And he told me the ending he had in mind.

1631
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:38,456
I said, "Steven, that is completely
unbelievable. It can't happen.

1632
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:43,272
"A shark does not bite down on a scuba
tank and explode like an oil refinery."

1633
01:29:44,362 --> 01:29:46,353
He said, "I don't care."

1634
01:29:46,731 --> 01:29:49,450
He said, "if I have
got them for two hours,

1635
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,133
"they will believe whatever I do

1636
01:29:51,202 --> 01:29:53,933
"for the next three minutes,
because I've got them.

1637
01:29:54,022 --> 01:29:58,289
"I want the audience on
their feet screaming at the end,

1638
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:01,846
"'Yes, yes! This is what
should happen to this animal!"'

1639
01:30:01,947 --> 01:30:05,406
Which reminded me, in
retrospect, of the Bill Goldman thing,

1640
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:09,067
which is that reality may be
great and truth may be wonderful,

1641
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,067
but none of it holds a
candle to believability.

1642
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:14,057
If the filmmaker has done his job

1643
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:17,686
and brought you into
believability, he can do anything.

1644
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:21,430
Play by the rules. Set the
rules, but follow the rules.

1645
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:23,684
And that's exactly what Steven did.

1646
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,534
He was right, I was wrong,

1647
01:30:25,604 --> 01:30:27,015
in this entire argument.

1648
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:31,275
His ending brought people
to their feet screaming,

1649
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:33,857
"Yes, yes! This is
the way it should be!"

1650
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:37,965
And it may be incredible,
but it was the right thing to do.

1651
01:30:44,673 --> 01:30:46,607
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1652
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:01,565
In <i>Duel,</i> you hear the sound of…

1653
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:05,354
In fact it was a dinosaur growling

1654
01:31:05,744 --> 01:31:07,644
from an old "B" dinosaur picture,

1655
01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:09,379
when the truck went over the cliff,

1656
01:31:09,447 --> 01:31:13,816
'cause I had always imagined the truck
to be a bit like a T-rex chasing a car.

1657
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:29,925
I used the very same sound effect in <i>Jaws</i>.

1658
01:31:30,468 --> 01:31:32,960
Almost as a bit of just a reminder

1659
01:31:33,038 --> 01:31:36,918
that there was a kinship
between both stories,

1660
01:31:37,308 --> 01:31:39,777
as the shark is sinking to
the bottom of the ocean,

1661
01:31:39,844 --> 01:31:42,779
<i>after it's been exploded
by the compressed air.</i>

1662
01:32:07,338 --> 01:32:11,684
<i>One of the great
pieces of Spielbergian genius</i>

1663
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:15,686
was the fact that at the
end of the movie Jaws,

1664
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:18,599
the Richard Dreyfuss character pops up

1665
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:20,967
and they swim to shore together.

1666
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:22,810
<i>This brought cheers, of course.</i>

1667
01:32:22,887 --> 01:32:24,867
<i>It was what the audience wanted.</i>

1668
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:28,086
I used to hate the water.

1669
01:32:30,361 --> 01:32:32,341
I can't imagine why.

1670
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:36,083
<i>When I finally did leave the island,</i>

1671
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:39,882
just before the last shot, which
was the blowing up of the shark…

1672
01:32:40,271 --> 01:32:41,739
I left the island for two reasons.

1673
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:44,474
One, I heard the crew wanted
to throw me overboard.

1674
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:48,888
I didn't know whether they were going
to throw me overboard in cement slippers

1675
01:32:48,997 --> 01:32:52,900
or throw me overboard via the poop deck,

1676
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:54,742
one bounce, and then into the water.

1677
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:58,682
Or whether it was going
to be just into the water

1678
01:32:58,757 --> 01:32:59,997
with a two-foot sandy bottom.

1679
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:01,371
I didn't know what they were gonna do,

1680
01:33:01,476 --> 01:33:03,467
so I thought I'd get out quickly.

1681
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:06,007
I remember when I got to Boston

1682
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:08,742
on the ferry.

1683
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:13,231
We spent the night in Boston, and
the next day we were scheduled…

1684
01:33:13,304 --> 01:33:16,649
Dreyfuss and I had to fly back to
Los Angeles on American Airlines.

1685
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:20,194
I vividly recall
getting into my hotel room

1686
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:26,033
and having a complete anxiety breakdown.

1687
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,568
I mean it's a complete…

1688
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:30,297
I don't know what you would
call it. It was a breakdown.

1689
01:33:30,405 --> 01:33:32,100
I couldn't stop shaking.

1690
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:35,054
My jaw was clenched.
I couldn't open my mouth.

1691
01:33:35,326 --> 01:33:37,260
I was getting electrical
shocks through my brain

1692
01:33:37,328 --> 01:33:38,944
like I was having seizures.

1693
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,788
I know this sounds really melodramatic,

1694
01:33:40,882 --> 01:33:42,407
but it's exactly what happened.

1695
01:33:42,517 --> 01:33:44,747
Something neurological, emotional…

1696
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:46,196
Something was happening to me.

1697
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:49,263
It was a full panic attack,

1698
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:54,323
which I don't remember ever
having at that level before.

1699
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:56,890
I remember calling Richard up.

1700
01:33:56,981 --> 01:34:00,690
He was in the pub downstairs
and Richard came up with me.

1701
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:03,018
I just said, "I'm in
really bad shape, Ricky."

1702
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:06,387
Rick said, "Don't worry. We'll be on
the airplane tomorrow." Which we were.

1703
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:10,968
My recollection is that we
showed a cut version of the film

1704
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,711
with one big sequence missing,

1705
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,545
without Johnny Williams' music,

1706
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,613
in a projection room at Universal Studios.

1707
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:24,993
And when the lights went on, there
was no reaction at all, as I recall.

1708
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,421
I recall turning around and saying,

1709
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,430
"Well, Sid, what do you think?"

1710
01:34:30,532 --> 01:34:32,000
He said, "It's okay."

1711
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,365
Well, "okay" was like
being given one-half a star.

1712
01:34:35,687 --> 01:34:38,463
"Okay" for 159 days?

1713
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:40,223
Of course it was only "okay."

1714
01:34:40,575 --> 01:34:42,805
It didn't have Johnny Williams' music.

1715
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:46,370
It didn't have some major underwater stuff

1716
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:49,007
that we filmed in the tank at MGM Studios

1717
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,916
in order to get very
close angles underwater.

1718
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,020
We couldn't get…

1719
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:55,722
The waters in Martha's
Vineyard, both cold and murky,

1720
01:34:55,807 --> 01:34:58,174
wouldn't allow us to do
much underwater stuff.

1721
01:34:58,243 --> 01:35:02,225
Metro had this great Esther
Williams tank, as it used to be called.

1722
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:06,607
So the reaction was, "Go
get the rest of the movie."

1723
01:35:06,684 --> 01:35:08,925
When they came back
from Martha's Vineyard,

1724
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,766
they realized that they didn't have

1725
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,283
the footage, as I understood it,

1726
01:35:12,357 --> 01:35:16,772
that they needed, of Hooper
and the shark together in the cage.

1727
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,509
So I was called.

1728
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:21,355
A friend of mine, Jesse
Wayne, recommended me.

1729
01:35:21,432 --> 01:35:25,209
He was called first, and, not
being a certified scuba diver,

1730
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:29,782
he spoke to Tom Joyner, the
assistant director, who then called me.

1731
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:31,265
I went in,

1732
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:35,160
and we went down to Culver City

1733
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:38,631
to MGM Studios, and
shot it in a tank down there.

1734
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:54,181
There were three inter-cuts
for the sequence

1735
01:35:54,282 --> 01:35:55,977
where the shark attacks the cage.

1736
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:59,736
One, of course, was Dick Warlock,

1737
01:36:00,305 --> 01:36:05,106
who was the stunt person inside
the cage subbing for Richard Dreyfuss.

1738
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:12,510
<i>The second was the Rizzo
shoot with Ron and Val in Australia.</i>

1739
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:16,785
And there was Frank Sparks,
whose eyes I actually used

1740
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,629
to substitute Richard's eyes

1741
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,890
because Rich was unavailable
for shooting the inserts.

1742
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:23,439
So when you see
the Richard Dreyfuss scream,

1743
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:26,270
that's not Richard's face,
those aren't Richard's eyes.

1744
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:28,110
<i>That's a guy named Sparks.</i>

1745
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,417
Help!

1746
01:36:38,142 --> 01:36:42,022
Down in the tank was a metal apparatus

1747
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,224
that the shark was attached to,

1748
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:49,177
where it could move forward,
backward, sideways, up and down.

1749
01:36:49,454 --> 01:36:52,503
So it had pretty good
movement, real natural movement.

1750
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,722
<i>It was operated by a special effects man.</i>

1751
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:56,442
<i>His name is Whitey Krumm.</i>

1752
01:37:35,717 --> 01:37:37,446
As Whitey was looking in one window,

1753
01:37:37,552 --> 01:37:40,544
watching the shark from
the side with the controls,

1754
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:42,446
Mr. Spielberg was around the other side,

1755
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:44,286
or a quarter of the way around,

1756
01:37:44,392 --> 01:37:46,087
looking at it from another perspective.

1757
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:49,038
He was looking at the shark
coming directly at the cage,

1758
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,815
and they communicated with each other

1759
01:37:51,883 --> 01:37:54,102
via headphones and a microphone.

1760
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:56,614
<i>Okay, here we go. Attack.</i>

1761
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:05,837
<i>Bring it out now!</i>

1762
01:38:05,947 --> 01:38:06,994
<i>Bring it out!</i>

1763
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,215
<i>Okay, attack!
Attack!</i>

1764
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,474
<i>Okay, bring it back and bring it in again.</i>

1765
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:19,692
<i>Bring it back and then bring it in.</i>

1766
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:27,641
<i>Yeah, bring it out!</i>

1767
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:29,009
<i>Bring it out!</i>

1768
01:38:30,138 --> 01:38:31,333
<i>Now bring it in.</i>

1769
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:32,770
<i>Bring it in again.</i>

1770
01:38:33,257 --> 01:38:37,569
<i>Now, cut!
Once again, right</i> away.

1771
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,505
<i>Yeah, next time. Okay?</i>

1772
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:44,293
Good grief.
Am I in trouble with <i>Jaws?</i>

1773
01:38:45,036 --> 01:38:46,504
In Jaws trouble?

1774
01:38:46,571 --> 01:38:49,131
Verna was great. We used to call her…

1775
01:38:49,207 --> 01:38:52,518
Our affectionate nickname for
Verna Fields was "Mother Cutter"

1776
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:56,530
because she was like our
mom and she cooked for us,

1777
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,992
and she told us great
stories of Peter Bogdanovich

1778
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:02,320
and all the films that she cut with him.

1779
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:03,848
She was just a great person.

1780
01:39:03,921 --> 01:39:05,855
She was a very charismatic person.

1781
01:39:05,923 --> 01:39:09,700
She was the most charismatic
person on Jaws, her and Robert Shaw.

1782
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:11,427
Except she never came out to sea.

1783
01:39:11,496 --> 01:39:13,055
She was always in her cutting room.

1784
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:15,866
It was frustrating for
Verna, for two reasons.

1785
01:39:15,967 --> 01:39:18,334
One, she never had enough film to cut.

1786
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,865
Because on a good day, I get five shots.

1787
01:39:20,938 --> 01:39:23,032
On a good day at sea, five shots.

1788
01:39:23,307 --> 01:39:26,504
On an average day, about
three. On a bad day, none.

1789
01:39:27,345 --> 01:39:31,077
Verna didn't have a lot of film racing
into her cutting room to put together,

1790
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,543
so she had to be on the
island for seven months,

1791
01:39:33,618 --> 01:39:34,995
with very little to cut.

1792
01:39:35,086 --> 01:39:37,771
<i>Verna didn't have the film
until we finished the movie.</i>

1793
01:39:37,872 --> 01:39:39,522
<i>That's when Verna's work got started.</i>

1794
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:42,292
<i>Verna and I worked every day
on the picture at her house,</i>

1795
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:47,207
<i>in her little cutting room by
the pool, and she did a great job.</i>

1796
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,115
What am I looking for?

1797
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:54,337
We're looking for a nice place to
show that Quint refuses to slow the boat.

1798
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,910
<i>Quint, it can't take that much pressure!</i>

1799
01:40:08,286 --> 01:40:09,651
That's the spot, Steve.

1800
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:13,748
I had always wanted to be in
business with John Williams, all my life.

1801
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:17,341
When he said yes to Sugar
land, and we became friends…

1802
01:40:18,129 --> 01:40:20,120
Obviously, I wanted him to
do every picture I ever made,

1803
01:40:20,248 --> 01:40:22,228
and Jaws came second.

1804
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,600
When John saw the movie,
he called me up on the phone.

1805
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:27,934
He said, "This is like a pirate movie."

1806
01:40:28,005 --> 01:40:30,565
And he said, "I think we
need pirate music for this

1807
01:40:30,658 --> 01:40:33,969
"because this is primal, but
it's also fun and entertaining."

1808
01:40:34,045 --> 01:40:36,889
This idea of characterizing
the shark musically,

1809
01:40:36,998 --> 01:40:40,684
these low, thumping
ostinato notes in the bass,

1810
01:40:41,736 --> 01:40:44,467
were the result of a very
simple idea that I had.

1811
01:40:44,572 --> 01:40:48,691
I thought that the shark
should be represented

1812
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,989
by something in sound or in music,

1813
01:40:51,062 --> 01:40:55,056
probably music, because there's no
sound underneath the water, we thought.

1814
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,427
Today you might do it with sound effects.

1815
01:40:57,501 --> 01:41:00,277
I thought a driving thing in
the bottom of the orchestra

1816
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:05,235
might indicate the
mindless attack of the shark.

1817
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:08,921
It's all instinct. There's no
real intelligence behind it.

1818
01:41:09,931 --> 01:41:11,558
It's an unstoppable…

1819
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:17,414
This thing comes at you. You
can't fight it off without destroying it

1820
01:41:17,888 --> 01:41:20,664
because of this
relentless drive that it has.

1821
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:24,659
When he finally played the
music for me on the piano,

1822
01:41:24,729 --> 01:41:27,198
he previewed the main Jaws theme.

1823
01:41:27,531 --> 01:41:31,195
I expected to hear something
kind of weird and melodic,

1824
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:36,052
kind of tonal, but eerie
and of another world,

1825
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:38,842
almost a bit like outer space,

1826
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,735
inner space under the water.

1827
01:41:41,545 --> 01:41:43,206
And what he played me instead,

1828
01:41:43,281 --> 01:41:45,545
with two fingers on the lower keys, was…

1829
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,947
At first I began to laugh.
I thought he was…

1830
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:53,866
He had a great sense of humor.
I thought he was putting me on.

1831
01:41:53,975 --> 01:41:56,558
And he said, "No, that's
the theme to Jaws!"

1832
01:41:57,228 --> 01:41:59,754
I said, "Play it again."
He played it again.

1833
01:42:00,231 --> 01:42:04,145
And he played it again,
and it suddenly seemed right.

1834
01:42:04,235 --> 01:42:06,397
But when I first heard it, it seemed wrong

1835
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:09,986
because it just seemed too simple.

1836
01:42:10,574 --> 01:42:15,239
And so simple… Often the
best ideas are the simplest ones.

1837
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:19,614
And John found a signature
for the entire movie.

1838
01:42:19,684 --> 01:42:23,086
One could alter
the speed of this ostinato.

1839
01:42:23,154 --> 01:42:25,566
It could be note, note,

1840
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:28,802
any kind of alteration
of speed, to very slow,

1841
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,635
very fast, very soft, very loud.

1842
01:42:31,896 --> 01:42:35,958
All these things could
manipulate the moment

1843
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:39,115
to illustrate that the shark was

1844
01:42:39,954 --> 01:42:43,800
at the highest pitch of
frenzy, or something lower.

1845
01:42:44,442 --> 01:42:48,174
And this simple dramatic device
seemed to be what we needed.

1846
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:28,945
<i>Part of the genius of John Williams</i>

1847
01:43:29,019 --> 01:43:33,217
is how he spots music and
how he places music in a movie.

1848
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:35,854
That's sort of something

1849
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,861
that's never discussed
about the art of composition.

1850
01:43:39,497 --> 01:43:41,659
The placement of that composition.

1851
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:46,816
And John did not want music
to celebrate a red herring.

1852
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:50,597
He only wanted music to signal
the actual arrival of the shark.

1853
01:43:54,612 --> 01:43:59,413
<i>There were opportunities
to advertise the shark with music,</i>

1854
01:43:59,784 --> 01:44:02,264
<i>and also opportunities
when we don't have the music</i>

1855
01:44:02,353 --> 01:44:04,947
<i>and the audience has
the sense of an absence.</i>

1856
01:44:07,508 --> 01:44:10,626
They sense the absence of the
shark. They don't hear the thump.

1857
01:44:10,694 --> 01:44:12,788
We've conditioned them to do that.

1858
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:19,527
<i>But then you may go one step further.</i>

1859
01:44:19,603 --> 01:44:21,753
<i>We know now the shark really is there,</i>

1860
01:44:21,856 --> 01:44:23,574
<i>but we haven't advertised it with music,</i>

1861
01:44:23,641 --> 01:44:25,803
<i>so his attack comes out of silence.</i>

1862
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:30,029
<i>Now, because you're conditioned
to have the music every time,</i>

1863
01:44:30,131 --> 01:44:33,647
<i>when you don't and the shark
arrives, it's even more terrifying.</i>

1864
01:44:34,552 --> 01:44:36,850
It's one of the beauties
of the film medium

1865
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:40,221
that when you combine music
with this kind of visual thing,

1866
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:42,988
you can get this association
in people's minds.

1867
01:44:43,093 --> 01:44:46,358
I think if you did it musically
just in a concert piece,

1868
01:44:46,464 --> 01:44:48,193
it wouldn't have the same effect.

1869
01:44:48,265 --> 01:44:52,224
It's the combination of
the visual and the situation.

1870
01:44:52,303 --> 01:44:56,149
This being the shark, or the
knifing scene in Hitchcock's Psycho,

1871
01:44:56,307 --> 01:44:57,502
combined with the notes.

1872
01:44:57,575 --> 01:45:02,308
That combination of sound and image

1873
01:45:02,563 --> 01:45:04,190
forming a memory,

1874
01:45:04,415 --> 01:45:08,579
which can then be referred back to.

1875
01:45:08,936 --> 01:45:11,098
As you do with an
audience that now hears it,

1876
01:45:11,205 --> 01:45:13,003
and a child will scream in terror

1877
01:45:13,107 --> 01:45:16,589
because of the association
that's been created.

1878
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,321
Ho open where are you?

1879
01:45:20,848 --> 01:45:23,966
<i>My favorite cue in</i> Jaws
<i>has always been that barrel chase,</i>

1880
01:45:24,034 --> 01:45:27,595
<i>where the shark approaches the
boat and they harpoon the animal</i>

1881
01:45:27,671 --> 01:45:32,404
<i>and he takes the line out
and the barrels lift off the boat</i>

1882
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:35,411
<i>and the music accelerates
and becomes very exciting.</i>

1883
01:45:36,146 --> 01:45:37,307
<i>Show.</i>

1884
01:45:40,317 --> 01:45:41,409
Time.

1885
01:45:43,153 --> 01:45:44,735
What were you doing? You knew I had

1886
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,137
to get a clean shot right in the head.

1887
01:45:47,241 --> 01:45:50,723
All right, let's see how long
that barrel takes to bring him up.

1888
01:45:50,794 --> 01:45:54,981
The boat turns to follow the
shark as he's pulling the line out,

1889
01:45:55,065 --> 01:45:56,624
and the music becomes very heroic.

1890
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:01,103
There's a Korngoldian
fanfare, if you like, of triumph

1891
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:04,618
as they're going through
the waves chasing the shark.

1892
01:46:05,626 --> 01:46:08,812
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!

1893
01:46:25,362 --> 01:46:27,387
<i>Suddenly the shark dives down.</i>

1894
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:31,560
<i>The music deflates and gets
slower and slower and softer.</i>

1895
01:46:35,839 --> 01:46:38,820
<i>The deflation and
disappointment of the realization</i>

1896
01:46:38,926 --> 01:46:41,111
<i>that the shark hasn't been captured.</i>

1897
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:46,216
It's all illustrated in this
one area where the music

1898
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:50,778
is able to follow all that
dramatic outline and punctuate it.

1899
01:46:50,905 --> 01:46:52,737
Without that score,

1900
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,434
I believe the film would have
only been half as successful.

1901
01:46:55,526 --> 01:46:58,962
The score was clearly responsible
for half the success of that movie.

1902
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:03,791
<i>Jaws</i> certainly was a hallmark in
my career. It changed it very greatly.

1903
01:47:03,867 --> 01:47:05,062
I had done

1904
01:47:05,135 --> 01:47:08,070
I don't know how many films,
dozens, before that,

1905
01:47:08,138 --> 01:47:10,288
and certainly hundreds
of television shows.

1906
01:47:10,391 --> 01:47:13,406
As a matter of fact, I'd even won
an Academy Award before Jaws

1907
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:16,172
<i>for having been</i> music
<i>director of Fiddler on the Roof,</i>

1908
01:47:16,246 --> 01:47:19,511
for which I did all the
arrangements and underscoring

1909
01:47:19,617 --> 01:47:23,611
and conducting of that
movie in 1970, I think it was.

1910
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:30,066
Jaws, for me, was the first Academy
Award that I received for my own music.

1911
01:47:31,245 --> 01:47:35,091
So that was a very significant
moment in my career,

1912
01:47:35,165 --> 01:47:37,247
as it would be for anyone's.

1913
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,894
The first test of Jaws took place,

1914
01:47:40,437 --> 01:47:44,101
as I wrote in my own book,
in Dallas in a shopping center.

1915
01:47:46,894 --> 01:47:49,989
Dick Zanuck and I were extremely nervous.

1916
01:47:50,364 --> 01:47:52,446
Would the shark get laughs?

1917
01:47:52,816 --> 01:47:56,650
Everybody knew that had read a
newspaper, that it was not a real shark.

1918
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:58,697
What would happen?

1919
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:02,458
And I remember circling
around that theater,

1920
01:48:03,293 --> 01:48:04,920
and we noticed a crowd.

1921
01:48:05,195 --> 01:48:09,177
Of course we weren't very subtle
with what was put on the marquee.

1922
01:48:09,283 --> 01:48:11,866
It was like, "The biggest
fish story you'll ever see,"

1923
01:48:11,935 --> 01:48:15,280
or something very clever
that attracted attention.

1924
01:48:15,389 --> 01:48:17,403
After all, Jaws was
a number one bestseller

1925
01:48:17,474 --> 01:48:19,408
and had a lot of media attention.

1926
01:48:19,476 --> 01:48:22,923
And so we went and had a very stiff drink.

1927
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:25,656
We went into the theater,

1928
01:48:25,949 --> 01:48:28,680
and the screams started,
and they never stopped.

1929
01:48:29,136 --> 01:48:32,049
And we were pinching
each other. It was incredible.

1930
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:36,215
I thought the whole roof,

1931
01:48:36,326 --> 01:48:39,307
ceiling of the theater
was going to collapse

1932
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:43,600
because of the noise, the
shock and the screams so loud.

1933
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:46,580
And it didn't die down, so that we…

1934
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:51,124
You couldn't, literally, hear the dialogue

1935
01:48:51,225 --> 01:48:54,786
for the next, maybe minute
because there was…

1936
01:48:54,878 --> 01:48:57,506
People were screaming repeatedly.

1937
01:48:58,165 --> 01:49:01,066
And there was such
excitement in the theater.

1938
01:49:01,335 --> 01:49:05,920
I remember elbowing Mr. Brown,
who was sitting next to me,

1939
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,974
and he was elbowing me back,
and said, "We're in. We did it."

1940
01:49:11,345 --> 01:49:15,088
We knew with that first
scream that it had worked.

1941
01:49:15,182 --> 01:49:17,344
When the shark came out of the water,

1942
01:49:17,451 --> 01:49:19,351
when Roy Scheider was chumming and said,

1943
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:22,036
"Why don't you come down
and chum some of this shit?"

1944
01:49:22,106 --> 01:49:23,619
The shark comes out.

1945
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:27,354
I had designed, hopefully, a
laugh that would turn into a scream.

1946
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:29,839
So I used the word "shit."
I added that line

1947
01:49:29,913 --> 01:49:32,257
because in those days, back in 1974,

1948
01:49:32,366 --> 01:49:33,629
the word "shit" was an easy laugh.

1949
01:49:33,734 --> 01:49:35,543
Now it's used so much
nobody laughs anymore.

1950
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:37,416
Then it wasn't used that much.

1951
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,707
It instantly got a nervous
laugh from audiences,

1952
01:49:39,807 --> 01:49:43,641
often an embarrassed laugh. With
younger people, a rebellious laugh.

1953
01:49:44,111 --> 01:49:46,489
I was trying to change a laugh,

1954
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:48,907
ramping up into a scream.
And it worked.

1955
01:49:49,016 --> 01:49:51,644
It was my proudest moment
at the whole preview.

1956
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:53,652
They laughed when they heard "shit,"

1957
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:56,530
and when the shark came out
that laugh sustained itself

1958
01:49:56,607 --> 01:49:59,292
into a humongous scream,
and popcorn went flying.

1959
01:49:59,393 --> 01:50:03,193
It was amazing, and it made
me greedy. I got so greedy.

1960
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:05,388
Because earlier in the movie,

1961
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:09,051
when they find Ben
Gardner's head in the boat,

1962
01:50:09,319 --> 01:50:12,550
I hadn't timed it right,
and Richard turns around…

1963
01:50:12,623 --> 01:50:14,364
That's where the head's already there,

1964
01:50:14,475 --> 01:50:16,842
and there was no reaction
from the audience at all.

1965
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:19,208
So I was scratching my head
after the preview.

1966
01:50:19,313 --> 01:50:20,997
I was extraordinarily happy.

1967
01:50:21,064 --> 01:50:24,159
The numbers were the highest
numbers in Universal's history,

1968
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:26,413
the executives were happy, we were happy,

1969
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,010
the audience loved the picture.

1970
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:29,203
And I was greedy.

1971
01:50:29,273 --> 01:50:32,265
I said, "There's one more
scream we can get into this movie

1972
01:50:32,342 --> 01:50:35,528
"if I can figure out this thing
with Ben Gardner's head."

1973
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:39,382
The studio wouldn't give me more
money, though they were ecstatic.

1974
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:43,158
They said, "It's fine. Don't fix
something that's not broken. It works.

1975
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,388
"Don't mess with it, or you'll
improve this into a failure."

1976
01:50:46,456 --> 01:50:49,016
So I went and spent $3,000 of my own money

1977
01:50:49,193 --> 01:50:51,605
to have some art department people

1978
01:50:51,712 --> 01:50:54,613
build a balsa-wood side of a boat

1979
01:50:55,098 --> 01:50:57,442
to match the Ben Gardner
boat we had shot before,

1980
01:50:57,551 --> 01:51:01,351
cut a hole in it and got the
same Ben Gardner head,

1981
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:04,372
the Styrofoam head, latex and Styrofoam,

1982
01:51:04,474 --> 01:51:05,987
and had it underwater.

1983
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:09,620
And this time, simply, when the
double for Rick came to the hole,

1984
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:12,461
I used several timings, I shot
it about nine different ways.

1985
01:51:12,566 --> 01:51:13,943
One time I shot it,

1986
01:51:14,017 --> 01:51:16,827
he comes through the hole
and the head comes out.

1987
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:18,515
Another time,

1988
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:21,058
he comes through the hole and
the head comes out at the same time.

1989
01:51:21,124 --> 01:51:24,651
Another time, the head comes
out and he's not even in the shot.

1990
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:27,105
Then the camera goes
really close to the knife,

1991
01:51:27,214 --> 01:51:29,273
taking the tooth out,
the head comes out there.

1992
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:31,750
I did it a whole bunch of different ways,

1993
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:34,184
and then I went to the dubbing room.

1994
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:37,770
We were already remixing
little changes we had made.

1995
01:51:38,325 --> 01:51:40,384
And I cut it in and I tried it out

1996
01:51:40,494 --> 01:51:42,553
on all of the sound effects editors,

1997
01:51:42,663 --> 01:51:44,757
the music editors and the dubbers.

1998
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,765
And I showed them one way, and they said,

1999
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:48,858
"Interesting. It's better
than what you had."

2000
01:51:48,969 --> 01:51:50,960
Another way, no reaction.

2001
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:53,765
And then one way, nobody screamed,

2002
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,501
but they all kind of suddenly said,

2003
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:58,670
"Oh, yeah. Wow. That
surprised me. I didn't expect it."

2004
01:51:59,429 --> 01:52:01,147
It was simply a matter of timing.

2005
01:52:01,248 --> 01:52:02,875
And the moment that works the best,

2006
01:52:02,983 --> 01:52:05,896
which is the moment in the
movie that the dubbers reacted to,

2007
01:52:05,986 --> 01:52:08,830
is the moment where he gets to the hole,

2008
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,883
and then the head comes out.
There's just a bit of a pause.

2009
01:52:22,069 --> 01:52:25,630
And I just remember we then
took the film to Long Beach.

2010
01:52:26,123 --> 01:52:28,535
I think at the Lakewood Theaters.

2011
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:30,711
And we had a second preview there

2012
01:52:30,811 --> 01:52:33,496
with that extra scene,
that extra moment in.

2013
01:52:33,814 --> 01:52:36,442
And it got a humongous scream.

2014
01:52:36,867 --> 01:52:40,667
Bigger than the scream in Dallas when
the shark came out, with Roy chumming.

2015
01:52:40,737 --> 01:52:42,501
And popcorn flew even higher,

2016
01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:44,449
and people came out of their seats higher.

2017
01:52:44,558 --> 01:52:47,255
And I was thrilled until at Lakewood,

2018
01:52:47,561 --> 01:52:50,826
we got to the scene that
got the previous big laugh,

2019
01:52:51,098 --> 01:52:53,897
where the shark comes out of
the water when Roy's chumming.

2020
01:52:54,001 --> 01:52:57,369
It got a big scream, but it was only 50%

2021
01:52:57,938 --> 01:53:00,316
or less of the scream we got in Dallas.

2022
01:53:00,407 --> 01:53:02,569
So that preview was a smash preview.

2023
01:53:02,676 --> 01:53:06,112
The scores were higher, the
studio was flying on cloud nine.

2024
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:08,910
They'll make a fortune with
the movie, they keep saying.

2025
01:53:09,016 --> 01:53:10,848
And I'm scratching my head thinking,

2026
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,852
"Now what did I do to make
that second scream less?"

2027
01:53:13,954 --> 01:53:16,139
And I realized it was a no-brainer.

2028
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:21,184
The audience didn't trust me after the
first scream at the end of the first act.

2029
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:24,026
They were surprised, and
then they were looking out

2030
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:26,975
for shadows and things
coming out from behind things.

2031
01:53:27,067 --> 01:53:31,504
And they were defensive and
ready for some kind of a shock.

2032
01:53:32,456 --> 01:53:36,916
The rating of Jaws was a real cliffhanger.

2033
01:53:38,045 --> 01:53:41,140
Richard Heffner, the
chairman of the rating board

2034
01:53:41,248 --> 01:53:43,683
of the Motion Picture
Association of America

2035
01:53:43,784 --> 01:53:47,152
that tells parents
what to expect on movies…

2036
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:52,884
It was essential to the MCA/Universal
financiers and distributors

2037
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:56,161
that Jaws get a "PG" rating,

2038
01:53:56,263 --> 01:53:59,164
meaning "parental guidance indicated,"

2039
01:53:59,266 --> 01:54:01,633
but it meant that children
could come and see it.

2040
01:54:01,735 --> 01:54:05,478
Whatever the ratings board said
to Sheinberg and Wasserman,

2041
01:54:06,289 --> 01:54:09,441
they told Dick and David, who
came to me as my producers

2042
01:54:09,543 --> 01:54:13,639
and said, "Steven, in order to get
not an 'R' rating, but a 'PG' rating,

2043
01:54:13,864 --> 01:54:17,346
"you need to cut some frames
from the leg coming down."

2044
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:20,352
I was happy to do it, as they
didn't ask me to cut the leg out.

2045
01:54:20,454 --> 01:54:25,016
They just asked me not to let the
leg hit, bounce, gush blood, settle…

2046
01:54:25,208 --> 01:54:27,188
Because I was really sort of studying it.

2047
01:54:27,294 --> 01:54:30,264
So I cut about a foot and a
half to two feet off that shot.

2048
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:32,992
<i>You'll see the leg.
Just when you see it severed</i>

2049
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,899
<i>and it just starts to hit
the silt bed, we cut</i> away.

2050
01:54:35,986 --> 01:54:40,401
And finally, a "PG" was awarded.

2051
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:45,619
Our argument was very simple
with Heffner and his board.

2052
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:50,897
Nobody impersonates a shark,
unlike films of violence.

2053
01:54:51,168 --> 01:54:54,001
No one is going to get up
and eat somebody.

2054
01:54:54,121 --> 01:54:56,556
Nobody's going to drag
someone down in the water.

2055
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:01,294
What happens in nature is
part of childhood's experience.

2056
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:05,127
<i>Anyone</i> who's read <i>Grimm's
Fairy Tales… Red Riding Hood.</i>

2057
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:08,964
<i>Little Red Riding Hood is one</i> of
<i>the scariest stories ever written,</i>

2058
01:55:10,337 --> 01:55:13,534
and children are regularly terrified.

2059
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,338
After the film was distributed,

2060
01:55:16,877 --> 01:55:21,246
I don't recall any letters from children…

2061
01:55:21,348 --> 01:55:23,783
About children having bad dreams.

2062
01:55:24,151 --> 01:55:26,779
I had many about adults having bad dreams

2063
01:55:26,887 --> 01:55:29,083
and never going by the water again.

2064
01:55:29,306 --> 01:55:33,243
And so the rating, to the
great relief of MCA/Universal,

2065
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:37,156
was, in my estimation, rightly
given "parental guidance."

2066
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:41,724
"May be too intense for
some children" was on the ads.

2067
01:55:42,536 --> 01:55:45,050
Of course, all that did was bring them in.

2068
01:55:45,288 --> 01:55:48,531
I saw the film in its final version

2069
01:55:48,959 --> 01:55:51,690
when it played at the
Rivoli Theater in Manhattan,

2070
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:54,895
which was a huge theater
with a great big screen.

2071
01:55:54,965 --> 01:55:59,334
And members of my family
and guests were invited.

2072
01:56:03,607 --> 01:56:07,817
Watching the audience react
to it was wonderfully exciting.

2073
01:56:07,928 --> 01:56:10,454
I mean, they just laughed
and they screamed.

2074
01:56:10,831 --> 01:56:13,277
They did everything
that we hoped they would do.

2075
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:16,559
I happened, by coincidence, to be
next to the Newsweek researcher,

2076
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,297
who was next to the Time researcher.

2077
01:56:18,405 --> 01:56:21,887
At the moment when Roy turns aft

2078
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:23,619
and the shark comes out of the water,

2079
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:26,207
and he utters that great
line that I wish I'd written,

2080
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:28,554
"I think you're gonna need a bigger boat,"

2081
01:56:28,632 --> 01:56:30,930
<i>the Newsweek researcher
jumped out</i> of <i>her</i> chair

2082
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,483
and landed on the upturned
pen of the Time researcher,

2083
01:56:34,588 --> 01:56:37,102
thus having a double screamer going.

2084
01:56:37,541 --> 01:56:39,475
I thought right then,

2085
01:56:39,543 --> 01:56:42,103
"We have a fairly successful
movie going on here."

2086
01:56:42,429 --> 01:56:45,012
There was applause at
the end of the movie.

2087
01:56:45,382 --> 01:56:48,010
The movie ends, we're
swimming away, it says "The End,"

2088
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:51,110
and they went crackers.
Everyone went berserk.

2089
01:56:52,189 --> 01:56:54,317
However many people are in that theater…

2090
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:57,509
I couldn't even tell you.
Pretty big theater.

2091
01:56:57,611 --> 01:56:59,124
They went nuts.

2092
01:57:01,831 --> 01:57:05,881
And then they sat and they
watched all of the credits,

2093
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:09,915
every last one of them, and nobody moved.

2094
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:13,886
And then they applauded again.

2095
01:57:13,994 --> 01:57:15,359
And I've never seen that.

2096
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:19,411
And I remember walking out
on the sidewalk at the end of it.

2097
01:57:19,683 --> 01:57:22,243
I looked at Dreyfuss and he looked at me,

2098
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,369
and he ran over and
he jumped up in my arms

2099
01:57:26,907 --> 01:57:30,787
and he said, "We're sensational!

2100
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,624
"We're great!
We're terrific!"

2101
01:57:32,696 --> 01:57:34,255
And I said, "Yeah."

2102
01:57:34,331 --> 01:57:38,700
At the end of that evening I walked
out and I ran into Dreyfuss in the street,

2103
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:40,429
and we went to a bar,

2104
01:57:40,503 --> 01:57:45,168
and all Rick could say was, "He did it!"

2105
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:48,874
And I said, "Who did it?
What are you talking about?"

2106
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:50,811
He said, "Spielberg
did it! He did it!"

2107
01:57:50,931 --> 01:57:52,660
It was a hell of a moment.

2108
01:57:52,766 --> 01:57:56,350
I felt so proud that I was in that movie,

2109
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,814
and so proud for Spielberg.

2110
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:03,942
I remember getting on
the phone with notes.

2111
01:58:04,044 --> 01:58:08,038
I was saying, "And you gotta
do this and you gotta do that."

2112
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:11,634
He was very pleased.

2113
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:16,313
Well, Jaws went on to become

2114
01:58:17,057 --> 01:58:20,368
the biggest picture of
all times at that time,

2115
01:58:21,478 --> 01:58:24,573
surpassing the $100 million mark,

2116
01:58:24,648 --> 01:58:27,015
which had never been done before.

2117
01:58:27,217 --> 01:58:30,960
And I remember Universal
marketing department

2118
01:58:31,755 --> 01:58:33,655
would take an ad out

2119
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:37,221
with the shark and the titles

2120
01:58:37,294 --> 01:58:39,979
<i>of the various pictures that had beaten us</i>

2121
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,491
<i>and held the records.</i>

2122
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:45,495
<i>And the shark would
devour each one, each week,</i>

2123
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:48,236
whether <i>it be</i> The Godfather
or The Sound of Music,

2124
01:58:48,305 --> 01:58:50,399
<i>finally</i> Gone With The Wind.

2125
01:58:50,657 --> 01:58:54,036
Until we were up on top
of the surface, number one,

2126
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:57,987
and we became the
biggest picture of all time.

2127
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:02,318
This was before even a
foreign release of any kind.

2128
01:59:02,419 --> 01:59:05,411
We busted right through
the $100 million mark.

2129
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:10,317
And it was a phenomenon.
It really was a phenomenon.

2130
01:59:10,527 --> 01:59:13,371
When a movie has the
success that Jaws had,

2131
01:59:13,596 --> 01:59:16,258
it becomes more than an entertainment.

2132
01:59:16,333 --> 01:59:19,018
It becomes part of the popular culture.

2133
01:59:19,169 --> 01:59:20,432
And <i>Jaws</i> was no exception.

2134
01:59:20,537 --> 01:59:23,905
We had really wonderful
political cartoonists

2135
01:59:23,973 --> 01:59:26,499
like Conrad using the image of the shark

2136
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:30,028
as a metaphor for political
behavior in Washington.

2137
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:32,906
<i>We had sketches on Saturday Night Live.</i>

2138
01:59:32,982 --> 01:59:36,031
Chevy Chase did a great
Land Shark. I remember that.

2139
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:39,436
And then John Belushi,
blessed be his memory,

2140
01:59:39,622 --> 01:59:43,286
did a fabulous impression of Dreyfuss.

2141
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:46,762
You don't think of Belushi and
Dreyfuss being anywhere similar,

2142
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:49,674
but when Belushi put on a
blue knit watch cap and said,

2143
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:53,469
"This was no boating accident,"
you got a laugh out of it.

2144
01:59:55,004 --> 01:59:58,941
<i>The first shot of Airplane!</i>

2145
02:00:00,643 --> 02:00:03,305
By the Zucker brothers uses a shark theme.

2146
02:00:03,646 --> 02:00:07,640
It was a combination of elements
that were all so instantly identifiable

2147
02:00:07,751 --> 02:00:09,776
because everybody knew what they were.

2148
02:00:09,853 --> 02:00:13,096
The shark's theme became
a synonym for danger.

2149
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:19,551
Just all those elements just
became part of popular culture.

2150
02:00:20,597 --> 02:00:21,860
Every time I'd fall asleep,

2151
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:24,957
I dreamt I was on the third
or fourth day of shooting.

2152
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:28,669
I'd wake up with an electrical
explosion in my brain.

2153
02:00:29,489 --> 02:00:31,537
My heart beating, can't catch my breath,

2154
02:00:31,608 --> 02:00:34,600
looking around the room,
where am I? Disoriented.

2155
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:38,312
I'd calm down, get a glass of
water, go back to sleep again.

2156
02:00:38,782 --> 02:00:41,308
Same dream. I'm on
the fourth day of shooting,

2157
02:00:41,418 --> 02:00:46,106
and I know I've got another 146 days left.

2158
02:00:46,589 --> 02:00:48,421
And I'd wake up again.
Same thing.

2159
02:00:48,508 --> 02:00:52,695
And this thing was just haunting me
all night long till I didn't get any sleep.

2160
02:00:52,796 --> 02:00:57,745
So Jaws was a fun movie to
watch, but not a fun movie to make.
