I'm through doing that shit.

The same thing every time.

again, too dangerous."

Thank you. You're welcome.

14

I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:16,258
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,385
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:21,471
Federal banks ain't supposed to
stop you in any way during a robbery.

They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

19

I don't even need a
gun in a federal bank.

Heard about this one bloke, he
walks into a bank with a portable phone.

21
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:32,357
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

22
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:34,072
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't

23
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:35,986
give him all your money,
we're gonna kill her."

24

Did they hurt the little girl?

30
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,223
There probably never was a little girl.

31
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:53,253
The point of the
story isn't a little girl.

32
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:56,298
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

-I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,698
That's it? Mm-hmm.

161
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,700
Then what'd Marsellus do?

162
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:42,953
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

163
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:46,957
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigga fell four stories.

164
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:51,086
He had a little garden down at the bottom
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

165
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,422
Nigga fell <i>through</i> that.

166
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,425
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

167
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,638
That's a damn shame. Hmm.

168
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:09,146
But still, you play with matches,
you get burned. What do you mean?

169
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,358
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

170
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,903
You don't think he overreacted?

171
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:18,314
Antwan didn't expect
Marsellus to react the

172
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:20,866
way he did, but he
had to expect a reaction.

173
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,078
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is
nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

174
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:28,707
It's laying your hands in a familiar
way on Marsellus's new wife.

175
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,031
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy

176
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:33,670
out?
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

177
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,839
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out…

178
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:38,509
And givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

179
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:42,513
It's not. It's the same ballpark.
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

180
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,516
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

181
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,353
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking
your tongue in the holiest of holies…

182
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,459
Ain't the same fuckin'
ballpark; it ain't the

183
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,690
same league; it ain't
the same fuckin' sport.

184
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:57,611
Foot massages don't mean shit!
Have you ever given a foot massage?

[SCOFFS] Don't be tellin'
me about foot massages.

186
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:03,534
I'm the foot fuckin' master.
You given a lot of them?

187
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:05,482
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and

188
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,829

I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

use a foot massage. Yo, yo, yo, man.

I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

Come on. Let's hang back.

198

Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no
man a foot massage don't make it right…

199
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,960
For Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass motherfuckin' house,

200
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:56,754
fuckin' up the way the
nigga talks; that shit ain't right.

201

I kill the motherfucker.

I'm sayin' it does.

205

Now, look, I've given
a million ladies a million

206
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,810
foot massages, and
they all meant somethin'.

207
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:14,606
We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

208
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,774
There's a sensuous thing goin' on…

209

Where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

210
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:25,199
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

211
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,389
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a

humor about this shit.

Why you so interested in big man's wife?

218
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,243
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked

219
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,854
me if I'd take care of
her while he's gone.

220
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:57,940
Take care of her?
No, man. Just take her out.

221
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:01,361
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

222
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,988
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

223

It is not a date.

your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

Where? Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

ain't never had one myself. How are they?

burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

254
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,956
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

255
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,168

[INHALES] But you have to
promise not to be offended. No, no.

You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

-He fell out of a window.
-Hmm. Hmm.

677
00:44:55,977 --> 00:44:58,304
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way

678
00:44:58,388 --> 00:45:00,689
to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

679
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:03,901
Another way would be he
was thrown out by Marsellus.

680
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,495
Yet, even another way
is to say he was thrown

681

out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

682
00:45:09,198 --> 00:45:11,617
Is that a fact? No.

[CHUCKLES] Well, at the time I
was told it sounded reasonable.

out of a fourth-story window…

700

For massaging my feet seemed reasonable?

701

No, it seemed excessive, but
that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

is very protective of you.

We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together…

980
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:31,243
Over five years.

experience this yourself,

983

but when two men are in a
situation like me and your dad were…

984
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,629
For as long as we were,

985
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,008
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

986

right now to my son Jim.

991

I got something for ya.

992
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:15,787
This watch I got here…

993
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:17,570
Was first purchased by your

994
01:05:17,654 --> 01:05:20,625
great-grandfather during
the First World War.

995
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:25,380
It was bought in a little general
store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

996
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:29,009
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

997
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:32,012
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

998
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:35,265
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge…

999
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:38,268
On the day he set sail for Paris.

1000
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,771
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

1001
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:44,191
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and…

1002
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:47,819
When he'd done his duty, he went
home to your great-grandmother,

1003
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:52,324
took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed…

1004
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:56,828
Until your grandad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country…

1005
01:05:56,912 --> 01:06:00,624
To go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1006
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:04,169
This time they called it World War II.

1007
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:09,216
Your great-grandfather gave this
watch to your grandad for good luck.

1008
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,302
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1009
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:15,305
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed,

1010
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:19,392
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

1011
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,395
Your grandad was facing death.

1012
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,398
He knew it.

1013
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:28,402
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that island alive,

1014
01:06:28,486 --> 01:06:31,697
so three days before the
Japanese took the island,

1015
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:36,994
your grandad asked a gunner on an
Air Force transport, name of Winocki…

1016
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,997
A man he'd never met before in his life…

1017
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:43,042
To deliver to his infant son,

1018
01:06:43,126 --> 01:06:47,713
who he'd never seen in
the flesh, his gold watch.

1019
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:52,134
Three days later, your grandad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

1020
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:56,430
After the war was over, he
paid a visit to your grandmother,

1021
01:06:56,514 --> 01:07:00,768
delivering to your infant
father his dad's gold watch.

1022
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:02,771
This watch.

1023
01:07:08,652 --> 01:07:14,073
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

1024
01:07:14,157 --> 01:07:17,577
He was captured, put in a
Vietnamese prison camp.

1025
01:07:17,661 --> 01:07:21,706
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,

1026
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:25,293
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

1027
01:07:25,377 --> 01:07:29,088
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1028
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:31,049
He'd be damned if any
slope's gonna put their

1029
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:33,092
greasy, yellow hands
on his boy's birthright,

1030
01:07:33,176 --> 01:07:37,096
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something… his ass.

1031
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,600
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1032
01:07:40,684 --> 01:07:44,854
Then he died of dysentery…
He give me the watch.

1033
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:48,774
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass two years.

gettin' on my nerves. Fuck. [MUTTERING]

Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1655
01:53:42,004 --> 01:53:44,881
Slip your mind?
Did you forget that someone was in there…

1656
01:53:44,965 --> 01:53:46,841
With a goddamn hand cannon?

1657
01:53:46,925 --> 01:53:50,888
You see the size of that gun he
fired at us? It was bigger than him.

1658
01:53:55,642 --> 01:53:58,353
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1659
01:53:58,437 --> 01:54:00,355
I know. We was lucky.

1660
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:03,525
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1661
01:54:03,609 --> 01:54:07,821
-Yeah, maybe.
-This was divine intervention.

1662
01:54:07,905 --> 01:54:09,823
You know what divine intervention is?

1663
01:54:15,704 --> 01:54:17,622
I think so.

1664
01:54:17,706 --> 01:54:21,126
That means that God came down
from heaven and stopped the bullets.

1665
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:23,628
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1666
01:54:23,712 --> 01:54:26,962
God came down from heaven and
stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1667
01:54:27,925 --> 01:54:29,884
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1668
01:54:29,968 --> 01:54:32,345
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1669
01:54:32,429 --> 01:54:34,881
What just happened
here was a fuckin' miracle!

1670
01:54:34,965 --> 01:54:36,391
Chill. This shit happens.

1671
01:54:36,475 --> 01:54:39,227
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit <i>doesn't</i> "just happen."

Do you want to continue this

1673

Or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1674
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:47,944
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!

1675
01:54:48,028 --> 01:54:52,240
What happened here was a miracle,
and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1676
01:54:52,324 --> 01:54:57,037
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1677
01:55:04,044 --> 01:55:07,422
Let's go, nigga! Come on! Shit.

VINCENT: You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>

1679
01:55:11,218 --> 01:55:14,137
I was watching it one time
and there was this cop on,

1680
01:55:14,221 --> 01:55:18,141
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he
had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1681
01:55:18,225 --> 01:55:21,645
He just unloaded on this guy and
nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1682
01:55:21,729 --> 01:55:24,648
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1683
01:55:24,732 --> 01:55:28,068
I mean, you know, it's-it's
freaky, but it happens.

-It means that's it for me.

consider my ass retired.

01:55:42,209 --> 01:55:44,210
Hey, why are you
fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1691
01:55:44,294 --> 01:55:47,338
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today…
I'm through.

1692
01:55:47,422 --> 01:55:49,313
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

1693
01:55:49,397 --> 01:55:50,341
Don't worry, I will.

1694
01:55:50,425 --> 01:55:52,672
And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.

1695
01:55:52,756 --> 01:55:54,428

do you make of all this?

Aw, shit, man! Aw, man!

1701
01:56:08,568 --> 01:56:11,487
Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
Why the fuck'd you do that?

1702
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:13,448
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1703
01:56:13,573 --> 01:56:16,492
Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit
in my time, but this… Chill out, man!

1704
01:56:16,576 --> 01:56:19,495
It was an accident.
We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1705
01:56:19,579 --> 01:56:21,497
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1706
01:56:21,581 --> 01:56:24,875
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.
The gun went off.

1707
01:56:24,959 --> 01:56:28,379
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1708
01:56:28,463 --> 01:56:31,382
I don't believe it!
Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1709
01:56:31,466 --> 01:56:34,927
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops
notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1710
01:56:35,011 --> 01:56:37,930
Just take it to a friendly place,
that's all! This is the Valley, Vincent.

1711
01:56:38,014 --> 01:56:40,432
Marsellus ain't got no
friendly places in the Valley.

1712
01:56:40,516 --> 01:56:43,394
Well, Jules, this ain't my
fuckin' town, man! Shit!

1713
01:56:43,519 --> 01:56:46,397
What you doing?
I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1714
01:56:46,522 --> 01:56:50,067
Where's Toluca Lake?
Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1715
01:56:50,151 --> 01:56:53,070
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't
know what the fuck we gonna do,

1716
01:56:53,154 --> 01:56:56,073
'cause I ain't got no
other partners in 818.

1717
01:56:56,157 --> 01:56:59,076
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1718
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:03,080
Me and my homeboy are in a car,
and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1719
01:57:03,164 --> 01:57:05,364
I need to use your
garage for a couple hours.

1720
01:57:06,834 --> 01:57:09,753
We gotta be real fuckin'
delicate with this Jimmie situation.

1721
01:57:09,837 --> 01:57:13,424
He's one remark away from
kickin' our asses out the door.

1722
01:57:13,549 --> 01:57:16,468
If he does, what do we do? We
ain't leavin' till we make a couple calls,

1723
01:57:16,552 --> 01:57:19,471
but I don't want it to reach that pitch…
Jimmie's a friend.

1724
01:57:19,555 --> 01:57:22,474
You don't come into your friend's
house and start tellin' him what's what.

1725
01:57:22,558 --> 01:57:24,476
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1726
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,478
He kinda freaked out back
there when he saw Marvin.

1727
01:57:26,562 --> 01:57:29,732
Put yourself in his position…
It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1728
01:57:29,816 --> 01:57:31,734
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1729
01:57:31,818 --> 01:57:34,737
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

1730
01:57:34,821 --> 01:57:38,741
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he
can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1731
01:57:38,825 --> 01:57:42,746
Fuck, nigga, what the fuck'd you just do
to his towel, man? I was dryin' my hands!

1732
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:45,730
You're supposed to wash 'em first!
You watched me wash 'em.

1733
01:57:45,833 --> 01:57:49,377
I watched you get 'em wet. I was
washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1734
01:57:49,461 --> 01:57:51,379
Maybe if he'd had Lava I
coulda done a better job.

1735
01:57:51,463 --> 01:57:53,381
I used the same fuckin' soap you did,

1736
01:57:53,465 --> 01:57:56,384
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1737
01:57:56,468 --> 01:57:59,387
What if he was to come in
here and see his towel like this?

1738
01:57:59,471 --> 01:58:03,558
It's shit like this that's gonna
bring this situation to a head, man!

1739
01:58:03,642 --> 01:58:07,062
Look, I ain't threatenin'
you or nothin', all right?

1740
01:58:07,146 --> 01:58:11,608
You know I respect you and all. But just
don't put me in this position, all right?

1741
01:58:11,692 --> 01:58:14,361
All right. Fine. Fine.

1742
01:58:14,445 --> 01:58:17,364
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1743
01:58:17,448 --> 01:58:20,409
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1744
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:24,996
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1745
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,123
This some serious gourmet shit.

1746
01:58:27,207 --> 01:58:29,167
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied…

1747
01:58:29,251 --> 01:58:31,169
With some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1748
01:58:31,253 --> 01:58:33,171
Right? [CHUCKLES]

1749
01:58:33,255 --> 01:58:36,174
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1750
01:58:36,258 --> 01:58:38,301
-What flavor is this?
-Knock it off, Julie.

1751
01:58:38,385 --> 01:58:38,724
What?

1752
01:58:38,808 --> 01:58:42,430
I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1753
01:58:42,514 --> 01:58:45,016
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1754
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,977
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1755
01:58:47,061 --> 01:58:50,689
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff
'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1756
01:58:50,773 --> 01:58:54,693
But you know what's on my mind right now?
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1757
01:58:54,777 --> 01:58:56,945
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1758
01:58:57,029 --> 01:58:57,991
Jimmie, don't even worry…

1759
01:58:58,075 --> 01:59:00,448
-Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1760
01:59:00,532 --> 01:59:02,450
When you came pulling in here,

1761
01:59:02,534 --> 01:59:05,704
did you notice the sign on the front of
my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"?

1762
01:59:05,788 --> 01:59:06,888
You know I ain't seen no…

1763
01:59:06,972 --> 01:59:09,207
Did you notice the sign
on the front of my house…

1764
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:11,209
That said, "Dead nigger storage"?

1765
01:59:11,293 --> 01:59:14,004
No. I didn't.

1766
01:59:14,129 --> 01:59:17,007
You know why you didn't see that sign?
[SIGHS] Why?

1767
01:59:17,091 --> 01:59:19,177
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead

1768
01:59:19,261 --> 01:59:21,636
niggers ain't my fuckin'
business, that's why!

1769
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,639
-We're not gonna store the motherfucker…
-Don't you fuckin' realize…

1770
01:59:24,723 --> 01:59:26,850
That if Bonnie comes
home and finds a dead

1771
01:59:26,934 --> 01:59:29,144
body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?

1772
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:30,489
No marriage counselor. No trial

1773
01:59:30,573 --> 01:59:32,439
separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1774
01:59:32,523 --> 01:59:35,859
Okay?
And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!

1775
01:59:35,943 --> 01:59:40,947
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1776
01:59:41,031 --> 01:59:43,116
Jimmie, Jimmie, she
ain't gonna leave you.

1777
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:47,120
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1778
01:59:47,204 --> 01:59:49,218
There's nothin' you're
gonna say that's gonna

1779
01:59:49,302 --> 01:59:51,302
make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1780
01:59:54,294 --> 01:59:58,965
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1781
01:59:59,049 --> 02:00:01,677
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1782
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:05,264
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1783
02:00:05,348 --> 02:00:09,268
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1784
02:00:09,352 --> 02:00:12,271
That's Kool & the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1785
02:00:12,355 --> 02:00:15,274
All I wanna do is call my
people and get 'em to bring us in.

1786
02:00:15,358 --> 02:00:18,277
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1787
02:00:18,361 --> 02:00:21,447
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1788
02:00:21,531 --> 02:00:25,034
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is
in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1789
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:28,037
Well, say she comes home.

1790
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:30,540
What do you think she'll do?

1791
02:00:32,041 --> 02:00:34,460
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1792
02:00:34,544 --> 02:00:36,754
That ain't no kinda answer.

1793
02:00:36,838 --> 02:00:39,882
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1794
02:00:39,966 --> 02:00:42,802
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element…

1795
02:00:42,886 --> 02:00:44,804
This Bonnie situation is.

1796
02:00:44,888 --> 02:00:48,808
<i>She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen…</i>

1797
02:00:48,892 --> 02:00:50,810
<i>Doing a bunch of gangster shit,</i>

and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

02:27:30,544 --> 02:27:33,463
I never gave much
thought to what it meant.

You're the righteous
man, and I'm the shepherd,
