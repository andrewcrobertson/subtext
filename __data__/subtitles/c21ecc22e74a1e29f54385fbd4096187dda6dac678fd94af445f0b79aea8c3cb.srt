1
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,179
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

2
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:17,249
<i>Beth.</i>

3
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,086
Keenish.

4
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,622
Herr... Konish?

5
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,658
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

6
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:28,526
<i>'Ö.' "Herr König."</i>

7
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,762
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

8
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:33,199
<i>Gretchen and the movers
are right behind us.</i>

9
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,936
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

10
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:42,574
No, she's Beth.

11
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,479
Ah, okay.

12
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,415
And what is going on
with your sister?

13
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,817
She deaf or something?

14
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:53,853
<i>-No.</i>

15
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:58,656
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

16
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,010
You okay, honey?

17
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:21,981
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

18
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,984
Oh!

19
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,500
Ah, very good, Luis!

20
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,336
You've been practicing, huh?

21
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:45,538
How was your journey?

22
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,206
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

23
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,442
<i>We almost forgot
how beautiful it is here.</i>

24
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:52,078
<i>Ah, we almost forgot how
beautiful you are, Beth.</i>

25
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,479
<i>-Oh, stop!</i>

26
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,181
Keep going!

27
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,050
Gretchen, come say hi.

28
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,321
Gretchen.

29
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:05,024
- What's up?
- Oh, Jesus.

30
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,293
<i>Nice to meet you.
Willkommen.</i>

31
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:08,327
Thank you.

32
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:09,661
No, thank you, Beth.

33
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,031
We are so glad to have you back.

34
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:15,667
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

35
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:16,936
I completely understand.

36
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:20,072
<i>We have something
for you.</i>

37
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,607
It's...

38
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,478
The original sketch.

39
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,646
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

40
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,449
the land you acquired.

41
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,518
Beth, that is...

42
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:37,523
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

43
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:40,359
- Oh!
<i>- You know, you two lovebirds</i>

44
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,297
stumbled into my nest almost
eight years ago to the day.

45
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,099
<i>And I believe there were more</i>

46
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,869
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

47
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,104
<i>Hello, Alma.</i>

48
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,013
Your German is already
better than your father's, huh?

49
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,285
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

50
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:13,325
<i>Hey, Gretchen.
How are you holding up?</i>

51
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,971
<i>I wish we could
have spent a little</i>

52
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,629
<i>more time together
after the funeral,</i>

53
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:18,264
<i>but I get it.</i>

54
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:21,733
<i>You're all over Europe
with your dad's family, huh?</i>

55
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,904
<i>Don't forget you have a band
that needs your voice.</i>

56
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,906
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you
the new mix.</i>

57
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,041
<i>I knew your mom
would have loved it.</i>

58
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,455
Beth? It's occupied.

59
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,587
Gretchen, let's go!

60
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:50,856
<i>Herr König is taking us
to the new house.</i>

61
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:52,825
<i>Can you sit with Alma
this time?</i>

62
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,124
Car? What?
Car what?

63
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:32,826
What?

64
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,335
<i>Hello there!</i>

65
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,881
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

66
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:58,417
I have my hands full.

67
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,119
Oh, me too.

68
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,889
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

69
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:05,691
No, I'm a daughter.

70
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,326
Oh, really?

71
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,061
Haven't heard about you.

72
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,497
Are you from England as well?

73
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,798
No, I'm not.

74
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:15,067
Why would you have heard
about me?

75
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,702
I told...

76
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,070
Jesus.

77
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,638
Forgive me, my dear.

78
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,142
Didn't mean to startle you.

79
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,677
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

80
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,161
Dr. Bonomo is the medical

81
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,181
superintendent of
the local hospital

82
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:33,085
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

83
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,320
which I am also funding.

84
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,190
<i>This is Gretchen.</i>

85
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,525
Gretchen.

86
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:41,861
Yeah.

87
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:45,397
Gretchen is from
the United States.

88
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:49,501
It has been decided that she
is moving in with her father.

89
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,706
What a pleasant surprise.

90
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,950
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

91
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,252
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

92
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,755
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

93
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:12,191
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

94
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,095
Hi, mom.

95
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:24,169
I know this is weird, um...

96
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,006
But it's good to hear
your voice.

97
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:35,147
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

98
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:39,718
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

99
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,966
<i>I know it's been tough.</i>

100
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:55,334
<i>But we are very happy
you're here.</i>

101
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:58,704
Excuse me.

102
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,640
Gretchen, my dear.

103
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,943
I, uh...

104
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:08,514
<i>I've been thinking,
for a young woman like you</i>

105
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,161
there's... not so
many things to do

106
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,585
here during the
summer, and so...

107
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,055
I have a little idea.

108
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,127
<i>A proposal. How would you like to
come work for me at the resort?</i>

109
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:23,830
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

110
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,397
<i>Well,
it's an easy job,</i>

111
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,299
<i>and it will give you
something to do</i>

112
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,234
<i>while your parents build
the new resort for me.</i>

113
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,104
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

114
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,039
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

115
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,009
I would pay you an
appropriate salary, of course.

116
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:38,410
<i>- I don't...</i>
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

117
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,051
Oh.

118
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:47,553
Schön.

119
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,187
<i>Wonderful.</i>

120
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,157
<i>Come by the reception tomorrow.</i>

121
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:56,261
<i>Here's your ID badge,
sir.</i>

122
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,131
<i>Would you like to pay
with cash or credit card?</i>

123
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:04,336
Cash, or credit?

124
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:07,339
Cash.

125
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:10,709
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

126
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:14,746
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

127
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,886
Oh, and this is Beatrice

128
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:22,287
and I am Gretchen.

129
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,952
<i>You have to be
polite and friendly,</i>

130
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:34,600
<i>even if the guest is rude.</i>

131
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:37,603
<i>And remember to put up the sign
if you go to the bathroom.</i>

132
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,173
But if you have any real
trouble, just call the boss.

133
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,710
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

134
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,413
He lives in a vacation
bungalow?

135
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,851
No, he has a villa way up there.

136
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:54,386
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

137
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:57,255
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

138
00:13:58,123 --> 00:13:59,758
Weird, right?

139
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:00,960
Super.

140
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,406
This happens
sometimes.

141
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,178
How's your first day, my dear?

142
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,250
Can't complain.

143
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,887
And how is your German
coming along?

144
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,622
Not good.

145
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:33,026
This is okay.

146
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,928
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

147
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,131
over the border, in Italy.

148
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:47,472
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

149
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,610
Oh, I have my bike.

150
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,711
Oh?

151
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,479
No.

152
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,248
No, no, no.

153
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,686
<i>No, it will be too dark
on the country roads by then.</i>

154
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:03,255
<i>This is why you
will not work late.</i>

155
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:06,692
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

156
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,226
What?

157
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,196
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

158
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,167
<i>-You have a car.</i>

159
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:15,802
<i>-I have a life, too.</i>

160
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:20,039
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

161
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,540
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

162
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,209
<i>-No. Every time I raise
an issue with you,</i>

163
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,145
<i>there is something
you have to say about it.</i>

164
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:28,313
<i>- I do everything you ask!
- No.</i>

165
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,916
<i>-What? I work every day
late shifts!</i>

166
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,717
<i>-You're blasting your
Scheisse music on the car radio</i>

167
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:32,985
<i>on your way to work.</i>

168
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,021
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

169
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:36,588
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

170
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:38,057
<i>and you are disturbing
the wildlife</i>

171
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:39,791
<i>with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

172
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:12,024
They can dance on the carpet...

173
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,322
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

174
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:44,382
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

175
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,810
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

176
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,410
Alma?

177
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:16,082
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

178
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,223
<i>What happened
to your face?</i>

179
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:28,995
My father's daughter
scratched me.

180
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,396
Your sister?

181
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,866
- She's not my sister.
<i>- Oh.</i>

182
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,201
Come on now.

183
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:38,503
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

184
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,611
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

185
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,718
<i>It's called vanishing twin
syndrome.</i>

186
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,456
It's when one fetus dies in the
early stages of the pregnancy

187
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,895
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

188
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:05,664
<i>I always thought
it was kind of badass.</i>

189
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,068
But yeah, she's a bitch.

190
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:12,604
Okay.

191
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,910
Another reason to not have kids.

192
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,645
<i>Thanks for finishing my shift.</i>

193
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:23,682
<i>Erik and I haven't been
on a date in ages.</i>

194
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,483
Here's my master key.

195
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,987
There's only one. Don't lose it.

196
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:32,191
And at 10 p.m. sharp you lock
everything up like I showed you.

197
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:34,526
And boss doesn't
need to know.

198
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,162
It's fine.

199
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,096
Okay.

200
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:45,737
Uh-huh.

201
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,739
Can I get a room?

202
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:25,177
May I see your ID or passport?

203
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:26,946
You can't just ask for my name?

204
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,553
Uhm...

205
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,456
Is it just you...

206
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,692
or are you here with a partner?

207
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,728
We have special rates
and amenities

208
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,966
for couples and newlyweds.

209
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,004
For now, just me.

210
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,106
Okay.

211
00:20:58,643 --> 00:20:59,912
I'm Ed.

212
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:04,216
<i>What's your name?</i>

213
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,153
I'm Gretchen.

214
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:11,991
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

215
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:16,962
I won't be here
for long anyways.

216
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:24,669
<i>-You like music?</i>

217
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:29,809
Sure.

218
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:36,248
Then you should come to Paris.

219
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:43,755
Okay.

220
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:05,177
Hey!

221
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:10,916
Is this normal?

222
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,253
It's only my second day.

223
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:15,921
<i>-Better go check on her.</i>

224
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,124
Uh-huh.

225
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:29,701
Resort Alpschatten...

226
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:35,141
<i>Gretchen?</i>

227
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,376
- Yes.
<i>- Where's Beatrix?</i>

228
00:22:37,843 --> 00:22:40,645
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

229
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:43,382
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

230
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:44,782
<i>Gretchen.</i>

231
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:46,852
<i>I want you to lock the doors
and wait for me,</i>

232
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:48,988
<i>I will come pick you up
right now.</i>

233
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,955
Uh...

234
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:53,859
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

235
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,296
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

236
00:22:57,396 --> 00:23:00,599
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

237
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:01,967
<i>Gretchen, listen to me
carefully.</i>

238
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,668
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

239
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,803
<i>Fuck no.</i>

240
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:08,460
<i>Gretchen?</i>

241
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,075
Hello!

242
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,145
Please let me in!

243
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:11,016
Please let me in right now!
Please!

244
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:01,066
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

245
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,404
<i>The woman stood there
until the police arrived.</i>

246
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:07,841
-I was chased.

247
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,541
Fuck!

248
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:12,226
It's really important that your

249
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,780
statement is as
accurate as possible.

250
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:17,468
The receptionist,
she stated that she

251
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,285
did not see any
woman in the parking lot.

252
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:23,789
May I suggest...

253
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:27,426
we change the last part into...

254
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:33,065
"The woman stood there until Mrs.
So-and-so entered the room..."

255
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,767
"Then the police arrived."

256
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,240
That is so much better.

257
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:43,709
I think...

258
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:46,980
you are the victim of a prank.

259
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,016
<i>Everybody
is very nice here, honey.</i>

260
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:53,018
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

261
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:55,287
<i>but this is actually
very common.</i>

262
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:59,791
- Dad.
- Gretchen?

263
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,393
What happened?

264
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:02,461
Did you fall?

265
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:04,396
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

266
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:06,665
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

267
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:08,166
<i>We need to get her checked out.</i>

268
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,102
Dad, I was attacked.

269
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:11,051
By who?

270
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,873
I don't know, the cops
think it was a prank...

271
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,808
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

272
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:18,310
- No, I fell, but...
<i>- Gretchen?</i>

273
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,350
She fell, it's okay.

274
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,088
<i>We are going
to do an MRI...</i>

275
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,773
It might be childhood epilepsy.

276
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,576
Epilepsy?

277
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:51,643
<i>It might be?</i>

278
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:52,946
It means it might be genetic

279
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:54,580
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

280
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,383
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

281
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,020
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

282
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:04,623
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

283
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:07,593
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

284
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:12,297
What's causing the seizures?

285
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:15,835
<i>-There are many possible triggers
for a seizure in a child.</i>

286
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:17,569
<i>Fever. Certain lights.</i>

287
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,940
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

288
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,042
But Alma is too young for that.

289
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,243
<i>Has there been
a stressful event</i>

290
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:27,646
<i>or disruption
in your family lately?</i>

291
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,426
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

292
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,795
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

293
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:46,365
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

294
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:49,134
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

295
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,838
<i>Mom, this place
is completely fucked.</i>

296
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:54,113
<i>Alma keeps
freaking out, and they</i>

297
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,174
<i>say she has
epilepsy or something.</i>

298
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:59,912
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

299
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,382
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

300
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,550
<i>I got the money.</i>

301
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,326
- <i>What happened to you?</i>
- Jesus.

302
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:19,331
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

303
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:29,374
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

304
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:33,278
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

305
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,448
incident last night.

306
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:46,658
Which one?

307
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:49,728
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

308
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,035
I don't wanna talk to you.

309
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:57,569
Excuse me?

310
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,338
Um... excuse me.

311
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,909
There's another guest waiting.

312
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:13,418
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

313
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:17,255
Could you come see me
when you're done?

314
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,791
Fine.

315
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:34,439
I'm checking out.

316
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:36,943
Oh.

317
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,978
Okay.

318
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:51,656
You didn't charge me.

319
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:54,292
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

320
00:32:56,129 --> 00:32:57,462
Um...

321
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,265
No, you don't.

322
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,775
Do you smoke?

323
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:26,725
You coming?

324
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:31,463
Yeah, just give me a minute.

325
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,672
<i>I have a house
back in the States.</i>

326
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,707
<i>I just need to get
to an airport.</i>

327
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:18,543
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

328
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:23,015
<i>We have one of these in Paris.</i>

329
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,962
<i>And then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.</i>

330
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:38,563
I wasn't going in there.

331
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:44,569
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

332
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,850
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

333
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:00,920
<i>I wasn't going in there.</i>

334
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:06,025
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

335
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:19,771
and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

336
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:22,909
I wasn't going in
there.

337
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:31,483
Watch out!

338
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:23,896
<i>Do you smell this?</i>

339
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:27,967
Yes.

340
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:39,677
Or are those molecules binding to
a receptor in your nasal cavity?

341
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,683
Got me.

342
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,167
And are you...

343
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:05,938
right now, in this moment...

344
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:14,180
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

345
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,787
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

346
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:23,956
Hm?

347
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:27,359
<i>If I were you...</i>

348
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:32,298
<i>I would stay home
until my body was done</i>

349
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:35,067
<i>growing back those cells.</i>

350
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:40,072
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

351
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:43,876
<i>As if I was stuck in a loop.</i>

352
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,612
<i>Can you... do this?</i>

353
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:53,651
Good.

354
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:02,027
Apology accepted.

355
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:06,165
Luis.

356
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,447
What are you doing?

357
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:23,115
I'm getting my stuff.

358
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,684
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

359
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,487
I mean, they said we can...

360
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:31,656
-I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

361
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:35,895
<i>Beth has been watching Alma while
I've been here looking after you.</i>

362
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:38,430
I have to go home
and give her a break.

363
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,700
- Please don't leave.
- You'll be fine.

364
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:44,136
There are people here
all the time.

365
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:46,472
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

366
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:48,908
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

367
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,145
What if she comes back?

368
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:54,613
Gretchen, stop it!

369
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:56,282
But why? I'm not making this up!

370
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:59,318
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

371
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:02,421
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

372
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:11,729
I wasn't high.

373
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,599
Oh, you were!

374
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:15,401
You were tested.

375
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,703
You stole money from Herr König

376
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:21,574
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

377
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,509
I can't force you
to do anything.

378
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:25,911
You are almost eighteen
years old.

379
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:27,913
But you don't have a job anymore

380
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:31,217
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

381
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,119
If you wanna run away,

382
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,189
then take your fucking bicycle.

383
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,003
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

384
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,405
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

385
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,941
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

386
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,844
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

387
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,915
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

388
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:05,451
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

389
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:09,188
<i>It's really bad.</i>

390
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,127
<i>I just wanna come home.</i>

391
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,333
Where's Gretchen?

392
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:23,435
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

393
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:25,037
Where's Gretchen?

394
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:27,973
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

395
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:44,223
<i>I told you
to come see me.</i>

396
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,793
<i>I saved your life.</i>

397
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:52,364
I saw the woman.

398
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,836
You saw her?

399
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:02,274
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

400
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:05,544
I need you to help me
find that woman.

401
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:09,014
<i>She's wanted for murder.</i>

402
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:12,051
<i>And I expect her
to come for you again.</i>

403
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:16,255
I can protect you.

404
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,758
If we find her...

405
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:25,831
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

406
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,536
<i>Does Alma
listen to music often?</i>

407
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:33,972
<i>She loves music, especially
since Gretchen moved in with us.</i>

408
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,674
<i>Now...</i>

409
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:38,177
<i>And this is extremely
important.</i>

410
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:42,214
<i>Nobody must know
about this investigation.</i>

411
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,017
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

412
00:42:45,317 --> 00:42:47,186
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

413
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:48,822
in people with Alma's condition.

414
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:53,025
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

415
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,362
It's just music.

416
00:42:56,462 --> 00:42:58,130
<i>You going out?</i>

417
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:20,886
<i>A month ago,
a married couple on vacation</i>

418
00:43:21,153 --> 00:43:22,988
had rented this cabin.

419
00:43:23,322 --> 00:43:25,691
<i>A cabin not far from here.</i>

420
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:28,927
<i>The husband told the police
that in the evening</i>

421
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:31,096
<i>he'd lost consciousness.</i>

422
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:34,700
When he woke up...

423
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:39,938
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

424
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:45,411
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

425
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:50,582
<i>The blonde woman's voice
had a hypnotic effect on the man.</i>

426
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:54,821
<i>He chased the woman into
the woods, but she got away.</i>

427
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,023
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

428
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:02,661
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

429
00:44:06,698 --> 00:44:07,699
Jesus.

430
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:16,942
Dude...

431
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,881
The other night, a half-naked
woman came into the reception,

432
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,083
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

433
00:44:30,824 --> 00:44:33,525
Where was she staying?

434
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:44,670
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

435
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:01,220
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

436
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:15,701
<i>I didn't know stakeouts
were gonna be so boring.</i>

437
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:20,205
When are we gonna see
some action?

438
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:22,174
<i>Almost 11.</i>

439
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:25,577
<i>Be on the lookout and listen
for anything strange.</i>

440
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:04,416
<i>She'll choke.</i>

441
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:09,521
<i>Last time I was too late.</i>

442
00:51:32,879 --> 00:51:34,379
<i>Gretchen?</i>

443
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:38,383
Did we wake you?

444
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:49,862
<i>All the owls
have individual calls</i>

445
00:51:50,096 --> 00:51:53,632
<i>so that they can understand
each other over long distances.</i>

446
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,800
<i>And maybe we
can make a secret call</i>

447
00:51:55,902 --> 00:51:58,871
so that we
can understand each other.

448
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:01,974
Now, I brought you something.

449
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:04,143
I know that you will like this.

450
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:15,087
Gretchen, come sit with us.

451
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:16,322
Gretchen?

452
00:52:16,488 --> 00:52:18,657
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

453
00:52:21,693 --> 00:52:22,560
No.

454
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:25,630
Okay, good. Please join us.

455
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,700
I went out last night.

456
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:31,904
Where did you go?

457
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:33,806
<i>The resort.</i>

458
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,044
What were you doing there?

459
00:52:38,144 --> 00:52:39,879
I was with Trixie.

460
00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:41,746
<i>-Hm.</i>

461
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:45,918
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

462
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:48,220
<i>-She wasn't.</i>

463
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,290
She was really confused.

464
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:52,892
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

465
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:55,261
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

466
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:58,297
Hm. I will look into this.

467
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:01,633
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

468
00:53:02,134 --> 00:53:05,371
<i>Seems like a lot of people
need assistance after ten.</i>

469
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:07,672
It doesn't make sense
economically.

470
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,309
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
<i>- Gretchen!</i>

471
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:11,543
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

472
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:13,245
It's not so interesting, but...

473
00:53:13,346 --> 00:53:14,914
Maybe another time.

474
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:18,583
It's quite the place
you got here.

475
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:20,219
-Gretchen, what's the matter?

476
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:21,954
Why did you bring us here?

477
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,397
Your parents are planning a...

478
00:53:31,496 --> 00:53:32,965
A new resort, I know.

479
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:37,003
Why do we have to live here?

480
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:37,903
<i>Gretchen!</i>

481
00:53:38,636 --> 00:53:39,671
Because it's pretty outside?

482
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:42,008
Calm down, right now.

483
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:03,295
You are here because your family
belongs here.

484
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,902
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

485
00:54:10,136 --> 00:54:12,179
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?

486
00:54:12,191 --> 00:54:12,972
<i>- I don't know dad!</i>

487
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:15,640
I'm just reflecting on this very
fucking weird living situation

488
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,742
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

489
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:18,844
Out!

490
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:20,112
<i>Now!</i>

491
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:23,816
- Great.
<i>- No, no, Luis.</i>

492
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,951
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

493
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:27,820
You need some family time,
I understand.

494
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,788
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

495
00:54:29,889 --> 00:54:31,756
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

496
00:54:31,857 --> 00:54:34,160
and I wish you a good evening.
- I'm very sorry.

497
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,561
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

498
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,065
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

499
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:43,469
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

500
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:45,637
don't be afraid to...

501
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:47,973
talk to me.

502
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:53,012
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

503
00:54:54,612 --> 00:54:56,916
Oh... it was a surprise.

504
00:54:57,016 --> 00:54:59,218
I was not supposed
to say anything.

505
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:00,352
I am so sorry.

506
00:55:00,453 --> 00:55:01,887
What package?

507
00:55:03,255 --> 00:55:06,258
What package?
- It has your family name on it.

508
00:55:19,939 --> 00:55:22,041
It was your mother's stuff.

509
00:55:23,576 --> 00:55:25,643
<i>The small stuff, at least.</i>

510
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:27,779
I received it this morning.

511
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,648
<i>I... your father should perhaps
change the address</i>

512
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,118
<i>on the counter...</i>

513
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,220
What is it doing here, dad?

514
00:55:39,624 --> 00:55:41,127
I sold the old house.

515
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:49,602
It was... still my house.

516
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:52,104
<i>And I put the money
in an account for you.</i>

517
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:58,477
<i>I... I didn't want you
to get worked up again...</i>

518
00:56:07,652 --> 00:56:10,322
<i>Hi, you have reached
the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

519
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:13,092
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia
are here now,</i>

520
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:15,660
<i>but we are dying to hear
what you have to say,</i>

521
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,863
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

522
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:21,267
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

523
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:24,570
<i>It's really bad.</i>

524
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:30,708
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

525
00:56:35,915 --> 00:56:37,383
<i>What do you think?</i>

526
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,657
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

527
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,725
<i>What's your take
on that, mom?</i>

528
00:57:04,877 --> 00:57:07,279
<i>Next message.</i>

529
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:12,784
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,
my name is Alma.</i>

530
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:15,753
<i>I'm calling you
because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

531
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:18,390
<i>Gretchen calls you
when she feels bad,</i>

532
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,292
<i>but you never answer.</i>

533
00:57:20,492 --> 00:57:22,294
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

534
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,263
<i>I'm worried.</i>

535
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,797
<i>If you get my message,</i>

536
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:28,400
<i>I want you to call Gretchen
back on the phone.</i>

537
00:57:28,968 --> 00:57:31,203
<i>You can tell her
that you love her.</i>

538
00:57:31,604 --> 00:57:33,205
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

539
00:57:33,872 --> 00:57:35,608
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

540
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:38,677
<i>If you'd like to,
you can come visit us.</i>

541
00:57:39,144 --> 00:57:41,146
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

542
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,202
Good, you're packed.

543
00:58:04,802 --> 00:58:06,805
Do you even know how to drive?

544
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:09,774
Where is everybody?

545
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:14,947
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

546
00:58:15,114 --> 00:58:18,217
Alma had a very strong seizure.

547
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:22,354
<i>It's your fault, Gretchen.
You know that.</i>

548
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:24,323
<i>You terrified her.</i>

549
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:30,496
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

550
00:58:31,163 --> 00:58:33,732
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

551
00:58:33,832 --> 00:58:35,634
and I'll drive you
to the station.

552
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:37,802
The last train leaves
in one hour.

553
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:56,588
Bring your bike.

554
00:59:26,852 --> 00:59:28,053
You like it?

555
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:30,322
Sure.

556
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:33,492
<i>You know it? A common cuckoo.</i>

557
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:36,495
<i>A magnificent creature.</i>

558
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:39,064
<i>-Common.</i>

559
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:44,536
Ah. But its behavior is not.

560
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:47,673
Its nature is quite remarkable.

561
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:52,945
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

562
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:58,117
<i>Some species need our help
to survive and reproduce.</i>

563
01:00:00,185 --> 01:00:02,654
I'm a preservationist, you know?

564
01:00:22,908 --> 01:00:24,443
<i>Oh, come along now.</i>

565
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:29,214
<i>I want you to understand
who you got involved with.</i>

566
01:00:29,648 --> 01:00:33,719
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

567
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,954
<i>with an illegal firearm.</i>

568
01:00:36,054 --> 01:00:37,824
What are you doing?

569
01:00:37,923 --> 01:00:39,224
He's a cop.

570
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:42,694
No, he's not.

571
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:44,864
Not anymore.

572
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:47,299
<i>You see, Erik here...</i>

573
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:49,468
is actually a policeman.

574
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:53,038
He has access to police files.

575
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:56,942
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

576
01:00:57,042 --> 01:01:00,279
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

577
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:04,450
<i>one that he is personally
involved with.</i>

578
01:01:04,616 --> 01:01:06,620
Okay, Erik. I
think it is time to

579
01:01:06,632 --> 01:01:08,954
take Herr Lando
to the police station.

580
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,256
Gretchen, let's get your money.

581
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:17,496
<i>This way, please.</i>

582
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,098
Come along, now.

583
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:23,629
<i>You are a liability, Gretchen.
I can't let you out.</i>

584
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,099
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

585
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,034
<i>-Just pheromones.</i>

586
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:31,737
<i>I am giving you the chance
to be of great use</i>

587
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:34,039
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

588
01:02:34,506 --> 01:02:37,075
<i>The adolescent
needs to be trained.</i>

589
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:41,814
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

590
01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:53,659
It's a mild sedative.

591
01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:55,060
What?

592
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:57,696
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

593
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:05,137
I'm staying here tonight.

594
01:03:08,206 --> 01:03:12,077
<i>These creatures can't speak
like you or I.</i>

595
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:13,679
<i>But when trained,</i>

596
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:18,051
<i>their song can be dizzyingly
persuasive.</i>

597
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:47,566
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

598
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,672
Something
is not right.

599
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,095
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

600
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:17,629
with those construction plans.

601
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:20,499
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

602
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,037
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

603
01:06:25,872 --> 01:06:27,807
<i>What happened
to Herr Lando's wife</i>

604
01:06:27,907 --> 01:06:29,976
<i>must not repeat itself.</i>

605
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:36,883
<i>I'm very sorry for what happened
to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

606
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:43,488
But this one's mother wandered
off my area of authority.

607
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:47,927
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

608
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:50,328
<i>before we had another offspring</i>

609
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:51,831
ready to replace her.

610
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:55,700
<i>There were family matters
prolonging my endeavor.</i>

611
01:07:00,772 --> 01:07:02,307
Actually...

612
01:07:02,674 --> 01:07:06,311
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

613
01:07:06,411 --> 01:07:10,615
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

614
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:11,683
Wow.

615
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:15,822
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

616
01:07:16,388 --> 01:07:18,991
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

617
01:07:19,357 --> 01:07:25,097
<i>A sacred process that keeps an
ancient creature alive and well.</i>

618
01:07:25,564 --> 01:07:28,567
<i>A magnificent creature
whose approach to family</i>

619
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:31,838
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

620
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:36,441
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

621
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:39,411
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

622
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:42,949
<i>Consider your mishap last night
a dry run.</i>

623
01:07:48,653 --> 01:07:49,788
Erik?

624
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,905
Shh...

625
01:08:13,212 --> 01:08:14,412
Oh.

626
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:18,217
No, no, no, no.

627
01:08:18,516 --> 01:08:20,186
<i>You should be on your side.</i>

628
01:08:20,286 --> 01:08:22,021
<i>You could choke, my dear.</i>

629
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:56,055
<i>Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?</i>

630
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:57,990
I don't feel so good.

631
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,060
Take this.

632
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,456
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

633
01:10:00,485 --> 01:10:03,089
After my mom died,

634
01:10:03,488 --> 01:10:05,992
I accidentally called
our house...

635
01:10:07,592 --> 01:10:10,695
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

636
01:10:13,565 --> 01:10:15,868
It kind of helped,

637
01:10:17,236 --> 01:10:19,071
so I kept calling.

638
01:10:21,907 --> 01:10:24,176
Maybe you can do that too.

639
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:11,991
<i>Do you know what this bird
is famous for?</i>

640
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:20,533
This bird lays its eggs in
the nests of other bird species

641
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:25,570
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

642
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:30,575
No! Not in here!

643
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,876
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

644
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:17,356
How old is your sister?

645
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:24,330
Gretchen?

646
01:12:25,831 --> 01:12:27,600
Yes, I am fine.

647
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,336
<i>We are in the treatment center
by the hospital.</i>

648
01:12:30,503 --> 01:12:31,703
-If you come back
in the morning,

649
01:12:32,138 --> 01:12:34,106
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

650
01:12:34,273 --> 01:12:36,609
<i>Alma is going
to stay here for the evening.</i>

651
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,111
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor
her sleep.</i>

652
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:39,979
<i>Dad?</i>

653
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:41,547
<i>-Beth and I are coming home.</i>

654
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:43,781
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about...

655
01:12:45,783 --> 01:12:47,685
<i>-What is it, Gretchen?</i>

656
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:50,856
We can't trust them.

657
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:53,292
<i>-Gretchen, we can talk
when we're home.</i>

658
01:12:53,392 --> 01:12:56,228
<i>I told you
I will protect you.</i>

659
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:01,400
<i>Get ready.</i>

660
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,402
What's wrong with Beth?

661
01:13:18,884 --> 01:13:22,254
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

662
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:28,294
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

663
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:33,566
<i>Astonishing resemblance
to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

664
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:37,970
<i>The surrogate mother's distress
grows in close proximity</i>

665
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:40,005
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

666
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:44,343
<i>Thus both host parents have
been removed from the premises.</i>

667
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:50,149
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

668
01:13:50,249 --> 01:13:55,221
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

669
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:59,724
<i>Instead of leaving their
offspring in the care of a host,</i>

670
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:04,063
<i>homo-cuculidae returns
to claim their young.</i>

671
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,365
Contact with the biological
mother

672
01:14:06,465 --> 01:14:10,102
speeds up the process of the
offspring's physical development

673
01:14:10,369 --> 01:14:13,806
<i>and its abilities
significantly.</i>

674
01:14:17,243 --> 01:14:22,548
We are about to initiate the
first close-distance encounter

675
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:24,950
with the biological mother.

676
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:46,771
Brood parasites.

677
01:14:49,408 --> 01:14:51,243
<i>They don't impregnate.</i>

678
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,979
They implant eggs.

679
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:59,285
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

680
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:05,424
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

681
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,862
Like your father...

682
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,598
<i>on his honeymoon.</i>

683
01:15:14,867 --> 01:15:16,869
<i>And then what do they do?</i>

684
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,539
Release them into the wild.

685
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:25,311
When the mother shows up...

686
01:15:25,411 --> 01:15:27,546
I end this experiment.

687
01:15:29,415 --> 01:15:31,483
What about my sister?

688
01:15:34,086 --> 01:15:37,189
That is not your sister.

689
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,225
Two.

690
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:42,528
<i>Yeah, the sister
of the young one</i>

691
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:44,863
and a rogue police detective.

692
01:15:45,397 --> 01:15:47,431
<i>Yeah, I am afraid
we must commence</i>

693
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,368
<i>definitive measures immediately.</i>

694
01:15:49,935 --> 01:15:51,203
<i>She's dead.</i>

695
01:15:52,404 --> 01:15:54,440
The feather
I wrote my name with.

696
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:57,943
<i>The plumage
of the apportioners.</i>

697
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:20,599
Yeah.

698
01:16:47,993 --> 01:16:49,328
No! No!

699
01:16:58,303 --> 01:17:00,172
I'm not going to hurt you.

700
01:17:35,641 --> 01:17:37,643
Alma. Alma?

701
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:39,945
Alma, we have to go.

702
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:42,014
We have to go now.

703
01:18:09,575 --> 01:18:11,009
Just stay right here.

704
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:05,130
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

705
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:52,277
Alma?

706
01:27:41,646 --> 01:27:43,182
She's dead!

707
01:27:43,983 --> 01:27:45,518
Mom is dead!

708
01:27:46,085 --> 01:27:50,555
<i>Where's your machine gun,
my dear?</i>

709
01:27:50,823 --> 01:27:52,992
Is it under your cast, huh?

710
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:57,096
Why me?

711
01:27:57,196 --> 01:27:59,965
It's not about you,
you little brat.

712
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:03,436
This is nature.

713
01:28:03,536 --> 01:28:05,905
<i>She is supposed
to be focusing...</i>

714
01:28:06,005 --> 01:28:09,607
<i>on reproduction and breeding.</i>

715
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:16,182
And you are competing for
resources with her offspring.

716
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:18,951
<i>Our process here ensures</i>

717
01:28:19,051 --> 01:28:21,887
<i>that each new generation
we breed</i>

718
01:28:21,987 --> 01:28:24,789
<i>is more powerful than the last.</i>

719
01:28:24,957 --> 01:28:28,327
<i>And my dear,
when I am done with you</i>

720
01:28:28,626 --> 01:28:31,297
<i>and reunite Alma with...</i>

721
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:11,297
Stay away
from her, Alma.

722
01:31:09,722 --> 01:31:10,990
No.

723
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:15,527
S-She... can't.

724
01:31:17,663 --> 01:31:22,835
But she says thank you.

725
01:31:23,768 --> 01:31:25,938
Thank you, Alma.

726
01:31:56,935 --> 01:31:59,004
Thank you, Alma.

727
01:32:06,645 --> 01:32:08,947
I really need your help.

728
01:32:21,694 --> 01:32:23,495
<i>Henry!</i>

729
01:32:23,996 --> 01:32:26,265
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

730
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,170
I stand by it.

731
01:32:31,603 --> 01:32:34,506
<i>-Did you ever tell your wife
you'd protect her?</i>

732
01:32:38,911 --> 01:32:40,346
What?

733
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:46,185
<i>Did you tell her
you'd protect her?</i>

734
01:32:51,323 --> 01:32:52,424
<i>Did you?</i>

735
01:32:56,695 --> 01:32:59,098
Yes!

736
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:01,867
<i>-Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

737
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:28,994
Alma!

738
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:32,297
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

739
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,335
<i>What are you doing?</i>

740
01:33:36,435 --> 01:33:37,703
She's one of them!

741
01:33:37,936 --> 01:33:39,772
<i>Alma!</i>

742
01:33:39,873 --> 01:33:41,173
I don't think so.

743
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:42,341
<i>-Come to me.</i>

744
01:33:43,008 --> 01:33:45,110
She will be.

745
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:47,413
She will become!

746
01:33:48,013 --> 01:33:50,549
- I don't think so.
<i>- Alma!</i>

747
01:33:50,716 --> 01:33:52,918
<i>We need to find out
how many there are.</i>

748
01:33:53,018 --> 01:33:56,355
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

749
01:33:57,055 --> 01:33:59,324
- Stop!
- Let her go.

750
01:33:59,658 --> 01:34:02,862
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

751
01:34:02,961 --> 01:34:04,696
She is not your sister!

752
01:34:04,797 --> 01:34:06,031
They stopped reproducing before.

753
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:08,400
They will go extinct
without preservation.

754
01:34:08,567 --> 01:34:10,102
Oh, they will go extinct.

755
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:12,171
<i>-Hundreds of years of research.</i>

756
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:14,373
<i>This is the will
of the apportioners.</i>

757
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,041
<i>Let her go.</i>

758
01:34:16,575 --> 01:34:18,444
You don't know
what you're doing!
