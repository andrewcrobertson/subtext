1
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,500
And we're on in four, three,

2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,667
two, one.

3
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:03,708
What if I told you that even
the worst neighborhood in America

4
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:05,792
could be made completely safe?

5
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,708
And what if I told you

6
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,042
that this could be accomplished

7
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,250
without risking the life

8
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,583
of one single law enforcement officer?

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,958
How do I know this?

10
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,167
Because it's happening right now

11
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,625
in every country in the world

12
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,000
but this one.

13
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,667
I'm Pat Novak,

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,208
and welcome to <i>The Novak Element.</i>

15
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,833
In tonight's State of the Union segment

16
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,000
we'll be joined by General Curtis Monroe

17
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,643
live from the War Room in the Pentagon.

18
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,792
General Monroe, welcome back.

19
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,083
<i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>

20
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,625
Thank you for this unprecedented access

21
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,417
to your operations.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,167
Could you walk us
through what we're seeing here?

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,583
<i>Well, this is a routine operation.</i>

24
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,875
<i>We found that random patrols</i>

25
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,333
<i>helped the local population</i>

26
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,167
<i>to feel safer and to trust us.</i>

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,333
It's amazing.

28
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,792
And what are these colored dots

29
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,375
that we're seeing here, General?

30
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>These are our assets on the ground.</i>

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,208
<i>In green, we got the ED-209s.</i>

32
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,083
<i>They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.</i>

33
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,125
<i>Purple are the smaller EM-208s.</i>

34
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>They sweep and mop up.</i>

35
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,708
<i>And the red dots,
Pat, that's your film crew.</i>

36
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,208
It is great to see American machines

37
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,458
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

38
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,309
<i>All right, you guys,
this is a standard op, all right?</i>

39
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,792
<i>There's no opposition expected.</i>

40
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>I'm gonna set your markers to code red.</i>

41
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,958
All our drones are gonna
give top priority to your safety.

42
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:38,958
No red assets have ever been lost.

43
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,208
- Okay.
- Okay?

44
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,000
Does that make you feel better?

45
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,417
But, listen,

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,542
<i>keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.</i>

47
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,625
<i>Okay?</i>

48
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,833
<i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>

49
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,792
All right. Let's go.

50
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,000
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

51
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,125
<i>Please exit
your homes with your arms raised</i>

52
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,625
<i>for a noninvasive scanning procedure.</i>

53
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,625
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

54
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>Please exit
your homes with your arms raised</i>

55
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,667
<i>for a noninvasive scanning procedure.</i>

56
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

57
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,250
Scott, get me a shot of this.

58
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,792
<i>Your cooperation is appreciated.</i>

59
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,583
<i>We apologize for any inconvenience.</i>

60
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,542
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

61
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,000
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

62
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,042
Incredible.

63
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,708
Incredible!

64
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,125
Not long ago,

65
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,375
that would have been
American men and women

66
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,000
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

67
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,625
General, you care to comment on this?

68
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,042
<i>Well, Pat, we had Vietnam,</i>

69
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,833
<i>we had Iraq, we had Afghanistan.</i>

70
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>Never again.</i>

71
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:16,292
<i>From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.</i>

72
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,125
<i>We can accomplish our objectives</i>

73
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,542
<i>without any loss to American lives</i>

74
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,667
<i>and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.</i>

75
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,708
And why wouldn't they?

76
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,958
For the first time in their lives

77
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,458
they get to watch their children grow up

78
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,417
in an environment of safety and security.

79
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,208
<i>Kelly! Can you hear me out there?</i>

80
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,125
<i>Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>

81
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:23,292
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

82
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,333
As you can see behind me, they're working

83
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,167
in collaboration with the robots

84
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,292
and obviously their safety is
everyone's top priority.

85
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,083
<i>You'll notice children</i>

86
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,208
<i>in the streets as well.
This is everyday life</i>

87
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,417
<i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>

88
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,875
<i>Oh, great. Here, come here.</i>

89
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,208
<i>Stay put, stay put, stay put.</i>

90
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,852
It's fine. Don't worry. My guys got it.

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh, my God!

92
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,667
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

93
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,292
<i>Kelly?</i>

94
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,375
Kelly! Are you all right? Kelly!

95
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,750
<i>We're okay, Pat.</i>

96
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,268
<i>- Our robots have just repelled...</i>
- Hold on, Kelly.

97
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,375
<i>...some suicide bombers.</i>

98
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,042
I'm sorry, Kelly, but for security reasons

99
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,542
the Pentagon's going
to cut our feed to Tehran.

100
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,000
But, please, be careful.

101
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,792
<i>Yeah. I'll continue to stand by.</i>

102
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,958
Now you see how fundamental

103
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,833
these robots are to our foreign policy.

104
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,958
So then tell me.

105
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,625
Why can't we use

106
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,625
these machines here at home?

107
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:48,000
Why is America so robophobic?

108
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,333
On the one hand, we have Raymond Sellars.

109
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,458
An entrepreneur and true American

110
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,792
whose product just
saved my colleague's life.

111
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,083
And on the other.

112
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,333
Hubert Dreyfus.

113
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,750
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

114
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,125
whose bill prohibits

115
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,375
the use of drones on US soil.

116
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,583
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

117
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:20,000
because they haven't
experienced this technology,

118
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,208
and they fear what they don't understand.

119
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,500
We at <i>The Novak Element</i>
support Mr. Sellars' efforts

120
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,000
to make our country and our viewers safer.

121
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,667
After all,

122
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,875
what's more important

123
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,958
than the safety of the American people?

124
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,417
- Hey, Murphy.
- Hey.

125
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,792
How's Jack?

126
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,667
We don't know yet.

127
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,500
- Murphy.
- Hey.

128
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,833
- How's it going?
- Good.

129
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,417
What the hell are they doing here?

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,417
Six in the morgue. Lewis in the hospital.

131
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,417
This was the mother of all bad ideas.

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,250
We got a lead on
Antoine Vallon, we took it.

133
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,333
What lead?

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,167
Not in front of them.

135
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
- This is bullshit.
- Yeah?

136
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,893
Yeah, you got something to say, Murphy?

137
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,167
Vallon's our case.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,708
Yeah, two years
without no arrest, no nothing?

139
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,125
You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

140
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,625
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

141
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,917
No, it's nothing personal.

142
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,833
Although, I don't like you as a person.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,833
Okay, you two, out.

144
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:52,917
No problem.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,601
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

146
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,105
your partner would still be standing.

147
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,927
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

148
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,042
Okay, Alex.

149
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,500
It's just you and me now.

150
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,543
So me and Jack,
we've been doin' some street buys.

151
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
We get a line on some guns.

152
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,167
<i>We meet up with this low-level G</i>

153
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,417
<i>called Jerry,</i>

154
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,042
<i>who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.</i>

155
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,000
Where the hell
you get a gun like that, Jerry?

156
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,042
I can get you two whole crates full, man.

157
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:24,958
Two crates?

158
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,042
No disrespect, J,

159
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,085
but how a clown like
you get so much product, man?

160
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,559
What's it matter where it comes from?

161
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,167
Why it matters,
we don't want no dirty guns, Jerry.

162
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,042
These guns got bodies on 'em, Jerry?

163
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,434
Yo, look, they're clean, all right?

164
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,698
You gonna buy this shit or not?

165
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,458
Hey, hey, why you acting so nervous, man?

166
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,375
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

167
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,625
What'd you say?

168
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,643
- You think he fishin', D?
- I think he's fishin' on us.

169
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,143
Yo, what the hell are
they talkin' about, man?

170
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,247
Hey, let me see your phone.

171
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,226
- Let me see your phone.
- I'm not showing you my phone, man!

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,583
You recordin' this?

173
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,208
I think you're a goddamn cop!

174
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,601
What the hell are you talkin' about, man?

175
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,792
I'm not showing you my phone!

176
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,958
Hey! Put your gun down!

177
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,333
Put your phones on the table.

178
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,518
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

179
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:00,708
What?

180
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,958
Shut up! Shut up! What'd you say?

181
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,583
Ends up he works for Vallon.

182
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,073
Before the meet,
we ran the serial numbers on the rifles.

183
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,918
The guns were supposed
to be in our evidence room.

184
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,917
<i>Not out on the street.</i>

185
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,958
<i>Intake papers blank. No signatures.</i>

186
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,833
- What do you got?
- Nothin'.

187
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,417
How do you think that happened?

188
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
I'm telling you,
Murphy, this is a mistake.

189
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,667
These guys'll shoot
you just to see if they gun work.

190
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,750
We need backup.

191
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,893
If we call for backup,
word's gonna get around the station.

192
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,667
He's gonna disappear.

193
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,125
It's gonna be all right.

194
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,375
<i>So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,</i>

195
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,875
<i>and he bought it.</i>

196
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,958
What do you two need
with that much product?

197
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,042
You plotting a coup?

198
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,101
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna bust
a single shot in your town.

199
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,083
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

200
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,833
Yeah, I heard you don't like cops.

201
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,833
Hey, boss.

202
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,750
What do you got for me?

203
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:58,958
Really?

204
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,625
<i>We were
just about to close the deal</i>

205
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,958
<i>but someone tipped him off.</i>

206
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,583
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

207
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:05,833
Two minutes.

208
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,417
Make sure you kill 'em both!

209
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,833
I got two handguns, one automatic.

210
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,292
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

211
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,375
You sure about this?

212
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:05,875
You ready?

213
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,250
Move.

214
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,708
Lewis!

215
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,708
Lewis!

216
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,667
Officer down! Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

217
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
This is Detective Alex Murphy

218
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,208
in need of immediate medical assistance.

219
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,833
331 Hamilton Road.

220
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,292
Jack.

221
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,833
Jack, come on. Jack. Can you hear me?

222
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,500
Jack. Stay with me.

223
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,500
Jack.

224
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,250
<i>Alex,
you don't do something like this</i>

225
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,833
unless you bring it to me first.

226
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,083
Vallon's connected.

227
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,167
I'm warning you,

228
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,083
don't make any more moves
until I vet this.

229
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,809
If officers are supplying him with guns...

230
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,500
That's up to IAD.

231
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I'll handle it.

232
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,792
I don't care how sophisticated

233
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,458
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

234
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,958
A machine does not know

235
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,083
what it feels like to be human.

236
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,625
It can't understand
the value of human life.

237
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,188
Why should it be allowed to take one?

238
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,667
To legislate over life and death,

239
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,958
we need people who understand

240
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,750
right from wrong.

241
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,750
- What do your machines feel?
- Well, they feel no anger.

242
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,583
They feel no prejudice.

243
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,583
They feel no fatigue,

244
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,083
which makes them
ideal for law enforcement.

245
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,542
Putting these machines on the streets

246
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,917
will save countless American lives.

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,875
- You're evading the question.
- No, I'm not.

248
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,101
Yes,
you're evading the question.

249
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,583
I asked what do these machines feel?

250
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,167
If one of them killed a child...

251
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,583
what would it feel?

252
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,625
- Nothing.
- And that's the problem.

253
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,667
That's why 72% of Americans

254
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,875
will not stand for
a robot pulling the trigger.

255
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,333
America is the world's

256
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:51,083
most valuable market,
and we can't touch it.

257
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,042
With a domestic expansion,

258
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,625
we'd clear 600 billion dollars per annum.

259
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,875
In other words, every second

260
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,667
that law is in existence,
we are hemorrhaging money.

261
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,833
What do you want me to do?

262
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,167
We've thrown cash at senators
at both sides of the aisle.

263
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,333
Nobody's budging.

264
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,417
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

265
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,542
So unless we sway public opinion,
the battle's lost.

266
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,542
Now, to that effect,

267
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,250
my team have come up with

268
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,083
a pretty aggressive new campaign.

269
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,875
Wow factor off-the-charts.

270
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,918
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

271
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,625
A figure they can rally behind.

272
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,542
Sir, I have dissected this bill.

273
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,083
There are no loopholes.

274
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,601
We can't put a machine on the streets.

275
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,667
Forget machines.

276
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,792
You saw the polls.

277
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,833
Americans don't want a machine.

278
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,958
They want

279
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,458
a product with a conscience.

280
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
They want...

281
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,250
something that knows...

282
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,833
what it feels like...

283
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:51,917
to be human.

284
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,833
We're gonna put a man inside a machine.

285
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,125
You're not you

286
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,917
because of your legs,
your arms, your hands.

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,583
You're you because of your brain.

288
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,833
It's your brain's capacity

289
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,208
to process information
that makes you who you are.

290
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,458
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

291
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,667
I've never played with these.

292
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,042
The music doesn't come

293
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,000
from your fingers, Michael,
it comes from your mind.

294
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,833
All you have to do is let it out.

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Please.

296
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,208
Oh, my God.

297
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,208
No, it's okay. Easy.

298
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,125
His emotions are peaking.

299
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,476
The readings are getting clouded.

300
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,958
It's okay.

301
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,542
Relax. If you get too emotional,

302
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,583
it'll change the chemistry in your brain.

303
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,833
It'll throw the system out.

304
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,583
You're doing great. Come on.

305
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,958
I need emotion to play.

306
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,833
<i>Concierto de Aranjuez,</i>
second movement.

307
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,208
Beautiful piece.

308
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,417
Dennett, when you have
a moment. Thank you.

309
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,542
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

310
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,417
I-I wouldn't be asked

311
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,375
to develop combat applications.

312
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,875
My-my work here

313
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,667
is driven by its own questions.

314
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,000
And your work is brilliant.

315
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,208
But your ideas are being underutilized.

316
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,250
Look, I think I found a way

317
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,583
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

318
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:21,083
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

319
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,750
You're not keeping up your end,

320
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,375
leaving me exposed like that.

321
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,333
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

322
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,559
So put him on the payroll.
Why are we talkin' about this?

323
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,463
It won't work.
And now that his partner got hit,

324
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,375
he's never gonna let it go.

325
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,417
- What is that?
- Lewis' hospital.

326
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,208
Alex is dropping by this afternoon,

327
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:50,612
in case you want to send flowers.

328
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Yeah.

329
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,875
I kill a cop,

330
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,042
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

331
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,875
That's not good for business.

332
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,758
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

333
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,125
I'm gonna go hard after Lake and Daniels.

334
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,998
I'm gonna have 'em in
bracelets within a month, man.

335
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,647
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

336
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,875
Cameras off?

337
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,625
Clear.

338
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,083
<i>You were right.
We should've had backup.</i>

339
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,667
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

340
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,150
You're not really sleeping, are ya?

341
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,250
Asshole.

342
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:48,042
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

343
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,917
He has let himself go
a little since the accident.

344
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,250
Pass.

345
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,792
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

346
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,958
Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.

347
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:02,500
"Severe Cerebellar..."

348
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,292
Cerebellar ataxia.

349
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,292
That's why you're the doctor, Doctor.

350
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,167
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

351
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,010
Let's keep this one in mind.
I like this guy.

352
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,625
Very good, sir. I saved the best for last.

353
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,583
I give you Sergeant Jack Freeman,

354
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,167
masculinity incarnate.

355
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,792
Led Pittsburgh SWAT for five years,

356
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,083
now confined to a wheelchair.

357
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,500
I...

358
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,792
think I can see the appeal.

359
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,875
No.

360
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,833
What? Why?

361
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,708
Well, check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

362
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,667
He's trying to say that he has a temper.

363
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,458
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

364
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,000
The psychological strain

365
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,750
requires someone emotionally balanced.

366
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,250
We have to be scientific.

367
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

368
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,542
He's right. Okay. Keep looking.

369
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,500
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.

370
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,958
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Dad.

371
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,750
- Hey.
- Hey, little monkey.

372
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,208
How's the game, buddy?

373
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,542
Damon got ejected,

374
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,250
but we got a two-man advantage.

375
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,042
Oh, yeah? That's fantastic.

376
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,958
Hey, D, why don't you head upstairs

377
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,750
and start getting ready for bed.

378
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,208
But he just got home.

379
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,542
I'll be up in a second.

380
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,958
Tuck you in, okay? All right?

381
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,809
- Now give your mom a kiss.
- Good night, baby.

382
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,833
Too slow, boy.

383
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,208
You're just too slow.

384
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,208
How's Jack holding up?

385
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,012
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

386
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:47,292
It's my fault.

387
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,735
We shouldn't even have been there.

388
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:52,958
Here.

389
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,875
Oh, shit, I thought I fixed that.

390
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,458
It'll stop.

391
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,500
It's gonna wake up David.

392
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,833
<i>He suffered</i>

393
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:56,167
<i>fourth-degree burns
over 80 percent of his body.</i>

394
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,583
<i>Lower spine has been severed.</i>

395
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,375
<i>If he survives...</i>

396
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,958
he'll be paralyzed

397
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:06,083
from the waist down
and confined to a wheelchair.

398
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,833
Mrs. Murphy...

399
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,750
we don't have to do this.

400
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,250
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

401
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,042
Please continue.

402
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,542
Vestibulocochlear,

403
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:30,417
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

404
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,375
He'll be blind in one eye.

405
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,500
Most likely deaf.

406
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,083
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

407
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,833
are the leaders in this field.

408
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:44,583
In my opinion, this is
the only chance your husband has.

409
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,500
I'd seriously consider their offer.

410
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,833
I'm sorry, Doctor.

411
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,125
I need time to think.

412
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,625
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy,

413
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,625
time is one thing you don't have.

414
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,542
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

415
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,917
What kind of life will he have?

416
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,750
- Thanks.
- Thanks, buddy.

417
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,625
You know she's gonna make me dance again.

418
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,458
Now that I've gotta see.

419
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,622
You don't want to see that.

420
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:35,708
Here she comes now.

421
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,458
Hold on to that.

422
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:38,750
Get out there, partner.

423
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,833
Every time.

424
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,125
Get her, boy.

425
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,333
Subject is still dreaming.

426
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,458
He's retrieving memories,

427
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,250
trying to make sense of
sensorial stimulation package 37.

428
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,833
Perfect, Kim.

429
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,292
Let's reconnect the spine.

430
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,958
Time to wake him up.

431
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,875
Excuse me?

432
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,125
What are you doing here?

433
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:53,875
Baby, where you going?

434
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:58,792
Lewis.

435
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,542
Subject regaining cognitive functions.

436
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,667
What's happening?

437
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Where am I?

438
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,333
You were in an explosion, Alex.

439
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,750
You're in a hospital.

440
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,208
Where's...

441
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,125
Where's Ciara? My wife. Where's my wife?

442
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,458
I want you to calm down,
Alex. Listen to me.

443
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,417
You're okay. And your family's fine.

444
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,833
Both your wife and your son.

445
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,583
Who the hell are you?

446
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,292
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton. I'm treating you.

447
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:42,042
Heart rate rising.

448
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,250
I can't move.

449
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,792
I can't move. What the hell is all that?

450
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,167
Visual input unstable.

451
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,792
I want you to relax, Alex.

452
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,184
Subject's dumping too much epinephrine.

453
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,448
- Should we purge it?
- Not yet.

454
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,667
Unlock vertebrae.

455
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,000
Go ahead, Kim.

456
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,833
Unlock upper, lower extremities.

457
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:24,917
What kind of suit is this?

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,333
It's not a suit, Alex. It's...

459
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,792
It's you.

460
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,667
This was the only option.

461
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,333
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

462
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,833
Full body unlock.

463
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,958
I want you to walk now, Alex.

464
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,625
You can do that.

465
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:10,375
This seems so real.

466
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,625
Alex, it's very important

467
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,333
you understand what is happening.

468
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,792
This is real.

469
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:22,167
It's not a dream,
it's not drugs or anesthetics.

470
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,083
I know I'm dreaming
'cause I can feel all of this.

471
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:28,125
Alex, amputees can often
feel their missing appendages.

472
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,518
It's called phantom limb sensation.

473
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,292
What do you mean "amputees"?

474
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,309
- What the hell did you do to me?
- You need to relax.

475
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,750
Take this off me now.

476
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,542
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

477
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,750
What have you done to me?

478
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,625
Alex? Hey!

479
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,250
Shut him down.

480
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,542
No! Let him run! Let him run!

481
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:08,542
Where am I?

482
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,583
<i>Alex, please.</i>

483
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,458
<i>Stop.</i>

484
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,042
<i>Alex, you have to stop.</i>

485
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,708
<i>Please.</i>

486
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,083
<i>Alex.</i>

487
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:47,833
Please stop.

488
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,292
Stay where you are

489
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,667
and we'll come and pick you up.

490
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,833
Okay, Kim.

491
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,667
Shut him down.

492
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Alex...

493
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:00,375
you can't run from this.

494
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,417
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

495
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,292
Show me.

496
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,792
Kim.

497
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,375
Oh!

498
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:35,792
No.

499
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,958
Holy Christ.

500
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,792
Holy Christ.

501
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,833
Holy Christ, there's nothing left.

502
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,917
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

503
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,417
That's not even my brain.

504
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,792
We had to repair the damaged areas.

505
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,292
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

506
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,042
Do you understand me, Alex?

507
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,833
You're... You're in control.

508
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,833
- I'm in control?
- Yes.

509
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:25,875
Okay.

510
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:30,583
If I'm in control...

511
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,292
then I wanna die.

512
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,167
Just unplug whatever it is

513
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,375
keepin' me alive and end this nightmare.

514
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,667
Now, say I did that,

515
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,583
which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

516
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,083
but say I did.

517
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,250
What do I say to your wife?

518
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,208
What does she say to your son?

519
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:57,833
That it didn't work. That you tried.

520
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,208
Somethin' went wrong.

521
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,083
You did everything you could...

522
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,833
but I died.

523
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,000
So after all they've been through,

524
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:14,542
all the pain, all their hope restored,

525
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,958
we would just rip that away?

526
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,125
Your wife loves you, Alex.

527
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,708
She signed the consent forms herself.

528
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:25,375
Otherwise, you couldn't
have undergone the procedure.

529
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,042
She loves you

530
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,167
and she gave you a second chance.

531
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,875
I need you to take it.

532
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,833
I don't wanna see myself like this again.

533
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,000
Ever.

534
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,833
And the same goes for my family.

535
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,167
Just put me back in.

536
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,292
Zoom in.

537
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:15,708
Stop.

538
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:19,792
Zoom in.

539
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:23,417
Stop.

540
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,875
Accept the connection.

541
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:38,167
<i>It's so good to finally see you.</i>

542
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,875
I was gonna say the same thing.

543
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,792
I'm sorry.

544
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:45,833
I know how I must look to you.

545
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,542
<i>I think you look beautiful.</i>

546
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,125
<i>Are they treating you okay, baby?</i>

547
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:58,833
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

548
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,282
Does David know you're calling?

549
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:07,458
<i>He misses you.</i>

550
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,167
<i>- I can go get him.</i>
- No.

551
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,772
I don't want him to see me like this.

552
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,375
Not yet.

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
<i>Sure.</i>

554
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,708
<i>We're gonna get through this, baby.</i>

555
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,833
<i>We're gonna make it like it was.</i>

556
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,792
<i>When are you comin' home?</i>

557
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,275
Well, they've still got some tests.

558
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,833
But they're sayin' it's goin' really well.

559
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,208
The minute they let me.

560
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I gotta go.

561
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,042
I love you.

562
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,125
End the connection.

563
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:13,625
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

564
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,833
Viral and bacterial screening activated.

565
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:25,125
Releasing proteins, fats,

566
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,833
minerals and carbs.

567
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:34,917
Energy inflow is at 1320 kilocalories.

568
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,000
Now starting

569
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:41,000
anti-inflammatory corticoids, hormones

570
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:43,667
and antibiotic protocols.

571
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,083
Standard daily intake.

572
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,708
Release antidepressants.

573
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,958
Let's give him a nice dream.

574
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,638
All right,
here's what you're dealin' with.

575
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,208
Modified M2 battle rifle.

576
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,833
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

577
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,375
Three-shot bursts or full auto.

578
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:16,833
Heavy-duty.

579
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,583
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven taser pistol.

580
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,292
Each projectile
releases up to 200,000 volts.

581
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,208
It can stun,
it can kill and it's nasty shit.

582
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,042
Your armor,

583
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,476
state-of-the-art, but not invulnerable.

584
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,042
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and kill.

585
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,250
Multiple hits,

586
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,250
and guess who ends
up in the recycling bin?

587
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,375
If you sense you need
a weapon or are threatened

588
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,605
the visor goes down and the system
makes the weapons available.

589
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,292
But you gotta remember,

590
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,655
it's not the weapons that count.

591
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,417
It's who's handling them.

592
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,250
Or, in your case, what.

593
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,708
- You think you can do this?
- Oh, just stick to your job.

594
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,125
Just stick to my job?

595
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,500
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

596
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,125
Rio, Congo,

597
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,042
you name it, I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.

598
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,958
You ask me, stickin' organics
into the system

599
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,792
is a huge step backwards.

600
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,508
I don't care how well
you designed this thing.

601
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,875
Without my sign-off,

602
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,018
it better start learnin' Chinese,

603
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,362
'cause it ain't never goin' home.

604
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:22,667
It's nice to meet you, too.

605
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,417
Let's do this,

606
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:27,292
Tin Man.

607
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:38,042
Quality control, EM-208 versus Tin Man.

608
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,833
Rendering scenario one now.

609
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,101
Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

610
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,725
I like a little music while I'm workin'.

611
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:49,958
All right.

612
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:52,583
All right, let's let the games begin.

613
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:53,667
Let's rock 'n' roll.

614
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,042
Commence scenario.

615
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,708
Laggin' on the corners.

616
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,417
No, there, do you see that?

617
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,100
What my robot did, that's how you do it.

618
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,750
New product's afraid.

619
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,167
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

620
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,917
<i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>

621
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

622
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,375
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

623
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,292
<i>Drop the weapon. Let the kid go!</i>

624
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,458
Oh, well, it's worried
that the kid's gonna get hurt.

625
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,833
<i>- Let the kid go!</i>
- Too bad.

626
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,875
Well, there you have it.

627
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,667
5.6 seconds behind. Scenario failure.

628
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,125
I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.

629
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,167
- Let's do it again.
- Your funeral.

630
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,417
Detective Alex Murphy.

631
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,708
<i>Search results.</i>

632
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,792
<i>"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."</i>

633
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:25,417
<i>"Alex Murphy. Man or Machine?"</i>

634
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,417
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight,
Ciara Murphy won't talk."</i>

635
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,292
Antoine Vallon.

636
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,292
<i>Search results.</i>

637
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,167
<i>"DPD says Antoine Vallon</i>

638
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,500
<i>no longer suspect
due to lack of evidence."</i>

639
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,542
<i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

640
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,458
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

641
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,333
<i>Murphy's investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>

642
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:46,958
<i>wasn't authorized in the first place.</i>

643
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:50,667
<i>Look, Detective Murphy
was simply overzealous, okay?</i>

644
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,083
<i>We have absolutely no evidence</i>

645
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,000
<i>linking Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>

646
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,167
<i>All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.</i>

647
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,458
<i>And I won't rest until the men</i>

648
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,302
<i>who tried to kill him
are brought to justice.</i>

649
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:04,750
What's wrong with him?

650
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,042
No, nothing, nothing.

651
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,833
Watch the procedural bars on the 208.

652
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,458
The machine assesses the threat and acts.

653
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,083
- All right.
- That's it.

654
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,083
It's two steps. Now watch Alex.

655
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,500
The software assesses the threat,

656
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,458
just like the robot.

657
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,042
And it sends the information to the brain.

658
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,917
Alex's brain receives the information

659
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,101
and decides what to do with
it based on his emotional...

660
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:31,875
Right.

661
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,042
...cognitive abilities like any man would.

662
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:39,042
Then the brain relates this
to the AI module and, uh...

663
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,750
Yeah, like, you know, a year later.

664
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,167
And our computers finish the job.

665
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,083
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

666
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,458
And that's what you've got.

667
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,583
But the human element
will always be present.

668
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:53,500
Fear, instinct, bias, compassion,
they will always interfere with

669
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,292
- the system!
- Okay, but, Dennett...

670
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,917
I've gotta give...

671
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,880
the American people
something they can root for.

672
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,708
Something aspirational, right?

673
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,143
They have to believe in this thing.

674
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:05,458
"Pretty good"? That's not...
I don't know how to sell "okay."

675
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,667
We, you and I, have got a release date,

676
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,059
and we've gotta make it, okay?
So I don't care how you do it.

677
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,518
I'm askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

678
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,833
Just get him to do that.

679
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,667
- Get him to do that.
- That is a machine.

680
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,184
I know, but it's a man inside a machine.

681
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,625
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

682
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,292
And his life depends on it.

683
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,893
And the future of OmniCorp depends on it

684
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:26,750
so get your ass back
to China and get it fixed.

685
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,625
I don't care how you do it, just go do it!

686
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:47,042
It tastes like peanut butter.

687
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,917
I can't get it out of my mouth.

688
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,042
And
you don't like peanut butter?

689
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,250
No.

690
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,708
You like peanut butter, Kim?

691
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,083
I love it.

692
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:03,917
Okay.

693
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm gonna put you to sleep now, Alex.

694
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,083
Okay.

695
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,875
Now, put him under, Kim.

696
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,000
What are you planning to do?

697
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:23,583
Consciousness is nothing more

698
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,792
than the processing of information.

699
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,042
I'm gonna fix him.

700
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,625
And he won't know the difference.

701
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,292
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

702
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,417
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

703
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:53,792
We call this Combat Mode.

704
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,375
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

705
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:57,750
Yeah, that's okay.

706
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:58,833
And get a load of this.

707
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,917
- What's that?
- He transforms. Kids love it.

708
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,958
- Really?
- Focus group numbers through the roof.

709
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,583
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

710
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,750
Well, that's really embarrassing.

711
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,875
What is this? You know what?

712
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,792
People really don't know what they want

713
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,833
until you show it to 'em most of the time.

714
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:18,958
Make him more, uh...

715
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,125
tactical.

716
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,583
Make him look, uh...

717
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,125
Let's go with black.

718
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:28,875
Yeah.

719
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,417
Alex.

720
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
He looks like a billion dollars.

721
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,083
2.6 billion.

722
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,042
Raymond Sellars.

723
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,250
I've looked forward
to meeting you, Detective.

724
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,268
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

725
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,583
Well, we funded this program

726
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,458
to give men like you a second chance.

727
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:22,833
You just do your best today.

728
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,292
- Shall we?
- Let's.

729
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,583
- Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.
- Okay, great.

730
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,375
Chief Technician Shuman.

731
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,458
Morning, folks.

732
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,875
<i>Okay,
so this is how it's gonna be.</i>

733
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,958
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

734
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,708
<i>I hit you, you go
back to the drawing board.</i>

735
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:46,750
<i>You hit me, you get a ticket back home.</i>

736
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,792
My guys are gonna be shootin'
.47 caliber rounds.

737
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,208
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

738
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,667
But make no mistake, Tin Man,

739
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,167
my gun will.

740
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,083
Alex, listen to me.

741
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,833
<i>The EM-208s will try to maneuver you</i>

742
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,917
<i>so Mattox can get a clear shot.</i>

743
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,167
<i>Do not let that happen.</i>

744
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:21,875
<i>If Mattox hits you,</i>

745
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>everything but your life support
will shut down.</i>

746
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,458
<i>You'll feel more pain</i>

747
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:27,542
<i>than you've ever felt in your life.</i>

748
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,042
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.

749
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,250
All right.

750
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,708
I say we go on three.

751
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,250
Three.

752
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:04,458
How's it going down there?

753
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,833
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

754
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:14,833
Wow.

755
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:50,167
Dr. Norton,
how, how is he doing this?

756
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,958
His software is faster.

757
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:53,750
His hardware is stronger.

758
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,083
<i>He's a better machine.</i>

759
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,208
<i>But you said humans hesitate.</i>

760
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,583
Only when they're making decisions.

761
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,333
He's not making decisions?

762
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,333
Yes and no.

763
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,917
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

764
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,458
Alex makes his own decisions.

765
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,167
<i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>

766
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:17,792
<i>the visor comes down
and the software takes over.</i>

767
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,833
<i>Then the machine does everything.</i>

768
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:23,125
Alex is, he's a passenger,
just along for the ride.

769
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,059
<i>But if the machine is in control,</i>

770
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,542
<i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>

771
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:30,667
Who's pulling the trigger?

772
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,042
Well, when the machine fights,

773
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,708
the system releases
signals into Alex's brain

774
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:35,917
making him think he's doing

775
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,542
what our computers are actually doing.

776
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:40,208
I mean, Alex believes
right now he is in control.

777
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,333
But he's not.

778
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,833
It's the illusion of free will.

779
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:54,708
Crap!

780
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,458
So you've circumvented the law

781
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,018
by creating a machine
that thinks it's a man.

782
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,167
But that's illegal.

783
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,833
No. No, no, no.

784
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,417
It's a machine
that thinks it's Alex Murphy.

785
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,583
And in my book...

786
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
that's legal.

787
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,042
Well done.

788
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:35,833
Well done.

789
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:41,917
Hey, Doctor, what happens
if I tase an exoskeleton

790
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,792
with a little asshole inside?

791
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:48,500
I, uh, I think we're
all curious to find out.

792
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,583
Go ahead.

793
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:28,833
If I had a pulse, it'd be racing.

794
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,542
She's been waiting four months.

795
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,833
I'm sure hers is, too.

796
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:37,875
You're gonna do fine.

797
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,667
I love your sign, D.

798
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,250
Hey.

799
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,542
There's nothin' to be nervous about.

800
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,500
Thank you, Dennett.

801
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:08,708
It's been a privilege.

802
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,333
Hi, Dad.

803
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,077
You know I missed you, buddy.

804
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,667
Me, too.

805
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,208
Wanna feel it?

806
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,375
What is it?

807
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:07,917
It's okay, sweetie.

808
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,750
I saved all the Red Wings games
on my computer.

809
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,708
You did?

810
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,042
- How'd they do?
- I don't know.

811
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,958
I've been waiting to watch them with you.

812
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,375
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

813
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,750
But I can't tonight.

814
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,833
You know, 'cause
Daddy's suit needs some...

815
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,667
Some special handling.

816
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,792
Do you understand?

817
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,667
Thanks for coming, Jack.

818
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,583
I heard you went home already.

819
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:23,434
I know Ciara must be
thrilled to have you back.

820
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,458
I saw Ciara...

821
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:26,792
and David.

822
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,000
That ain't my home right now.

823
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:35,333
It's in a damn lab across the hall.

824
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,083
I'm sorry, Alex.

825
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:38,875
Startin' tomorrow,

826
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,083
I'm gonna take down
Vallon and his whole damn crew.

827
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,208
I was waitin' to hear you say that.

828
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,375
Least I know you're the right color now.

829
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,625
<i>Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today</i>

830
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,375
<i>certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.</i>

831
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:29,833
<i>We're expecting people
from every corner of the city</i>

832
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:30,917
<i>here in Detroit</i>

833
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,792
<i>to come out and show their support</i>

834
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,208
<i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>

835
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:35,708
<i>You know, a lot of questions</i>

836
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:38,000
<i>on people's minds today
is what will he look like.</i>

837
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:39,667
<i>Is he a changed man?</i>

838
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,833
<i>Rumor has it he is in the building</i>

839
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,375
<i>preparing to come out...</i>

840
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,375
<i>Alex, we're gonna upload</i>

841
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:49,875
<i>the entire DPD database into your brain.</i>

842
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:51,250
<i>That means you'll have</i>

843
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,250
<i>instantaneous access to criminal records</i>

844
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,708
<i>plus an archive of CCTV footage</i>

845
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,458
<i>from 2011 to the present.</i>

846
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,542
All right.

847
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,542
Hit me.

848
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,458
Okay. Kim, it's all yours.

849
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,958
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

850
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:11,792
Your system draws
connections automatically.

851
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:13,708
It will link perpetrators to their crimes

852
00:58:13,792 --> 00:58:15,583
and give you their exact locations

853
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:16,917
whenever available.

854
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:21,042
I got evidence to make 138... No, no.

855
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,792
166 arrests.

856
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,708
His emotions are stable.

857
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,875
This is incredible.

858
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,458
<i>You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.</i>

859
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,667
<i>The mayor is standing on stage behind me.</i>

860
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,000
<i>Also, Raymond Sellars from OmniCorp.</i>

861
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,375
<i>They seem like great friends
obviously echoing</i>

862
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,258
<i>the partnership that they've
brought together.</i>

863
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,875
How much longer will this take?

864
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,958
Well, the feed
from the database is almost done, so.

865
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,542
We're approaching present day.

866
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,292
634 pending arrests.

867
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,833
We're gonna need a bigger prison.

868
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,375
He's on top of her.

869
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,167
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

870
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,833
- I gotta do something!
- Alex.

871
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,667
Alex, calm down.

872
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,667
Take a breath.

873
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,833
Relax.

874
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:09,250
Kim, what are the readings?

875
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,208
I haven't seen him at levels like this.

876
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:12,625
- He's gonna shoot 'em!
- Alex!

877
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,667
Alex, Alex, relax.

878
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:16,708
Relax.

879
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:18,750
Alex?

880
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,667
- What is this?
- This just a computer glitch?

881
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,458
No. That's his own crime scene.

882
00:59:23,917 --> 00:59:25,625
- Alex!
- He's spiking all over the place.

883
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,708
Alex!

884
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,375
- Alex?
- The system is crashing, Doctor.

885
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,583
Alex, can you hear me?

886
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,250
Alex! Alex!

887
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,351
- I'm not sure he can handle this.
- I gotta do something!

888
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,750
He's emotionally overloaded.

889
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:36,750
Unlock me!

890
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,625
Alex! Stop!

891
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,208
Stop! He's having a seizure!

892
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,500
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

893
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,042
Get me a live feed!

894
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:44,875
I can't do it.

895
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,351
- Dr. Norton's with the patient.
- Do it now!

896
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,625
Jesus Christ!

897
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,375
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

898
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:50,518
- What?
- The press is waiting!

899
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:51,833
We have to get him up there now!

900
00:59:51,917 --> 00:59:53,167
What do you want me to do?

901
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,875
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

902
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,250
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

903
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:01,833
We're running out of time.

904
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:04,708
Okay.

905
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:06,917
Everybody out!

906
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:09,875
Out!

907
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:11,708
<i>Mayor Durant is about to take to the stage</i>

908
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:12,875
<i>and introduce Detroit's</i>

909
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,500
newest weapon in the war on crime.

910
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,125
I'm actually getting word
that he's ready to go right now.

911
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:24,083
Heart rate rising.

912
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,417
He might start spiking, Doctor.

913
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,042
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

914
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,434
But you'll be taking away his emotions.

915
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,417
Drop the levels until I tell you to stop.

916
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,667
Doctor, you'll be taking away

917
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,550
- his ability to feel anything.
- Now, please!

918
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,417
Pull the footage. Put it on a loop.

919
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,667
- Dopamine level's at 20 percent.
- More.

920
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,625
- Dopamine level's at 10 percent.
- More.

921
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,708
- Dopamine level's at five percent.
- Lower.

922
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,232
- You're flattening him out.
- Lower!

923
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:01,833
- Two percent.
- Hold it there.

924
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
Alex?

925
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,417
Alex, how do you feel?

926
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:19,417
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

927
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:25,667
Well, today I'm not here
to talk about crime prevention.

928
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:29,500
I am here to give you the cure.

929
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,917
That's right!

930
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,750
Hi, Dad!

931
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,333
Dad?

932
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

933
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,000
the revolution begins right now

934
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:56,167
with Detective Alex Murphy!

935
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,208
Detective.

936
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,958
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

937
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:34,250
I think he's accessing criminal data.

938
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:43,333
Thomas King! You are under arrest!

939
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:04,875
Until today, Thomas King was
a convicted felon

940
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:08,125
wanted for rape, arson, and murder.

941
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:12,167
This man has torn apart American families.

942
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,833
On the loose for six years.

943
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:22,083
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

944
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,375
Right in front of the police headquarters.

945
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:34,917
Here he is, just steps
away from two of Detroit's finest.

946
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:39,667
These two officers are completely unaware

947
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,417
of the monster in their midst.

948
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:47,667
And then, in 60 seconds...

949
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,417
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

950
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:55,042
Detective Murphy brings him down.

951
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,542
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,</i>

952
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,917
<i>one will be provided for you.</i>

953
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,250
This, my friends,

954
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:05,833
is the future of American justice.

955
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:09,125
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

956
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:12,333
now that RoboCop is here?

957
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,375
Yes,

958
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:18,292
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

959
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,833
Men weren't up to the task.

960
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:24,708
But Alex Murphy,

961
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,333
<i>a robot cop,</i>

962
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:28,292
<i>was.</i>

963
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,934
We can't take him off the street.

964
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,625
This is what I'm saying. He's a hit.

965
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,375
A big, fat, stinking hit.

966
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,625
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

967
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:38,333
Hey, we all knew there would be issues.

968
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,208
It's inevitable.

969
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:42,768
Dennett, you're my guy.
I just need you to get a handle on this.

970
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:43,952
I know, but I need more time.

971
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,583
Scientifically, we're in uncharted water.

972
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,917
We need to take him back
to the lab and do more tests.

973
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,542
I mean, it was like something

974
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,083
was interfering with our system.

975
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,958
Something beyond chemistry or physics.

976
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:56,917
Like what? His soul?

977
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,375
Hey, look, this train
has already left the station.

978
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,833
I can't exactly go
out to the world and say,

979
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:04,417
"Sorry, I released a defective product."

980
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,875
So, no matter what we do,

981
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,558
we just need to keep him on the streets.

982
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,083
What about the interviews?

983
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,958
Cancel 'em. Cancel all of 'em.

984
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,875
Everything.

985
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,083
In fact, Dennett.

986
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,125
Let's, uh...

987
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:20,292
<i>Let's keep the wife
at a distance for now, as well.</i>

988
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:23,125
<i>I'd like to see him.</i>

989
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:25,625
Can you arrange that?

990
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:26,917
Look, I won't lie to you.

991
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,583
Alex was so nervous, we had to sedate him.

992
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:34,458
I looked in his eyes
and I couldn't see my husband.

993
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,625
And then he just shoots a man
in front of our son.

994
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:37,833
That's not sedation.

995
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,125
He's responding to drugs differently now.

996
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,458
We both knew from day one...

997
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,292
there would be complications.

998
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:55,833
Just give me a little more time.

999
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:58,458
I promise...

1000
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,667
you'll have your husband back.

1001
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:06,458
This goes for every squad

1002
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,042
in every department.

1003
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:11,750
Detective Murphy will have
full access to all investigations.

1004
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,625
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.

1005
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:17,250
If he requests to take over a case,

1006
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,000
the case will be handed to him.

1007
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,833
No arguments, no complaints.

1008
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:21,917
This is bullshit!

1009
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,708
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

1010
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,708
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

1011
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,583
I've selected 13 targets for today,

1012
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,042
all wanted for murder.

1013
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,833
John Biggs is target number one.

1014
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,500
I'll be taking over this case.

1015
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,708
Ambulances,
detention vehicles, and coroners

1016
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:40,958
should be ready to move in on my request.

1017
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:42,500
I wish you all a very good day.

1018
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,250
Murphy.

1019
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,333
You okay, man?

1020
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:56,833
I'm fine, Sergeant.

1021
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,583
Can't wait to get back to work.

1022
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:01,726
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

1023
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,833
Excuse me, I have casework.

1024
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,917
That's him!

1025
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,792
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1026
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,208
Walter Karrel, look at me.

1027
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,542
You have two options.

1028
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,625
Option one.

1029
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:11,917
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

1030
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,875
which may cause respiratory failure,

1031
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:15,083
organ malfunction,

1032
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:17,625
internal burns, and loss
of bowel and bladder control.

1033
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:19,625
And then I arrest you.

1034
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:21,292
Option two. You tell me where

1035
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,250
John Biggs' drug lab is located.

1036
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,000
And then I arrest you.

1037
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,250
You have two seconds to decide.

1038
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:38,750
Totally justifiable.

1039
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,917
We are going to make a lot of money.

1040
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:45,083
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

1041
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,042
No traces of anger whatsoever.

1042
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,542
Congratulations, Doctor.

1043
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,458
You did it.

1044
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:54,958
Yes, I did.

1045
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,208
<i>I told you, sir.</i>

1046
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:08,167
Norton clearly never
had control of the product.

1047
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,292
I agree.

1048
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,695
And that's why I called you here.

1049
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,768
I just want a second pair of eyes

1050
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,292
on this thing, that's all.

1051
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:15,500
Okay.

1052
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:17,458
I'll need a feed from the Tin Man's head

1053
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,792
plus full surveillance of the lab, and...

1054
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:22,292
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

1055
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,417
If anything comes up...

1056
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,375
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1057
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:31,333
<i>He brought peace</i>

1058
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,875
<i>to this country's most violent city.</i>

1059
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,333
<i>He showed us all</i>

1060
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:38,542
<i>that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.</i>

1061
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:42,667
<i>A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.</i>

1062
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,875
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

1063
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:50,583
The CEO of OmniCorp, Raymond Sellars.

1064
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,000
- Hello, Pat.
- Raymond.

1065
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:54,958
Thanks for havin' me.

1066
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,750
You must be doing a victory lap about now.

1067
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:58,667
Well...

1068
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,625
Two weeks ago,

1069
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,833
Omni's stock went through the roof.

1070
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:05,042
And the Senate has finally agreed

1071
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,208
to vote on the repeal of the Dreyfus Act.

1072
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:08,667
Well, look, I mean,

1073
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,458
the tide is definitely turning.

1074
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:12,000
I just feel certain that

1075
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,723
soon we'll be keeping all Americans safe.

1076
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:15,000
I certainly hope so.

1077
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,375
But, I think

1078
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,143
our next guest will
have a different point of view.

1079
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:19,458
Mmm-hmm.

1080
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:20,542
Hubert Dreyfus.

1081
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,042
Senator, thank you for joining us.

1082
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,917
<i>Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.</i>

1083
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,375
Senator, do you know what this is?

1084
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:30,208
The American public is divided

1085
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:31,542
on the Dreyfus Act.

1086
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:37,167
Our polls at <i>Novakelement.com</i>
are tight at 50-50.

1087
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,125
<i>There is no doubt
OmniCorp created a sensation</i>

1088
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:44,583
<i>but this bill is not about Alex Murphy.</i>

1089
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:47,625
<i>It's about whether
America's willing to give robots</i>

1090
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:51,292
<i>- the authority over human lives.</i>
- No. Look, look, look.

1091
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,792
This sea change we're witnessing,
and it is a sea change,

1092
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:57,125
shows that Americans don't really care

1093
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:59,875
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1094
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,792
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

1095
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,208
<i>You're clouding the issue.</i>

1096
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,625
<i>This is clearly an attempt
to sway public opinion</i>

1097
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,833
<i>- with a marketing stunt.</i>
- No. What's clear is

1098
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:11,833
that with just one system in place,

1099
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,542
we've cut crime by 80 percent.

1100
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,667
Just imagine if we put,

1101
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,000
I don't know,
let's say 100 systems in place.

1102
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,958
And then, I want you to ask yourself,

1103
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,542
why are you holding us back?

1104
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,417
<i>- Is that your plan?</i>
- Thank you, Senator.

1105
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,458
- And thank you, Raymond.
- Thank you, Pat.

1106
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:28,542
Well, there you have it.

1107
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:30,792
Who could argue with that?

1108
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,083
Which begs the question.

1109
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:38,250
Has the US Senate become pro-crime?

1110
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:48,917
Yeah, hi.

1111
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,167
No, no, 5000.

1112
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,125
Call me tomorrow.

1113
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:54,833
Hey, guys.

1114
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,863
Vallon's waitin' for you inside.

1115
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,059
What, you too busy to walk us in?

1116
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,934
- I'm out here makin' money.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1117
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:02,875
Where are my trip wires?

1118
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,333
I gotta do this myself?

1119
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,500
- What took you so long?
- What the hell is all this shit?

1120
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,833
I can't move any product
with this thing on the street.

1121
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,667
What are you doing to protect me?

1122
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,917
Relax. The guy's a walkin' zombie.

1123
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,500
And tell me your phones are off.

1124
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,917
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

1125
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,042
He can't manufacture
evidence out of thin air.

1126
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,875
If he does, I'm ready for him.

1127
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,583
Well?

1128
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:37,833
I've been getting calls.

1129
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:38,917
From whom?

1130
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,458
Well, Ciara.

1131
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,292
You need to let her see her husband.

1132
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,625
She has rights.

1133
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,958
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

1134
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:51,208
Yeah, but it's only a question of time

1135
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,708
before she turns up on television.

1136
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,667
Well, she can try.

1137
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,958
I'll issue a gag order
before I let her see her husband.

1138
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:01,000
I'd hop to it.

1139
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,042
Alex. Alex!

1140
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:10,000
Alex, you need to come home.

1141
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,458
Ciara, please stand aside.

1142
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,083
You need to speak to your son.

1143
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,208
Right now, I see three crimes in progress.

1144
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:16,542
Alex, listen to me.

1145
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,375
I know you're in there.

1146
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,417
David won't show his face at school.

1147
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,000
He's having nightmares.

1148
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,417
He's falling apart. I am falling apart.

1149
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:33,083
Please.

1150
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,167
I can't do this on my own.

1151
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:40,333
He's been scared ever since that night.

1152
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:51,708
<i>What do you think she's gonna do?</i>

1153
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:53,833
What's he gonna do?

1154
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:16,458
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1155
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,875
<i>David? David.</i>

1156
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,458
<i>Stand back. Come on, stand back!</i>

1157
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,250
He's supposed to be watching this.

1158
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,167
Instead, he's accessing

1159
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,833
images of Ciara and David
arriving at school.

1160
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,958
Over and over again.

1161
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:54,792
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

1162
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,833
<i>- Do you want me to shut him down?
- No.</i>

1163
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:08,917
Not yet.

1164
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:12,292
I wanna see what happens.

1165
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:33,833
What's he doing at his house?

1166
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,417
Look, he's disobeying protocol.

1167
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,125
You have to shut him down.

1168
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,500
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1169
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,833
Adrian, give me an image of his brain.

1170
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,875
He's undoing what we did to him.

1171
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,708
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

1172
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:54,750
How is that even possible?

1173
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:57,917
I haven't the faintest idea.

1174
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,167
<i>Alex.</i>

1175
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:28,833
<i>Alex, please return to the station.</i>

1176
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,375
I wanna run some tests.

1177
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,917
Well, this should be interesting.

1178
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:52,833
<i>And your phone on the table!</i>

1179
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:54,893
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1180
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:56,833
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

1181
01:18:58,125 --> 01:18:59,750
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1182
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,125
My hand, man!

1183
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:32,417
- Where's Antoine Vallon?
- You broke my hand, man!

1184
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:34,958
I know you remember me, Jerry.

1185
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:40,458
Where's Vallon?

1186
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,333
Wait, man.

1187
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:42,851
Wait, man.
If I tell you where Vallon is,

1188
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,333
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1189
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:47,375
Your wife left you in 2019

1190
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,417
after filing charges for domestic abuse.

1191
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,625
And you don't have a kid.

1192
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:52,917
But I do.

1193
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:55,792
I'm not askin' again!

1194
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:58,083
Look, I swear, man.
I don't know where Vallon is, okay?

1195
01:19:58,167 --> 01:19:59,887
The only guy I talk to
is his driver Marcus.

1196
01:19:59,917 --> 01:20:01,417
That's it, man. That's it!

1197
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,333
Does he have a phone number?

1198
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,833
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

1199
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:24,667
What's he doing?

1200
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,583
He's off solving his own murder.

1201
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,625
Oh, that is genius.

1202
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,375
Why didn't I think of that?

1203
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,333
<i>How long till he gets here?</i>

1204
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,542
- <i>Five minutes.</i>
- All right.

1205
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:44,500
Johnny, you stay on these monitors.

1206
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:45,625
What happened?

1207
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,667
Some idiot used an unencrypted phone.

1208
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:52,333
Shit.

1209
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:01,833
All right, everyone, listen up!

1210
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,042
He's coming.

1211
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,833
He leaves alive, you don't.

1212
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,292
How do we stop him?

1213
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:14,125
.50 caliber and above. Aim for the head.

1214
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,000
This one's set.

1215
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,417
Let's go. Go!

1216
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,625
All right, move! Let's go!

1217
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,500
Come on. Come on!

1218
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Ready to go!

1219
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,000
They're all set.

1220
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Finish it!

1221
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,083
Freak, die!

1222
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:14,208
Watch out.

1223
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,417
Need me to call a doctor?

1224
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,208
Come on, Jack. You're gonna like this.

1225
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,184
What's going on?
What the hell you doin' here?

1226
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,601
Y'all gonna play good cop, bad cop?

1227
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,833
Nah, Daniels. Bad cop, RoboCop.

1228
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:30,083
I've recovered 26 guns

1229
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:31,708
from Vallon's warehouse.

1230
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,000
13 serial numbers

1231
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,625
match weapons missing from Evidence.

1232
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,375
And I got your prints all over 'em.

1233
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:37,833
This is bullshit.

1234
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:40,583
I also have
CCTV footage of you and Vallon

1235
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,208
the same day he tried to kill me.

1236
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,184
<i>So put him on the payroll.
Why we talkin' about this?</i>

1237
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,208
<i>It won't work.</i>

1238
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:47,625
<i>Now that his partner got hit,
he's never gonna let it go.</i>

1239
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,125
<i>- What is that?
- Lewis' hospital.</i>

1240
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,917
<i>Murphy's dropping by this afternoon.</i>

1241
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,542
<i>I kill a cop,
I'm lookin' over my shoulder...</i>

1242
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:55,708
You know what
they do to cops in prison, man?

1243
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,917
Being locked up with
the same dudes you put in there?

1244
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,305
How long you think before he gives you up?

1245
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,625
Don't shoot me. Okay?

1246
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,875
I swear to Christ. It was Dean.

1247
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,542
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1248
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,542
Thank you for your cooperation.

1249
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,458
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1250
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:35,417
Now I know why we couldn't get an arrest.

1251
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:39,000
'Cause Vallon was
protected from up on high.

1252
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,583
Alex, I can explain.

1253
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:42,875
You tipped him off today.

1254
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:45,500
- Come on, man. Don't do this.
- You tried to kill me twice.

1255
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:49,708
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

1256
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,167
Confess.

1257
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,542
Now, in front of everyone.

1258
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,083
Confess!

1259
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:05,917
What happened?

1260
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,208
Tin Man is down. Had to be done.

1261
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:09,417
<i>Why?</i>

1262
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,833
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1263
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:12,309
Two more seconds, the chief's brains

1264
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,542
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

1265
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:16,542
We got anything on her?

1266
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:19,000
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1267
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,750
What do you think?

1268
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:25,708
You know what?

1269
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,042
This might actually tip
this thing right into the net.

1270
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:40,458
<i>Alex,
I don't know if you can hear me.</i>

1271
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:43,833
<i>But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>

1272
01:26:43,917 --> 01:26:46,542
<i>inside the Detroit Police Department.</i>

1273
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,750
<i>And in so doing,</i>

1274
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,417
<i>you shed light on an invaluable truth.</i>

1275
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:52,958
Even the police,

1276
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:56,792
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

1277
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:58,833
they can be bribed.

1278
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:02,667
They can be bought.

1279
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:08,417
Machines, however, are corruption-free.

1280
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,917
Americans could be living in a country

1281
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,833
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1282
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,625
but incorruptible.

1283
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:20,333
Thank you, Alex, for all you've done.

1284
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:22,458
And for all that you are.

1285
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:26,000
<i>Detective Murphy is
currently in critical condition.</i>

1286
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:28,875
Our doctors are working ceaselessly

1287
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,250
but, at this time,
it is unclear if he will survive.

1288
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,833
<i>Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt</i>

1289
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,792
<i>on Detective Alex Murphy's life</i>

1290
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,083
<i>will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?</i>

1291
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:42,125
<i>At this time,
OmniCorp's sole concern</i>

1292
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:44,125
<i>is the full recovery of Detective Murphy.</i>

1293
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,542
<i>How many times does Detective Murphy</i>

1294
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:49,708
<i>have to give his life for his country?</i>

1295
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:52,583
<i>I sincerely hope...</i>

1296
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,542
<i>the Senate makes the right vote tomorrow</i>

1297
01:27:55,625 --> 01:28:00,083
<i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.</i>

1298
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:07,042
<i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>

1299
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:10,125
<i>He has been my mentor and my strength</i>

1300
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,083
<i>in times of difficulty on this floor.</i>

1301
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:15,708
<i>But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,</i>

1302
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:18,833
<i>and the safety of
its citizens is my top priority.</i>

1303
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:20,958
<i>So I vote yes.</i>

1304
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:22,917
<i>The Dreyfus Act must be repealed.</i>

1305
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:25,917
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

1306
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,917
Yeah, I spoke to the Senate liaison
and it looks like it's in the bag,

1307
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,333
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1308
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,833
<i>We're here live
at DPD headquarters</i>

1309
01:28:35,917 --> 01:28:37,625
<i>where moments ago, Ciara Murphy</i>

1310
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:40,000
<i>- made a shocking statement.</i>
- What the hell?

1311
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:44,833
<i>OmniCorp has denied me and my son
access to Alex for weeks.</i>

1312
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,250
<i>I demand to know why.</i>

1313
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:53,292
<i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody
needs to be held accountable.</i>

1314
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,583
Oh, we're fucked.

1315
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,083
No, we only need 12 votes.

1316
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,750
She shouldn't make much difference.

1317
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,708
Yeah,
but what about after the vote?

1318
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:04,125
I mean, those two
should not be allowed contact.

1319
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:06,708
If she starts putting ideas in his head...

1320
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,333
Bring her in. I'll handle the explanation.

1321
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:11,000
And what about Alex?

1322
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,243
You know, unfortunately,
we can't just keep him on ice.

1323
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,417
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1324
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,667
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

1325
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:21,792
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1326
01:29:21,875 --> 01:29:26,125
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

1327
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:28,417
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

1328
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,500
It's property of OmniCorp.

1329
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,917
And politics are
the least of your concern.

1330
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,640
I mean, this thing solved its own murder.

1331
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,059
How long till it realizes
you haven't been on the level with it?

1332
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,375
If that happens,

1333
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:41,208
every journalist in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1334
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,083
I mean, we created a hero.

1335
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,333
What happens when he opens his mouth?

1336
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:51,625
What's bigger than a hero?

1337
01:30:03,417 --> 01:30:04,500
Dead hero.

1338
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:10,833
Get me Dr. Norton.

1339
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,250
What is this, Raymond?

1340
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:26,375
You have Mattox spying on me and now this
bullshit about a "critical condition"?

1341
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:29,208
You know and I know Alex is fine!

1342
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:30,667
Calm down.

1343
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,208
Dennett.

1344
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:33,572
Your work is so good, I don't...

1345
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,018
Well, now, this is not about my work!

1346
01:30:35,042 --> 01:30:37,083
You saw the woman on TV!

1347
01:30:37,167 --> 01:30:38,792
This has to stop!

1348
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,083
You're right.

1349
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:45,292
But let me ask you something, Dennett.

1350
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:47,667
What kind of life have
we really given Alex Murphy?

1351
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:51,292
He's never gonna be a normal man,
a father, a husband.

1352
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:54,667
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...

1353
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:55,792
Dennett.

1354
01:30:57,833 --> 01:30:58,917
Let's face it.

1355
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:01,292
We failed him.

1356
01:31:03,042 --> 01:31:04,792
We failed Alex Murphy.

1357
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,755
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1358
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,458
'cause that's what we're talking about.

1359
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:11,167
The work you've done with him
is gonna be studied for decades.

1360
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,375
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1361
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:17,875
No policeman is ever going to die
in the line of duty again

1362
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,833
'cause of you.

1363
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,042
You think about that.

1364
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:35,667
I want that family taken care of

1365
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,125
beyond their wildest dreams.

1366
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,917
- We owe them that.
- I agree.

1367
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:42,750
I want full funding. 10 years.

1368
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:45,542
New staff, all my own people.

1369
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:46,917
Fantastic.

1370
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:48,875
Deal.

1371
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,917
Hey. What's going on?

1372
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,840
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

1373
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,208
They're not waking him up.

1374
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,708
Whatever you do, don't leave him alone.

1375
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:08,472
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1376
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,542
<i>The voting period has ended.</i>

1377
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:14,208
<i>The clerks have tabulated the results.</i>

1378
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:16,375
<i>The yeas are 63.</i>

1379
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,292
<i>The nays are 22.</i>

1380
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,333
<i>A majority of senators
have voted in the affirmative.</i>

1381
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,958
<i>The Dreyfus Act has
been repealed by Congress.</i>

1382
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:33,458
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1383
01:32:33,542 --> 01:32:34,667
This is Mattox.

1384
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,208
<i>Dennett's on board.</i>

1385
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:37,500
It's about time.

1386
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,083
Call it.

1387
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:46,125
<i>Get it done.</i>

1388
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,250
My pleasure.

1389
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,708
- Mrs. Murphy...
- You can come here as much as you want.

1390
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:02,958
You can threaten me.
You can sue me. You can take my home,

1391
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,417
but I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

1392
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,625
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1393
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:12,250
Is Alex okay?

1394
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,167
He has important information to share
with you. Will you accompany me?

1395
01:33:18,167 --> 01:33:19,167
David.

1396
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:22,875
We gotta go. Can you grab your coat?

1397
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:25,250
Hey!

1398
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,773
<i>I'm in the elevator, on my way down.</i>

1399
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,250
I need access to the lab.

1400
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:29,693
That's insane. They're still here.

1401
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,583
<i>Distract them.</i>

1402
01:33:31,917 --> 01:33:33,000
Okay.

1403
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:35,458
I cannot...

1404
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:37,375
There's a lady in here going hysterical.

1405
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:39,559
She will not let us in.
She's got the codes for the door.

1406
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,292
I repeat, she will not let us in.

1407
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,684
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

1408
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,351
Are you not understanding what I'm saying?

1409
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,292
Do you wanna be responsible for
the deaths of everyone in this building?

1410
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:49,375
Hey! Stop!

1411
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,958
Don't shoot!

1412
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:56,208
Step outside.

1413
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,375
Unlock the transmitter!

1414
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,000
Transmitter unlocked!

1415
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:16,333
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1416
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,708
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

1417
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,125
<i>Wake him up!</i>

1418
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:24,667
Alex! Alex!

1419
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:28,375
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

1420
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,625
Alex, can you hear me?

1421
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,708
These men are here to kill us!

1422
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,208
They're here to kill us, for Christ sakes!

1423
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,833
<i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>

1424
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:43,583
Alex had a psychotic break.

1425
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:48,250
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

1426
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:51,042
We did everything,

1427
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:54,417
everything we could,
but the doctors couldn't save him.

1428
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:58,000
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1429
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:00,043
We're going to be
making the announcement shortly.

1430
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:03,375
You shut me down.
I was about to get a confession.

1431
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:05,083
Mattox shut you down.

1432
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:09,542
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

1433
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,000
Sellars can't afford to wake you up.

1434
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,542
He sent these guys to pull the plug.

1435
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,417
He wants you dead,
Alex. Do you understand?

1436
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:21,542
Sorry.
If there's anything we can do

1437
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,083
for you and David, we'll do it.

1438
01:35:23,167 --> 01:35:24,750
I want nothing from you.

1439
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:27,542
I understand.

1440
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,833
You stay out of our lives.

1441
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,542
You and your company.

1442
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:34,945
If that's what you think is best.

1443
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:37,542
There's one more thing.

1444
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:40,750
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David,

1445
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:42,833
if we kept this matter private.

1446
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:45,292
We don't wanna damage Alex's legacy.

1447
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:50,500
<i>Alex! Alex!</i>

1448
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:51,792
I can fix this!

1449
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,542
You lied to me.

1450
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:54,958
You lied to my wife.

1451
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,059
You're working for
the people that are trying to kill me.

1452
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:59,833
- You want me to trust you, Doctor?
- Alex, I can go to the press!

1453
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:04,167
Alex, I can tell them the whole story!

1454
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:05,708
Alex!

1455
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,833
Listen to me, please!

1456
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:12,458
Alex! Alex!

1457
01:36:24,292 --> 01:36:25,333
What the hell?

1458
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,273
Keep all our systems at green light,

1459
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:37,250
and for Christ sakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1460
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:38,375
<i>Roger that.</i>

1461
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:40,417
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1462
01:36:41,792 --> 01:36:43,000
Look at this city.

1463
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:46,500
So beautiful.

1464
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,833
It's become so peaceful.

1465
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,333
I wish...

1466
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,500
I had some good news for Detroit.

1467
01:36:58,208 --> 01:37:00,208
I have very sad news.

1468
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:02,750
Despite our best efforts to save him,

1469
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:05,542
Alex Murphy passed away just hours ago.

1470
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:07,250
Alex Murphy...

1471
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,792
Mr. Sellars.

1472
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,542
- What is it?
- Mattox just called.

1473
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:12,625
We need you to come with us now.

1474
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,226
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1475
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,268
- What are you talking about?
- We have a security situation here.

1476
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:25,018
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1477
01:37:25,042 --> 01:37:26,143
Sir, there's a car outside...

1478
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:27,958
That area is locked down. Now go.

1479
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,750
- What's happening?
- I said go!

1480
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:32,000
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

1481
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:36,292
Mr. Sellars.

1482
01:37:36,667 --> 01:37:37,917
How close is that helicopter?

1483
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,042
About 10 minutes, sir.

1484
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:57,833
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1485
01:37:57,917 --> 01:38:00,208
I need to speak with Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1486
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:01,667
It's an emergency.

1487
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:03,833
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

1488
01:38:03,917 --> 01:38:05,757
Apparently there's
a Ciara Murphy in the lobby.

1489
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,000
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

1490
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,083
What do you wanna do?

1491
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:11,625
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1492
01:38:11,708 --> 01:38:12,708
Yes, sir.

1493
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:19,625
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

1494
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:21,833
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1495
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:24,333
They won't shoot if we're unarmed. Clear?

1496
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:25,625
Clear.

1497
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:43,292
Hold it right there.

1498
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:45,375
Don't move.

1499
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:52,458
This is private property.
You are not authorized to be here!

1500
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:58,625
I'd put those guns down now if I were you.

1501
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,868
- Stand down.
- All right, man, we're good, we're good.

1502
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:04,083
Go, back it up!

1503
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:48,167
Head to the lower level.

1504
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,833
Hold up, hold up!

1505
01:39:50,917 --> 01:39:52,000
Ram it!

1506
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,417
Gun it.

1507
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:56,500
Go, go, go! Now!

1508
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:13,958
Alex, run!

1509
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:17,083
OmniCorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

1510
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:18,917
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

1511
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:22,292
<i>Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.</i>

1512
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:38,458
What's going on?

1513
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,917
Mrs. Murphy,
I want you to listen to me carefully.

1514
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,500
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

1515
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:45,750
The robotic part of him is malfunctioning,

1516
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:47,059
and he's shooting up the building.

1517
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:49,667
So we've gotta get you and your son
out of here right away.

1518
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,125
I gotta take this call.

1519
01:41:52,417 --> 01:41:54,292
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

1520
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,583
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1521
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:58,042
Don't shoot. My robot.

1522
01:41:58,125 --> 01:41:59,500
- You just flank.
- Got it.

1523
01:41:59,583 --> 01:42:00,833
Tin Man.

1524
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:04,833
Tin Man.

1525
01:42:05,792 --> 01:42:07,000
Tin Man.

1526
01:42:07,417 --> 01:42:08,583
Oh, there it is.

1527
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:10,625
You look like crap.

1528
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:14,542
What's the matter?

1529
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:15,833
Can't shoot?

1530
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:18,625
Huh?

1531
01:42:19,458 --> 01:42:21,208
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1532
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:22,625
You're a robot.

1533
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:25,667
I'm a red asset. Wrote that myself.

1534
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,750
What do you think?

1535
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,292
Come on, Tin Man, just pull the trigger.

1536
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:31,375
Pull it.

1537
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,417
You can run.

1538
01:42:33,917 --> 01:42:34,958
Go on.

1539
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:36,083
Run.

1540
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:37,917
Run!

1541
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,750
There you go. Run.

1542
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:42,000
Run. Run!

1543
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:45,958
Whoo!

1544
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:48,375
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

1545
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:51,583
Aren't you lucky I didn't
have my gun set to "kill"?

1546
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,792
Hey, listen.

1547
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,083
This isn't personal.

1548
01:42:57,667 --> 01:42:59,333
Well, maybe a little.

1549
01:43:01,042 --> 01:43:02,708
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

1550
01:43:14,625 --> 01:43:15,792
<i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>

1551
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:17,583
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1552
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:20,708
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy,
you and your son can get on first.

1553
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:27,167
Officer down.

1554
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,417
Mechanical room.

1555
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,875
OmniCorp Building.

1556
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:31,833
<i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>

1557
01:43:33,667 --> 01:43:35,417
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1558
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,583
It's nonfatal.

1559
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:38,250
Go. Go.

1560
01:43:39,667 --> 01:43:42,000
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

1561
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
What's that?

1562
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,250
- He's got a gun!
- What?

1563
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:54,333
Pull up! Pull up!

1564
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:01,458
- What the hell is he doing?
- Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1565
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,125
Alex?

1566
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:09,208
Dad?

1567
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:13,833
Ciara, David.

1568
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:16,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1569
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:17,375
Wait.

1570
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:20,458
- Get out of the way.
- Alex, put down the gun.

1571
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:22,833
Ciara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1572
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,000
Raymond Sellars, you're under arrest

1573
01:44:26,083 --> 01:44:27,958
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1574
01:44:31,292 --> 01:44:33,792
Oh, you're here to cuff me? All right.

1575
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:36,000
Go ahead, cuff me.

1576
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:40,083
You can't. You're not programmed that way.

1577
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:41,417
If you go against the program,

1578
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
the entire system shuts down, so.

1579
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,851
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1580
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:47,934
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your back.

1581
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:49,458
- I'm just from marketing.
- Now!

1582
01:44:49,542 --> 01:44:51,250
Okay, yep, yep, yep. Yep.

1583
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,750
Alex, we need to work together here.

1584
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:57,167
Because I'm the only one with
the technology to keep you alive.

1585
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:00,083
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

1586
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,125
All right.

1587
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:08,208
Weapon.

1588
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:13,208
Alex, honestly, I mean you no harm.

1589
01:45:13,292 --> 01:45:15,542
If I wanted to, I could
have killed you a long time ago.

1590
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:17,559
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1591
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,375
Sellars, please! Don't!

1592
01:45:19,458 --> 01:45:22,292
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family...

1593
01:45:23,208 --> 01:45:24,792
and I could just kill them too.

1594
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,726
And really, there's
nothing you could do about it

1595
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,000
because, let's face it,

1596
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,625
you're a robot.

1597
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,917
Do you understand that?

1598
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:38,458
Alex.

1599
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:42,458
Dad!

1600
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,792
Baby.

1601
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:54,708
Hey.

1602
01:45:56,292 --> 01:45:57,750
Hey.

1603
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:59,708
Everything's gonna be all right.

1604
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:02,583
Everything's gonna be all right.

1605
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,250
How are you feeling, Alex?

1606
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:57,417
I'm ready.

1607
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,792
He's ready.

1608
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:12,000
There's still no word

1609
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:15,042
from OmniCorp parent company, OCP.

1610
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,792
And although the government
says they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1611
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,042
rumors continue to
swirl about his condition.

1612
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:27,042
But we have obtained
exclusive video taken by cell phone

1613
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:29,667
that shows the people of Detroit

1614
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,792
may have Alex Murphy back on the streets

1615
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,333
sooner than they think.

1616
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,042
The real tragedy here

1617
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:42,167
is that our president
chose to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1618
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:47,792
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

1619
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:51,583
and by whistle-blower Dennett Norton.

1620
01:48:51,667 --> 01:48:55,333
<i>I acknowledge
we know less than we thought.</i>

1621
01:48:56,458 --> 01:48:58,875
<i>But I do believe
my research program is sound.</i>

1622
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:02,083
<i>What I did with it...</i>

1623
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:04,750
<i>was wrong.</i>

1624
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:07,833
The fact that this mother

1625
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:11,250
is not serving time in
some federal penitentiary

1626
01:49:11,333 --> 01:49:14,833
is a huge, hot,
heaping pile of horse.

1627
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:25,375
Now I know some of you may think
that this kind of thinking is dangerous

1628
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:28,958
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1629
01:49:29,417 --> 01:49:33,750
Some of you even believe
that the use of these drones overseas

1630
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:38,167
makes us the same
kind of bullying imperialists

1631
01:49:38,625 --> 01:49:40,833
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1632
01:49:41,667 --> 01:49:43,708
To you, I say...

1633
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,542
stop whining!

1634
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:51,250
America is now

1635
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:53,750
and always will be

1636
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:57,750
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1637
01:50:02,583 --> 01:50:03,833
I'm Pat Novak.

1638
01:50:05,667 --> 01:50:06,833
Good night.
