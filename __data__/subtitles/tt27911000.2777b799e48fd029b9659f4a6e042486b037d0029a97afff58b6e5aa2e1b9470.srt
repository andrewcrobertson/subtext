01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,292
I was thinking,

1100
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,000
why don't you come over
Aunt Jess's tonight?

1101
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,375
I mean,
why wait till Christmas Eve?

with classes by now, right?

I can't, I can't tonight.

1104
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:21,626
Why not?

1105
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,375
There's a party on campus
that I was invited to.

1106
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,542
Really?

1107
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,375

No. I'm happy.

Oh, wow.

1116
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,918
Hey, big sis.

1117
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,792
I've, uh, heard a lot about you.

1118
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:47,375
It's nice to finally meet you.

1119
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,626
Hi.

1120
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,125
Well, you've got a cool
baby bro here, and I treat him

1121
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,167
like he's my own.

1122
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,751

01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:58,918
Oh, shit.

1126
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,876
Let me get out of here.

I can't believe I'm sitting here

1132
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,792
I was literally just telling
your little brother.

1133
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:11,751
I'm sorry.

1134
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:12,667
I'm probably being
a little weird.

1135
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:15,918
I'm just super stoked
to see you.

1136

Mia has been following
our story very closely.

1137
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,626
I am a true crime enthusiast,

1138
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:24,000
and I've actually been following
your case in particular

1139
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:27,167
for years on my podcast,
and no rush or anything,

1140
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,125
but I do know the five year
anniversary is coming up

1141
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,375
and the fanbase is rabid.

1142
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:34,876

kill for anything.

on a daily basis,

1148
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:44,292

1150
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:54,000
Well, uh, I've been in and out
of a psychiatric hospital

1151
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,250
for the past five years.

1152
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,667
Oh.

1153
01:04:56,751 --> 01:05:00,500
I see images of my dead friends
and relatives on a daily basis,

1154
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:03,792

in the middle of the night.

1155
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:06,500
I have hideous scars
all over my body,

1156
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,000
and every time I see them,

1157
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:11,375
I think of how that sick fuck
who ruined our lives

1158
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:12,542
is still out there.

1159
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:14,417

how I'm coping with everything?

How can you be sure
it was really him?

of anything anymore.

or what's in my fucking head.

Well,
what'd you see exactly?

1173
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,167
He was dressed as Santa Claus.

1174
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,626
