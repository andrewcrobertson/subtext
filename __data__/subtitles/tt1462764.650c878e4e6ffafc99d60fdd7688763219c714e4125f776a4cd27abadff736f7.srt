1
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,923
On your feet!

2
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,237
An American, Colonel.

3
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,530
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

4
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,205
You were alone?

5
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,751
Spy, you were alone?

6
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,336
I like to be alone.

7
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,381
What did you come here for?

8
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,717
You got a lot of nice stuff.

9
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,177
Other people's stuff.

10
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,014
"To the victor
belongs the spoils."

11
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,433
"To the victor"?

12
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,894
Berlin's in rubble.

13
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,729
The Führer's in hiding.

14
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,649
You lost.

15
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,029
Take him upstairs.

16
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,573
What? What? Hey!

17
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,825
Hey, wait a second. Guys!

18
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,285
A moment. Please!

19
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,578
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

20
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,747
Colonel. I found it!

21
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,209
Do as he says. Open it.

22
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,590
Doctor.

23
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,600
The Lance of Longinus.

24
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,438
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

25
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,315
The Holy Lance.

26
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,036
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

27
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,202
Colonel, we need to talk.

28
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,413
No time, Doctor.

29
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,040
The train to Berlin is waiting.

30
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,541
Search the woods!

31
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,667
Take the dogs.

32
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,920
Do you think that spy was alone?

33
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,048
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
On the double!

35
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,159
Looks like
they're leaving

36
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,535
without you guys.

37
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,955
Tell us your story, or die.

38
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,083
Story. Um...

39
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,794
Okay, okay.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,712
Well...

41
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,255
It all started

42
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:38,010
once upon a time,
when this village

43
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:42,723
of stupid blue-eyed boys
decided to join hands together

44
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,892
and follow this sweaty
little pied piper

45
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,727
named Adolf...

46
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,995
This man
was with the American.

47
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,831
This is the American's bag.

48
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
What have I done?

49
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,590
Bring him to my carriage.

50
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,267
Careful. This is the Führer's
special relic!

51
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,537
Heil Hitler!

52
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,131
Stay seated.

53
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,342
So...

54
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,138
you are a birdwatcher?

55
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,686
Yes. Because of the bombing,

56
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,605
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

57
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,278
We caught your accomplice.

58
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,989
The American.

59
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,181
Oh, my!

60
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,999
Get off of me!

61
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,487
There's one reason

62
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,072
you're still alive,
birdwatcher.

63
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,159
Who sent you?

64
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,494
What was your mission?

65
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,663
Please, Colonel, no.
I beg you.

66
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,124
My name is Basil Shaw.

67
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,335
I'm a professor at Oxford.

68
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,837
An archeologist.

69
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,429
There you are.

70
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,560
There is a problem.

71
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,020
I must speak to the Colonel.

72
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,522
It's urgent.

73
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,569
I have a daughter. I beg you.

74
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,947
I guarantee you will never see
your child again, Mr. Shaw.

75
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,245
Unless you explain
why your accomplice had this.

76
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,797
Sieg heil!

77
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,020
We were fold
that the Lance of Longinus

78
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
could be found
at the fortress.

79
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,274
We were looking for it.

80
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,776
Why?

81
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,361
Because of its power?

82
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,199
It has no power.

83
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,496
My friend and I
were trying to save history.

84
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,583
I must
speak with the Colonel.

85
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,919
It's about the Lance.

86
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,050
I only had a moment to look at it.

87
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,969
Of course, my training is in physics,

88
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,429
For God's sake, spit it out!

89
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,515
The Lance...

90
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,645
It's a fake.

91
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,271
It's a fake.

92
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,648
A fake?

93
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,443
The blade is an alloy.

94
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,945
Fifty years old,

95
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,281
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

96
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,490
We're dead.

97
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,244
Twelfth century.

98
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,537
Thirteenth century.

99
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,831
Ramesses II.

100
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,959
None of this stuff is fake.

101
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,380
I gotta stop this train.

102
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,194
There is another relic on this train.

103
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,634
One with real power.

104
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,219
What are you talking about?

105
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,263
The Antikythera.

106
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,557
The Antikythera?!

107
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,809
Enough about that old dial!

108
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,228
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

109
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,022
and his mind!

110
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,567
Let me explain.

111
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,030
The Antikythera's power
is not supernatural.

112
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,365
It is mathematics.

113
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,577
Whoever harnesses it...

114
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,164
will not be King...

115
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,916
nor Emperor...

116
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,501
or Führer.

117
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,798
He will be God.

118
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,860
Too many Nazis.

119
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,325
And how do you propose we tell him this?

120
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,992
My Führer,

121
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,412
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

122
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,830
But here is...

123
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,001
half of something you've never heard of.

124
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,544
Tell me,

125
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,464
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

126
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,134
A saboteur aboard.

127
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,636
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

128
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:03,927
Sieg heil!

129
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,220
That way!

130
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,183
What are you doing here?!

131
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,817
What the hell?

132
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,111
Indy?

133
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,195
Baz?

134
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,530
You're alive!

135
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
So far.

136
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,326
I thought I told you
to stay in the woods, Baz.

137
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,454
What sort of a man
hides in a hedge

138
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,539
while his friend
is facing death?

139
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,514
This lot are carting off
half the world's antiquities.

140
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,726
I was gonna stop 'em,
but now I've gotta rescue you.

141
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,811
Did you at least
find the Lance?

142
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,021
"At least"?

143
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,481
Well, have you got it?

144
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,399
- It's a fake.
- What?

145
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,401
A reproduction.

146
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,237
Who are you?

147
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,619
Indy?

148
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,837
The Antikythera.

149
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,673
Archimedes' Dial.

150
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,218
Bring it.

151
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,070
Hurry up, Baz.

152
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,366
Give me that.

153
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,659
Come on.

154
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,883
Get up, Baz.

155
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,260
Follow me.

156
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,220
Towards the gun?

157
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,680
Away from the Nazis!

158
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,057
Those are Nazis!

159
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,601
Get down! Down! Down!

160
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,027
This way. Come on!

161
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,612
I can't do that!

162
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,697
You wanna stop
for a little lie-down?

163
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,869
They have the Antikythera!

164
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,288
Easy.

165
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,195
Tunnel!

166
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,540
Got you! No!

167
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,207
Indy!

168
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,466
Get the gun!

169
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,060
Shoot him!

170
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,064
Not me!

171
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,191
S-Sorry.

172
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,504
To the victor go the spoils.

173
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,204
Drop the gun.

174
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,500
Give me the Antikythera.

175
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,970
Indy!

176
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,774
Hey!

177
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,196
- Here!
- They can't hear you, Baz.

178
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,115
We gotta jump!

179
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,616
What about my dicky knee?

180
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,326
Ahh!

181
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
Baz!

182
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,501
Baz!

183
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,379
Baz!

184
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,382
- Indy!
- Baz!

185
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,305
Go! Move! Move it!

186
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,810
Bit rum to go home
empty-handed after all that.

187
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,603
"Empty-handed"?

188
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,896
Not exactly.

189
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,025
Archimedes' Dial.

190
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,235
Well, half of it.

191
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,612
Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

192
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,285
Roll up, roll up
for the Magical Mystery Tour

193
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,204
Step right this way

194
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,081
Roll up

195
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,959
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

196
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,754
Roll up

197
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,590
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

198
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,468
-Roll up
-That's an invitation

199
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,886
Roll up for the...

200
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,597
Larry! Turn it down!

201
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,891
Turn it down!

202
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,893
Hey, Larry!

203
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:37,106
The Magical Mystery Tour
is waiting to take you away

204
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,360
Waiting to take you away

205
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:46,533
Roll up
Roll up for the Mystery Tour

206
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,617
Larry!

207
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,119
Larry!

208
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,746
- Hi, Mr. Jones.
- Where's Larry?

209
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,083
- Who is this guy?
- It's the old guy next door.

210
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,876
Larry, it's 8:00
in the morning.

211
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,420
- "It's 8:00 in the morning."
- We talked about this, Larry.

212
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,630
Yeah, but that was

213
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,174
- a workday, Mr. Jones.
- This is a workday too, Larry!

214
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,718
Turn on the news.

215
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,929
It's moon day, Mr. Jones.

216
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,597
Moon day?

217
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,865
And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear

218
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:35,415
Now it's time to leave
the capsule if you dare

219
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:42,005
This is Major Tom
to Ground Control

220
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,967
I'm stepping through the door

221
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:53,224
And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way

222
00:23:54,601 --> 00:24:00,648
And the stars look
very different today

223
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,068
Thanks.

224
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,250
All you really
need to remember

225
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,004
is that Assyrian ceramics of this period
are characterized

226
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:27,133
by this complex
blue-line pattern.

227
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,301
Okay?

228
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,764
I assigned pages 131
through 171

229
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,557
in Winford for today.

230
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,225
Anybody do the reading?

231
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,520
Anyone?

232
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,359
This is on the test.

233
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,735
Okay.

234
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,946
Guess I'll spoon-feed it
to you.

235
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,452
In 213 BC,

236
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,621
Roman forces led by Marcellus

237
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,624
laid siege
to the city of Syracuse.

238
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,459
"Syracuse."

239
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,505
Not the Syracuse
in New York, Tonya.

240
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,256
The one in Sicily.

241
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,426
Amongst the defenders
of the city

242
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,680
was its most famous resident,
who was...

243
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,600
Come on, guys.
This is on the final.

244
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,894
Archimedes.

245
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,813
Archimedes.

246
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,314
Archimedes, who was a...

247
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,607
A mathematician.

248
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,942
A mathematician.

249
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,695
But more than that,
an inventor,

250
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,364
a brilliant engineer

251
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,949
who conceived of a way

252
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,827
to harness the energy
of the Mediterranean sun

253
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,746
on concave mirrors
and focus it

254
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,582
on attacking Roman warships
and set them on fire.

255
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,211
Who devised giant iron claws

256
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,964
that could snatch hostiles
from the sea.

257
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,428
But how do we know
it really happened?

258
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:58,558
What physical, irrefutable
archeological evidence

259
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,061
- is there of these inventions?
- The Antikythera.

260
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,606
- The Antikythera.
- For starters.

261
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,775
They're here!
They're downtown!

262
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,070
The astronauts.

263
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,656
Giant parade
this morning will be seen

264
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,450
by about
two and a half million people

265
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,868
lining the sidewalks...

266
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,330
He's coming.
He's come. See?

267
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,915
Oh, here he comes.

268
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,876
Hide the cake.

269
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,671
- Surprise.
- Surprise!

270
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,970
For over a decade now,
our colleague Dr. Jones

271
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,639
has been a loyal servant
of Hunter.

272
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,642
A token of our gratitude.

273
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,777
Wow.

274
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,199
Thanks for putting up with me.

275
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,714
Here.

276
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,391
Astronauts
Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,

277
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,353
and Buzz Aldrin will not be
able to avoid the spotlight.

278
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,438
At 11:00 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time,

279
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,232
a grateful nation
will pay homage

280
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,026
with a ticker-tape parade
through New York and Chicago,

281
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,694
climaxed by a dinner
in Los Angeles...

282
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,196
What would the ancients say?

283
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,448
Neil, Buzz, and Mike...

284
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,368
If they knew
we walked on the moon?

285
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,078
Speaking as an ancient,

286
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,705
going to the moon
is like going to Reno.

287
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,165
Middle of nowhere

288
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,835
and no blackjack.

289
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,504
You don't recognize me,
do you?

290
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,883
Whatever I did, I apologize.

291
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:57,885
It's Helena.

292
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,513
Helena Shaw.

293
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,641
Wombat?

294
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,351
Wow, I haven't
heard that in a while.

295
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,645
- You got tall.
- I did.

296
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,105
It's fair to say.

297
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,316
I'm celebrating.

298
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,653
- I'm retiring.
- Oh.

299
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,953
Wow. Well, in that case,
what are we drinking?

300
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,829
Room service for Mr. Schmidt.

301
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,384
Put that away.

302
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,012
I was asking how you broke
your ankle.

303
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,097
- None of your business.
- Are you Mr. Schmidt?

304
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,391
"Doctor" Schmidt.
He's in there.

305
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,059
And he don't eat anything
on wheels,

306
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,352
so put it on a table.

307
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,105
When I was a little boy,

308
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,773
I always imagined

309
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,652
that one day
man would walk on the moon.

310
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,321
And by golly...

311
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,662
Quite a celebration
out there, hmm?

312
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,542
The man you're serving,

313
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,003
he's the one who put
those astronauts on the moon.

314
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,370
Built the rockets
they rode in.

315
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,882
Congratulations.

316
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,133
Where are you from?

317
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,135
The Bronx, sir.

318
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,179
No, no. I mean originally,
your people.

319
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,347
Do you know?

320
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,686
I was born
by Yankee Stadium, sir.

321
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,107
And you fought
for your country?

322
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,485
320th Battalion.

323
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,029
Set up balloons to stop
the planes bombing Normandy.

324
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,370
And are you enjoying
your victory?

325
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,253
Will there be
anything else?

326
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,007
You didn't win the war.

327
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,802
Hitler lost it.

328
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,517
Yeah.

329
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,229
My field agent,
she found Shaw.

330
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,439
Yeah, I'm coming.

331
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,607
Let's go, Hauke.

332
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,195
Where are we here?

333
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,781
Oxford. In the garden.

334
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,368
He was an original.

335
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,205
I just graduated.

336
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,373
In Archeology.

337
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,459
Archeology. Wow.

338
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,169
Apple didn't fall far.

339
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,047
Well, now I'm researching
a doctorate.

340
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:42,258
What's your subject?

341
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,052
The Archimedes Dial.

342
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,138
The Antikythera.

343
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,434
What do you know about that?

344
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,310
Well, for starters,

345
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,856
in 1902, Greek sponge divers
found a wrecked Roman warship,

346
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,399
huge, off the coast of Greece.

347
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,735
Below deck, sealed in wax,

348
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,445
was a clock-like mechanism,

349
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,406
finely tooled,
purpose unknown.

350
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,450
Nothing approximating
its complexity

351
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,535
appears in the world
for 1,000 years.

352
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,830
- You've done your homework.
- Well, not me.

353
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,415
Dad. He had
all these journals,

354
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,000
reams of notes about it.

355
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,002
He was obsessed till the end.

356
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,841
He told me you found it
on a Nazi plunder train.

357
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,387
And then lost it in a river
in the French Alps.

358
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,349
Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.

359
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,976
And it was only half the Dial.

360
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,245
- Archimedes...
- Archimedes broke the Dial...

361
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,955
- ...disassembled it.
- ...in two, and then hid

362
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,124
the two halves from the Romans
during the siege of Syracuse.

363
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,357
I know. Look.

364
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,442
You don't remember the last
time I saw you, do you?

365
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,113
Remember what?

366
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:47,198
These are the Alps.

367
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,242
Yeah, I see.

368
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,161
And this is the route
that your train took

369
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,287
from the Nazi stronghold

370
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,371
- in '44.
- Right.

371
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,332
It went through
this mountain pass,

372
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,000
and then here.

373
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,002
Here, it's the only river
on the route.

374
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,629
- Right.
- Under a bridge.

375
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,172
It's down there.
It's got to be.

376
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,758
- And nobody knows except us.
- "Us"?

377
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,551
Well, I mean, you.

378
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,261
And me. So, yeah.

379
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,263
- Us.
- Us.

380
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,767
And what were you
thinking exactly?

381
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,311
Well, that maybe...

382
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,689
we could go there.

383
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,899
And?

384
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,150
And find it. And...

385
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,694
And I'd become...

386
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,489
famous.

387
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,950
Oh, well, not famous.
Renowned. Feted.

388
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,327
A feted archeologist.

389
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,204
And you, a final triumph!

390
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,413
Indiana Jones!

391
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,541
Out with a bang!
Back in the saddle!

392
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,003
I'm not selling this, am I?

393
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,715
Wombat...

394
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,678
why are you chasing the thing

395
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,515
that drove your father crazy?

396
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,897
Wouldn't you?

397
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,125
I got it.

398
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,209
Parade's coming soon.

399
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,253
So, what we got?

400
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,382
She's in there, third floor,
with an old guy.

401
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,675
Who is he, a Russian?

402
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,760
No, a professor.
Dr. Henry Jones.

403
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,846
Klaber!

404
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,432
Klaber, get back here!
You're not an agent!

405
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,892
God damn it! Go.

406
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,644
I'll get support up here
and pull a file on Jones.

407
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,541
This way.

408
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,789
Basil became obsessed
by this German theory.

409
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,708
Conjecture, really.

410
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,879
Archimedes had figured out

411
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,966
that the movements
of the moon and planets

412
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,051
weren't perfect.

413
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,805
There were irregularities
in their rotations.

414
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:01,267
He thought these
irregularities might

415
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,812
explain fluctuations
in temperature, tides.

416
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,232
Storms, even.

417
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,486
So, he set about building
a device to predict them.

418
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,990
But then, he stumbled upon

419
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,117
a method to predict
even larger

420
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:19,868
disturbances.

421
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,163
Larger disturbances?

422
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,000
Your father
thought this thing could

423
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,961
predict fissures in time.

424
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,479
Hauke, if you don't...

425
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,109
Found 'em.

426
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,743
Hello.

427
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,996
Are you looking for...

428
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,331
Dr. Jones?

429
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,252
Excuse me, can I help you?

430
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,837
No, thank you.

431
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,630
Just a routine investigation,
ma'am.

432
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,217
Are you the police?

433
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,719
It'll just be a few moments.

434
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,596
- Professor Plimpton.
- Ma'am.

435
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,839
- Professor Plimpton!
- Ma'am!

436
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,394
Drop your weapon.

437
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,830
What the hell are you doing?

438
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:29,980
Um...

439
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,232
What the doctor tells me,
Miss Mason.

440
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,317
Mandy?

441
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,990
Yeah, no witnesses.

442
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,455
Jesus. What the hell?

443
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,123
Your father wrote
SO many letters

444
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,042
about the Dial,
I stopped reading 'em.

445
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,171
You really don't remember

446
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,881
the last time
I was at your house?

447
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,718
I took that from him then.

448
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,945
I thought he'd stopped
thinking about it.

449
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,074
But your father was convinced

450
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,101
this thing was real
and dangerous.

451
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,228
Do not shoot.

452
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:13,065
He was terrified that if somebody found
this legendary tablet,

453
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,358
the Grafikos...

454
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,585
The tablet
containing directions

455
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,693
to the rest of the Dial.

456
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,060
And if they found
the Grafikos,

457
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,672
they might acquire
the other half of the Dial

458
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,697
and put the two together.

459
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,575
I knew
you wouldn't destroy it.

460
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,039
How did you know
he asked me to destroy it?

461
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,917
- What?
- You do remember that night.

462
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,586
I was 12 years old, Indy.

463
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,150
You knew we didn't drop it
in a river.

464
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,841
- Baz didn't tell you that.
- See, listen.

465
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,244
- I didn't...
- No, he never lied.

466
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,969
- No...
- What was all that crap

467
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,095
- about the map?
- You...

468
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,542
No, you've had
too many whiskeys.

469
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,241
What are you doing, Wombat?

470
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,599
Stay where you are.

471
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:49,810
Don't move.

472
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,122
- Who are these people?
- We need to get out of here.

473
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:53,147
Are they with you?

474
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,481
Not an inch, Miss Shaw.

475
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,692
Miss Shaw, stop!

476
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,363
Helena!

477
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,161
Stop!

478
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,122
Sorry.

479
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,167
- Helena!
- Dr. Jones. It's over.

480
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,543
Who are you people?

481
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,794
What do you want?

482
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,630
Stop!

483
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:21,717
Helena Shaw!

484
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,319
She's on the roof.
Find another way up.

485
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,428
Dr. Jones!

486
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,287
Dr. Jones,
we're not gonna hurt you.

487
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,082
Move.
We gotta follow 'em.

488
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,292
Go. Hurry up.

489
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,862
Fan out!

490
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,228
All right, let's go.
Move, move, move! Pack it up!

491
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,253
Come on,
get everything.

492
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,546
Found her!

493
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,285
- Operator.
- I need the police.

494
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,745
Hunter College.
People are dead.

495
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:14,997
- Please...
- Hang up, fella.

496
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,962
Stand up.

497
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,510
Okay, okay.

498
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,328
She's gone. You blew it,

499
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,746
you trigger-happy cracker.

500
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,373
- She had it in her hand.
- We got the professor.

501
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,128
Here's the file on Jones.

502
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,212
Yes.

503
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,523
Who are you?

504
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,150
That's my question.

505
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,120
You're CIA.

506
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,039
Oh, not me, man.

507
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,166
I don't take government jobs.

508
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,417
Okay.

509
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,879
How are you acquainted
with Miss Shaw?

510
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,506
She's my goddaughter.

511
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,883
I haven't seen her
in 18 years.

512
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,194
Why did you
meet with her today?

513
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,219
To give her the Dial?

514
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,056
Lady, it's an ancient
hunk of gears.

515
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,058
Half a hunk.

516
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,810
Oh, it's a lot more than that.

517
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,729
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

518
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,064
Where do you think
you're going?

519
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,607
I got a parade going on.

520
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,234
And a demonstration
coming down here.

521
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,443
Hey! Hey, hey!

522
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,153
- Hey...
- Shut up.

523
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,739
I can't go this way.
Gotta go back.

524
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,496
Hell no!
What is wrong with you, man?

525
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,289
Damn it! Let's go on foot.

526
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,541
You heard her.

527
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,353
What the hell
were you thinking?

528
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,729
- Walk! Come on.
- What is your problem?

529
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,814
You don't look
when you're backing up?

530
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,440
- Take care of that guy.
- Who's gonna pay for that?

531
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,590
Easy, fella. Easy.

532
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:31,675
Keep moving.

533
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,510
Can't you see my cab?
It's yellow.

534
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,238
No, you're gonna have to pay
for this bodywork, man.

535
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,263
I don't...

536
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,434
Peace now!
Peace now!

537
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:44,688
Stop the war!
Stop the fighting!

538
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,606
- Where are we going, Mason?
- This way.

539
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,235
- Hell no, we won't go.
- Shut up.

540
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,820
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no!

541
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,698
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

542
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,782
We won't go!

543
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,326
- Hell no, we won't go!
- Hell no, we won't go!

544
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,328
- Hell no...
- Shut up!

545
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,496
Hell yeah!

546
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,665
Hell no, we won't go!

547
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,584
Hell no, we won't go!

548
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,129
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

549
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,465
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

550
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,549
Hell no...

551
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:16,511
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

552
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,770
Hey!

553
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,230
Officer! Help me!

554
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,566
Officer,
there was a shooting...

555
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,627
- All right, all right.
- ...this morning at Hunter.

556
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,403
People are dead. God damn it.

557
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:35,197
Some rogue maniacs
broke in and...

558
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,907
Sir, you need to calm it down.

559
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,283
Please listen to me.

560
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,577
There was a shooting
this morning, and the...

561
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:44,164
They're in a Con Ed van
right around the corner!

562
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,376
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

563
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,472
Whoa!

564
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,890
- Watch out!
- What's he doing?

565
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,058
Whoa!

566
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:38,635
Hyah! Hyah!

567
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,941
- Move, out the way!
- Whoa, whoa!

568
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,611
Hyah!

569
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:01,533
- Watch out!
- Hyah!

570
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,368
Whoa. Whoa.

571
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,619
Move! Quickly!

572
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,293
Hyah!

573
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,302
Move! Move!

574
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,230
Go, go, go!

575
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:37,736
Hyah!

576
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:49,831
Hyah!

577
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,961
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

578
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,546
- It's a horse.
- Come on.

579
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,884
- Hey, mister.
- Move! Out of the way!

580
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,011
- Hold my horse.
- Move! Move!

581
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,095
Transfer is available

582
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,264
for IND Queens Boulevard.

583
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,693
Next stop, 59th,
Lexington Avenue.

584
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,864
- Subway is faster.
- Oh!

585
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:25,116
People tend
to romanticize science,

586
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,160
when it is, in fact,
quite cold.

587
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,828
So, what's next,
Dr. Schmidt?

588
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,039
Mars?

589
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,249
No, we've conquered space.

590
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,795
I'm moving
to the next frontier.

591
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,674
What's beyond space?

592
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,221
You might wanna
get that suit pressed,

593
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,305
Dr. Schmidt.

594
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,557
We leave for the airport
in an hour.

595
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,077
He's gonna meet the President.

596
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,741
If the President objects
to a few creases,

597
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:55,105
perhaps he should find himself
another physicist.

598
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,941
- Can I use that?
- No.

599
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,401
Yes.

600
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,528
Baxter.

601
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,825
It's for you, Doctor.

602
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,706
I may wanna leave a bit later
for Los Angeles.

603
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:15,041
I'm expecting
a delivery shortly.

604
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,212
Speak.

605
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,797
Your goons made a mess.

606
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,132
Did they?

607
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,718
Miss Shaw met
with a professor. Jones.

608
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,095
She acquired the device
from him.

609
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,097
Then we lost her.

610
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,434
Dr. Jones got away as well.

611
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,019
Ls that so?

612
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,520
Most unfortunate.

613
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,355
I gotta clean things
up here, Doctor.

614
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,440
And as a represent alive

615
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,983
of the United States
government,

616
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,776
I urge you to cooperate.

617
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,153
Get on that plane
to Los Angeles,

618
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,550
and get your medal
from the President.

619
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,039
Hello?

620
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,708
Call our friends
and secure a private charter.

621
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,127
To Morocco.

622
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,378
Yes, sir.

623
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,547
The university murders

624
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,591
took place at the height
of the parade.

625
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:05,759
Police are searching

626
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:08,094
for retired professor
Dr. Henry Jones.

627
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,264
A colleague told ABC that
Jones recently lost his son

628
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,433
and was in the middle
of a divorce.

629
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,855
This guy,
he looks like you.

630
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,192
Nah. No.

631
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,154
- It is you.
- No, no, no. Hey.

632
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,923
- Go home, pal. You're drunk.
- This is the guy!

633
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,282
- Hey!
- It's the killer!

634
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,369
Sorry I'm late, Indy.

635
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,954
Bridge traffic.

636
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,009
Boy, am I glad
to see you, Sallah.

637
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,845
I wish I could say the same,
old friend.

638
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,059
Quickly, Indy. Inside.

639
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,148
Your goddaughter, Helena,

640
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,984
was arrested in Tangier
last year

641
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,904
for auctioning contraband.

642
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,449
There's more.

643
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:15,912
She was bailed out
by Aziz Rahim.

644
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,582
Aziz Rahim is the son
of Big Rahim,

645
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,418
a well-known Moroccan mobster.

646
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:27,632
Big Rahim
owns the Hotel Atlantique

647
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,385
in Tangier, and this week,

648
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:34,681
the hotel is hosting
its annual auction

649
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:36,724
of stolen antiquities.

650
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,395
All the big players
are already there.

651
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,355
Alia, Jabari.

652
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,774
This is the great man
who brought our family

653
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,693
to America during the war.

654
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,237
Quick, when was
the Suez Crisis?

655
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,781
1956.

656
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,616
Very impressive, Jabari.

657
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,202
My grandchildren watch
too much TV,

658
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,913
but they know their history.

659
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,209
They understand what it is
to be American and Egyptian.

660
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,254
I need a ride
to the airport, Sallah.

661
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,841
If you run, the police will
assume that you're guilty.

662
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,885
Without Helena or the Dial,

663
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,887
I'm gonna get framed
for murder.

664
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,681
Have you thought
about calling Marion?

665
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,100
She doesn't wanna talk to me.

666
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,482
Welcome to New York's

667
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,860
John F. Kennedy
International Airport.

668
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,988
The upper level is
for Pan American Airlines...

669
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,990
I took something else
from your apartment.

670
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,366
It was under the bed.

671
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,623
Thanks, Sallah.

672
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,668
I also brought my passport.

673
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,922
I could help you.

674
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,089
In Tangier?

675
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,799
Wherever chance takes us.

676
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:53,801
Indy, I...

677
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,179
I miss the desert.

678
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,056
I miss the sea.

679
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,392
And I miss waking up
every morning

680
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,977
wondering what
wonderful adventure

681
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:04,687
the new day will bring to us.

682
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,649
This is not
an adventure, Sallah.

683
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,694
Those days have come and gone.

684
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:12,904
Perhaps.

685
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,405
Perhaps not.

686
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,287
Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!

687
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,175
Champagne?

688
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,427
We've got four more hours
to Tangier.

689
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,603
Your scotch, sir.

690
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,230
Thanks.

691
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,530
Basil. Come on, Baz!

692
00:51:55,697 --> 00:51:57,448
- Open the door!
- No!

693
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,117
- Stay out, Indy!
- Open the door.

694
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,205
The Germans were right, Indy.

695
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,666
- Huh? What?
- It's too big. It's too much.

696
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,501
Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!

697
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,585
- Give me...
- No.

698
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:10,670
What are you doing?

699
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,022
You've listened
to nothing that I said.

700
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,840
I don't understand it, Baz!

701
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,173
Well, I was trying to
explain it to you downstairs.

702
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,510
You've just
ignored everything.

703
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,833
You're terrifying
your daughter.

704
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,849
Indy, Archimedes

705
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:25,226
discovered
a temporal meteorology.

706
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:28,062
Archimedes was
a mathematician, Baz,

707
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,439
not a magician.

708
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,066
He could predict
fissures in time.

709
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,776
Fissures in time?

710
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,196
- Baz, you can't prove that!
- Well, not yet.

711
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,240
Proving it
is what makes it science!

712
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,715
Oh, Baz.

713
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:58,968
I never should've
given you the thing.

714
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,179
It... It belongs in a museum.

715
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,806
Give it to me. Please.

716
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,770
If I give you this,

717
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,439
it must be destroyed.

718
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,025
I will.

719
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,071
I'll destroy it, Baz.

720
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:21,574
Promise.

721
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,207
I'm sorry about this.

722
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:30,583
It's all my fault.

723
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:34,253
- Are you gonna be here?
- Yes, sir.

724
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,422
Okay. I've gotta catch
an airplane.

725
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:39,384
If anyone finds the Grafikos,
they'll have both halves.

726
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:40,802
Some things
should stay buried.

727
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,886
I know, Baz.

728
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,179
It's vital
that you destroy it.

729
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,680
- I will, Baz.
- Do you understand?

730
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,450
- I'll destroy it. Yes.
- Say you will, Indy.

731
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:47,475
I will... Yes.

732
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,185
You promised me.
Remember that.

733
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,311
I will... I promise.

734
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:51,437
There's a reason,

735
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:54,107
a reason that Archimedes
broke it in two.

736
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,983
I know, Baz.

737
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,277
-Indy.

738
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,321
Thanks, Wombat.

739
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,448
He's gonna be all right
in a few days.

740
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:05,952
I'll call you
as soon as I land.

741
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,375
Ladies and gentlemen,

742
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,919
we are 20 minutes
from landing in Tangier.

743
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,139
- Stop drinking!
- What are you doing?

744
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:51,831
No more champagne!
How many more...

745
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:52,957
I'm staying.

746
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,500
Go home. Go home!

747
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,100
Rahim.

748
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,519
Miss Shaw, she's here.

749
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:18,941
Forged in bronze.

750
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,067
Nearly complete.

751
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,861
It is an astrological clock.

752
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:24,655
Dating third century BC

753
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,743
and built
by Archimedes himself.

754
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,205
All right,
let's start at 20,000.

755
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:33,456
20,000, thank you very much.

756
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:34,957
30. 30.

757
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,793
Gauges green, power full,

758
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,296
and when I reach 85, I rotate.

759
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,881
What next?

760
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,257
Louis, help him! He's so cute.

761
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,384
- Pull back on the yoke.
- did, man. I'm airborne.

762
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,469
Yeah, he's airborne.

763
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,905
- Can I have a sip?
- Do I pick up the flaps?

764
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:49,931
Don't touch the flaps
under 400 feet.

765
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,766
Decrease your pitch
to get to 120.

766
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:52,934
All right.

767
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,772
- Private auction, old timer.
- I've gotta get in there.

768
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,441
No password, no entry.
I don't make the rules.

769
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,379
And, uh,
what is the current bid?

770
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,405
- The bid is 50,000.
- Then I bid 55.

771
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,032
Who'll give me 60?

772
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,659
- 60.
- 60. 65?

773
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,077
65. 70?

774
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,495
- 75.
- 75. 80?

775
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,579
- 80.
- 85.

776
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:14,872
How about 90?

777
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,881
- This auction is private.
- This auction's over.

778
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,633
Au contraire,
it's hardly begun.

779
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,176
- 100.
- 100,000.

780
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,886
I like the hat, by the way.

781
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,447
Makes you look
at least two years younger.

782
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,639
Thanks.

783
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,783
- 110, bravo.
- I told you that

784
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,887
- this auction is over.
- Excuse me, who is this man?

785
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,453
- I'm her godfather.
- He's mildly related.

786
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,396
And she's up past her bedtime.

787
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:39,915
- Come on, Wombat.
- I wouldn't do that.

788
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,583
You want to explain it
to the cops at the bar?

789
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,942
The ones I paid off?

790
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,069
You're out of your depth,
Jonesy.

791
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,713
- "Jonesy"?
- He thinks I'm a criminal.

792
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,489
He's the one
wanted for murder.

793
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,700
Nice big picture
in the New York Herald. 130?

794
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,451
I didn't kill anyone.

795
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:53,595
No entry,
it's a private auction.

796
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,829
And you know it,
Helena.

797
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,499
But whoever did
was looking for this.

798
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,043
What you've got here
is Pandora's Box.

799
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,504
No, actually.

800
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,840
It's my box.

801
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,468
You.

802
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,305
Have we met?

803
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,598
No.

804
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,099
My memory
is a little fuzzy,

805
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,892
but your face rings a bell.

806
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,519
Are you still a Nazi?

807
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,817
You're confused.
My name is Schmidt.

808
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,570
Professor Schmidt
of Alabama University.

809
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,574
Professor Schmidt. How nice
to meet you in person.

810
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,200
150.

811
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,511
After our conversation,
Miss Shaw,

812
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,535
I thought we'd come to
an agreement about the Dial.

813
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,580
Funny. The last time

814
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,016
I saw the other guy
who looks like you,

815
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,791
he was also after this.

816
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,055
Your numbers were light,
Professor Schmidt.

817
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,045
But good news is, you're here
now. The bid is 160.

818
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,922
You don't seem
to understand, Miss Shaw.

819
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,299
This relic is my property.

820
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,885
- It's not yours. You stole it.
- Then you stole it.

821
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,696
And then I stole it.
It's called capitalism.

822
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,763
The bid is 160.

823
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:54,847
- 160.
- 170?

824
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,991
You should've
stayed in New York.

825
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,075
- 170?
- You should've stayed

826
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,894
- out of Poland.
- 170. Anyone? Anyone?

827
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,354
Going, going...

828
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:02,730
Gone!

829
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:04,357
Stay away!

830
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:07,109
Get the Dial.

831
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,782
Stay away!

832
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,084
Oh, hello, Claude.

833
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,647
You should not
have come back, Helena.

834
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:34,929
Get back.

835
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,649
Teddy!

836
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,164
Rahim says you stay.

837
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:14,969
Thank you.

838
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,525
See you in the past,
Dr. Jones.

839
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:57,553
It's my cab!

840
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,310
Tell them to back off.

841
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,853
I just told them to shoot you.

842
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,148
All right, guys.

843
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,901
Put the guns down.

844
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,277
Put 'em down.

845
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,238
All right.

846
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,200
That's better.

847
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,705
Oh, dear.

848
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:35,883
Rahim.

849
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,469
You're in pajamas.

850
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,638
I was sleeping, Helena.

851
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,806
- Mm-hmm.
- Peacefully.

852
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:42,890
Oh.

853
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,809
My father woke me.

854
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,603
He told me you'd
returned to our hotel.

855
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,357
Then he handed me
this scimitar

856
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:54,360
and told me to come home
with your head.

857
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,111
Huh.

858
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,488
Does it have to be that bit?

859
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,040
I thought maybe you returned
because you loved me.

860
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,333
Rahim,

861
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,669
I had an item to sell.

862
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,712
Excuse me. The item
she's talking about

863
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:14,856
- actually belongs to me.
- No.

864
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,233
You do not need to intrude
in this conversation.

865
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:17,442
And some very bad people,
worse people...

866
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:18,735
You do not need to get
involved with my business.

867
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,278
- ...have run off with it.
- Is this your new man?

868
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,012
- No. No, no, no, no.
- It's complicated.

869
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,849
What exactly
do you owe this guy?

870
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,101
Just some bail money
and a lifetime of happiness.

871
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,936
I presume you sold the ring.

872
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,872
It didn't go for as much
as I thought it would.

873
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:31,939
I'll do it!

874
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,107
What are you... Hey!

875
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,948
You just got me killed!

876
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,701
Well, I'm not the one that's
engaged to a mobster!

877
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,787
I don't need morality lessons
from an aging grave robber!

878
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,163
I'm not a grave robber.

879
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,332
Your father and I
did important work together.

880
01:01:53,002 --> 01:01:54,646
Don't tell me
all your escapades were noble,

881
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,297
selfless quests.
You did it for the buzz!

882
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:00,050
Oh, good work, Teddy!

883
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,220
- Move over, kid.
- Hey!

884
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,816
- Helena!
- Back up! Back up!

885
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:34,710
Not this way!

886
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,521
You don't know where you're
going, Indy! Listen to him.

887
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,065
- He knows this town!
- I know Tangier!

888
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,427
There he is!

889
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,684
Faster. Go faster!

890
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,770
Ten minutes
to the airport, boss.

891
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,106
I'm not sure
Professor Schmidt

892
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,550
is an actual professor,
by the way.

893
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,859
- He's a Nazi!
- Turn left!

894
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:00,486
Turn left! Turn left!

895
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:01,737
- Oh, no!
- No!

896
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,379
Helena! Don't do this!

897
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:27,888
- Hey, this way!
- That way!

898
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:29,848
No!

899
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,309
Helena!

900
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,479
No!

901
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,615
What the hell?

902
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,498
Helena!

903
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,335
Hey! Hey!

904
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,504
What the hell?

905
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,258
Come on!

906
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,888
Come on. Come on!

907
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:45,632
You think
he'd be proud of this?

908
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,551
Who?

909
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,012
Your father!

910
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:53,140
His only daughter selling
her soul for bail money!

911
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:54,826
Sounds quite cool
when you put it like that.

912
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,477
And it's not all bail money.

913
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,853
Some of it's gambling debt

914
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,080
- and some...
- Thank you, Teddy.

915
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:00,898
Helena! No!

916
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:01,982
Helena!

917
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,569
How did you end up like this?

918
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,071
Well, you mean resourceful?

919
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,573
Daring? Beautiful?
Self-sufficient?

920
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,959
Whoa!

921
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,350
Hold on!

922
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,437
Go this way!

923
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:50,823
There he is.

924
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,044
Stop!

925
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:05,921
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop!

926
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,259
Aah!

927
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,810
On the left!

928
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:21,937
Take the wheel, Teddy!

929
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,190
What are you doing?

930
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:26,900
Getting what's mine.

931
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,861
Helena!

932
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,200
Damn it! You crazy?

933
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,163
Hey! Helena!

934
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,751
- Take the gun!
- Miss Shaw.

935
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,838
Let go, Miss Shaw!

936
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,695
Let go.

937
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,156
Come on! Give me the Dial!

938
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:16,950
Helena!

939
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:19,786
Damn.

940
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:27,729
Turn back! They went that way!

941
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,754
He's gone!

942
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,672
- Move over!
- Hey!

943
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,054
I didn't come here to
rescue you from your fiancé!

944
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,138
Rescue me?

945
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,937
I just want the Dial back.

946
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:05,999
Put your hands
above your head.

947
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,605
Not the smoothest
break-up I ever had.

948
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:09,949
If your father
was still alive...

949
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,046
Well, he's not, Indy.

950
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,649
Hey, something's wrong
with the engine.

951
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:13,983
If only there'd been
someone there for me,

952
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,509
some father figure, someone

953
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,719
specifically anointed
for the job.

954
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:19,206
You have no idea
about the kind...

955
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,323
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

956
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,391
I mean,
what even is a godfather?

957
01:08:23,392 --> 01:08:25,435
Anyway, family never
was your strong suit.

958
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:28,438
- What is the time, by the way?
- It's...

959
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,606
Hey, no fair.

960
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,358
Give me that back.

961
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,651
That was my father's watch!

962
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,071
Give it back to him.

963
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,094
You're gonna have
to leave town with me.

964
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,620
Rahim will be
looking for you too.

965
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,056
They'll go to
Tangier airport first,

966
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,140
so we'll need to catch a train

967
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,404
and get a plane
from Casablanca.

968
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,419
Whoa. What was that?

969
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,424
Ah.

970
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,508
Damn.

971
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,012
Yeah.

972
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,221
I know, sir.

973
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:04,433
Yes...

974
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:06,685
Copy.

975
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,066
They pulled the plug.

976
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,526
You got them scared.

977
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,101
Because they don't understand.

978
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,738
No. Because your associates

979
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:19,156
killed three
American civilians

980
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:21,575
and blew up
a nationally televised parade.

981
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:22,909
Because you stood up

982
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,703
the President
of the United States,

983
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,038
ran to Morocco,

984
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,582
and created an incident that
required military extraction!

985
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,478
Then take me to DC,
and I will explain it all.

986
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,920
They want you to vanish.

987
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,214
We have half the Dial now.

988
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,941
They were just trying
to keep you happy,

989
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,385
letting you chase that thing.

990
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:41,595
They never cared about it.

991
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,763
They will, Miss Mason,

992
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,473
when they understand
what it can do.

993
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:45,766
You put them
on the moon.

994
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:47,726
They got what they wanted.

995
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:50,937
All right, buckle up.
We're landing in Spain.

996
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:53,565
C-9 transport will take you
from there to Maxwell.

997
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,192
I'm not going back to Alabama!

998
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,611
All we need is a vessel to
take us to the Mediterranean.

999
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,756
The Grafikos
will take us to the other...

1000
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,865
Please, Miss Mason. Please.

1001
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,075
Let go of me, Schmidt.

1002
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,868
I'm asking you personally.

1003
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,204
You're a piece of work, Doc.

1004
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:09,748
Hey!

1005
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,277
Schmidt...

1006
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,822
My name is Voller.

1007
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:45,992
Jurgen Voller.

1008
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:01,049
That's a Sea Stallion.

1009
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,634
American helicopter.

1010
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:05,345
Did you know
the Wright Brothers?

1011
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,264
- What?
- The Wright Brothers.

1012
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,515
Orville and Wilbur.

1013
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,934
They invented the airplane,
and they lived in Indiana.

1014
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,644
Wilbur was born in Indiana.

1015
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:15,230
I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.

1016
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,941
And the Wright Brothers were
born during the Civil War.

1017
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:20,235
Oh, I thought maybe you went
to school with them.

1018
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:24,114
Oh, come on, Indy.
That was funny.

1019
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:25,574
- "Funny"?
- Mm-hmm.

1020
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,534
I'm stuck in Tangier

1021
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,953
with a broken tuk-tuk
and two thieves.

1022
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,329
I'm wanted for murder.

1023
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,415
Nazis have
half of Archimedes' Dial

1024
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:35,000
and your father's notebooks.

1025
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,377
I have a copy.

1026
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,671
Dad's notebooks.
I made a copy.

1027
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,673
Where?

1028
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,717
You memorized five notebooks?

1029
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:45,093
Seven. And of course not.

1030
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,887
Half of them were
as dull as ditch water.

1031
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:50,182
Just the really
important bits.

1032
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,058
Like what?

1033
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,677
The location of the Grafikos.

1034
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,520
Nobody knows
where the Grafikos is.

1035
01:11:55,687 --> 01:11:57,022
- Dad did.
- No, he didn't.

1036
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:58,389
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

1037
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,150
- Yes, he did.
- What's a Grafikos?

1038
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,752
It's directions
to the rest of the Dial.

1039
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:03,337
Ask her if she knows
what language it's in.

1040
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,363
Ah! It isn't in a language.
It's in a code.

1041
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,740
What code?

1042
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,366
Archimedes used two codes.

1043
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,076
Linear B and Polybius Square.

1044
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,870
So, even if you find
the Grafikos,

1045
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,580
without me, you can't read it.

1046
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,415
Please.

1047
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:17,417
Dad taught me Polybius
when I was nine.

1048
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,304
Used to leave little notes
around the house.

1049
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:20,337
"Tidy your room."

1050
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,713
"Stay away from my brandy."

1051
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:23,882
What if it's Linear B?

1052
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,218
50 quid it's Polybius.

1053
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,386
Give me that.

1054
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,471
Hey.

1055
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,097
That won't work.

1056
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,545
Moroccan chewing gum's made
from the sap of the Manilkara.

1057
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,976
Heat resistant.

1058
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:37,687
Try and start it.

1059
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,777
- Start it.
- I am.

1060
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,447
Huh? Huh?

1061
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:49,741
- Huh?
- It won't hold.

1062
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,826
It'll get us
to the train station.

1063
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,119
"Us"?

1064
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,496
- You going home?
- No.

1065
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,456
I'm going to Casablanca.

1066
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,375
Then I'm gonna hop a plane
to the Aegean.

1067
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,459
Just like you.

1068
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,562
What makes you think
we're going to the Aegean?

1069
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,673
You gotta get to the Grafikos
before the Nazis.

1070
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,925
Archimedes was
surrounded by Romans.

1071
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,843
Where else would it be?

1072
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,011
The Aegean is huge, Indy.

1073
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:11,378
And you don't
have coordinates.

1074
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,014
And you don't have a boat.

1075
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,353
I've got an old friend
in Greece.

1076
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,896
An expert diver.

1077
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,898
With a big, beautiful boat

1078
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,109
that'll get us there
before they will.

1079
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:27,028
You need me,

1080
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:28,405
and you know it.

1081
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:19,789
Renny!

1082
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:22,917
Indy?

1083
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:24,794
Indy!

1084
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,218
So, that's the expert diver?

1085
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,596
Spain's greatest frogman.

1086
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:38,391
Hey!

1087
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,644
So, Spain's greatest frogman
has a shit boat

1088
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,020
and only one good frog leg?

1089
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:43,229
Stop it.

1090
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,234
You got
a different boat.

1091
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,527
Stop it.

1092
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:04,834
We're going here.

1093
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:08,922
Where they found the first
part of the Antikythera.

1094
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,007
But...

1095
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,635
We're going deeper.

1096
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,222
Dad tracked down
the old sponge diver

1097
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,932
who found the Dial.

1098
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:20,266
He told him

1099
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,395
that the wrecked Roman ship
broke up under the sea

1100
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,688
70 feet below.

1101
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,816
Filled with the skeletons
of over 100 centurions.

1102
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,151
That's where they found it.

1103
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:34,823
But he said that most
of the ship had broken off

1104
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,741
and sunk to the ocean floor.

1105
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,285
Too deep for sponge divers.

1106
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:43,164
So, Dad started wondering
why a Roman warship

1107
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:46,710
would sail out of Syracuse
with 100 centurions on board.

1108
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:53,800
They weren't taking
half a Dial for a joyride.

1109
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,222
They had the Grafikos...

1110
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,269
and they were looking
for the rest of the Dial.

1111
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,190
Your dad was a genius.

1112
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:10,859
Yeah.

1113
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,319
He was.

1114
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,174
Seven of spades.

1115
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:38,553
How do you do that?

1116
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,138
Wow.

1117
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,431
Do it again.

1118
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,312
Pick a card, Dr. Jones.

1119
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:55,945
Seven of spades!

1120
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,115
She's magic.

1121
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:00,450
Trick deck.

1122
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:01,618
No.

1123
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:04,204
I force the card.

1124
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,663
I offer the mark,

1125
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,998
you,

1126
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,166
the feeling of a choice,

1127
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,543
but ultimately, I make you
pick the card I want.

1128
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,838
"The mark."

1129
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,802
Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.

1130
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,720
I have to check the lines.

1131
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:27,852
Good night.

1132
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,108
You remember seeing any dates
in your father's notebooks?

1133
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:36,820
Dates?

1134
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,279
What dates?

1135
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:40,198
These dates.

1136
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,371
Written over and over again
in this letter.

1137
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,624
August 20th, 1969.

1138
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,334
That's three days from now.

1139
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,753
And the same date in 1939.

1140
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,339
Two weeks before
Hitler invades Poland.

1141
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,759
Wait.

1142
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:02,887
Now you believe the Dial
has magical powers?

1143
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,224
I don't believe in magic,
Wombat.

1144
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,478
But a few times in my life,
I've seen things.

1145
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,358
Things I can't explain.

1146
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:19,070
And I've come to believe
it's not so much

1147
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:21,364
what you believe.

1148
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,783
It's how hard you believe it.

1149
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,246
I've seen things too, Indy.

1150
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,708
The only thing
worth believing in, ever,

1151
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,543
is cash.

1152
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:36,921
Right.

1153
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,039
What if you could
go back in time?

1154
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,223
What would you do?

1155
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,018
Witness the Trojan War?

1156
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,645
Check in on Cleopatra?

1157
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:58,401
I'd stop my son
from enlisting.

1158
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,281
Did he sign up to please you?

1159
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,576
No, he signed up
to piss me off.

1160
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,748
How would you
have stopped him?

1161
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,463
I'd tell him
he was gonna die.

1162
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,388
I'd tell him
that his mother would...

1163
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,851
find no end to her grief.

1164
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,438
And that his father
would be...

1165
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,193
helpless to console her.

1166
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:45,990
And that the loss would put
an end to their marriage.

1167
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,214
You're still wearing the ring.

1168
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,235
Mm.

1169
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,321
Promising.

1170
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:35,456
More promising.

1171
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:42,338
Hello.

1172
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:46,551
Get your gear on.
They're waiting.

1173
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,265
Hey.

1174
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,267
Come here.

1175
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:56,477
Okay.

1176
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:57,621
I'm gonna show you something.

1177
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:00,648
Gosh, this looks important.

1178
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:03,818
Around the rope...

1179
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,029
Now, we are going deep.

1180
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,032
Descend fast, and breathe
through these hoses.

1181
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,241
Okay?

1182
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,035
Ah, stay separate.

1183
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,162
No crisscross. All right?

1184
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,496
We cannot stay long.

1185
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:19,000
I have a method that
usually prevents the bends.

1186
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,127
- Usually?
- Yeah.

1187
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,420
I call it "the bounce."

1188
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:23,588
You know, fast down,

1189
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:25,673
three minutes on the bottom,
and then up.

1190
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,883
Three minutes!

1191
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,885
No one more second.

1192
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,804
- Three minutes.
- Yeah, that's right.

1193
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,811
- Where is my lighter?
- I don't know, capitán.

1194
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,975
We have to go.

1195
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,771
Uh, quick question.

1196
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,272
What's that?

1197
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:42,815
- They're sharks?
- No.

1198
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:45,276
No, no. No sharks here. Eels.

1199
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,654
- Eels?
- Anguilas.

1200
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:49,739
Most are small.

1201
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:51,491
Sometimes they are big.
Two meters.

1202
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,701
But if you see them,
stay still.

1203
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:57,080
They bite you,
they lock the jaw. Yeah.

1204
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,664
They look like snakes.

1205
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,374
No, they don't.

1206
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,627
Private Brandy
reporting for duty.

1207
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,128
You're not coming, Teddy?

1208
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:06,005
I can't swim.

1209
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,298
Lucky him.

1210
01:22:07,465 --> 01:22:08,758
Everyone can swim.

1211
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:12,512
Reach and pull.
Reach and pull.

1212
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:15,640
All right.
You stay here

1213
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,016
with Hector
and watch our lines.

1214
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:21,938
It is time, camarada.

1215
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,297
Two minutes?

1216
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:25,556
Hey.

1217
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:58,422
Hurry up!

1218
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,980
Helena!

1219
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:24,740
Come on.

1220
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,450
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

1221
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,494
That's it.

1222
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,018
Who are these people?

1223
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:56,272
Nazis.

1224
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,816
First, you return my Dial,
Dr. Jones,

1225
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,111
and now,
you bring me the Grafikos.

1226
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,197
I'm very happy you're not
wasting in retirement.

1227
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,950
I should have retired you
when I had the chance.

1228
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,243
Where are your sponsors?

1229
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,995
I'm on my own now.

1230
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:12,830
Things move forward,
Dr. Jones.

1231
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:13,914
And sometimes...

1232
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,585
they go backward.

1233
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:23,090
Now, let's get comfortable
and have a little talk.

1234
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,535
What language is that?

1235
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:53,287
It's not a language.

1236
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:55,623
It's a code.

1237
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:57,458
Polybius.

1238
01:28:58,292 --> 01:28:59,585
You owe me 50 quid.

1239
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,714
Not familiar
with Polybius cipher?

1240
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:04,882
No.

1241
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:07,051
But it appears you are.

1242
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,640
Read it, please.

1243
01:29:20,773 --> 01:29:21,774
No.

1244
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,531
Indy...

1245
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:40,918
Feeling helpful now?

1246
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,172
I am.

1247
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,593
I know this stuff backwards.

1248
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,844
No!

1249
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,430
Sorry, Indy.

1250
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,224
I don't do noble death.

1251
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:56,976
Just

1252
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,561
cold, hard maths.

1253
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,943
I crack the code,
help you find the other half.

1254
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:03,983
One hundred grand. Cash.

1255
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,150
Helena...

1256
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:06,819
Take it or leave it.

1257
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,363
You have a deal.

1258
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,670
He'll never pay you.

1259
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,573
I think
you will find this is worth

1260
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,091
more than your asking price.

1261
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:40,102
- Teddy.
- Helena,

1262
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:41,437
don't do this.

1263
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:48,277
Let's see what we've got here.

1264
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:51,822
"My Makhana..."

1265
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:53,324
that's "machine"...

1266
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:58,120
"lies with me,
in the city I left.

1267
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,664
"Where wolves
teach men to walk.

1268
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:04,960
"Under one of nine, I lie."

1269
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,506
Only one thing
lies anywhere forever.

1270
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:12,384
The dead. So, if the Dial lies
with him, then...

1271
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:15,763
then this is directions
to his tomb.

1272
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,598
The Tomb of Archimedes?

1273
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:20,809
Undiscovered
for two millennia.

1274
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:25,981
"The city I left."

1275
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:28,651
Archimedes lived two places
his entire life,

1276
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:30,069
so he only left one.

1277
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,946
Anyone? At the back?

1278
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,366
Come on, Indy.
Everyone knows this.

1279
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,368
- Even this clown.
- Alexandria.

1280
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,870
Full marks.

1281
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:42,498
Now, "wolf"
in Greek is "lycos."

1282
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:44,917
Root of the word
"lycaeum" or "school."

1283
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:47,711
And the Doric
for "walking" is...

1284
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:49,963
"peripatio."

1285
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:54,009
Which also happens to be
the word for...

1286
01:31:55,344 --> 01:31:56,595
Aw.

1287
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,225
I thought you were
a bright spark.

1288
01:32:03,811 --> 01:32:06,939
"Peripatio" means "walking,"

1289
01:32:07,106 --> 01:32:09,525
but it also means "counting."

1290
01:32:09,692 --> 01:32:12,820
So, "Where wolves
teach men to walk"

1291
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,864
- could be...
- The School of Mathematics.

1292
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,784
Is correct.

1293
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,494
Now, the next bit is easy.

1294
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:23,372
"Beneath one of nine"?

1295
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,874
There are nine Muses.

1296
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,167
The Museon.

1297
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,795
The Greek word for the
Great Library of Alexandria.

1298
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:31,004
Which, as we all know,

1299
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:33,757
has nine statues
supporting its roof.

1300
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:34,925
May I?

1301
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:37,219
Thank you.

1302
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:41,140
The nine Muses,
in reverse order,

1303
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,101
are Calliope,

1304
01:32:44,852 --> 01:32:45,853
Urania,

1305
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,480
Polymnia,

1306
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,983
- Erato...
- Polymnia.

1307
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,569
...and Meli whasisname,

1308
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:54,945
that other one,

1309
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:56,697
Thalia,

1310
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:58,657
Euteroe,

1311
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,909
but the first is...

1312
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,161
Clio.

1313
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:05,164
The Muse of history and time.

1314
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,540
That Archimedes,

1315
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:08,017
- what a clever bugger.
- The entrance

1316
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:10,169
to the tomb is by
the School of Mathematics,

1317
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,045
under a statue of Clio,

1318
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,965
in the ruins of the Great
Library of Alexandria.

1319
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,425
Gold star for Dr. Brains.

1320
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,802
Teddy!

1321
01:33:28,729 --> 01:33:30,314
The Grafikos, get it!

1322
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,677
I have said it before,
and I will say it again!

1323
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:03,472
When you're
in a tight spot, dynamite.

1324
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:06,767
My friend was just murdered.

1325
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,273
Sorry.

1326
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,192
You told them everything.

1327
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:17,986
Word for word.

1328
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:20,531
But Archimedes
didn't make it that easy.

1329
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,242
The tomb isn't in Alexandria.

1330
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,293
Go!

1331
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:37,756
So, what do you see?

1332
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,217
Polybius square.

1333
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:41,885
Made of?

1334
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:45,639
Wax and wood.

1335
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:48,517
Anything else?

1336
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:52,980
It's heavy.

1337
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:57,150
Too heavy.

1338
01:34:59,278 --> 01:35:00,404
Give me that.

1339
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:42,321
This is solid gold?

1340
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:43,697
Ancient gold.

1341
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:46,199
From the Nile.

1342
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:48,869
Hold it, Teddy.

1343
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,465
Sell this thing

1344
01:36:01,632 --> 01:36:03,300
and we are out of the hole
and then some.

1345
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:04,384
I have just the customer.

1346
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:05,928
Cranky, old Duchess
in Gibraltar...

1347
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:07,971
This is going in a museum.

1348
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:12,142
Take the wheel, Teddy.

1349
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,025
What does it say?

1350
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:25,030
"Search where Dionysius

1351
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:28,575
"hears each whisper

1352
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,453
"like a hurricane."

1353
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,707
The Ear.

1354
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,210
The cave of Dionysius.

1355
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:40,045
Where is that?

1356
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:42,547
In Sicily.

1357
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:46,134
- How much fuel have we got?
- It's full.

1358
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,144
They're heading west.

1359
01:36:57,521 --> 01:36:58,522
Not east.

1360
01:37:27,467 --> 01:37:29,594
- I want the papaya.
- How much is it?

1361
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:34,057
Take this.

1362
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,979
Look at that kid
with the straw hat.

1363
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:41,064
This way.

1364
01:37:44,651 --> 01:37:45,652
Hey.

1365
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:49,156
What do you think?

1366
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:56,204
What are we doing?

1367
01:37:57,831 --> 01:37:59,499
Waiting for closing time
at the caves.

1368
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:01,168
It's crawling with tourists.

1369
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:03,754
Okay, so he's, like,
running the show now?

1370
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,548
He's not running
the show, Teddy.

1371
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:11,053
I just thought we were in this
for all the wrong reasons.

1372
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:12,804
We are.

1373
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:17,267
Most assuredly.

1374
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:20,103
You know he's never gonna
let us sell any of that stuff.

1375
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,273
I'm still in charge, Teddy.

1376
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,399
Helena,
get over here!

1377
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:25,484
Give me a hand!

1378
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:32,532
Oh, you splurged.

1379
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:34,910
Here's your backpack.

1380
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,036
Where's the kid?

1381
01:38:49,966 --> 01:38:51,551
Hey, watch it!

1382
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:52,886
What's wrong
with you?

1383
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:22,582
Hello.

1384
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,001
Hey.

1385
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:29,005
Let me go!

1386
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:31,341
Let me go!

1387
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:41,893
Get off me! Let me go!

1388
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,231
Hey, hey, hey!

1389
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,160
Helena!

1390
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:00,954
They've got Teddy.

1391
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:04,666
They took him
up the hill somewhere.

1392
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,552
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1393
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:25,929
What are they
gonna do to him?

1394
01:40:26,021 --> 01:40:28,690
He knows about the Ear,
what the Grafikos says.

1395
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,526
They're not gonna hurt him.

1396
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:32,861
They're gonna use him

1397
01:40:33,612 --> 01:40:35,864
to get the other half
of the Dial.

1398
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:36,990
We gotta get there first.

1399
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:54,216
Colonizing queens
built many cities in Sicily.

1400
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:55,884
- The temple...
- Let's go.

1401
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:59,095
...is the oldest
of the Greek temples.

1402
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,556
The cave's over there.

1403
01:41:11,942 --> 01:41:13,693
Could we go
a little faster, please?

1404
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:24,371
The Ear of Dionysius.

1405
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,088
Wow.

1406
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,020
"Search where Dionysius hears

1407
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:50,814
"each whisper
like a hurricane."

1408
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,024
That's some echo.

1409
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:57,362
Keep making noise till we
find out where it's loudest.

1410
01:42:14,796 --> 01:42:15,964
Stop.

1411
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,681
This is it.

1412
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:31,146
Greek pediment.

1413
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:32,814
An entrance.

1414
01:42:34,232 --> 01:42:35,233
Used to be.

1415
01:42:38,528 --> 01:42:39,529
A crescent.

1416
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:43,491
Just like on the Grafikos.

1417
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,917
I think there's
an opening up there.

1418
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:00,550
You okay up there?

1419
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:02,886
Yes.

1420
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:06,431
You're not moving.

1421
01:43:08,933 --> 01:43:10,143
I'm thinking.

1422
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:13,980
About?

1423
01:43:15,148 --> 01:43:18,068
About what the hell I'm doing
up here, 40 feet in the air,

1424
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,986
with crap shoulders,

1425
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:21,946
crumbling vertebrae,

1426
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:24,616
a plate in one leg,
screws in the other.

1427
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,034
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

1428
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:27,786
No, you don't get it.

1429
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,829
You're half my age.

1430
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:33,541
You haven't been forced
to drink the blood of Kali.

1431
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:34,959
No. Fair enough.

1432
01:43:35,794 --> 01:43:37,545
Or been tortured with voodoo.

1433
01:43:38,922 --> 01:43:39,923
And I'm just guessing,

1434
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:41,806
but I don't think
you've been shot nine times,

1435
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:44,302
including once by your father.

1436
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:47,389
Dad shot you?

1437
01:43:48,098 --> 01:43:49,265
Don't talk to me.

1438
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:50,632
Just go ahead.
I'll follow you.

1439
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:01,945
No, no, no. We are close.
We are close.

1440
01:44:02,112 --> 01:44:03,113
Look around you.

1441
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,839
- We are close.
- The Cave of Dionysius.

1442
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,826
No, no, no. The cave
is closed for renovation.

1443
01:44:08,827 --> 01:44:09,828
Oh.

1444
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:10,954
Let me ask again.

1445
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:12,956
Where is
the Cave of Dionysius?

1446
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,769
What's the matter?
You worried about the kid?

1447
01:44:36,062 --> 01:44:37,730
Are you sure
they won't hurt him?

1448
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:39,107
He'll be fine.

1449
01:44:39,274 --> 01:44:40,316
He's smart.

1450
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:43,570
Where'd you find him?

1451
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:47,407
He, uh... He tried to steal
my purse outside a casino

1452
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,951
in Marrakesh when he was 10.

1453
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:51,953
I hit him repeatedly
with my car door,

1454
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,622
but he didn't let go
and neither did I.

1455
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,332
So, been together ever since.

1456
01:44:57,459 --> 01:44:59,419
Thought you were
all about the money.

1457
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:01,546
I am.

1458
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:06,468
Nobody memorizes every page

1459
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:08,678
of their
dead father's notebooks

1460
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:09,929
for the money.

1461
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:18,021
Herr Voller!

1462
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:29,574
They went that way.

1463
01:45:39,918 --> 01:45:41,669
Why?

1464
01:45:44,881 --> 01:45:46,716
Come on, come on.

1465
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:50,386
Let's go.

1466
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:56,100
Oh, my...

1467
01:45:59,145 --> 01:46:00,647
Oh, my God!

1468
01:46:01,481 --> 01:46:02,815
Oh, my God!

1469
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:04,400
- Oh, God!
- No, no.

1470
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:06,694
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1471
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:12,867
Are they off me? Get 'em off!

1472
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:14,619
- No, no. Wait.
- Get 'em off!

1473
01:46:27,674 --> 01:46:28,758
What is that?

1474
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,221
Methane.

1475
01:46:34,264 --> 01:46:35,473
Don't breathe.

1476
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,641
Don't breathe?

1477
01:46:40,353 --> 01:46:41,729
We've gotta get outta here.

1478
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:51,573
Athena.

1479
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:54,617
Goddess of war.

1480
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:58,705
And reason.

1481
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,377
"Under the moon...

1482
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:08,673
"life lies at her feet."

1483
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:17,765
Water displacement.

1484
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:19,892
Get in the pool!

1485
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:22,061
Why?
Help me open the door.

1486
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:23,855
Well, they didn't
get out the doors!

1487
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:24,939
Get in the pool!

1488
01:47:25,982 --> 01:47:27,859
Okay, I'm getting in the pool.

1489
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,152
Help me.

1490
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:33,906
Archimedes was fascinated

1491
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:37,368
by water displacement!

1492
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:52,216
Whoa!

1493
01:48:18,368 --> 01:48:20,662
Hey! Get back here! Klaber!

1494
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,052
You don't need to do that.

1495
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:03,162
Hey!

1496
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:06,290
Give me that!

1497
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,793
No!

1498
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:16,634
Leave them.

1499
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:18,970
I said leave them.

1500
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:44,954
Reach and pull.

1501
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:46,706
Reach and pull.

1502
01:49:46,873 --> 01:49:49,041
Reach and pull.

1503
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:19,030
Archimedes' tomb.

1504
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,268
Grab that corner.

1505
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,607
Indy.

1506
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:40,278
This frieze...

1507
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:44,198
It's a phoenix.

1508
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:45,366
A common icon.

1509
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,118
No. Look,
it isn't.

1510
01:51:48,703 --> 01:51:50,413
This phoenix has propellers.

1511
01:51:59,297 --> 01:52:00,756
What's this doing here?

1512
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:12,560
Clocks won't be invented
for 1,000 years,

1513
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:14,687
much less watches.

1514
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:18,441
Archimedes used it.

1515
01:52:21,986 --> 01:52:23,362
Dad was right.

1516
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,031
It works.

1517
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:26,741
Of course it works,
Miss Shaw.

1518
01:52:29,452 --> 01:52:30,703
Mathematics works.

1519
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:34,832
As it conquered space,
it will conquer time.

1520
01:52:42,715 --> 01:52:44,634
You've already
lost your son, Dr. Jones.

1521
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,801
Your wife is gone.

1522
01:52:45,885 --> 01:52:47,803
Do you really
want to lose your godchild?

1523
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:51,974
For what?

1524
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:54,560
A world that no longer cares
about men like us.

1525
01:53:05,905 --> 01:53:06,906
Thank you.

1526
01:53:45,611 --> 01:53:46,988
History's greatest moment.

1527
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:55,371
Its end.

1528
01:54:03,045 --> 01:54:04,046
Throw me the gun!

1529
01:54:14,432 --> 01:54:16,684
- Get him outta here.
- Teddy.

1530
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:18,853
Teddy! Teddy!

1531
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,062
Come on! Go!

1532
01:54:20,146 --> 01:54:21,147
This way. Come on.

1533
01:54:25,234 --> 01:54:26,777
Go!

1534
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:31,365
Indy!

1535
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:34,535
Go!

1536
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:35,953
Go!

1537
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,204
Stop!

1538
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:42,001
Now what?

1539
01:54:43,627 --> 01:54:44,628
Bring him.

1540
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,721
Helena, come on!

1541
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:55,181
Teddy, we can't
just leave him.

1542
01:54:55,264 --> 01:54:56,599
We're not! Follow me!

1543
01:54:58,559 --> 01:54:59,560
Come on!

1544
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:04,565
Come on.

1545
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:20,706
Teddy. Come on.
We've got a car.

1546
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:26,587
Ah, crap.

1547
01:55:32,802 --> 01:55:33,844
Stay there.

1548
01:55:52,738 --> 01:55:53,739
Hop on.

1549
01:55:57,368 --> 01:56:00,287
The first hemisphere
sets the destination.

1550
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:05,376
The second calculates
the location of the fissure

1551
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:08,462
in Alexandrine coordinates.

1552
01:56:09,046 --> 01:56:11,924
Have Messner transpose this
to longitude and latitude,

1553
01:56:12,967 --> 01:56:14,844
and transmit way points
to the pilots.

1554
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:28,482
Shortcut.

1555
01:56:32,778 --> 01:56:35,739
You got coordinates for 37.07.

1556
01:56:35,823 --> 01:56:37,158
So, who is it?

1557
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,160
Churchill?

1558
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:41,495
Ike?

1559
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:46,333
Who are you gonna kill
to win the war?

1560
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:50,045
In a few minutes,
with the help of Archimedes,

1561
01:56:50,212 --> 01:56:52,089
we shall fly
into the eye of this storm

1562
01:56:52,882 --> 01:56:55,134
and cross into
Sicilian airspace

1563
01:56:55,301 --> 01:56:58,804
on August 20th, 1939.

1564
01:56:59,555 --> 01:57:01,390
We will head north
over friendly skies

1565
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:03,100
with enough fuel
to reach Munich.

1566
01:57:04,393 --> 01:57:06,020
My quarry
will be waiting for me

1567
01:57:06,562 --> 01:57:09,023
at 16 Prinzregentenplatz

1568
01:57:09,398 --> 01:57:11,609
for an update
on his V-1 rocket.

1569
01:57:18,616 --> 01:57:22,578
What kind of Nazi
kills the Führer?

1570
01:57:24,205 --> 01:57:26,874
The kind that believes
in victory, Dr. Jones.

1571
01:57:32,129 --> 01:57:35,966
Hitler lit a fire that could
have burned 1,000 years.

1572
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,635
I saw every mistake.

1573
01:57:38,427 --> 01:57:39,720
Every blunder.

1574
01:57:39,887 --> 01:57:41,555
And I will correct them all.

1575
01:57:41,722 --> 01:57:44,350
History is a long list
of losses, Dr. Jones.

1576
01:57:45,392 --> 01:57:46,644
It's just a question of whose.

1577
01:57:59,323 --> 01:58:00,616
Stop!

1578
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:14,315
Teddy.

1579
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:17,510
You think you can fly
one of those?

1580
01:59:19,153 --> 01:59:20,154
A Nord?

1581
01:59:22,865 --> 01:59:23,866
Sure.

1582
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:25,743
It's not a ringing response.

1583
01:59:25,909 --> 01:59:27,536
Well, I haven't flown a Nord.

1584
01:59:27,703 --> 01:59:29,246
You've never flown any plane.

1585
01:59:30,456 --> 01:59:32,249
I'll get it started.

1586
01:59:32,416 --> 01:59:33,667
No, Teddy.

1587
01:59:34,835 --> 01:59:35,836
Crap.

1588
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,823
Fasten
your seat belt, Dr. Jones.

1589
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:06,283
There might be
some turbulence.

1590
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:09,745
You're German, Voller.

1591
02:00:09,912 --> 02:00:11,914
Don't try and be funny.

1592
02:00:35,312 --> 02:00:37,147
Come on, big talker.

1593
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:52,955
Okay.

1594
02:01:09,805 --> 02:01:11,390
Okay. Okay.

1595
02:01:11,557 --> 02:01:14,101
Gauges green. Power full.

1596
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:17,271
And when I reach 85, I rotate.

1597
02:01:55,017 --> 02:01:56,435
Okay, wings down.

1598
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,522
Okay, 84 miles an hour.

1599
02:02:00,981 --> 02:02:02,065
Rotate.

1600
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:11,176
Time to destination?

1601
02:03:12,386 --> 02:03:13,929
60 seconds.

1602
02:03:19,268 --> 02:03:20,727
Continental drift.

1603
02:03:24,147 --> 02:03:25,357
Continental drift!

1604
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:29,695
Archimedes didn't know
about continental drift.

1605
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:32,698
He couldn't have!

1606
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:34,700
It hadn't been observed yet.

1607
02:03:35,701 --> 02:03:37,494
You're off target.

1608
02:03:37,953 --> 02:03:39,830
Your coordinates
are based on markers

1609
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:43,792
that have been moving
for 2,000 years!

1610
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:46,795
You could be off
by 10 degrees, by...

1611
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:03,937
30 seconds.

1612
02:04:05,105 --> 02:04:06,106
Herr Voller...

1613
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:08,233
Your calculations are wrong!

1614
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:11,236
- Herr Voller...
- Will you shut up?

1615
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,321
I'm thinking!

1616
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:16,282
20 seconds.

1617
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:20,078
Hold the flight path!

1618
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:23,373
15 seconds.

1619
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:28,962
I don't know
where we're going, Jürgen.

1620
02:04:29,046 --> 02:04:30,047
10 seconds.

1621
02:04:30,172 --> 02:04:31,172
9!

1622
02:04:31,214 --> 02:04:32,758
But it sure as hell

1623
02:04:33,175 --> 02:04:34,635
- 7!
- ...ain't 1939!

1624
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:35,427
6!

1625
02:04:35,594 --> 02:04:36,594
Turn around!

1626
02:04:37,721 --> 02:04:38,721
Abort!

1627
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:39,930
Turn around!

1628
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:41,641
ABORT!!!

1629
02:04:41,767 --> 02:04:43,727
We're being pulled in!

1630
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:55,072
What are you doing?!

1631
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,280
This is my plane!

1632
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,783
You're flying my plane!

1633
02:05:22,599 --> 02:05:23,767
We're going to DIE!!!

1634
02:05:25,102 --> 02:05:26,812
We need to pull up!

1635
02:05:48,667 --> 02:05:49,835
Restart engines!

1636
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:19,698
That's Sicily.

1637
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:20,991
1939.

1638
02:06:22,743 --> 02:06:24,161
I did it.

1639
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:25,829
I did it, Dr. Jones!

1640
02:06:25,996 --> 02:06:27,706
Setting coordinates for Munich.

1641
02:06:34,671 --> 02:06:36,715
Yesterday
belongs to us, Dr. Jones.

1642
02:07:01,615 --> 02:07:03,784
Those are Roman triremes.

1643
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:33,230
Keep it in the air!

1644
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,084
Master...

1645
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:56,753
The Romans are getting closer.

1646
02:07:58,505 --> 02:07:59,505
They have dragons!

1647
02:08:04,553 --> 02:08:05,929
Amazing.

1648
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:13,603
Whoa!

1649
02:08:14,896 --> 02:08:15,897
Open the door!

1650
02:08:20,861 --> 02:08:21,862
What are you doing?

1651
02:08:22,821 --> 02:08:24,531
What are you doing,
you idiots?

1652
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:26,491
They think we're a monster!

1653
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:28,034
Aah!

1654
02:08:32,956 --> 02:08:34,457
You have
to turn around.

1655
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:36,543
This is the Siege of Syracuse.

1656
02:08:37,669 --> 02:08:39,004
214 BC.

1657
02:08:39,170 --> 02:08:40,380
You got the wrong war.

1658
02:08:44,134 --> 02:08:45,134
Master...

1659
02:08:48,388 --> 02:08:49,639
Don't ride out there, Master!

1660
02:08:50,223 --> 02:08:51,433
The dragons!!

1661
02:09:01,693 --> 02:09:05,196
We must take down their dragons!

1662
02:09:12,203 --> 02:09:13,288
Boss!

1663
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:14,371
Change course!

1664
02:09:14,456 --> 02:09:15,832
The portal closes in minutes!

1665
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:17,249
I have to go back!

1666
02:09:17,626 --> 02:09:18,752
I can't be here!

1667
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,045
I CAN'T STAY HERE!

1668
02:09:20,211 --> 02:09:21,671
The plane won't make it!!

1669
02:09:51,368 --> 02:09:52,369
Get out of the way!

1670
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:00,835
How do you like that,
you savages?

1671
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:06,633
Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!

1672
02:10:16,685 --> 02:10:18,770
What are you doing here?

1673
02:10:18,937 --> 02:10:20,480
Rescuing you!

1674
02:10:31,116 --> 02:10:32,909
Get him off!

1675
02:10:34,285 --> 02:10:35,370
Indy!

1676
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:42,210
Parachute!

1677
02:10:45,005 --> 02:10:46,172
I got a parachute!

1678
02:10:47,674 --> 02:10:49,092
Hang on!

1679
02:10:52,095 --> 02:10:53,179
Let go!

1680
02:10:55,515 --> 02:10:56,891
Give me the parachute!

1681
02:11:02,981 --> 02:11:05,108
Grab it. Hang on!

1682
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:08,403
Indy!

1683
02:11:35,764 --> 02:11:37,223
We're losing altitude!

1684
02:11:38,475 --> 02:11:39,475
We're going down!

1685
02:11:41,311 --> 02:11:42,896
I've lost control!

1686
02:12:01,122 --> 02:12:03,583
Hey,
those are my friends.

1687
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,794
Those are my friends.
We need to help them!

1688
02:12:06,961 --> 02:12:08,546
Those are my friends!

1689
02:13:10,441 --> 02:13:11,818
Eureka.

1690
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:30,003
He's trying to land.

1691
02:13:30,086 --> 02:13:32,046
Come on, Indy. Help me.

1692
02:13:32,797 --> 02:13:34,841
Get up. Yeah.

1693
02:13:35,008 --> 02:13:37,302
We need to get you
out of here. Okay.

1694
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:40,513
Help me. Sit up, okay?

1695
02:13:41,389 --> 02:13:42,640
Sit up. You need to help me.

1696
02:13:42,807 --> 02:13:44,684
I know it hurts,
but we gotta get you back.

1697
02:13:44,851 --> 02:13:47,562
This is incredible, Wombat.

1698
02:13:48,104 --> 02:13:50,064
Incredible.

1699
02:13:51,608 --> 02:13:53,318
Yeah, it very well is.

1700
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:55,069
But we have to
get you out of here.

1701
02:13:57,197 --> 02:13:58,323
My God.

1702
02:13:59,991 --> 02:14:01,868
We're witnessing history.

1703
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:10,752
Reverse these numbers.

1704
02:14:10,919 --> 02:14:12,003
They'll get you home.

1705
02:14:13,671 --> 02:14:14,672
What?

1706
02:14:17,592 --> 02:14:18,801
I'm going to stay.

1707
02:14:19,552 --> 02:14:21,554
No. You're not serious.

1708
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:25,433
Wow, you are serious.

1709
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,147
Indy, you've been shot.

1710
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:32,232
You're bleeding.

1711
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:34,150
You can't stay here.

1712
02:14:34,234 --> 02:14:35,235
Yes, I can.

1713
02:14:35,902 --> 02:14:36,945
But for what? For...

1714
02:14:37,028 --> 02:14:40,573
For a long, painful death
with poultice and leeches?

1715
02:14:41,616 --> 02:14:43,743
I've imagined this, Wombat.

1716
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:46,663
Studied it.

1717
02:14:46,829 --> 02:14:48,873
- All my life.
- Yeah.

1718
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:52,043
And if you stay here,
you will muck it all up.

1719
02:14:52,126 --> 02:14:53,127
And die.

1720
02:14:53,878 --> 02:14:55,505
Please, get up.

1721
02:14:57,257 --> 02:14:58,424
Helena!

1722
02:14:58,758 --> 02:14:59,759
I did it!

1723
02:14:59,926 --> 02:15:02,262
Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!

1724
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:04,055
Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.
Get up.

1725
02:15:04,138 --> 02:15:05,658
I need to get you
into that plane, okay?

1726
02:15:05,682 --> 02:15:06,683
- We need to.
- No. No.

1727
02:15:06,849 --> 02:15:09,185
Get up. You can... We can!

1728
02:15:21,656 --> 02:15:22,656
Master!

1729
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:26,953
We have to leave, Master.

1730
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:29,580
It's him.

1731
02:15:38,548 --> 02:15:40,591
He's asking
how far we've come.

1732
02:15:44,012 --> 02:15:46,764
Two thousand years.

1733
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,558
We've come...

1734
02:15:49,142 --> 02:15:52,145
two thousand years.

1735
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:57,608
But we didn't expect to meet...

1736
02:15:58,151 --> 02:16:00,653
the great...

1737
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:03,239
Archimedes.

1738
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:09,911
You...

1739
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:12,373
were always...

1740
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,292
going to...

1741
02:16:14,876 --> 02:16:16,461
meet me.

1742
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,047
That dial
is a forced deck.

1743
02:16:19,130 --> 02:16:20,590
It doesn't take us
anywhere but here.

1744
02:16:20,757 --> 02:16:22,050
He built it to get help.

1745
02:16:22,216 --> 02:16:24,761
Well, we just scared off
the entire Roman Navy,

1746
02:16:24,844 --> 02:16:26,030
so I think
we've helped enough.

1747
02:16:26,054 --> 02:16:27,680
Apologies, Archimedes.

1748
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:29,223
I'm a fan...

1749
02:16:29,474 --> 02:16:32,185
- but we need to leave. He's hurt.
- Helena...

1750
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:33,871
He can't
keep that, by the way.

1751
02:16:33,895 --> 02:16:34,955
He needs to build his own one.

1752
02:16:34,979 --> 02:16:36,647
Helena, we need to go!

1753
02:16:37,106 --> 02:16:39,233
Indy, the window is closing!

1754
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,526
We cannot get stuck here!

1755
02:16:42,028 --> 02:16:42,653
I want...

1756
02:16:42,862 --> 02:16:43,946
to stay...

1757
02:16:44,322 --> 02:16:46,074
with you.

1758
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,201
No, no, no!
Do not say yes!

1759
02:16:48,785 --> 02:16:51,037
You are a brilliant man...

1760
02:16:51,287 --> 02:16:53,289
a wise man...

1761
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:55,083
a genius...

1762
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:56,167
Helena...

1763
02:16:56,334 --> 02:16:58,669
a hero to your people.

1764
02:16:59,379 --> 02:17:02,924
But he can't help you.

1765
02:17:04,092 --> 02:17:05,259
This is your time.

1766
02:17:05,343 --> 02:17:06,677
This is your time.

1767
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,721
He must be in his own time -

1768
02:17:08,805 --> 02:17:10,056
He needs to be in his.

1769
02:17:10,139 --> 02:17:12,433
His work is not done.
He needs to go home.

1770
02:17:12,517 --> 02:17:14,185
There is medicine at home.

1771
02:17:14,268 --> 02:17:16,145
He cannot die here. He can't.

1772
02:17:17,814 --> 02:17:20,650
Helena, get on the plane.

1773
02:17:23,236 --> 02:17:24,320
I'll be all right.

1774
02:17:26,155 --> 02:17:27,490
No, you won't.

1775
02:17:30,451 --> 02:17:32,203
I need to do this.

1776
02:17:33,287 --> 02:17:34,288
Me too.

1777
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:29,802
Good morning.

1778
02:18:34,682 --> 02:18:36,058
How's the shoulder?

1779
02:18:38,728 --> 02:18:41,230
Better than my jaw.

1780
02:18:44,859 --> 02:18:45,860
Right.

1781
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:49,363
You should've
let me stay.

1782
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:51,449
I couldn't do that.

1783
02:19:00,458 --> 02:19:01,459
Why not?

1784
02:19:03,336 --> 02:19:05,880
Well, for starters, you'd have
changed the course of history.

1785
02:19:10,218 --> 02:19:12,011
That's supposed to be
a bad thing?

1786
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:17,934
You're meant to be here, Indy.

1787
02:19:21,729 --> 02:19:22,730
Here.

1788
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,986
For who?

1789
02:19:56,305 --> 02:19:57,890
Marion.

1790
02:19:59,141 --> 02:20:00,184
Hey.

1791
02:20:19,453 --> 02:20:20,454
Teddy.

1792
02:20:22,081 --> 02:20:23,082
Marion.

1793
02:20:25,793 --> 02:20:26,794
What are you doing?

1794
02:20:28,337 --> 02:20:29,505
Putting groceries away.

1795
02:20:31,799 --> 02:20:34,510
There wasn't a scrap of food
in this place.

1796
02:20:35,428 --> 02:20:37,430
No. Really.

1797
02:20:42,226 --> 02:20:44,437
Someone told me you were back.

1798
02:20:51,902 --> 02:20:53,529
Are you back, Indy?

1799
02:20:55,156 --> 02:20:56,866
It was explosives,

1800
02:20:57,033 --> 02:20:59,160
and Indy was running,
Marion was running,

1801
02:20:59,327 --> 02:21:01,996
and suddenly
the plane exploded.

1802
02:21:05,708 --> 02:21:07,752
Indy, you're up and about.

1803
02:21:08,961 --> 02:21:10,338
Yes, I am.

1804
02:21:11,464 --> 02:21:12,465
Yes.

1805
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:15,134
Why don't we go
and get some ice cream, Kids?

1806
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:16,636
But Marion
just bought some.

1807
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:17,803
Oh,
I know a better place.

1808
02:21:17,970 --> 02:21:20,181
You can never have too much
ice cream, can you?

1809
02:21:23,893 --> 02:21:24,894
See you later.

1810
02:21:28,481 --> 02:21:31,400
A British
tar is a soaring soul

1811
02:21:31,567 --> 02:21:34,403
As free as a mountain bird

1812
02:21:34,570 --> 02:21:36,405
His energetic fist

1813
02:21:36,572 --> 02:21:38,991
Should be ready to resist...

1814
02:21:40,868 --> 02:21:42,161
That looks bad.

1815
02:21:43,663 --> 02:21:44,914
Does it hurt?

1816
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,918
Everything hurts.

1817
02:21:51,796 --> 02:21:53,422
I know how that feels.

1818
02:21:59,512 --> 02:22:02,139
Well, where doesn't it hurt?

1819
02:22:10,731 --> 02:22:11,732
Here.

1820
02:22:12,525 --> 02:22:13,776
It doesn't hurt here.

1821
02:22:22,034 --> 02:22:23,577
And here.

1822
02:22:47,184 --> 02:22:49,562
Jabari, Alia,
slow down!

1823
02:22:49,729 --> 02:22:51,856
Helena! Hurry up!

1824
02:22:52,022 --> 02:22:54,692
I scream, you scream...

1825
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,986
Everybody, slow down.

1826
02:22:57,153 --> 02:22:59,155
- I scream, you scream
-KIDS: I scream, I scream

1827
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:01,031
We all scream for ice cream!

1828
02:23:01,198 --> 02:23:03,284
Slow down.
