1
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,762
On the clearest of nights...

2
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:34,800
when the winds of the Etherium
were calm and peaceful...

3
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,243
the great merchant ships...

4
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,165
with their cargoes
of Arcturian sura crystals...

5
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,677
felt safe and secure.

6
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:56,721
Little did they suspect
that they were pursued by...

7
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,644
pirates.

8
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:03,207
And the most feared
of all these pirates...

9
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:07,240
was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint.

10
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:08,481
Fire!

11
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:23,920
Like a Candarian zap-wing
overtaking its prey...

12
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,686
James Pleiades Hawkins.

13
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:26,887
I thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

14
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,401
I thought you were asleep
an hour ago.

15
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:33,156
Mom, I was just getting
to the best part.

16
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,243
Please?

17
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,006
Can those eyes get any bigger?

18
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,641
Scootch over.

19
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:46,602
...like a Candarian zap-wing
overtaking its prey...

20
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:49,002
Flint
and his band of renegades...

21
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,800
swooped in out of nowhere.

22
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:03,607
And then, gathering up
their spoils...

23
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:08,280
vanished without a trace.

24
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:13,038
Flint's secret trove
was never found...

25
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,397
but stories have persisted
that it remains hidden...

26
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:20,679
somewhere at the farthest
reaches of the galaxy...

27
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:24,606
stowed with riches
beyond imagination...

28
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:27,844
the loot
of a thousand worlds...

29
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,685
Treasure Planet.

30
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,683
OK. Blow your nose.

31
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,405
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?

32
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:43,316
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere
and vanished without a trace?

33
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,403
I have no idea.

34
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,358
Come here, you, you li...

35
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,159
I'm gonna get...

36
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:55,563
OK, it's time for this
little spacer to go to sleep.

37
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:58,167
You think somebody'll
ever find Treasure Planet?

38
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:04,282
Sweetheart,
I think it's more like a legend.

39
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:06,204
I know it's real.

40
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:09,284
You win. It's real.

41
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:13,081
- Nighty-night, Mom.
- Nighty-night, sweetheart.

42
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,326
I love you.

43
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:17,766
Love you, too.

44
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,164
There are nights when
the winds of the Etherium...

45
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:30,200
so inviting in their promise
of flight and freedom...

46
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,956
made one's spirit soar!

47
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,525
Come on!

48
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:39,240
Great.

49
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,750
Mrs Hawkins!

50
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,829
I know...
refill on the purp juice.

51
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,226
Coming right up,
Mrs Dunwiddie.

52
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:54,707
There we go. That's four
powdered spheroids...

53
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,472
two lunar eclipses,
and it's a big bowl...

54
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,663
of Zorellian jelly worms
for the big boy!

55
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,783
- Awesome!
- Enjoy.

56
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,543
Sorry, Delbert. It's been
a madhouse here all morning.

57
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:08,946
No problem, Sarah.

58
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:12,303
My Alponian chowder
with the extra solara seed.

59
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:21,749
What brings you here,
curious little one?

60
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,351
Go away.

61
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:31,224
Are your parents around?

62
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,185
What's the matter?
Cat got your...

63
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,701
They're so adorable
at that age.

64
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,744
Yes... deplorable.

65
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,590
Adorable!

66
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,101
Speaking of which,
how's Jim doing?

67
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:48,190
Much better. I know
he had some rough spots...

68
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,269
earlier this year,
but I really think...

69
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,951
that he's starting
to turn a corner.

70
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:55,030
- Mrs Hawkins?
- Jim!

71
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,904
Wrong turn.

72
00:05:56,953 --> 00:06:00,229
- Thanks for the lift, guys.
- Not so fast.

73
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,752
We apprehended your son
operating...

74
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,465
a solar vehicle
in a restricted area.

75
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:05,549
Moving violation 9-0-4...

76
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:08,266
section fifteen,
paragraph...

77
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,462
Six?

78
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:10,787
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

79
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,903
As you are aware, ma'am...

80
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:14,830
this constitutes
a violation of his probation.

81
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:18,343
Yes, yes. I understand.
Could we just...

82
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:19,872
Pardon me.

83
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,144
Officers,
if I might interject here.

84
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:26,583
I am the noted astrophysicist
Dr Delbert Doppler.

85
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:27,907
Perhaps you've heard of me.

86
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,148
No? I have a clipping.

87
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,707
- Are you the boy's father?
- Good heavens, no!

88
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:35,745
He's just an old friend
of the family.

89
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,192
Back off, sir!

90
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,383
Thank you, Delbert.
I will take it from here.

91
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,151
Well, Sarah, if you insist.

92
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,627
Don't ever let me do that again.

93
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:45,709
Due to repeated violations
of statute 15-C...

94
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,665
we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip-ups will result...

95
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,112
in a one-way ticket
to Juvenile Hall.

96
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,825
- Kiddie hoosegow.
- The slammo.

97
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:55,422
Thank you, officers.
It won't happen again.

98
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:56,952
We see his type
all the time, ma'am.

99
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:58,346
- Wrong choices.
- Dead-enders.

100
00:06:58,393 --> 00:07:00,224
Losers.

101
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:02,423
- You take care now.
- Let's motor.

102
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:11,991
Jim, I have had it.

103
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,263
Do you want to go
to Juvenile Hall?

104
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,145
Jim, look at me.

105
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,104
It's been hard enough
keeping this place...

106
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,905
afloat by myself
without you going...

107
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,069
Mom, it's no big deal.
There was nobody around.

108
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,673
Those cops
just won't get off my...

109
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,307
Forget it.

110
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,947
Mrs Hawkins! My juice!

111
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,348
Yes, I'll be right there,
Mrs Dunwiddie.

112
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,065
Jim, I just don't want
to see you...

113
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:41,105
throw away your entire future.

114
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:44,984
Yeah, what future?

115
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:58,591
I really don't know
how you manage it, Sarah.

116
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,193
Trying to run a business
while raising a felon like...

117
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,908
felon... fellow...
fellow like Jim.

118
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,626
Managing it?
I'm at the end of my rope.

119
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:09,470
Ever since his father left...

120
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:12,983
well, Jim's just
never recovered.

121
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,069
And you know how smart he is.

122
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:18,901
He built his first solar surfer
when he was eight!

123
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:21,387
And yet,
he's failing at school...

124
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,424
he is constantly in trouble...

125
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:26,112
and when I talk to him,
he's like a stranger to me.

126
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:29,543
I don't know, Delbert.
I've tried everything...

127
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,829
Hey, Mister?
You're OK in there, right?

128
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,746
He's a-comin'.

129
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,670
Can you hear him?

130
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,546
Those gears and gyros
clickin' and whirrin'...

131
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:53,311
like the devil himself!

132
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:56,106
Hit your head there
pretty hard, didn't ya?

133
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,632
He's after me chest...

134
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:02,064
that fiendish cyborg
and his band of cutthroats.

135
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:04,992
But they'll have to pry it...

136
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:10,949
from old Billy Bones'
cold, dead fingers afore I...

137
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,952
Oh, my...

138
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:16,507
Come on, give me your arm.

139
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,352
That's it.

140
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:24,992
- Good lad.
- Mom's gonna love this.

141
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,625
Thanks for listening, Delbert.

142
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:38,710
It helps.

143
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,190
It's going to be OK.

144
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,905
You'll see.

145
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,421
I keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door...

146
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,941
and there he'll be
just the way he was.

147
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:54,224
A smiling, happy little boy,
holding a new pet...

148
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:56,741
and begging me
to let him keep it.

149
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:03,664
- James Pleiades Hawkins!
- Mom, he's hurt... bad!

150
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:08,465
Me chest, lad.

151
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,343
He'll be comin' soon.

152
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,068
Can't let them find this.

153
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:21,470
- Who's coming?
- The cyborg!

154
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:25,825
Beware the cyborg!

155
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,271
Quick! We gotta go!

156
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,309
I believe I'm with Jim
on this one!

157
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,513
Delilah! Hallelujah!

158
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:05,747
Stay! Don't move!

159
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:09,263
Where is it? Find it!

160
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:10,666
Don't worry, Sarah.

161
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,624
I'm an expert in the laws
of physical science.

162
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,664
- On the count of three... one...
- Three!

163
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:19,229
Go, Delilah! Go!

164
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:22,071
Go! That's it! Go!

165
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:45,100
I just spoke
with the constabulary.

166
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:49,339
Those blaggard pirates
have fled without a trace.

167
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:50,860
I'm sorry, Sarah.

168
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn
has burnt to the ground.

169
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,812
Certainly a lot of trouble
over that odd little sphere.

170
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,375
Those markings baffle me.

171
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,697
Unlike anything
I've ever encountered.

172
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,539
Even with my vast experience
and superior intellect...

173
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:16,539
it would take me years
to unlock its... Hey!

174
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:23,210
Why, it's a map!

175
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,689
Wait, wait, wait!

176
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:28,130
This is us,
the planet Montressor.

177
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,741
That's the Magellanic Cloud!

178
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,215
The Coral Galaxy!

179
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:40,732
That's the Cygnus Cross
and the Kerian Abyss.

180
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:44,012
Wait. What's this?
Why, it's...

181
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,779
Treasure Planet.

182
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,052
- No.
- That's Treasure Planet!

183
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,537
Flint's trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?

184
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:54,173
You know what this means?

185
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,531
It means that all that treasure
is only a boat ride away.

186
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:00,891
Whoever brings it back
would hold an eternal place...

187
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,139
atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience...

188
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:06,660
What just happened?

189
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,613
Mom, this is it...
the answer to all our problems.

190
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,856
There is absolutely no way...

191
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:14,290
Don't you remember,
all those stories?

192
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:17,174
That's all they were... stories!

193
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,574
With that treasure...

194
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,816
we could rebuild the Benbow
a hundred times over!

195
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,421
This is...
It's just... Oh, my.

196
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:25,816
Would you please explain
how ridiculous this is?

197
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,977
It's totally preposterous...

198
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,977
traversing
the entire galaxy alone.

199
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,012
Now at last,
we hear some sense!

200
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,495
That's why I'm going with you.

201
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,930
I'll use my savings
to finance the expedition.

202
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:40,098
I'll commission a ship,
hire a captain and a crew.

203
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:41,733
You're not serious.

204
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,056
All my life I've been waiting
for an opportunity like this...

205
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:47,377
and here it is screaming,
"Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!"

206
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,493
OK! You're both grounded!

207
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,538
Mom, look...

208
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:56,891
I know that I keep
messing everything up...

209
00:13:56,941 --> 00:14:01,457
and I know that I let you down.

210
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:06,014
But this is my chance
to make it up to you.

211
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,621
I'm gonna set things right.

212
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,175
Sarah?

213
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,371
If I may?

214
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,696
You said yourself,
you've tried everything.

215
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,379
There are much worse
remedies...

216
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,413
than a few character-building
months in space.

217
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,134
Are you saying this
because it's the right thing...

218
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,297
or because
you really want to go?

219
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:28,060
I really, really,
really want to go...

220
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,932
and it's the right thing.

221
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:40,735
Jim, I don't want to lose you.

222
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,251
Mom... you won't.

223
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,417
I'll make you proud.

224
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:51,217
Well... there we are then.

225
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,661
We'll begin preparations
at once.

226
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:53,899
We'll begin preparations
at once.

227
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:57,934
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be
off to the spaceport.

228
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,779
Jim! Wait for me!

229
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,214
Jim, this should be
a wonderful opportunity...

230
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,377
for the two of us
to get to know one another.

231
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,571
You know what they say,
familiarity breeds...

232
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,498
well, contempt,
but in our case...

233
00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:00,661
Let's just find the ship.
OK?

234
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,139
- Second berth on your right!
- You can't miss it.

235
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,017
- Second berth on your right!
- You can't miss it.

236
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,129
Thanks.

237
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,818
It's the suit, isn't it?
I should never have listened...

238
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,009
to that pushy
two-headed saleswoman.

239
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,334
This one said it fit,
that one said it was my colour.

240
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,258
I didn't know what to do.
I get so flustered.

241
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:21,975
Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!

242
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,657
Stow those casks forward!

243
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,929
Heave together now!

244
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:37,858
How cool is this?

245
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,810
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean...

246
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,290
Allow me to handle this.

247
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,133
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.

248
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,171
Took two years of it
in high school.

249
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,813
Flatula? Cool.

250
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:05,011
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?

251
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,495
Shipshape it is, sir,
but I'm not the captain.

252
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,257
The captain's aloft.

253
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,129
Mr Arrow, I've checked
this miserable ship...

254
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:23,491
from stem to stern,
and, as usual, it's spot on.

255
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,495
Can you get nothing wrong?

256
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:27,689
You flatter me, Captain.

257
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,371
Dr Doppler, I presume?

258
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,216
Yes. I...

259
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:37,331
- Hello! Can you hear me?
- Yes! Stop that banging!

260
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,973
If I may, Doctor,
this works so much better...

261
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,613
when it's right-way up
and plugged in.

262
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:44,058
Lovely. There you go.

263
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,659
If you don't mind,
I can manage my own plugging!

264
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,739
I'm Captain Amelia...

265
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:47,977
I'm Captain Amelia...

266
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,532
late of a few run-ins
with the Protean armada.

267
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,570
Nasty business, but I won't
bore you with my scars.

268
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,371
You've met
my first officer, Mr Arrow.

269
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,330
Sterling, tough, dependable,
honest, brave, and true.

270
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,051
Please, Captain.

271
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,976
Shut up, Arrow.
I don't mean a word of it.

272
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,136
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt
this lovely banter...

273
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,613
but may I introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?

274
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,776
Jim, you see, is the boy
who found the treasure...

275
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,775
Doctor, please!

276
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,728
I'd like a word with you
in my stateroom.

277
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:21,207
Doctor, to muse and blabber
about a treasure map...

278
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,136
in front of
this particular crew...

279
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,295
demonstrates
a level of ineptitude...

280
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,455
that borders
on the imbecilic...

281
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,410
and I mean that
in a very caring way.

282
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,690
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've...

283
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,377
May I see the map, please?

284
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,007
Here.

285
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,768
Fascinating.

286
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:48,256
Mr Hawkins, in the future...

287
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,051
you will address me
as "Captain" or "Ma'am."

288
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,327
Is that clear?

289
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,809
Mr Hawkins?

290
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,737
- Yes, ma'am.
- That'll do.

291
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,009
Gentlemen, this must be kept
under lock and key...

292
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,653
when not in use.
And, Doctor, again...

293
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,291
with the greatest
possible respect...

294
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,250
zip your howling screamer.

295
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,051
Captain, I assure you...

296
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:12,296
Let me make this
as monosyllabic as possible.

297
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:16,571
I don't much care
for this crew you hired.

298
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,769
How did I describe them, Arrow?

299
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:21,128
I said something rather good
this morning before coffee.

300
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,331
"A ludicrous parcel
of drivelling galoots," ma'am.

301
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:28,655
- There you go... poetry.
- Now, see here...

302
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:32,738
I'd love to chat...
tea, cake, the whole shebang...

303
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,098
but I have a ship to launch...

304
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,016
and you've got your outfit
to buff up.

305
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:36,179
Mr Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes...

306
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,295
Mr Arrow, please escort
these two neophytes...

307
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:39,852
down to the galley
straightaway.

308
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,538
Young Hawkins will be working
for our cook, Mr Silver.

309
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,774
What? The cook?

310
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,454
That woman! That feline!

311
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,535
Who does she think
is working for whom?

312
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:52,888
It's my map, and
she's got me bussin' tables?

313
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:55,499
I'll not tolerate a cross word
about our captain!

314
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,135
There's no finer officer
in this or any galaxy.

315
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,655
Mr Silver?

316
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,690
Why, Mr Arrow, sir.

317
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,094
Bringin' in such fine
and distinguished gents...

318
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,095
to grace my humble galley.

319
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,448
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.

320
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,736
A cyborg!

321
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,170
May I introduce Dr Doppler,
the financier of our voyage?

322
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,289
Love the outfit, Doc.

323
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,695
Thank you. Love the eye.

324
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:32,412
This young lad is Jim Hawkins.

325
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,767
Jimbo!

326
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,129
Don't be too put off
by this hunk of hardware.

327
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,655
These gears have been
tough getting used to...

328
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:57,453
but they do come in
mighty handy from time to time.

329
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,808
Here, have a taste of
me famous bonzabeast stew.

330
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,213
Delightfully tangy,
yet robust.

331
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:20,568
Old family recipe.

332
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:25,414
In fact, that was part
of the old family!

333
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,338
I'm just kiddin', Doc!

334
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,893
I'm nothin'
if I ain't a kidder.

335
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:37,373
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.

336
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:48,817
Morph! You jiggle-headed
blob of mischief!

337
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:50,975
So that's
where you was hiding!

338
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,808
What is that thing?

339
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,531
He's a morph.

340
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:05,891
I rescued the little
shape-shifter on Proteus 1.

341
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:11,172
He took a shine to me.
We been together ever since.

342
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,892
Right? Nice boy.

343
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,213
We're about to get underway.

344
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,295
Would you like to observe
the launch, Doctor?

345
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,852
Would I?

346
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,016
Does an active galactic nucleus
have superluminal jets?

347
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:24,414
I'll follow you.

348
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:29,214
Mr Hawkins will stay here
in your charge, Mr Silver.

349
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,534
Beggin' your pardon, sir...

350
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:36,209
Captain's orders! See to it
the new cabin boy's kept busy.

351
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,853
- But, no, but...
- No, you can't...

352
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,847
So, Captain's
put you with me, eh?

353
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,776
Whatever.

354
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:53,973
Who be a humble cyborg
to argue with a captain?

355
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,177
You know... these purps...

356
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:03,132
they're kind of like the ones
back home on Montressor.

357
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,931
You ever been there?

358
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:07,447
I can't say as I have, Jimbo.

359
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,539
Come to think of it,
just before I left...

360
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:13,535
I met this old guy...

361
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,696
who was looking
for a cyborg buddy of his.

362
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:19,412
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:23,134
What was
that old salamander's name?

364
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,454
Oh, yeah. Bones.

365
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:27,330
Billy Bones?

366
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:30,337
Bones? Bones?

367
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,654
T'ain't ringin' any bells.

368
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:34,769
Must have been
a different cyborg.

369
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,607
There's a slew of cyborgs
roamin' this port.

370
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,775
Prepare to cast off!

371
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,573
Off with you, lad,
and watch the launch.

372
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:49,056
There'll be plenty work
a-waitin' for you afterwards.

373
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:58,653
We best be keepin' a sharp eye
on this one, eh, Morph?

374
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:03,525
We wouldn't want him strayin'
into things he shouldn't.

375
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,483
We're all clear, Captain!

376
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:09,642
Well, my friend. Are we ready
to raise this creaking tub?

377
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:11,721
My pleasure, Captain.

378
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:14,677
All hands to stations!

379
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:16,999
Smartly now!

380
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,444
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!

381
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:25,156
Loose all solar sails!

382
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,233
Come on!

383
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,797
Heave up the braces.

384
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,563
Brace up.

385
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,679
Mr Zoff,
engage artificial gravity.

386
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,281
South by southwest,
Mr Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.

387
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:12,044
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.

388
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:16,396
Full speed, Mr Arrow,
if you please.

389
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,673
Take her away!

390
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,601
Brace yourself, Doctor.

391
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:06,998
Upon my word,
an Orcus Galacticus.

392
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,358
- Smile.
- Doctor, I'd stand clear...

393
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,917
'Tis a grand day
for sailing, Captain...

394
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:20,398
and look at you.

395
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,913
You're as trim and as bonny
as a sloop...

396
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:25,604
with new sails
and a fresh coat of paint.

397
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,476
You can keep that kind
of flim-flammery...

398
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,163
for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.

399
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:30,684
Spaceport floozy!

400
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:33,114
You cut me to the quick,
Captain.

401
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:37,078
I speaks nothing
but me heart at all times.

402
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,878
And, by the way,
isn't that your cabin boy...

403
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:43,440
aimlessly footling about
in those shrouds?

404
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:44,964
Yep, it...

405
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:49,840
A momentary aberration, Cap'n,
soon to be addressed.

406
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:54,078
I got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.

407
00:26:55,325 --> 00:27:00,115
Say hello to
Mr Mop and Mrs Bucket.

408
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:06,837
Yeah, I got your Mr Mop.

409
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:12,598
Watch it, twerp.

410
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:28,473
What are you looking at,
weirdo?

411
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,756
Yeah, weirdo.

412
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:41,434
Cabin boys should learn
to mind their own business.

413
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,953
Why? You got something to hide,
bright eyes?

414
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:50,274
Maybe your ears
don't work so well.

415
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:53,840
Yeah. Too bad
my nose works just fine.

416
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:57,321
Why, you impudent little...

417
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:03,200
Slice him! Dice him!

418
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:07,204
Any last words, cabin boy?

419
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,724
Mr Scroop...

420
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,878
you ever see what happens
to a fresh purp...

421
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,713
when you squeeze real hard?

422
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,244
What's all this, then?

423
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,282
You know the rules.

424
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,919
There'll be no brawling
on this ship.

425
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:35,675
Any further offenders
will be confined to the brig...

426
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:38,319
for the remainder
of the voyage.

427
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,755
Am I clear, Mr Scroop?

428
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,600
Transparently.

429
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:57,564
Well done, Mr Arrow, sir!

430
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,358
A tight ship's
a happy ship, sir.

431
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:04,079
Jimbo, I gave you a job.

432
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,480
I was doing it
until that bug thing...

433
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:11,440
Belay that! I want
this deck swabbed spotless...

434
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:14,875
and heaven help you if
I come back and it's not done.

435
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:18,440
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup...

436
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:21,716
and let me know if there be
any more distractions.

437
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,114
So, we're all here, then.

438
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:36,237
- Excuse me.
- Fine.

439
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:42,394
Now, if you pardon
my plain speaking, gentlemen...

440
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,083
are you all...

441
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:48,835
stark-raving,
totally blinking daft?

442
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:51,115
After all me finagling
getting us hired...

443
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,678
as an upstanding crew...

444
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:56,479
you want to blow the whole
mutiny before it's time?

445
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,323
The boy was sniffing about.

446
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:04,678
You just stick to the plan,
you bug-brained twit.

447
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:08,195
As for the boy,
I'll run him so ragged...

448
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:10,236
he won't have time to think.

449
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,953
This has been a fun day, huh?

450
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:27,237
Making new friends
like that spider psycho.

451
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,162
Spider psycho!

452
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:31,002
A little uglier.

453
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:34,519
Pretty close.

454
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:38,717
Thank heavens
for little miracles.

455
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:40,244
Up here for an hour...

456
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,515
and the deck's
still in one piece.

457
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:45,523
Look, I...

458
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,673
What you did...

459
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,204
Thanks.

460
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,002
Didn't your pap
ever teach you...

461
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:58,115
to pick your fights
a bit more carefully?

462
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:05,554
Your father's
not the teachin' sort.

463
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:11,362
No. He was more the taking off
and never coming back sort.

464
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,359
Sorry, lad.

465
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:20,954
No big deal.
I'm doing just fine.

466
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,441
Is that so?

467
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:27,921
Since the captain
has put you in my charge...

468
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:30,035
like it or not,
I'll be pounding a few skills...

469
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,440
into that thick head of yours
to keep you out of trouble.

470
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,679
- What?
- From now on...

471
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm not letting you
out of me sight.

472
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,159
You can't do...

473
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,684
You won't so much
as eat, sleep...

474
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:41,797
or scratch your bum
without my say-so.

475
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:43,164
Don't do me any favours!

476
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:45,878
You can be sure of that,
my lad.

477
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:46,031
You can be sure of that.

478
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,465
You can be sure of that.

479
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:56,139
Put some elbow into it.

480
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,623
I am a question to the world

481
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:13,708
Not an answer to be heard

482
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:18,586
Or a moment
that's held in your arms

483
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:23,102
And what do you think
you'd ever say

484
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,143
I won't listen anyway

485
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,863
You don't know me

486
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,550
And I'll never be what you want

487
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:32,946
Me to be

488
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:41,668
And what do you think
you'd understand?

489
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,828
I'm a boy, no, I'm a man

490
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:49,581
You can take me
and throw me away

491
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:54,182
And how can you learn
what's never shown

492
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:57,143
Yeah, you stand here
on your own

493
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,783
They don't know me

494
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:03,985
'Cause I'm not here

495
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:07,785
And I want a moment to be real

496
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:11,267
Want to touch things
I don't feel

497
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:16,101
Want to hold on
and feel I belong

498
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:20,622
And how can the world
want me to change

499
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:23,629
They're the ones
that stay the same

500
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:25,627
They don't know me

501
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,903
But I'm still here

502
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:34,581
And you see the things
they never see

503
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:37,782
All you wanted, I could be

504
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:39,344
Now you know me

505
00:33:39,391 --> 00:33:42,064
And I'm not afraid

506
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:46,946
And I want to tell you who I am

507
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,063
Can you help me be a man?

508
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,590
They can't break me

509
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:55,829
As long as I know who I am

510
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:01,148
They can't tell me who to be

511
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:08,782
'Cause I'm not what they see

512
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:10,708
Yeah, the world
is still sleeping

513
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:13,431
While I keep on dreaming for me

514
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,183
While I keep on dreaming for me

515
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:17,426
And the words
are just whispers and lies

516
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:22,943
That I'll never believe

517
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:29,068
And I want a moment to be real

518
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:32,023
Want to touch things
I don't feel

519
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:37,020
Want to hold on
and feel I belong

520
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:41,462
How can you say I never change?

521
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,264
They're the ones
that stay the same

522
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:46,188
I'm the one now

523
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:50,941
'Cause I'm still here

524
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm the one son still here

525
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:59,142
I'm still here

526
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,025
I'm still here

527
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:20,860
You having
a little trouble there?

528
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,708
Get away from me.

529
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:29,346
If I could manoeuvre a skiff
like that when I was your age...

530
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:32,463
they'd be bowing in the streets
when I walked by today.

531
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,071
Bowing in the streets.

532
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:36,908
I don't know.

533
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,943
They weren't exactly singing
my praises when I left home.

534
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:46,103
But I'm gonna change all that.

535
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:49,143
Are you now? How so?

536
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,581
I got some plans.

537
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:55,668
Gonna make people see me
a little different.

538
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:01,987
Sometimes, plans go astray.

539
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:04,340
Not this time.

540
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:15,744
Thank you, Morphy.

541
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:21,182
So, how'd that happen anyway?

542
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:29,191
You give up a few things
chasing a dream.

543
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,267
Was it worth it?

544
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:38,748
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo.

545
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,259
I most surely am.

546
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:49,702
What the devil?

547
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,345
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa...

548
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,668
it's gone supernova!

549
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,781
Evasive action, Mr Turnbuckle!

550
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,059
Aye-aye, Captain.

551
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:05,300
All hands,
fasten your lifelines!

552
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:21,141
Mr Arrow, secure those sails!

553
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:23,466
Secure all sails!

554
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:26,025
Reef them down, men!

555
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:37,230
Yeah, baby!

556
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,419
Silver!

557
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,982
Thanks, lad.

558
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:17,750
Captain, the star!

559
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,259
It's devolving into a...

560
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,701
a black hole!

561
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,311
We're being pulled in!

562
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:28,307
No, you don't!

563
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:38,902
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!

564
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:41,146
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.

565
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:44,228
There'll be one more
in precisely 47.2 seconds.

566
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:45,351
Followed by the biggest
magilla of them all!

567
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:46,943
Followed by the biggest
magilla of them all!

568
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,822
Of course!
Brilliant, Doctor!

569
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,749
We'll ride that last magilla
out of here.

570
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,986
All sails secured, Captain!

571
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,546
Good man!
Now release them immediately!

572
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,470
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.

573
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,581
Unfurl those sails.

574
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:05,144
- What?
- But we just finished...

575
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:08,547
- Tying them down!
- Make up your blooming minds!

576
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,870
Mr Hawkins...

577
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:15,665
make sure all lifelines
are secured good and tight!

578
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:17,030
Aye-aye, Captain.

579
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,143
- Lifelines secured, Captain!
- Very good!

580
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:54,989
Captain, the last wave!

581
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,908
Here it comes!

582
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,862
Hold on to your lifelines,
gents!

583
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:01,266
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

584
00:40:39,258 --> 00:40:42,011
Captain! Oh, my goodness.

585
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,571
That was absolutely...
That was the most...

586
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:45,893
Tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor...

587
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:48,657
your astronomical advice
was most helpful.

588
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:52,168
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

589
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:54,334
I have a lot of help
to offer anatomically...

590
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:57,529
amanamonically...
as-astronomically.

591
00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:00,251
I must congratulate you,
Mr Silver.

592
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:01,526
It seems your cabin boy...

593
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:03,887
did a bang-up job
with those lifelines.

594
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,852
All hands accounted for,
Mr Arrow?

595
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,006
Mr Arrow?

596
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:18,169
I'm afraid
Mr Arrow has been lost.

597
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:22,971
His lifeline was not secured.

598
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,297
No, I checked them all.

599
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:34,408
I did. I checked them all.
They were secure.

600
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,096
I swear.

601
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:51,214
Mr Arrow was a...

602
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,818
fine spacer...

603
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:57,612
finer than most of us
could ever hope to be...

604
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:01,975
but he knew the risks,
as do we all.

605
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:05,454
Resume your posts.
We carry on.

606
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:30,770
It weren't your fault,
you know?

607
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:33,738
Half the crew would be spinning
in that black abyss...

608
00:42:33,738 --> 00:42:38,095
Half the crew would be spinning
in that black abyss...

609
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,448
Don't you get it?
I screwed up!

610
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:43,375
For two seconds,
I thought that maybe...

611
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:46,649
I could do
something right, but...

612
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:47,926
I just...

613
00:42:51,658 --> 00:42:54,536
Just forget it. Forget it.

614
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:04,770
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.

615
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:08,015
You got the makings
of greatness in ya...

616
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:11,289
but you gotta take the helm
and chart your own course.

617
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,648
Stick to it,
no matter the squalls...

618
00:43:14,698 --> 00:43:16,814
and when the time comes
you get the chance...

619
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:19,088
to really test
the cut of your sails...

620
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:24,417
and show what you're made of,
I hope I'm there...

621
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:28,929
catching some of the light
coming off ya that day.

622
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:42,454
There, there.

623
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:45,217
Lad, it's alright, Jimbo.

624
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:47,772
It's alright.

625
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:53,737
Now, Jim, I...

626
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:56,133
I best be getting
about my watch...

627
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:59,090
and you best be getting
some shut-eye.

628
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:18,172
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.

629
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:22,291
Next thing ya know, they'll be
saying I've gone soft.

630
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,119
Morph, knock it off.
It's too early for this.

631
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,322
Come back here!

632
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,394
Gotcha, Morph!

633
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:28,997
That's it, you little squid.

634
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,118
Busted!

635
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:56,364
What we're saying is
we're sick of all this waiting.

636
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:57,634
There's only
three of them left.

637
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:59,802
We are wanting to move.

638
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:02,599
We don't move till
we got the treasure in hand.

639
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:05,843
I say we kill 'em all now.

640
00:46:05,886 --> 00:46:09,196
I say what's to say!

641
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:10,964
Disobey my orders again...

642
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:12,917
like that stunt you pulled
with Mr Arrow...

643
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:15,766
and so help me,
you'll be joining him!

644
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:16,403
and so help me,
you'll be joining him!

645
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:23,846
Strong talk,
but I know otherwise.

646
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:26,400
You got something to say,
Scroop?

647
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:30,234
It's that boy.

648
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:35,041
Methinks you have
a soft spot for him.

649
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,124
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.

650
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,636
I care about one thing,
and one thing only!

651
00:46:43,686 --> 00:46:46,200
Flint's trove.

652
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:48,237
You think I'd risk it all
for the sake...

653
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:51,642
of some nose-wiping
little whelp?

654
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:53,244
What was it now?

655
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:57,996
"You got the makings
of greatness in ya."

656
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:59,525
Shut your yap!

657
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,844
I cosied up to that kid
to keep him off our scent.

658
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:06,081
But I ain't gone soft.

659
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:08,037
Land ho!

660
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:16,362
There it is!

661
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:19,125
Feast eyes and click heels
if you got 'em.

662
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:28,997
Where the devil's me glass?

663
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:45,320
Playing games, are we?

664
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:49,325
Yeah.
Yeah, we're playing games.

665
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:55,999
I see. Well, I was
never much good at games.

666
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:59,436
Always hated to lose.

667
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:02,805
Me, too!

668
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:08,834
Right-o...

669
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,318
Blast it all.

670
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:22,126
Change in plan, lads!

671
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:24,236
We move now!

672
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:31,358
Strike our colours, Mr Onus.

673
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:33,874
With pleasure, Captain.

674
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:50,092
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.

675
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:51,451
Doctor, familiar with these?

676
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:53,847
I've seen... I've read...

677
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:56,690
No, I'm not.

678
00:49:00,252 --> 00:49:03,210
Mr Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.

679
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:04,651
Morph! Give me that!

680
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:10,411
You're taking all day about it.

681
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:20,325
Stop them!

682
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,487
To the longboats, quickly!

683
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:55,732
Chew on this,
you pus-filled boils!

684
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:04,207
Did you actually aim for that?

685
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,924
Actually, I did.

686
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:14,490
Blast it.

687
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,768
When I say "now",
shoot out the forward cable.

688
00:50:17,812 --> 00:50:19,040
I'll take this one.

689
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:20,605
Morph, here!

690
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:25,611
Morphy, come here.

691
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:28,849
Bring it here.
Morph, come here.

692
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,531
Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.

693
00:50:31,572 --> 00:50:33,164
Come here, boy.

694
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:34,964
- Come on!
- Morph, here!

695
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,411
Now!

696
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:03,327
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.

697
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:06,887
That's it! Come to papa!

698
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:10,288
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!

699
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:14,043
Captain!
Laser ball at 12 o'clock!

700
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:44,809
Oh, my goodness.

701
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,844
That was more fun
than I ever want to have again.

702
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:52,647
That's not one of
my gossamer landings.

703
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,886
Captain!

704
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:57,971
Don't fuss.

705
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:01,085
Slight bruising.
That's all.

706
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,248
Cup of tea,
and I'll be right as rain.

707
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:06,284
Mr Hawkins...

708
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,845
the map if you please.

709
00:52:14,812 --> 00:52:16,484
Where's the map?

710
00:52:18,932 --> 00:52:21,844
Are you serious?
It's back on the ship?

711
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:26,448
Stifle that blob and get low.

712
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,242
We've got company.

713
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:37,451
We need
a more defensible position.

714
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:39,483
Mr Hawkins, scout ahead.

715
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:42,361
Aye, Captain.

716
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,006
Steady, steady.

717
00:52:45,052 --> 00:52:48,089
Now, let's have a look at that.

718
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:28,440
This is fantastic!

719
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:31,315
A carbon-based life form
come to rescue me at last!

720
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:33,318
I just want to hug you
and squeeze you...

721
00:53:33,362 --> 00:53:34,841
and hold you close to me.

722
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:38,033
Alright. OK.
Would you let go of me?

723
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,720
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

724
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:43,311
It's just I've been marooned
for so long.

725
00:53:43,362 --> 00:53:45,830
Solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.

726
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,600
For heaven's sakes,
after a hundred years...

727
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:51,112
you go a little nuts!

728
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm sorry. Am I...

729
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:54,275
I am...

730
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:57,712
My name is...

731
00:54:01,802 --> 00:54:04,157
B.E.N.!
Of course, I'm B. E. N.

732
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:06,762
Bioelectronic Navigator.
Oops.

733
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:08,281
- And you are?
- Jim.

734
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:09,880
What a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

735
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:11,833
- It's Jim.
- Anyway...

736
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,440
Look, I'm in a hurry.

737
00:54:13,482 --> 00:54:15,916
I got to find a place to hide.
There's pirates chasing me.

738
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:19,034
Pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates!

739
00:54:19,082 --> 00:54:22,040
I don't like them.
I remember Captain Flint.

740
00:54:22,082 --> 00:54:24,312
This guy had such a temper.

741
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:26,398
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

742
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:29,240
I think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

743
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:30,920
I'm not a therapist,
and anyway...

744
00:54:30,962 --> 00:54:32,998
You let me know
when I'm rambling.

745
00:54:33,042 --> 00:54:34,361
But that means...

746
00:54:34,402 --> 00:54:36,597
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

747
00:54:36,642 --> 00:54:38,155
- Treasure?
- Flint's trove?

748
00:54:38,202 --> 00:54:40,079
You know,
loot of a thousand worlds.

749
00:54:40,122 --> 00:54:41,953
It's... Well, it's...

750
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:45,472
It's all a little...
little fuzzy.

751
00:54:45,522 --> 00:54:48,958
Wait. I remember.

752
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:50,993
I do. Treasure!

753
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,795
Lots of treasure
buried in the centroid...

754
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:55,798
centroid of the mechanism.

755
00:54:55,842 --> 00:55:00,791
There was this big door
opening and closing...

756
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,514
and Captain Flint
wanted to make sure...

757
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:03,995
nobody could ever
get to his treasure...

758
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:05,794
so I helped him...

759
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:11,518
Data inaccessible!
Reboot!

760
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:14,156
Reboot! And you are?

761
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:15,396
What about the treasure?

762
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,875
I want to say Larry.

763
00:55:16,922 --> 00:55:19,038
The centroid
of the mechanism, or...

764
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:22,122
I'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

765
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:25,000
I've lost my mind.

766
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,475
You haven't found it, have you?

767
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:29,992
My missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

768
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:34,513
Look, B.E.N., I really need
to find a place to hide.

769
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:38,396
So I'm gonna be moving on.

770
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:41,673
Oh, so, well, then...

771
00:55:41,722 --> 00:55:45,397
I guess
this is good-bye, huh?

772
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:50,197
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.

773
00:55:50,242 --> 00:55:55,077
So, go ahead.
I do understand.

774
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:58,353
I do. Bye-bye.

775
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:05,437
If you're gonna come along,
you have to stop talking.

776
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:09,031
Huzzah!
This is fantastic!

777
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:12,154
Me and my best buddy
are lookin' for a...

778
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:15,874
Being quiet.

779
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:18,197
And you have to stop
touching me.

780
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:21,678
Touching and talking.
My two big no-nos.

781
00:56:21,722 --> 00:56:23,713
OK. I think we should...

782
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:26,754
Say, before we go out
on our big search...

783
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:31,114
would you mind if we made
a quick pit stop at my place?

784
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:33,039
Kind of urgent.

785
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:36,438
B.E.N., I think
you just solved my problem.

786
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:42,313
Pardon the mess, people.

787
00:56:42,362 --> 00:56:43,681
You'd think
in a hundred years...

788
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:45,235
I would've dusted
a little more often...

789
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:47,432
but when you're batchin' it...

790
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:50,042
you tend to let things go.

791
00:56:50,082 --> 00:56:52,232
Isn't that sweet?

792
00:56:52,282 --> 00:56:55,274
I find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

793
00:56:55,322 --> 00:56:58,041
How about drinks
for the happy couple?

794
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:03,232
Thank you, we don't drink...
and we're not a couple.

795
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:07,552
Look at these markings.

796
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:10,878
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

797
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:12,958
I suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants...

798
00:57:13,002 --> 00:57:14,640
of an ancient culture.

799
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:18,675
Mr Hawkins, stop anyone
who tries to approach.

800
00:57:18,722 --> 00:57:20,474
Yes, yes.
Now listen to me...

801
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:24,595
stop giving orders for a few
milliseconds and lie still.

802
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,678
Very forceful, Doctor.

803
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:28,599
Go on. Say something else.

804
00:57:28,642 --> 00:57:31,793
Look! There's some more
of your buddies!

805
00:57:31,842 --> 00:57:34,675
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!

806
00:57:39,802 --> 00:57:43,715
Stop wastin' your fire!

807
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:47,152
Hello, up there!

808
00:57:51,242 --> 00:57:54,552
If it's alright
with the captain...

809
00:57:54,602 --> 00:57:57,241
I'd like a short word with ya.

810
00:57:57,282 --> 00:58:00,638
No tricks,
just a little palaver.

811
00:58:00,682 --> 00:58:00,762
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

812
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:03,196
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

813
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:06,393
- Pestilential...
- Captain.

814
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:11,721
That means... that he thinks
we still have it.

815
00:58:16,402 --> 00:58:21,351
Morphy!
I wondered where you was off to.

816
00:58:26,762 --> 00:58:29,913
This poor old leg's
downright snarky...

817
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:32,840
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

818
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:41,240
Whatever you heard
back there...

819
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:43,318
at least the part
concerning you...

820
00:58:43,362 --> 00:58:47,150
I didn't mean a word of it.

821
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:51,036
Had that bloodthirsty lot
thought I'd gone soft...

822
00:58:51,082 --> 00:58:53,516
they'd have gutted us both.

823
00:58:55,562 --> 00:58:59,840
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right...

824
00:58:59,882 --> 00:59:05,400
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

825
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:10,320
You get me that map...

826
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:12,114
and...

827
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:17,441
an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

828
00:59:21,842 --> 00:59:24,151
Boy.

829
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:26,670
You are really something.

830
00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:29,361
All that talk of greatness...

831
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:32,872
light coming off my sails...
what a joke.

832
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:34,674
Just see here, Jimbo...

833
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:35,916
At least
you taught me one thing.

834
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,156
Stick to it, right?

835
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,079
That's just what I'm gonna do.

836
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:43,274
I'll make sure you never see
one drabloon of my treasure!

837
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:46,632
That treasure is owed me,
by thunder!

838
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:50,914
Try to find it without my map,
by thunder!

839
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:55,877
You still don't know how
to pick your fights, do you?

840
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:59,073
Now, mark me.

841
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:02,751
Either I get that map
by dawn tomorrow...

842
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:06,761
or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons...

843
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:10,397
to blast ya all
to kingdom come!

844
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:13,354
Morph, hop to it.

845
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:16,041
Now!

846
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,239
Blast it!

847
01:00:31,442 --> 01:00:33,114
Gentlemen...

848
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:38,680
we must stay together and...

849
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,394
And what? What?

850
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:42,956
We must stay together
and what?

851
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:48,201
Doctor,
you have wonderful eyes.

852
01:00:48,242 --> 01:00:49,721
She's lost her mind!

853
01:00:49,762 --> 01:00:51,036
You gotta help her.

854
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:53,277
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

855
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:55,677
I am a doctor,
but not that kind of doctor.

856
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:57,201
I have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

857
01:00:57,242 --> 01:00:58,561
You can't help people
with a doctorate.

858
01:00:58,602 --> 01:01:01,116
You just sit there,
and you're useless.

859
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,357
It's OK, Doc.

860
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:05,040
It's alright.

861
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:08,199
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly
how to get out of this.

862
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:11,279
Jimmy has this knowledge
of things.

863
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:11,466
Any thoughts at all?

864
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:14,856
Any thoughts at all?

865
01:01:14,906 --> 01:01:17,784
Without the map, we're dead.

866
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:21,585
If we try to leave, we're dead.

867
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:24,743
- Lf we stay here...
- We're dead!

868
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:33,503
I think that Jimmy could
use a little quiet time.

869
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:36,697
So I'll just slip out
the back door.

870
01:01:36,746 --> 01:01:38,862
- Back door?
- Oh, yeah.

871
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:40,862
I get this delightful breeze
through here...

872
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,625
which I think is important,
because ventilation...

873
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,021
What is all this stuff?

874
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:48,296
You mean the miles and miles
of machinery that run...

875
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:50,337
through the entire course
of the inside of this planet?

876
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:52,138
Not a clue.

877
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:54,336
Doc! I think I found
a way out of here!

878
01:01:54,386 --> 01:01:56,820
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay...

879
01:01:56,866 --> 01:01:59,664
- I'll be back.
- Cannonball!

880
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:11,500
- What's the plan?
- B.E.N., quiet.

881
01:02:15,386 --> 01:02:16,944
Here it is.

882
01:02:16,986 --> 01:02:20,103
We sneak back to the Legacy,
disable the laser cannons...

883
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:21,864
and bring back the map.

884
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,862
That's a good plan.
I like that plan.

885
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,864
The only thing is,
how do we get there?

886
01:02:26,906 --> 01:02:28,385
On that.

887
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,464
Sorry, sorry.

888
01:02:49,706 --> 01:02:52,174
I'll get the map.
You wait here.

889
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,662
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralise
laser cannons, sir!

890
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:59,460
Yo-ho, yo-ho,
a pirate's life for me

891
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:05,054
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?

892
01:03:05,106 --> 01:03:08,621
All we gotta do is find
that one little wire.

893
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:11,100
Oh, mama.

894
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:21,779
Bad, B.E.N. Bad. Fixing!

895
01:03:21,826 --> 01:03:24,499
That stupid robot's
gonna get us all... killed.

896
01:03:24,546 --> 01:03:26,741
Cabin boy.

897
01:03:53,986 --> 01:03:55,624
Don't panic.

898
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,543
Breathing in,
breathing out...

899
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:19,624
This has gotta be cannons.

900
01:04:20,826 --> 01:04:22,225
Maybe not.

901
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:45,863
Come on, come on.

902
01:04:45,906 --> 01:04:50,024
- No!
- Oh, yes.

903
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,103
Do say hello to Mr Arrow.

904
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:58,338
Tell him yourself!

905
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:10,823
Back you go, you naughty plug!

906
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:24,943
Laser cannons disconnected,
Captain Jimmy, sir!

907
01:05:24,986 --> 01:05:27,022
That wasn't so tough.

908
01:05:34,506 --> 01:05:36,497
Doc, wake up!

909
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:39,663
I got the map.

910
01:05:39,706 --> 01:05:44,734
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.

911
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:51,385
Thanks for
showing us the way, boy.

912
01:05:59,146 --> 01:06:01,455
What's this sorry stack
of metal?

913
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:02,700
Not the face!

914
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:05,544
You're just like me, Jimbo.

915
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:08,464
Ya hates to lose.

916
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:18,975
What the devil's the...

917
01:06:22,866 --> 01:06:24,379
Open it.

918
01:06:32,706 --> 01:06:34,936
I'd get busy.

919
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:54,381
The powers that be.
Would you look?

920
01:07:00,546 --> 01:07:04,380
Tie him up and leave him
with the others till we...

921
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:06,944
You want the map...

922
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:08,783
you're taking me, too.

923
01:07:16,506 --> 01:07:18,224
We'll take 'em all.

924
01:07:39,586 --> 01:07:42,225
It's OK, Morph.

925
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,063
Jimmy,
I don't know about you...

926
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:47,735
but I'm starting to see my life
pass in front of my eyes.

927
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:49,697
At least, I think it's my life.

928
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:52,783
Was I ever dancing
with an android named Lupe?

929
01:07:52,826 --> 01:07:56,819
B.E.N., shh.
This isn't over yet.

930
01:07:58,026 --> 01:08:00,494
We're gettin' close, lads.

931
01:08:00,546 --> 01:08:03,856
I smell treasure a-waitin'.

932
01:08:09,746 --> 01:08:11,782
Where is it?

933
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:16,058
I see nothing! One great, big
stinking hunk of nothing!

934
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:18,859
What's going on, Jimbo?

935
01:08:18,906 --> 01:08:21,739
I don't know.
I can't get it open.

936
01:08:21,786 --> 01:08:24,778
We should've never
followed this boy!

937
01:08:24,826 --> 01:08:29,456
I'd suggest you get that gizmo
going again, and fast!

938
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,737
Let's rip his gizzard
right out right now!

939
01:08:32,786 --> 01:08:35,220
Throw him off the cliff!

940
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,821
Have mercy.

941
01:08:59,186 --> 01:09:01,416
The Lagoon Nebula?

942
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:04,936
But that's halfway
across the galaxy.

943
01:09:06,586 --> 01:09:08,895
A big door...

944
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:11,016
opening and closing.

945
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:16,418
Let's see.

946
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:19,902
Kinapis.

947
01:09:19,946 --> 01:09:21,425
Montressor spaceport.

948
01:09:24,546 --> 01:09:26,423
So that's how Flint did it.

949
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:31,460
He used this portal to roam
the universe stealing treasure.

950
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:33,701
But where'd he stash it all?

951
01:09:34,946 --> 01:09:38,018
Where's that blasted treasure?

952
01:09:38,066 --> 01:09:40,182
Treasure! Treasure!

953
01:09:40,226 --> 01:09:42,137
It's buried in the...

954
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:46,179
Buried in the centroid
of the mechanism.

955
01:09:46,226 --> 01:09:49,935
What if the whole planet
is the mechanism...

956
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:53,535
and the treasure is buried
in the centre of this planet?

957
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:00,499
How in blue blazes
are we supposed to get there?

958
01:10:00,546 --> 01:10:03,902
Just open the right door.

959
01:10:19,826 --> 01:10:23,057
Wait for me!

960
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:35,698
The loot of a thousand worlds.

961
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:42,021
We are going to need
a bigger boat!

962
01:10:53,426 --> 01:10:56,623
This is all seeming
very familiar.

963
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:01,658
I can't remember why.

964
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:03,298
B.E.N., come on.

965
01:11:03,346 --> 01:11:05,701
We're getting out of here, and
we're not leaving empty-handed.

966
01:11:05,746 --> 01:11:07,782
But, Jimmy!

967
01:11:09,226 --> 01:11:12,616
A lifetime of searching.

968
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:15,624
And at long last...

969
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:19,300
I can touch it.

970
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,745
Do you know what's strange?

971
01:11:20,786 --> 01:11:22,378
I can't tell you
how frustrating this is.

972
01:11:22,426 --> 01:11:23,939
There's something just...

973
01:11:23,986 --> 01:11:26,136
It's nagging
at the back of my mind.

974
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:30,897
- Captain Flint?
- In the flesh!

975
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:34,541
Sort of.
Except for skin, organs...

976
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:37,339
or anything
that resembles flesh...

977
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:39,263
that's not there.

978
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:41,183
And yet it's so odd?

979
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:44,104
I remember there was
something horrible...

980
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:46,137
Flint didn't want
anyone else to know...

981
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:50,020
but I just can't remember
what it was.

982
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:53,695
A mind is a terrible thing
to lose!

983
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:59,425
I think I found your mind.
Hold still.

984
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:02,139
Your hands are very, very cold.

985
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:09,905
You know, Jimmy,
I was just thinking...

986
01:12:09,946 --> 01:12:12,255
I was just think...

987
01:12:12,306 --> 01:12:15,218
It's all flooding back!
All my memories!

988
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:16,858
Right up until Flint
pulled my memory circuits...

989
01:12:16,906 --> 01:12:20,694
so I could never tell anybody
about his booby trap!

990
01:12:20,746 --> 01:12:22,145
Speaking of which...

991
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:28,180
Flint wanted to make sure that
nobody stole his treasure...

992
01:12:28,226 --> 01:12:29,545
so he rigged
this whole planet...

993
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:32,578
to blow higher
than a Kalepsian kite!

994
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:44,663
Run, Jimmy!
Run for your life!

995
01:12:44,706 --> 01:12:46,298
Go back and help
the captain and Doc!

996
01:12:46,346 --> 01:12:49,383
If I'm not there in 5 minutes,
leave without me.

997
01:12:49,426 --> 01:12:52,498
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.

998
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:55,106
Unless he looks at me
like that.

999
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:19,220
Come back here, ya blighters!

1000
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:39,055
All my life, I dreamed of
an adventure like this.

1001
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:43,224
I'm just sorry I couldn't
have been more helpful.

1002
01:13:43,266 --> 01:13:45,143
Don't be daft.

1003
01:13:45,186 --> 01:13:48,735
You've been very helpful.
Truly.

1004
01:13:48,786 --> 01:13:52,699
I feel like such
a useless weakling...

1005
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:56,375
with abnormally thin wrists.

1006
01:13:56,426 --> 01:13:59,577
Excuse me, brutish pirate.

1007
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:01,298
Yes, you. I have a question.

1008
01:14:01,346 --> 01:14:03,541
Is it that your body
is too massive...

1009
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:05,019
for your teeny-tiny head...

1010
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,421
or is it that your head
is too teeny-tiny...

1011
01:14:07,466 --> 01:14:10,185
for your big, fat body?

1012
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:12,262
I pummel you good!

1013
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:14,536
I'm sure you will,
but before you do...

1014
01:14:14,586 --> 01:14:17,578
I have one more question.
Is this yours?

1015
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:28,338
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!

1016
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:35,095
Aren't you the seventh wonder
of the universe?

1017
01:14:35,146 --> 01:14:37,580
Get back!

1018
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:45,260
I like you, lad,
but I've come too far...

1019
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:48,457
to let you stand
between me and me treasure.

1020
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:09,345
Oh, no, you don't!

1021
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,820
What?

1022
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:28,816
Reach for me now!

1023
01:15:28,866 --> 01:15:31,699
Reach!

1024
01:15:31,746 --> 01:15:33,384
I can't!

1025
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:52,302
Blast me for a fool!

1026
01:16:14,562 --> 01:16:16,439
Silver, you gave up?

1027
01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:20,157
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.

1028
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:21,920
Aloha, Jimmy!

1029
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,914
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes...

1030
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:28,840
and thirty-four seconds
till planet's destruction!

1031
01:16:28,882 --> 01:16:32,192
You're doing fine, Doctor.
Ease her over gently.

1032
01:16:34,642 --> 01:16:37,554
We were better off
on exploding planet!

1033
01:16:39,802 --> 01:16:41,554
Take us out of here, metal man!

1034
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,115
Aye, Captain!

1035
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:49,241
Captain, you dropped from
the heavens in the nick of...

1036
01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:51,955
Save your claptrap
for the judge, Silver!

1037
01:17:01,882 --> 01:17:03,440
Mizzen sail demobilised,
Captain!

1038
01:17:03,482 --> 01:17:05,313
Thrusters at only
thirty percent of capacity.

1039
01:17:05,362 --> 01:17:07,193
Thirty percent?
That means...

1040
01:17:07,242 --> 01:17:10,154
We'll never clear
the planet's explosion in time.

1041
01:17:17,722 --> 01:17:20,475
- We gotta turn around.
- What?

1042
01:17:20,522 --> 01:17:23,275
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!

1043
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:25,472
Pardon me, Jim,
but didn't that portal open...

1044
01:17:25,522 --> 01:17:27,558
onto a raging inferno?

1045
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,435
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.

1046
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:34,270
I'm gonna open
a different door.

1047
01:17:34,322 --> 01:17:35,596
Captain, really, I don't see
how this is possible...

1048
01:17:35,642 --> 01:17:37,758
Listen to the boy!

1049
01:17:37,802 --> 01:17:40,157
One minute, twenty-nine seconds
till planet's destruction!

1050
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:43,672
- What do you need, Jim?
- Some way to attach this.

1051
01:17:43,722 --> 01:17:45,997
Alright. Stand back, now.

1052
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,952
- There you go.
- There you go.

1053
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,237
No matter what happens...

1054
01:17:54,282 --> 01:17:56,716
keep the ship heading
straight for that portal.

1055
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:59,481
Fifty-eight seconds!

1056
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:08,033
You heard him!

1057
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:11,313
Get this blasted heap
turned 'round!

1058
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:13,751
Doctor,
head us back to the portal.

1059
01:18:13,802 --> 01:18:15,201
Aye, Captain.

1060
01:18:36,762 --> 01:18:38,400
Go to the right!

1061
01:18:38,442 --> 01:18:41,991
I know, I know!
Will you let me drive?

1062
01:18:44,162 --> 01:18:45,993
Twenty-five seconds!

1063
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,074
Come on, lad.

1064
01:18:58,522 --> 01:19:01,275
Seventeen seconds!

1065
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:19,834
Seven... six... five... four...

1066
01:19:19,882 --> 01:19:22,396
three... two...

1067
01:19:33,362 --> 01:19:35,876
You done it, Jimmy!

1068
01:19:35,922 --> 01:19:38,072
You done it, boy!

1069
01:19:39,402 --> 01:19:41,870
Didn't I say the lad
had greatness in him?

1070
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:57,152
Unorthodox,
but ludicrously effective.

1071
01:19:57,202 --> 01:19:58,954
I'd be proud
to recommend you...

1072
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:02,677
to the Interstellar Academy.
They could use a man like you.

1073
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:05,520
Wait until your mother
hears about this!

1074
01:20:05,562 --> 01:20:07,553
We may downplay
the life-threatening parts.

1075
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:11,390
Jimmy,
that was unforgettable!

1076
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:12,841
I know you don't like
touching...

1077
01:20:12,882 --> 01:20:15,760
but get ready for a hug,
big guy!

1078
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:20,958
You hugged me back.

1079
01:20:21,002 --> 01:20:23,914
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

1080
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:31,553
Does anyone have a tissue?

1081
01:20:33,948 --> 01:20:37,020
- Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
- I know.

1082
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:39,184
You never quit, do you?

1083
01:20:42,028 --> 01:20:44,019
I was merely
checking to make sure...

1084
01:20:44,068 --> 01:20:46,946
our last longboat
was safe and secure.

1085
01:20:50,508 --> 01:20:51,736
Well...

1086
01:20:53,108 --> 01:20:54,905
that should hold it.

1087
01:20:54,948 --> 01:20:57,542
I taught you too well.

1088
01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:02,944
If you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1089
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:06,424
Little Morphy here,
he's a free spirit.

1090
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:12,703
Being in a cage,
it'd break his heart.

1091
01:21:28,268 --> 01:21:31,624
What say you ship out
with us, lad?

1092
01:21:31,668 --> 01:21:33,863
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver...

1093
01:21:33,908 --> 01:21:38,504
full of ourselves
and no ties to anyone!

1094
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:44,746
You know,
when I got on this boat...

1095
01:21:44,788 --> 01:21:48,701
I would've taken you up
on that offer in a second...

1096
01:21:48,748 --> 01:21:52,980
but I met this old cyborg...

1097
01:21:53,028 --> 01:21:56,225
and he taught me that
I could chart my own course.

1098
01:21:58,868 --> 01:22:00,381
That's what I'm gonna do.

1099
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:06,697
And what do you see
of that pal of yours?

1100
01:22:06,748 --> 01:22:08,261
A future.

1101
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:10,742
Why...

1102
01:22:10,788 --> 01:22:15,623
Iook at ya,
glowing like a solar fire.

1103
01:22:15,668 --> 01:22:18,228
You're something special, Jim.

1104
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:22,261
You're gonna rattle the stars,
you are.

1105
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:34,747
Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

1106
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:42,383
Hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?

1107
01:22:42,428 --> 01:22:43,656
See ya around.

1108
01:22:52,548 --> 01:22:56,097
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

1109
01:22:56,148 --> 01:23:01,176
I need you to keep an eye
on this here pup.

1110
01:23:03,428 --> 01:23:05,942
Will ya do me
that little favour?

1111
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:07,501
Aye-aye, Captain.

1112
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:17,504
And one more thing.

1113
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:19,857
This is for your dear mother...

1114
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:22,900
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1115
01:23:24,948 --> 01:23:25,068
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scallywag.

1116
01:23:25,068 --> 01:23:27,980
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scallywag.

1117
01:23:28,028 --> 01:23:33,341
Why, Jimbo, lad,
when have I ever done otherwise?

1118
01:25:34,428 --> 01:25:38,706
It's good to see the sun
and feel this place

1119
01:25:38,748 --> 01:25:42,582
This place I never thought
would feel like home

1120
01:25:42,628 --> 01:25:45,062
And I ran forever

1121
01:25:45,108 --> 01:25:46,826
Far away

1122
01:25:46,868 --> 01:25:51,259
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone

1123
01:25:51,308 --> 01:25:54,778
Somehow the world has changed

1124
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:57,501
And I've come home

1125
01:25:57,548 --> 01:26:01,063
To give you back the things
they took from you

1126
01:26:01,108 --> 01:26:03,417
And I feel you now

1127
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:05,743
I'm not alone

1128
01:26:05,788 --> 01:26:11,545
I always know where you are

1129
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:13,943
When I see myself

1130
01:26:13,988 --> 01:26:20,063
I always know where you are

1131
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:24,863
Where you are

1132
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:28,696
And I found something
that was always there

1133
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:32,900
Sometimes it's got to hurt
before you feel

1134
01:26:32,948 --> 01:26:37,180
But now I'm strong,
and I won't kneel

1135
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:41,346
Except to thank
who's watching over me

1136
01:26:41,388 --> 01:26:45,097
And somehow I feel so strong

1137
01:26:45,148 --> 01:26:47,537
And I've begun

1138
01:26:47,588 --> 01:26:51,137
To be the one
I never thought I'd be

1139
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:53,065
And I feel you now

1140
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:55,542
I'm not alone

1141
01:26:55,588 --> 01:27:01,424
I always know where you are

1142
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:03,823
And when I see myself

1143
01:27:03,868 --> 01:27:09,977
I always know where you are

1144
01:27:10,028 --> 01:27:15,148
Where you are

1145
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:18,578
Now it's all so clear

1146
01:27:18,628 --> 01:27:20,903
And I believe

1147
01:27:20,948 --> 01:27:24,657
That everything's been
opened up to me

1148
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:26,699
And I feel you now

1149
01:27:26,748 --> 01:27:30,741
I'm not alone, I always know

1150
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:37,182
I always know where you are

1151
01:27:37,228 --> 01:27:39,298
And when I see myself

1152
01:27:39,348 --> 01:27:45,503
I always know where you are

1153
01:27:45,548 --> 01:27:47,459
And when I feel the sun

1154
01:27:47,508 --> 01:27:53,663
I always know where you are

1155
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:56,097
And when I see myself

1156
01:27:56,148 --> 01:28:02,144
I always know where you are

1157
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:07,626
Where you are
