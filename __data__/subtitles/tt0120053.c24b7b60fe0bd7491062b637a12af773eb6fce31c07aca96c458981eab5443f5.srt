1
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,969
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer in...

2
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,934
In Sumeria.

3
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,604
And what happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

4
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:08,235
Jesus' disciples performed miracles.
When Simon Magus saw the miracles

5
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,279
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

6
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,199
And how did Peter respond?

7
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,077
John Rossi?

8
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,372
Stand up.

9
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,713
Answer my question, John Rossi.

10
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,175
That's not my name.

11
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:36,805
You and all the other bastards
lucky enough to be here,

12
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:43,395
children of sin, spawn of the damned,
are all named for saints!

13
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,898
Saints who were disciplined.

14
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,900
Saints who were chaste.

15
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,988
You were named
for John Baptist Rossi,

16
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,825
a Capuchin priest who gave away
all his possessions.

17
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,871
A man who had nothing, like you.

18
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:07,585
Now what is your name,
you ungrateful cur?

19
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,350
Your name, boy!

20
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:29,065
Have you lost your tongue?
What is your name?

21
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:41,661
All the girls will remain
locked in their dormitory

22
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,622
and no food will be served
to any boy

23
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,086
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

24
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,903
Food, food, food!

25
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:07,747
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

26
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,709
No. Simon Templar.

27
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,681
Agnes!

28
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,976
Agnes!

29
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,359
Agnes!

30
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,745
- What are you doing?
- Agnes!

31
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,172
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

32
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,549
It won't happen,
because we're leaving tonight,

33
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,218
this hardy brotherhood,
on a crusade.

34
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,431
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love, to bid you farewell.

35
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,726
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss, can I?

36
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,895
Hey, watch this.

37
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,831
We've lost some girls!
The girls are missing!

38
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,335
There are girls missing!
Come on, boys, hurry up.

39
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,004
Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!

40
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:47,180
Wait, John Rossi, my kiss.

41
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,688
There he is! Get him!

42
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>October 3rd, entering
foyer of Tretiak Industries.</i>

43
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,966
<i>Heavy security in the elevators.
Guards in uniform.</i>

44
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,761
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate pass key.

45
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,391
Maybe use stairs. No traffic there.

46
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,479
October 4th. Personal tidbits.

47
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,233
<i>Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.</i>

48
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,195
<i>It left Tretiak the sole owner
of gas and oil empire.</i>

49
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,492
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

50
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,328
Who are you?

51
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,957
<i>Vehicle was driven
by younger son, Ilya, now 27.</i>

52
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,086
Wife now lives in Geneva following
an assassination attempt in 1996.

53
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,298
<i>- I'm Ivan Ivanovich.
- No other children.</i>

54
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:08,261
October 5th. llya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado with Bandido buddies.

55
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,556
Gangster rap coffee
flirting with teenage girls.

56
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,684
Small firearms in coats,
machine pistols in cars.

57
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>...compulsory military service.</i>

58
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,859
<i>Family company employs all four
as fix-it guys...</i>

59
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:39,310
There were three great
empires that dominated the world,

60
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,438
<i>both culturally and militarily:</i>

61
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:47,527
Rome, Constantinople and Russia.

62
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:52,990
All three have fallen.
Only one can be restored.

63
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,703
And only one man can restore it:

64
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,373
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

65
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:28,484
Friends. Countrymen. Russians!

66
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,912
You people here in this room...

67
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,166
are the cream of Russia.

68
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:48,379
<i>And the whole nation
is listening with us.</i>

69
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,049
But why do you all listen to me rave?

70
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:56,763
Set aside my oil company,
forget about my best-selling book,

71
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,770
<i>And all I am is a lunatic
haunted by the fantasy</i>

72
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:10,151
<i>of an empire that reclaims
her former might, her former size.</i>

73
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:20,203
<i>All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of Russia</i>

74
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,291
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth!

75
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,923
<i>Not ridiculed, but revered!</i>

76
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:38,429
No, more than revered. Feared!

77
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:53,152
But who am I to dazzle you
with this dream? All I've done...

78
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,407
How does it look for the leader's son
to walk out when the leader speaks?

79
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,538
You'd prefer the leader's son
to piss his pants on live TV?

80
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,544
And still the people
freeze to death!

81
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,397
I love this country.

82
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,324
I don't speak Russian.

83
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:50,746
In that case, stand up,
put your hands behind your head

84
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,666
and turn around slowly.

85
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,382
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

86
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:13,144
Listen, if I give this to you,
you're gonna give it to your daddy.

87
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,231
And what's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

88
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,317
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me a million dollars.

89
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,820
If we partner,
we'll split 50-50,

90
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,739
that's half a million
in hard currency.

91
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,575
Think of the drugs
you could buy with that much cake.

92
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,578
You'll be discoing for a decade
in Moscow, mate.

93
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:35,291
I don't need your small change.
That's your first problem.

94
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,793
Here is your second.

95
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,589
Microchip, please.

96
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,303
- Freeze!
- Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

97
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,806
Suck me sideways.

98
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,927
My eyes!

99
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,032
Give it up!

100
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,915
You've got no place to go!

101
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,764
A goddamn button!

102
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,484
Back of the building! Come on!

103
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,251
- Where's the body?
- No body. Just some guy in rags.

104
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,778
<i>As the bitter chill of
winter descends on Moscow,</i>

105
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,364
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric

106
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,908
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

107
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:00,537
<i>Now, a billionaire oil magnate
and leader of his own political party,</i>

108
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,208
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia

109
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,754
<i>will only worsen unless reformist
President Karpov can overcome</i>

110
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,384
the heating oil shortage that has
already killed scores of Russians.

111
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,888
In his speech today, Tretiak called
on elements of the Russian army

112
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,809
who are opposed to the elected
government, to seize control

113
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,103
and end the heating oil crisis...

114
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,646
What beautiful work.

115
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,817
<i>...angry siege
at the American embassy.</i>

116
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:35,239
Fired by Tretiak's attacks on U. S.
foreign policy, the protesters...

117
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,534
Cloisonnï¿½. It is old.

118
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,495
Yes. It belonged to my grandmother.

119
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,250
Please.

120
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:55,009
Tonight I feel like the oldest person
on this plane.

121
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,971
My husband,
he's sending me to England

122
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,640
to live until things change.

123
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,102
You are married not even a year

124
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,647
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend!

125
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,192
I'm sorry, it's not my business.

126
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,449
How come you know
so much about me?

127
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,617
It is a gift.

128
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,372
I am Martin de Porres.

129
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:28,542
I'm from Spain, but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint

130
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:33,213
who could cure the sick
or the injured by the laying of hands.

131
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,481
He's the same build as the description
the Russians gave us,

132
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,649
but he doesn't sound
like an Aussie.

133
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,447
He could be faking it.

134
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:10,209
X- rays are clear, he hasn't
swallowed the microchip. Anything?

135
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>You English with your fish and chips.
On the plane I have chicken.</i>

136
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,842
Van Gogh theft, Netherlands,
last year. Same eyes.

137
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,386
Different chin.

138
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,223
Halcyon Hotel, sir.

139
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,569
Stand up! What is your name?

140
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,571
Answer the question!

141
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,367
What is your name... Name... Name...

142
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:34,376
Hey, Lou. The microchip arrived.
I put the dough in your Swiss account.

143
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,295
Sorry I didn't get back to you
about the diamonds.

144
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,046
But Moscow's like Dodge City now.

145
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,382
All them greedy commies have turned
into capitalists.

146
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,301
It's disgusting.
It's made them sloppy.

147
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,346
One or two more easy score,
I top 50 mill, I'm out of the game.

148
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,599
- Yeah, I heard that before.
- Not from me.

149
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,518
I don't know nothing. If you don't
believe me, try and find me.

150
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>- Fuck you, Lou!
- Cheers.</i>

151
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,903
I can't seem to break 50.

152
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,874
"One million U.S. dollars,

Had the wine, the women, the songs,
and then, inexplicably,

165
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,396
took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit

166
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,482
went off to live in the forest,

I'm his business manager.
I speak for him.

Come on, Father, let's go.

00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,917
Wait, sit down. Listen and learn.

172
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,502
Youth.

173
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:32,262
Who runs this thief?
CIA? MI-6? Libya?

174
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,891
He's not a race car, nobody runs him.
He's an independent contractor.

175
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,436
Good. Then no one will mind
if I kill him.

176
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:45,484
Yes, I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that.

177
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,905
Even with metal detectors.
Even in this transit lounge.

178
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,037
It's so early. You guys want
to get some coffee or something?

179
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,956
Sure.

180
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,420
Be quiet.

181
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,131
What is it you request
of my employer?

182
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,052
- Do you know what cold fusion is?
- Of course.

183
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,807
It's the theory of nuclear fusion
at room temperature.

184
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,726
- Free energy forever.
- Yes.

185
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,192
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

186
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,319
Those who claim
to have achieved it,

187
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,613
have never been able to duplicate it.

188
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,240
Until now.

189
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,662
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

190
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,084
We believe that this good lady
made a breakthrough in cold fusion.

191
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,338
Your employer will obtain
the formula for me.

192
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,717
He's very busy.
And you're very boring.

193
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,052
Your offer must inspire him.

194
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,930
This woman has repeatedly avoided

195
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,308
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

196
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,061
She's cagey, difficult.

197
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,898
Maybe your agents are stupid.

198
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:15,115
I think this inspiration
would cost you three million dollars.

199
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,368
- Ridiculous.
- Why?

200
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,621
You'll have the world market
in energy.

201
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:26,001
Cost you a nickel for every million
you make. His deposit should go...

202
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,297
It is not for me.
It is for Mother Russia.

203
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,301
But you want Mother Russia too,
Mr. Tretiak.

204
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:38,847
Three million on deposit
in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?

205
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,725
Yes.

206
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:47,397
And how long to get
your employer's agreement?

207
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,774
I'll ask.

208
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,792
Your offer has inspired her.
I'll do it.

209
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,296
Bank account number in Zurich.

210
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,509
- Bye, sonny.
- Bye-bye.

211
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,554
I really love this guy.

212
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:28,230
- Too bad we have to kill him.
- Yeah, too bad.

213
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,458
When the electro-chemists Hans
and Fleischman announced in 1989

214
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,503
that they had discovered cold fusion,

215
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,465
a revolutionary process
of generating energy,

216
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,719
They were at first
acclaimed as geniuses,

217
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,430
and then condemned as charlatans.

218
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,643
The protocols of cold fusion...

219
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,854
What are those? Drugs?

220
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,483
Can I have one? My head is pounding.
She's boring the life out of me.

221
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,153
They're for my heart.

222
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:22,534
You have very pretty eyes.
Pretty lady.

223
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,327
- Who are you?
- Me?

224
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,913
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

225
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,624
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

226
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,295
You don't put any stock in this
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

227
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,880
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

228
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,674
Dr. Emma Russell!

229
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:56,610
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

230
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,822
I'm more interested
in what questions you all have

231
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,324
about cold fusion.

232
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,119
So I thought we would start
with those. Any questions?

233
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,167
- Please?
- Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.

234
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:17,380
Can you explain the actual process
of fusion? You know, the theory?

235
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,300
Yes. There it is.

236
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,720
This is the apparatus.

237
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,892
And very simply,
when positively charged deuterons

238
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,478
are attracted
to the palladium cathode,

239
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,521
they cram together.

240
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:38,109
There are millions and millions
of them getting closer and closer,

241
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:43,114
and then they fuse. And they create
energy in the form of helium.

242
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:47,327
But I read that the experiment
couldn't be replicated. So...

243
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,373
- How do we know it works?
- Well, we don't.

244
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,708
Not yet.

245
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,547
But if you remember, Einstein knew
the theory of relativity to be true

246
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,218
long before he could prove it.
He felt the truth.

247
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:08,306
And some of us feel the same way
about cold fusion.

248
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,725
Because it's there, it's in nature,

249
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:15,271
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

250
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:20,110
And when we ignite
that cold fusion fire,

251
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,696
I mean, just imagine...

252
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,158
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of sea water

253
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,328
than in all the known
oil reserves on Earth.

254
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:37,085
You could drive your car 55 million
miles on a gallon of heavy water.

255
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:42,799
It would be the end of pollution.
Warmth for the whole world.

256
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,554
So why don't I demonstrate for you

257
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:51,891
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

258
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,978
They use very complex...

259
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,190
November 17th, 11. 30 a. m.

260
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:03,778
Entering flat of Dr. Emma Russell,
High Street, Oxford.

261
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,240
No alarms on outer doors. Strange.

262
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,325
No messages.

263
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,041
Shelley monument.

264
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,128
Entering bathroom.

265
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,213
Books.

266
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,426
More books.

267
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,766
Walls covered with reminder notes.

268
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,144
Poetry.

269
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,202
Dad.

270
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,364
"Stop and talk to Shelley every day.
How can I love a man named Percy?

271
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:37,247
"Isn't there someone in the world
who can consume me like that?

272
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,708
"Magic. Romantic. "

273
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,886
No recent applications.
Cold fusion notes.

274
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,483
"Although I pass
the Shelley monument every day,

275
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,027
"its sadness strikes me every time.

276
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,282
"For some reason, I feel a very
personal loss when I look at it.

277
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,742
"So much pain and so much passion. "

278
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,584
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness,

279
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,211
"and in the shadow of death.

280
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,673
"Luke 1, Verse 79."

281
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:32,093
Tretiak's wrong, she's not cagey.

282
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:37,182
She's not difficult,
she's just eccentric.

283
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,684
She's innocent.

284
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,401
Maybe it's in her head.

285
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,571
She needs a poet.

286
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,531
An artist.

287
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,412
Someone who understands truth.

288
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,338
She needs Thomas Moore.

289
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,387
Do you like it?

290
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,726
- What?
- The sculpture. Do you like it?

291
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,481
Yes.

292
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,984
What do you love about it?

293
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:24,872
The way it... glows.

294
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:32,046
And how the light
holds him in silence,

295
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,550
taking care of him.

296
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,595
Yeah, that's what I like about it.

297
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,810
- Are you an artist?
- No.

298
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:50,481
Just a traveler
searching for purity.

299
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,193
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

300
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,570
Yes.

301
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,743
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

302
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,495
No, not really.

303
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,335
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home in Africa.

304
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:16,507
You should experience the energy
of where all life began.

305
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,974
Sorry, I'm not very good with people.

306
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,897
Me neither.

307
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,387
"I see my angel for the first time.

308
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,848
"Know my purpose, feel my birth.

309
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,144
"Hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly,

310
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,731
"The sweet strains of our union,

311
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,485
"Our love heats up the cold universe

312
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,655
"And gives my tired,
desperate heart... "

313
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,160
...are eternally healed.

314
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,707
- Do you like it?
- Who did you write it for?

315
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,793
You.

316
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,630
You're following me or it's destiny.

317
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:42,135
- Either way, it's weird.
- Very weird.

318
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,972
Destiny, then.

319
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,943
This must look strange.

320
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:04,407
It's something that I'm working on.

321
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:09,704
A formula for creating energy.

322
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,915
That you carry around
in your underwear?

323
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,670
Yeah. I do.

324
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,727
How did you do that?

325
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,563
Magic.

326
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,857
Give it back.

327
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,777
- It looks like Sanskrit.
- Give it back.

328
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,366
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

329
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:53,998
- What else do you keep in there?
- Nothing.

330
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,917
That's not true.

331
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,795
Can I get you anything else?

332
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,424
Drink your wine.

333
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,469
Latour '57.

334
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,849
The Latour, sir,
is 400 pounds a bottle.

335
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,189
Then we'll have two bottles.

336
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,402
There, you count it.

337
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:33,037
All these little tubes and microbes.

338
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,624
- And molecules.
- Those too.

339
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:41,963
- Can I tell you something?
- What? You must. Everything.

340
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,341
- It's a secret.
- What?

341
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,719
I'm done.

342
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,059
My energy research, I'm finished.

343
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,895
I still have some sequencing
to work out

344
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,108
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

345
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,528
It's been you
against the whole world, hasn't it?

346
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,656
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

347
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,075
The gift of faith.

348
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,954
To see...

349
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,669
Well, to believe in something
that's all around us

350
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,089
but hidden from our sight.

351
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,384
It's a beautiful thought.

352
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,636
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

353
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,764
I don't even know your name.

354
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,767
My name is...

355
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:41,397
I don't want to tell you my name.
No, I don't want to do that.

356
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,402
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

357
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,866
- What's your name?
- Emma.

358
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,786
Emma. Now I know
everything about you.

359
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,999
You're a genius.

360
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,420
You have a weak heart.

361
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,925
You have beautiful dreams.

362
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,927
Great courage.

363
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,139
Unafraid in this world.

364
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,350
You get that from your father.

365
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,271
You can't cook to save your life.

366
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,899
And you love fish.

367
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,111
I do love fish.

368
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,572
That's weird.

369
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,742
- I want to try that.
- No.

370
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,037
- Yes.
- I don't want you to. Drink your wine.

371
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,043
Yes, I do.
What's your name?

372
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,755
My name is Thomas Moore.

373
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:51,550
I was named after a saint...

374
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,472
who died for his faith.

375
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,059
Okay.

376
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,854
Your work...

377
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,567
is very dangerous and alive.

378
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,698
And I love your poems.
They move me.

379
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,160
But that's not who you really are.

380
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:24,500
You're running away
from your past and your pain

381
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:29,255
and yet you keep it so close to you.

382
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,845
You don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

383
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,807
because you're beautiful.

384
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,742
What are you doing?

385
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:02,264
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
What happened?

386
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:07,520
I don't know,
I was weeping and I slipped.

387
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,189
I was thinking of you,
I don't know...

388
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:14,401
Well, I live right down the street,
I could clean you up.

389
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,571
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

390
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,281
- I don't know.
- Wait.

391
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:28,666
I'm glad that it stopped bleeding.
You don't need stitches.

392
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,216
We have to disinfect it, though.

393
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,927
You really are an angel.

394
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,596
You are.

395
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,268
This is gonna hurt.

396
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,105
I'm sorry.

397
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:57,027
- I'm sorry. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

398
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,656
I'm sorry, I was just joking.

399
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,494
- I should go.
- No.

400
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,080
Yes, you... I...

401
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:12,251
- Take off your pants.
- Pardon?

402
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:14,211
I mean, your sweater.

403
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,509
There's blood on it. I'll wash it.

404
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,849
You're very domestic.

405
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,104
There's blood on your blouse
as well.

406
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,108
I'll wash it.

407
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,124
Do you have any wine?

408
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:09,141
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

409
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,269
How could I not?

410
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,231
You make me feel so good.

411
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,942
I wish...

412
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,028
I wish you could understand.

413
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,865
I want you to know who I am.

414
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,259
Oh, my heart.

415
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,097
Don't disappear, I'll be right back.

416
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,173
You can't do this.
She's so great.

417
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:27,219
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.

418
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,539
Hi.

419
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:17,478
"To Spider. Must fly.
Have better offer. "

420
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,522
Greedy Westerner.
Wants more money.

421
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,568
Who cares?
Can't spend hard currency in hell.

422
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:32,076
Send this message:
"Fly. Don't buzz off.

423
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,621
"I'll double your fee.

424
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:41,543
<i>"Or send my own boys
to take care of the woman. "</i>

425
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,886
Are you okay?

426
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:57,476
I just want to lie here.

427
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,856
Can we just be like this tonight?

428
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,860
Is that what you want?

429
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,404
It's so magic.

430
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,412
It just feels so perfect.

431
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:50,612
It's 7:00 a. m.
and here are the news headlines...

432
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,290
Thomas?

433
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:22,037
- Lev Naumovitch! It's here.
- It's revolutionary, sir.

434
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:25,165
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas.

435
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,877
But I think the formula
is incomplete. It will take months...

436
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:30,379
But that won't do.

437
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,298
Now that the people
are beginning to freeze,

438
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:37,135
Tretiak must swoop in from the wings
with a miracle to save them.

439
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,389
- How high do you want it?
- To the top.

440
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:43,100
- Good morning, Yuri.
- Good morning.

441
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,896
Perhaps I can confirm the validity
of this formula more quickly

442
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,566
if I dispense
with certain protocols. But...

443
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,946
How long, Dr. Botvin, since you
received your last salary check

444
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,699
from Moscow University?

445
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:01,868
Ukrainian Independence Day.

446
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,288
Last August.

447
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:08,959
Ivan, he's online.

448
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,421
Do it.

449
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:20,679
"To Spider. You've got the recipe... "

450
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,391
- "Where's my dough?"
- "To Human Fly.

451
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:31,148
"Recipe incomplete.
The cake won't rise.

452
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,817
"Hence, no dough. "

453
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:45,245
- "I'm not the baker. "
- "Don't make me the butcher. "

454
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,416
I like this guy.

455
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,548
"No play, no pay.

456
00:52:56,716 --> 00:53:00,177
"I'm certain you kept the cookbook. "

457
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:09,978
Holland Park.

458
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,081
I'll check that for you. Yes,
that seems to be fine. One moment.

459
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,551
He's keeping me online.

460
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,063
You wait here.

461
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,317
You! Beside the car!

462
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,780
Now turn around!
Step away from the vehicle!

463
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,282
He's armed!

464
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:09,973
Come on, drive!

465
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,651
Go the other way! Go!

466
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:35,957
What about him?

467
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,009
What about this one?

468
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,599
Yeah, that...

469
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,061
You see, we believe
they're all the same villain.

470
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,359
Oh, my God.

471
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:08,198
- They're all him?
- We believe so.

472
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,952
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

473
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,914
Then he fled the U K out of Heathrow.

474
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,625
We've got a handful of
false identities used on

475
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,378
visas, passports, leases...

476
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,632
Nicholas Owen.
Louis Guanella.

477
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,592
Peter Damian.

478
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,470
Charles Borromeo.

479
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,306
Of course.

480
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:38,645
Thomas Moore.
All the names of Catholic saints.

481
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:47,779
Can you access Heathrow's passenger
lists for the last... eight hours?

482
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,241
- I think it might be possible.
- Good.

483
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,354
Yes!

484
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,199
Yes!

485
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:50,008
See, my friends,
you back the biggest rat.

486
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:20,330
Out! Out! Freeloaders, out!

487
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,292
I want to drink alone.
Close the curtain!

488
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,109
- What?
- What?

489
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,612
Don't look down.

490
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:57,117
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

491
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,620
I'm the thief you tried to cheat.

492
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,915
And this is your accountant.

493
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,877
Talk to him.

494
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,508
The phone goes the other way,
you moron.

495
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,098
Hello? Tretiak speaking.

496
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:25,186
That money to Zurich, send it now.

497
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,313
I said now.

498
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:29,899
Yeah.

499
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:33,945
Thank you.

500
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:38,199
Do you know what the hardest part
about being you is?

501
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,536
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

502
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,540
You son of a bitch!

503
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,752
There is an impostor in there!
Get him out!

504
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,337
Hey, hey. Hey.

505
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,175
Take your hands off me, you idiots!

506
00:59:55,342 --> 01:00:00,138
Are you crazy? It's me!
Go! Get him! Go!

507
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,557
Ilya, get the bastard!

508
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:27,373
Fifty million. I'm out.

509
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:34,088
Mr. Ferrer, checking out.

510
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,100
I'll have one too.

511
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,063
- Emma.
- Hi.

512
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,734
I am... I'm overwhelmed.

513
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,197
- You found me.
- It wasn't very hard.

514
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,660
Two men with saints' names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

515
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:08,331
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African.

516
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,500
Whereas Vincent Ferrer...

517
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,002
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

518
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,921
How could you do it?

519
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:20,260
Emma, I had to.

520
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:24,722
- I'm a thief.
- I want my cards back.

521
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,600
You flew all this way
because you want your cards?

522
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,937
- Yes, I did.
- No. It's because you're in love.

523
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,735
- I rest my case.
- Who are you?

524
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,238
No one has a clue, least of all me.

525
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,077
And why would you steal
cold fusion? It's free.

526
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,205
Why would you do that?

527
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,919
- Eight million reasons.
- Eight million? Is that all?

528
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:01,968
I would have given them to you
if you'd only asked.

529
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,851
You've got to get away from me.

530
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,229
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why you lied to me.

531
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,940
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

532
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:18,693
You almost got me killed. The guy
I stole it for says it doesn't work.

533
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,447
- Well, screw him!
- I don't think you'd enjoy that.

534
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,450
Yeah, you're right,
I don't think I would.

535
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,835
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

536
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,017
- They took my pills.
- No, I palmed them from your purse.

537
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:56,689
I need one or two, I need...
I have a bad heart and...

538
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,651
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

539
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:04,989
It's okay, I've got your pills.
I've got two in my hand.

540
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:08,284
- I'm gonna pass out.
- Sit down on the floor.

541
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:13,164
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

542
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:16,709
That's right, eat two out of my hand.
That's right.

543
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:18,670
Okay?

544
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,297
While you're down there...

545
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:26,386
Get the pocketknife out of my boot.

546
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:32,350
This formula makes
certain assumptions

547
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:36,646
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes.

548
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:41,317
Testing at any level becomes futile
without any further information.

549
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,777
Mr. Tretiak.

550
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:47,490
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.
Help is here.

551
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,004
The two came very quietly.

552
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,515
And they left even more quietly.

553
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:17,186
Close the city. Kill him.

554
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,606
And bring her alive.

555
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,790
Why are they after me?

556
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:42,045
Tretiak, the guy I worked for,
owns this city. Cops and all.

557
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:45,840
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

558
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:48,593
What do you want from me?

559
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,144
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

560
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:02,106
- So the formula works?
- Kiss me again.

561
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:07,487
- No.
- Make up your mind.

562
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:12,492
I... I have to figure out the order
before the formula works.

563
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,787
- I'm not gonna give it to him.
- Tretiak will find you.

564
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,082
- No.
- He found me, and that's very hard.

565
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,710
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

566
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,546
What do you need?

567
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,512
I need some time, and I need...

568
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,849
I need a place to work.

569
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:44,273
- Where's everyone going?
- To their country relatives.

570
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,069
To cut firewood.
There's no heat in this city.

571
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,414
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

572
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,874
I don't know.

573
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,295
- Two hours maybe. I don't know.
- It should be enough time...

574
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:10,258
to get our passports together
and for us to get married.

575
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,010
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

576
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:18,015
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

577
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,397
- You're not Martin.
- No.

578
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,441
Who are you?

579
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,071
I don't have a name.

580
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:35,116
Sad.

581
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:39,370
- Will you have one when we get home?
- I don't have a home.

582
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:43,332
When we get back, you do
the science, I'll do the math.

583
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:47,378
We'll market your formula around
the world, we'll make a fortune.

584
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,465
And then... we'll see.

585
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,062
Emma!

586
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,707
No trouble, okay?

587
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:31,088
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

588
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,592
I've got you.

589
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:46,849
Come on.

590
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,022
Here we go.

591
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,652
Now we've got to get you warm.

592
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,038
Come on, almost there.

593
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,816
Come on, come on.

594
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,242
You'll wait
till Christ comes to Moscow.

595
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:51,288
Elevator was made of mahogany.
Tenants used it for firewood.

596
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:56,377
We need your help.
He fell in the river. He's freezing.

597
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:59,505
- We're just people who...
- You're not people.

598
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,883
- You're Americans.
- Yes.

599
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,719
But we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

600
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:41,505
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys.

601
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:48,179
No heat for sale, but these clothes
will make you warm.

602
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:58,564
I said "Mashenka, go back to bed. "
She's always puttering around.

603
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,904
It's here. Built to escape...

604
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,240
the Secret Police. In you go.

605
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,465
You've got hypothermia.

606
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,718
We've have to get
these wet clothes off...

607
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,179
and keep you warm.

608
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,265
They must be
in one of these buildings.

609
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,017
Check every apartment.

610
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:40,272
How are you doing?
Talk to me.

611
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,733
Snug as a bug in a rug.

612
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:59,041
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature falls

613
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,377
below 95 degrees.

614
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:17,268
Two kids talking about foreigners.

615
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,571
Listen to me, tenants!

616
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:34,368
Show me where the Americans are.
You'll be paid in American dollars.

617
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,247
Five hundred bucks reward.

618
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:43,419
Have you seen by chance
two Americans?

619
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:49,383
Just one American and one polar bear.
Do I get 250?

620
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,405
We'll check upstairs.

621
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,669
What's your name?

622
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,215
Who are you really?

623
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,762
- Simon.
- Simon?

624
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:40,351
- So you were named for a saint.
- No, Simon the magician.

625
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:44,688
I did tricks. Tricks for Agnes.

626
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:49,026
That's how I got things.
Priests took everything.

627
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:54,156
Took Agnes. Dog's too big... Teeth...

628
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:59,703
She fell. I escaped.

629
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:02,748
I always escape.

630
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,043
I don't believe in magic anymore.

631
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,254
I do.

632
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:14,343
I've never felt like this before.

633
01:15:15,762 --> 01:15:17,137
How?

634
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,682
I'm freezing.

635
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:28,649
These are here!
These Americans are here!

636
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,820
These are here!

637
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:37,241
We've got to get out of here.
Are you okay? They're coming.

638
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,037
The Americans are here!

639
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,540
Hurry, put this on.

640
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,964
Here they are!

641
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,520
Upstairs!

642
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,540
Maybe we can jump.

643
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,709
Let's jump.

644
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:34,590
Run!

645
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,511
We need her alive, idiot!

646
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,182
The embassy's east of here.

647
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:48,497
You're late. Where have you been?
I've been waiting two hours.

648
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:53,836
I've got some beautiful paintings
for you to buy. In here, come on.

649
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,802
Don't fret,
it's just my curator, Toli.

650
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:03,554
I'm Alexa Frankievitch.

651
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:06,723
But being you're Americans,
you can call me Frankie.

652
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:10,352
- Okay, I've got money. We want...
- I know.

653
01:18:10,645 --> 01:18:13,021
The icon of the Virgin of the Don.

654
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,399
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

655
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,318
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American embassy.

656
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,864
Right. I need 10,000 dollars up front.

657
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:22,948
No.

658
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:27,369
Okay, 7,000, and not a penny less.

659
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,090
- Police?
- No. Tretiak's goons.

660
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,395
- Wait!
- Sasha, go east, to the embassy.

661
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,606
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

662
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:58,775
You're in Russia.
Everything's complicated.

663
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,237
- But you know the way?
- Like the face of a...

664
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,364
Bulgari chronograph.

665
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,876
I remember. This way.

666
01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:26,136
At last, water main. They shut it
down each afternoon in winter.

667
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:30,432
- What time do they turn it back on?
- You have five minutes.

668
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,476
- Plus or minus.
- Plus or minus?

669
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:35,228
It means several minutes
earlier or later.

670
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:38,649
Don't worry.
Third opening is under your embassy.

671
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,251
Quick, someone's coming.

672
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,927
Come on, come on.

673
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,814
Here's the second one.
Embassy's next.

674
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,737
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah, unless it's minus.

675
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:32,661
Damn! It's sealed.

676
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,873
- We'll have to go back.
- Come on.

677
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:02,941
Hurry!

678
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,618
Up you go!

679
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,652
The embassy's only
about a hundred yards away.

680
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:49,029
There's a car right above us.

681
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,865
Watch your head.

682
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:29,778
I'll create a diversion. Should take
you ten seconds to run to the gates.

683
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,822
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

684
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:35,826
- Okay, I can do that.
- You can do it.

685
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,580
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

686
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:43,416
I'll find you. You found me.

687
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,043
Yeah, I did.

688
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:51,651
I'm an American! Open the gate!
Open the gate.

689
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,115
Back off from the gate! Back off!

690
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,618
I said back off!

691
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,413
Stand back from the gate.

692
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,584
I said back off!

693
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,225
She out-ran you? How humiliating.

694
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,815
One shot left.

695
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:36,655
Can't come all the way to Russia
and not play Russian roulette.

696
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:40,659
Before you shoot me, don't you want
to know where all the money's hidden?

697
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,496
- Whose money?
- Tretiak's, yours.

698
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,207
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

699
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:51,044
- What are you saying?
- Your father's stashed billions.

700
01:24:51,212 --> 01:24:54,005
And I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

701
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,968
Where are all those hidden billions?

702
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,178
I know.

703
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,181
But I don't think I'm gonna tell you.

704
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:39,384
You're worse than all the others.
However, the burns will heal.

705
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:45,807
Maybe a little chance of scarring.
But I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

706
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:51,062
Lucky?
Look at me, I'm a damn devil.

707
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:01,323
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula,

708
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:08,079
and must conclude that it is not
merely incomplete, but impossible.

709
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:12,375
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.

710
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,337
I invest millions,

711
01:26:17,048 --> 01:26:19,883
and you can't make it work!

712
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,306
What are you doing with my money?

713
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:34,272
Do you think it comes so easy? No!

714
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:40,153
Sir, I have been working
for nearly two weeks without sleep.

715
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:45,450
At first blush, the theorem appears
quite impressive. Convincing.

716
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,035
It does?

717
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,794
Yes, it does.

718
01:26:56,629 --> 01:27:00,548
Good man. We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

719
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,804
<i>Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.</i>

720
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:08,807
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press.

721
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:14,104
From here to the airport are three
army checkpoints, all loyal to us.

722
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:19,651
Make sure they all get the message.
She doesn't leave Moscow alive.

723
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:26,533
Mr. President, as former
Vice Minister of Energy and Power,

724
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:31,704
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

725
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:34,916
And as our countrymen
freeze to death,

726
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,003
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology,

727
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:44,634
about which I'm hopelessly out of
my league from a scientific viewpoint.

728
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:47,846
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here,

729
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,349
Dr. Lev Botvin
from the University of Moscow.

730
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:56,729
Before we are dazzled by the good
news, let's dispense with the bad.

731
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:58,982
What is the price of this marvel?

732
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,485
The cost of research
and development are there,

733
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,946
which is all
you are asked to defray.

734
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:14,038
Ten billion in hard currency?

735
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:18,293
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

736
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,886
Where are you heading?

737
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:31,598
I thought we'd drink some vodka
to get warmer.

738
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:42,192
Like the miracle of socialism,
our miracle of cold fusion failed.

739
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:47,780
But no matter. We have sold
cold fusion to President Karpov.

740
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:51,409
We will use the scandal
of his failure to destroy him.

741
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:54,245
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

742
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,999
You're in a hurry, Ivan Petrovich.
That's one day.

743
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,460
Not now, old witch, we're working.

744
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:08,051
Think of it. In one day you can be
proud again to be a Russian general.

745
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:12,764
With a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

746
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,892
You have to fill out a form
before we put you on a flight.

747
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,852
Medical problems, that sort of thing.

748
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,981
- I have a heart condition.
- Do you need any medication?

749
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:27,195
Well, I haven't needed a pill.
That's strange.

750
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,532
Get a form from down the corridor.
I'll be back in ten.

751
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,202
- I'll be by your side to the airport.
- Thank you.

752
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,498
...where overnight a mob attacked

753
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:41,376
several companies
with ties to America.

754
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:45,380
Apparently, four U. S. citizens
were badly injured in the attack.

755
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:49,926
I'm told that American citizens are
asked to report to the U. S. embassy

756
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:52,679
for immediate evacuation...

757
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:56,599
- Excuse me, lady, you look lost.
- No, I'm fine.

758
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:02,438
May I help you? Allow me to introduce
myself. My name is August Christopher,

759
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:06,067
I was named after Saint Augustin,
who coined my favorite phrase:

760
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:10,321
"Give me chastity and constancy,
but do not give it yet. "

761
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:18,621
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

762
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,623
Are you coming with me?

763
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,501
No. But they are.

764
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,720
I need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

765
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:38,808
Find a quiet room, finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

766
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,435
My number's on the back.

767
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:44,564
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

768
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,026
We've got to do a deal with
the Russians or you'll never be safe.

769
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,902
Be good at school.

770
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:52,363
Wait!

771
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,951
- Don't you trust me, darling?
- Trust who?

772
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:01,080
- That hurts, Emma.
- I'm serious.

773
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:05,126
- What's your name?
- My name is August Christopher.

774
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,171
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

775
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:10,423
I mean, Vincent Ferrer.

776
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,800
I mean, Martin de Porres.

777
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,803
Thomas Moore.

778
01:31:17,014 --> 01:31:19,849
After all, you are my personal saint.

779
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:26,022
You have to be very good and usually
very dead to become a saint.

780
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,192
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

781
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,946
Now get to work.
Who's that man?

782
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,200
You're leaving on the transport
at 9 o'clock, ma'am?

783
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:41,496
Probably your last chance
out of here. Hurry, it's leaving.

784
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:46,626
The troops will depose the President

785
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:49,921
and install Ivan Tretiak as leader
of Russia.

786
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:54,342
<i>Moscow must be ringed with tanks
by early evening.</i>

787
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:59,806
<i>Don't worry, the people will follow
me. They'll be crying for revolution.</i>

788
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,724
Still no one's guessed

789
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:04,936
the simple truth
of where the heating oil went.

790
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:14,570
<i>Who would believe the sea of oil was
hidden under this very building?</i>

791
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:19,117
<i>Yuri, I understand your Natalia is...</i>

792
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,661
<i>Francis, you devil.</i>

793
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:23,996
<i>I heard you came down here
and you didn't call me.</i>

794
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,458
Give me a ring, Charles...

795
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:30,503
Lou, I've heard
on the grapevine

796
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,715
that you're brokering
a revolutionary new energy source.

797
01:32:34,842 --> 01:32:37,093
If it's as good as
it's cracked up to be,

798
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:40,054
I have friends
who can double your best offer.

799
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:45,351
<i>On deposit, in Zurich, within one
hour of delivery and confirmation.</i>

800
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:47,729
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

801
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:12,462
The work could be here.
This machine could work, couldn't it?

802
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,841
Who are you?

803
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:20,344
- A friend of Dr. Russell's.
- Dr. Russell...

804
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:25,975
What's this equation?
It's so simple, it's...

805
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:31,022
- The key to Dr. Russell's formula.
- Yes.

806
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:35,151
The alarm! You had better go.

807
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:39,197
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

808
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:47,371
- But Mr. Tretiak's rally is tonight.
- Can you make it work? Make it work.

809
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:54,921
- What is wrong here?
- It's the alarm.

810
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:01,886
I tripped.

811
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,396
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

812
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:17,652
You are Nikolai Protrovich...
Petrovich.

813
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,581
Tunnel built by KGB.

814
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,877
Leads to machine room in Kremlin.

815
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:38,464
Great. Do you happen to know
where the President's quarters are?

816
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:43,177
President Karpov is... there.

817
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:46,264
But there are many guards.

818
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:49,350
- So I suggest...
- An alternate route?

819
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,353
Money. Now.

820
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:56,232
Oh, ye of little faith.

821
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:04,407
Russia stands tonight
on the brink of a second revolution

822
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:07,118
as the number of deaths
from freezing mounts,

823
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:10,746
hundreds of thousands ofprotestors
have taken to the streets.

824
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:14,876
<i>Even as Russian President Karpov
is promising a mysterious solution</i>

825
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,044
to the crippling heating oil shortage,

826
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:21,549
troops opposed to the elected
government led by General Leo Sklarov,

827
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:24,427
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

828
01:35:24,595 --> 01:35:26,554
Angry, frightened citizens

829
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:29,265
are gathering outside the Kremlin
in Red Square.

830
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:33,352
But they're not braving the cold
for yet another a political rally.

831
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,606
They've been drawn here
by the promise of a revelation,

832
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,190
whatever that may be,

833
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:40,568
in what's become
a life and death struggle

834
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:43,821
for the future of democracy
in Russia.

835
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:03,150
- Mr. President, I'm your friend.
- What do you want?

836
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:10,908
I want to help you to destroy Tretiak.
I need you to listen for 30 seconds.

837
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:15,538
I'm all right! Stay outside.

838
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:17,790
Please, continue.

839
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:21,085
Tonight you're going to stand trial
on Red Square before the world.

840
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:24,505
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

841
01:37:24,965 --> 01:37:29,593
- Agree with this criminal?
- If you want to destroy Tretiak, yes.

842
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:50,448
Gruschev, take Mr. Karpov downstairs.
The wife stays here.

843
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:55,536
Hands off!
What you are doing is illegal.

844
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:59,165
- The people won't stand for it!
- They are too cold to stop it.

845
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:00,833
Who are you?

846
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:38,996
Friends! Countrymen! Russians!

847
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:53,427
You heard about this morning's
sensational event.

848
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:58,933
Shocking documents were recovered
from the president's secret files,

849
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:01,644
locked within his private safe.

850
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:06,607
The documents, which will be
published in today's papers,

851
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:13,197
prove that the traitor Karpov
was about to steal

852
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:17,618
over 40 trillion
of our precious Russian rubles

853
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:21,413
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

854
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:27,962
To add insult, millions of dollars
were to be paid

855
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:30,422
to this international criminal!

856
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:43,853
And for what was your president hoping
to bankrupt our national treasury?

857
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:49,233
<i>What you see is the fairy tale
called cold fusion.</i>

858
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:54,321
You pass electric current
into the machine,

859
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:58,450
and there is supposed to be
a chemical reaction!

860
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:03,747
Watch! It can't even light up
a tiny light-bulb!

861
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:06,542
Do you dare deny this, Mr. Karpov?

862
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:10,880
Absolutely not. I proudly admit it!

863
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:16,886
But enough puny failure!
Failure is in the past!

864
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:19,889
Begging is behind us!

865
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:23,767
The balance of power
is about to shift!

866
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,011
Miracle one.

867
01:41:03,934 --> 01:41:08,312
Karpov! Karpov! Karpov!

868
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:34,922
- Ilya!
- Go! Go, go, go!

869
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:41,804
I order all troops
loyal to Mother Russia

870
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:45,266
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

871
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:52,648
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

872
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:55,985
There was a miscommunication
somewhere in the chain of command.

873
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:03,492
Miracle two.

874
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:09,581
<i>The billionaire industrialist and his
son llya were taken to Lubyanka prison</i>

875
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:14,253
where they await trial along with
fellow conspirator General Sklarov.

876
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:17,756
Moscow woke today
to the forgotten sensation of warmth,

877
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:19,842
<i>as millions of gallons of heating oil</i>

878
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:24,013
flowed from a storage depot discovered
beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.

879
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:28,392
- He made no threat to contact you?
- He never had the chance.

880
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,145
- You'll tell us if he does?
- Yes.

881
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:35,357
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue, you see.

882
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:39,445
He charms women,
this so-called saint.

883
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,406
It seems it's his stock-in-trade.
No offense.

884
01:42:42,574 --> 01:42:48,537
I am offended. All I got from this
saint was near-death experiences.

885
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:50,581
Count yourself lucky.

886
01:42:50,749 --> 01:42:54,084
I have an important conference
to prepare for.

887
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,253
We understand. You have a life.

888
01:42:57,297 --> 01:43:00,299
- We appreciate you taking the time.
- No problem.

889
01:43:07,015 --> 01:43:08,766
She's in love with him.

890
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,296
I wanted to call
and tell you everything.

891
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:25,592
- It just hasn't been safe.
- I couldn't stop thinking about you.

892
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:32,516
So, have you... been busy?

893
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:37,229
Yeah, I've been working real hard.
Thank God I have my cards back.

894
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:41,525
You don't believe in that
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

895
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:44,361
You're a very pretty lady.

896
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:48,323
Oh, my God! That was you?

897
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:51,785
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

898
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:55,372
I thought you were an old biddy,

899
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:58,125
not a gorgeous
soon-to-be trillionaire.

900
01:44:58,585 --> 01:45:01,628
You know you're gonna be
the richest woman in the world?

901
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:05,215
- I am?
- Why do you think I'm hanging around?

902
01:45:12,682 --> 01:45:13,682
- Emma?
- Yeah?

903
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,726
My life is very strange.

904
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:17,769
I just...

905
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:25,027
I don't do anything normal.
I... I can't...

906
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:26,945
I know.

907
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:29,323
I know you.

908
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:31,867
I know your life.

909
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:35,537
- What do you want?
- I want you.

910
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:39,249
- For how long?
- It doesn't matter.

911
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:47,883
Tell me you love me.

912
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:51,637
I love you.

913
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:54,223
Simon...

914
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:57,351
I love you, Simon.

915
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,354
Miracle three.

916
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:29,675
Dear Simon, the pin is something
I've kept for years, God knows why.

917
01:46:30,176 --> 01:46:32,844
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

918
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:35,347
But don't worry,
you don't have to wear it.

919
01:46:35,682 --> 01:46:39,851
Ijust wanted you to have
something I loved.

920
01:46:40,353 --> 01:46:43,272
Simon, I've seen it requires
three miracles,

921
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:45,899
then I'd say, you've made it, my love.

922
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:48,485
<i>And so I hope you'll understand.</i>

923
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:52,364
Last night, it became clear to me
what I have to do this morning.

924
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:55,576
You see, I'm going to
give cold fusion to the world.

925
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,453
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again,

926
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:01,707
<i>that I'll know it's for you
and you'll know it's for me.</i>

927
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:06,837
<i>If cold fusion is free, then you
and I, Simon, will be free too.</i>

928
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:10,549
Listen. If you think giving away
everything in front of the world,

929
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:14,678
preventing us from making a fortune,
will accomplish anything,

930
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:17,764
you're absolutely right.

931
01:47:19,684 --> 01:47:21,643
Simon, what are you doing here?

932
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:27,316
- There are police everywhere.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

933
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:31,028
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

934
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:36,908
You'd better go.

935
01:47:50,048 --> 01:47:52,090
How am I gonna find you?

936
01:47:53,635 --> 01:47:56,136
I'll find you. You found me.

937
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:27,084
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction

938
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:30,587
after last week's
Moscow fireworks,

939
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:35,676
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell...

940
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:38,428
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

941
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:41,640
No.

942
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,559
Dr. Russell.

943
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:57,364
You don't believe in this
cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?

944
01:48:58,074 --> 01:48:59,074
No.

945
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:05,956
Well, we all know that cold fusion
has had a difficult childhood.

946
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:11,253
Those of us in the field are orphans,
bastards at best.

947
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:15,882
But difficult childhoods, I believe,
make the most interesting adults.

948
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:21,388
I know that most of you thought...

949
01:49:21,556 --> 01:49:24,975
I'm her biggest fan.
I think she's a fox.

950
01:49:26,728 --> 01:49:32,357
Some may feel that its practical
application is still speculative.

951
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:38,363
But I want to share with you how
that dream is slowly becoming reality.

952
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:43,869
Look at the time. Got to go.

953
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:50,167
With your help, we can all
work towards making the...

954
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:56,339
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

955
01:50:28,831 --> 01:50:30,874
Got you, you slippery son of a...

956
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,417
What's going on here?

957
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:40,091
Damn!

958
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:49,684
Donations totaling three billion
dollars were made today to

959
01:50:49,769 --> 01:50:54,314
<i>the Red Cross, The Salvation Army, and
the United Nations' Children's Fund.</i>

960
01:50:54,482 --> 01:50:58,944
The funds were wired from the account
ofjailed Russian tycoon Ivan Tretiak.

961
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:03,156
<i>In other philanthropic news,
a non-prof it research foundation</i>

962
01:51:03,324 --> 01:51:07,327
has been established
to develop cold fusion technology,

963
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,663
funded with an anonymous donation

964
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:13,291
and to be headed by Russian physicist,
Dr. Lev Botvin.

965
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:16,169
The E.J. Russell Foundation...
