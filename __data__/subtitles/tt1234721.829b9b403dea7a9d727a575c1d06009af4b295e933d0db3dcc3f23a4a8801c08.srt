1
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:54,910
And we're on
in four, three,

2
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,912
two, one.

3
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:02,835
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

4
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:05,004
could be made
completely safe.

5
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:08,090
And what if I told you that
this could be accomplished

6
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:09,383
without risking the life

7
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:12,344
of one single
law enforcement officer.

8
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,929
How do I know this?

9
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,223
Because it's happening
right now

10
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,601
in every country
in the world

11
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:20,478
but this one.

12
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,523
<i>I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to The Novak Element.</i>

13
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,780
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

14
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,907
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe

15
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,201
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

16
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,704
General Monroe,
welcome back.

17
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:39,955
<i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>

18
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,376
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

19
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:48,172
Could you walk us through
what we're seeing here?

20
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,549
<i>Well, this is
a routine operation.</i>

21
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:52,802
<i>We found that
random patrols</i>

22
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:56,263
<i>helped the local population to
feel safer and to trust us.</i>

23
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:57,348
It's amazing.

24
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,767
And what are
these colored dots

25
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,352
that we're seeing here,
General?

26
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,438
<i>These are our assets
on the ground.</i>

27
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:07,107
<i>In green,
we got the ED-209s.</i>

28
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,902
<i>They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.</i>

29
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,238
<i>Purple are
the smaller EM-208s.</i>

30
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,864
<i>They sweep and mop up.</i>

31
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,909
<i>And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.</i>

32
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,121
It is great to see
American machines

33
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,500
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

34
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,335
<i>All right, you guys, this is
a standard op, all right?</i>

35
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,795
<i>There's no
opposition expected.</i>

36
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:30,047
<i>I'm gonna set your markers
to code red.</i>

37
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,928
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

38
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:38,138
No red assets
have ever been lost.

39
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:39,348
Okay.
Okay?

40
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,766
Does that
make you feel better?

41
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,768
But, listen,

42
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,603
<i>keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.</i>

43
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:45,771
<i>Okay?</i>

44
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,106
<i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>

45
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,364
All right. Let's go.

46
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:02,454
<i>May peace
be upon you.</i>

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,292
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

48
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,878
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

49
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,963
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

50
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,559
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

51
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:26,312
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

52
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:28,564
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,776
Scott, get me
a shot of this.

54
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:35,529
<i>Your cooperation
is appreciated.</i>

55
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:38,532
<i>We apologize
for any inconvenience.</i>

56
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,328
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

57
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:51,503
Incredible.

58
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:53,923
Incredible!

59
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:58,344
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

60
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:01,597
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

61
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,892
General, you care
to comment on this?

62
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,436
<i>Well, Pat,
we had Vietnam,</i>

63
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,314
<i>we had Iraq,
we had Afghanistan.</i>

64
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,066
<i>Never again.</i>

65
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:15,611
<i>From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.</i>

66
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,488
<i>We can accomplish
our objectives</i>

67
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,615
<i>without any loss
to American lives</i>

68
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:23,035
<i>and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.</i>

69
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,954
And why wouldn't they?

70
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,373
For the first time
in their lives

71
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:29,792
they get to watch
their children grow up

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,754
in an environment
of safety and security.

73
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:35,798
Navid!

74
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,216
Get away from the window!

75
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,385
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

76
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,221
Come here! Come here right now!

77
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:43,389
Arash!

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,433
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,309
But he's just a kid.

80
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:47,726
Seven!

81
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,728
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

82
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,939
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

83
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,566
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

84
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,821
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

85
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:01,031
Navid!

86
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,574
Shut the door!

87
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:05,577
We're not here to kill any of them.

88
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,079
Got it?

89
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,290
The goal is to die on television.

90
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,291
Let's go!

91
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:13,585
<i>Kelly!</i>

92
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,337
<i>Can you hear me out there?</i>

93
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:18,340
<i>Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>

94
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:22,678
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

95
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:24,722
As you can see behind me,
they're working

96
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,598
in collaboration
with the robots

97
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:31,186
and obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

98
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,622
Don't make a move before I say...

99
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,833
I wanna make sure they're recording.

100
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:53,792
Yes!

101
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:54,668
Yes! Yes!

102
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:55,878
We're ready.

103
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,551
<i>You'll notice children</i>

104
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,678
<i>in the streets as well.
This is everyday life</i>

105
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,847
<i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>

106
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,395
<i>Oh, great.
Here, come here.</i>

107
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,605
<i>Stay put,
stay put, stay put.</i>

108
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,148
It's fine. Don't worry.
My guy's got it.

109
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,580
Navid! It's dangerous here!

110
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:32,414
Come away! Come...

111
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:33,916
Navid, where are you going?

112
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,877
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

113
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,337
What are you looking for? Navid!

114
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:40,923
Navid! Navid! What are you...

115
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,382
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

116
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,150
Oh, my God!

117
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:08,367
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

118
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:14,706
<i>Kelly?</i>

119
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,792
Kelly!
Are you all right? Kelly!

120
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,043
<i>We're okay, Pat.</i>

121
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,546
<i>Our robots have just repelled
some suicide bombers.</i>

122
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,339
I'm sorry, Kelly,

123
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:26,218
but for security reasons the Pentagon's
going to cut our feed to Tehran.

124
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,594
But, please, be careful.

125
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,471
<i>Yeah. I'll continue
to stand by.</i>

126
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,478
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

127
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:38,355
So then tell me.

128
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:42,860
Why can't we use these
machines here at home?

129
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:47,990
Why is America
so robophobic?

130
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,910
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars.

131
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,998
An entrepreneur
and true American

132
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:59,251
whose product just saved
my colleague's life.

133
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,628
And on the other.

134
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:04,131
Hubert Dreyfus.

135
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:08,260
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

136
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,723
whose bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

137
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,934
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

138
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:19,563
because they haven't
experienced this technology

139
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,774
and they fear
what they don't understand.

140
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,778
<i>We at The Novak Element
support Mr. Sellars' efforts</i>

141
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:30,199
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

142
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,284
After all,

143
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:36,413
what's more important than the
safety of the American people?

144
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,275
Hey, Murphy.
Hey.

145
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,904
How's Jack?

146
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,781
We don't know yet.

147
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,991
Murphy-
Hey.

148
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,993
How's it going?
Good.

149
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,042
What the hell
are they doing here?

150
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,045
Six in the morgue.
Lewis in the hospital.

151
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:27,047
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

152
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,091
We got a lead on Antoine
Vallon, we took it.

153
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,175
What lead?

154
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,427
Not in front of them.

155
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:34,846
This is bullshit. Yeah?

156
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,598
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

157
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:37,766
Vallon's our case.

158
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:41,687
Yeah, two years without no arrest, no
nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

159
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:45,107
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

160
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,192
No, it's nothing personal.

161
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,444
Although, I don't
like you as a person.

162
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:51,530
Okay, you two, out.

163
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,115
No problem.

164
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,951
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

165
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:57,577
your partner would
still be standing.

166
00:09:57,703 --> 00:09:59,496
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

167
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,875
Okay, Alex.

168
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,463
It's just you and me now.

169
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:11,550
So me and Jack, we've been
doin' some street buys.

170
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,218
We get a line on some guns.

171
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,888
<i>We meet up with this
low-level G called Jerry</i>

172
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,516
<i>who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.</i>

173
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,476
Where the hell you get a
gun like that, Jerry?

174
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,478
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

175
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,646
Two crates?

176
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:25,814
No disrespect, J,

177
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:27,733
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

178
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,067
What's it matter
where it comes from?

179
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,820
Why it matters, we don't
want no dirty guns, Jerry.

180
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:33,739
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

181
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:35,073
Yo, look,
they're clean, all right?

182
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:36,616
You gonna buy
this shit or not?

183
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,160
Why you acting
so nervous, man?

184
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,078
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

185
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:41,246
What'd you say?

186
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,332
You think he fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.

187
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,833
Yo, what the hell
are they talkin' about, man?

188
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,251
Hey, let me see your phone.

189
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:47,753
Let me see your phone.

190
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,046
I'm not showing you
my phone, man!

191
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,380
You recordin' this?

192
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:52,132
I think you're
a goddamn cop!

193
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:53,216
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

194
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,593
I'm not showing you
my phone!

195
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:55,761
Hey! Put your gun down!

196
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,054
Put your phones
on the table.

197
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,056
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

198
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:00,265
What?

199
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:02,225
Shut up! Shut up!
What'd you say?

200
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,394
Ends up he works
for Vallon.

201
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,356
Before the meet, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

202
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,691
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

203
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:12,444
<i>Not out on the street.</i>

204
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,696
<i>Intake papers blank.
No signatures.</i>

205
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:17,115
What do you got?
Nothin'.

206
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,785
How do you think
that happened?

207
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:23,705
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

208
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,792
These guys'll shoot you just
to see if they gun work.

209
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,251
We need backup.

210
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,712
If we call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station.

211
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,130
He's gonna disappear.

212
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:33,965
It's gonna be all right.

213
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,052
<i>MURPHY". So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,</i>

214
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:38,387
<i>and he bought it.</i>

215
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:42,474
What do you two need with that
much product? You plotting a coup?

216
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,811
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

217
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,896
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

218
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,024
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

219
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:52,984
Hey, boss.

220
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,987
What do you got for me?

221
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:58,782
Really?

222
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,660
<i>We were just about to close
the deal but someone tipped him off.</i>

223
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:04,246
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

224
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,831
Two minutes.

225
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,339
Make sure
you kill 'em both!

226
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:26,101
I got two handguns,
one automatic.

227
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,032
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

228
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,492
You sure about this?

229
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:05,849
You ready?

230
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:07,142
Move.

231
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:48,850
Lewis!

232
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:50,894
Lewis!

233
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:57,442
Officer down!
Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

234
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,069
This is Detective Alex Murphy

235
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,071
in need of immediate
medical assistance.

236
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,240
331 Hamilton Road.

237
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,283
Jack.

238
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,246
Jack, come on.
Jack. Can you hear me?

239
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:11,748
Jack. Stay with me.

240
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:13,792
Jack.

241
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:17,629
<i>Alex, you don't
do something like this</i>

242
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,464
unless you bring it
to me first.

243
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:20,966
Vallon's connected.

244
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:24,928
I'm warning you, don't make any
more moves until I vet this.

245
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,805
If officers are
supplying him with guns...

246
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:28,974
That's up to IAD.

247
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:30,934
I'll handle it.

248
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:41,278
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

249
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:45,991
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

250
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:48,535
It can't understand
the value of human life.

251
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,120
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

252
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,708
To legislate
over life and death,

253
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,587
we need people who
understand right from wrong.

254
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,006
What do your machines feel?

255
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:04,634
Well, they feel no anger.
They feel no prejudice.

256
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:09,347
They feel no fatigue, which makes
them ideal for law enforcement.

257
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:13,518
Putting these machines
on the streets

258
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,688
will save countless
American lives.

259
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,690
You're evading the question.
No, I'm not.

260
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:19,899
Yes,
you're evading the question.

261
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:23,445
I asked what do
these machines feel?

262
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:26,448
If one of them
killed a child,

263
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:28,992
what would it feel?

264
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,497
Nothing.
And that's the problem.

265
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:39,961
That's why 72% of Americans will not
stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

266
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:50,930
America is the world's most
valuable market, and we can't touch it.

267
00:15:51,222 --> 00:15:56,519
With a domestic expansion, we'd
clear $600 billion per annum.

268
00:15:56,686 --> 00:16:01,566
In other words, every second that law is
in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.

269
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:02,734
What do you
want me to do?

270
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:06,237
We've thrown cash at senators at both
sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.

271
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:08,323
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

272
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,534
So unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

273
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,662
Now, to that effect,

274
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:18,083
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

275
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:20,752
Wow factor
off-the-charts.

276
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,755
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

277
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,757
A figure
they can rally behind.

278
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,927
Sir, I have dissected this bill.
There are no loopholes.

279
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:30,762
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

280
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,055
Forget machines.

281
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,598
You saw the polls.

282
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,267
Americans don't
want a machine.

283
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,104
They want

284
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,940
a product
with a conscience.

285
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,526
They want

286
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:47,487
something that knows

287
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,032
what it feels like

288
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:52,575
to be human.

289
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,459
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

290
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:09,092
You're not you because
of your legs, your arms, your hands.

291
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,844
You're you because
of your brain.

292
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:15,348
It's your brain's capacity to process
information that makes you who you are.

293
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:20,979
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

294
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,609
I've never played
with these.

295
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:31,114
The music doesn't come from your fingers,
Michael, it comes from your mind.

296
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:33,241
All you have to do
is let it out.

297
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,326
Please.

298
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,650
Oh, my God.

299
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,573
No, it's okay. Easy.

300
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,328
His emotions are peaking. The
readings are getting clouded.

301
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:19,662
It's okay.

302
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,665
Relax. If you get
too emotional,

303
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,626
it'll change the chemistry
in your brain.

304
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,544
It'll throw the system out.

305
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,133
You're doing great.
Come on.

306
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,733
I need emotion to play.

307
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,694
Concierto <i>de
</i> Aranjuez, second movement.

308
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,572
Beautiful piece.

309
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:57,450
<i>Bennett, when you
have a moment. Thank you.</i>

310
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,703
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

311
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:04,499
I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

312
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,836
My work here is driven
by its own questions.

313
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,464
And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

314
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:14,300
Look, I think
I found a way

315
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:18,137
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

316
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:21,891
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

317
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,114
You're not
keeping up your end,

318
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,532
leaving me exposed
like that.

319
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:39,492
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

320
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:40,743
So put him
on the payroll.

321
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:41,828
Why are we talkin'
about this?

322
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,538
It won't work. And now that
his partner got hit,

323
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:45,540
he's never gonna let it go.

324
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:47,584
What is that?
Lewis' hospital.

325
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,043
Alex is dropping by
this afternoon,

326
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,212
in case you want
to send flowers.

327
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,634
Yeah.

328
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,177
I kill a cop,

329
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,929
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

330
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,347
That's not good
for business.

331
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,434
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

332
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:12,942
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

333
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,655
I'm gonna have 'em in bracelets
within a month, man.

334
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,117
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

335
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,703
Cameras off?

336
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,080
Clear.

337
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:30,960
<i>You were right.
We should've had backup.</i>

338
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,503
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

339
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,842
You're not really sleeping,
are ya?

340
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,596
Asshole.

341
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:48,770
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

342
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:53,232
He has let himself go a
little since the accident.

343
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,525
Pass.

344
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,152
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

345
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,155
Officer Alfred Miller,
Denver.

346
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,867
"Severe Cerebellar..."

347
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,535
Cerebellar ataxia.

348
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,287
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

349
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:10,541
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

350
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,210
Let's keep this one
in mind. I like this guy.

351
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,171
Very good, sir.
I saved the best for last.

352
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:20,802
I give you Sergeant Jack
Freeman, masculinity incarnate.

353
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:23,262
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

354
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,431
now confined
to a wheelchair.

355
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,978
I think I can
see the appeal.

356
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:31,062
NO.

357
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,022
What? Why?

358
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:36,109
Well,check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

359
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,069
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

360
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,738
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

361
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:44,158
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

362
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,369
We have to be scientific.

363
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:49,247
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

364
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:52,125
He's right. Okay.
Keep looking.

365
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:56,963
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.

366
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,132
Hey, guys.
Hi, Dad.

367
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:02,093
Hey.
Hey, little monkey.

368
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:07,557
How's the game, buddy?

369
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,601
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

370
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,604
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

371
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,231
Hey, D, why don't
you head upstairs

372
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:16,983
and start getting ready
for bed.

373
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,818
But he just got home.

374
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:20,903
I'll be up in a second.

375
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:23,448
Tuck you in, okay?
All right?

376
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:29,203
Now give your mom a kiss.
Good night, baby.

377
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,580
Too slow, boy.

378
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:34,167
You're just too slow.

379
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,259
How's Jack holding up?

380
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:45,887
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

381
00:22:46,763 --> 00:22:47,722
It's my fault.

382
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,182
We shouldn't even
have been there.

383
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:52,852
Here.

384
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,960
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

385
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,419
It'll stop.

386
00:24:06,717 --> 00:24:08,469
It's gonna
wake up David.

387
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:56,726
<i>He suffered 4th degree
burns over 80% of his body.</i>

388
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,729
<i>Lower spine
has been severed.</i>

389
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:02,607
<i>If he survives,</i>

390
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,278
he'll be paralyzed from the waist
down and confined to a wheelchair.

391
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,741
Mrs. Murphy,

392
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,828
we don't have to do this.

393
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:20,208
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

394
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:24,962
Please continue.

395
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:28,090
Vestibulocochlear,

396
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:31,260
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

397
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,430
He'll be blind in one eye.

398
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,515
Most likely deaf.

399
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:39,727
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

400
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,312
are the leaders
in this field.

401
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:45,066
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

402
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,610
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

403
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,697
I'm sorry, Doctor.

404
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:54,700
I need time to think.

405
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:58,788
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

406
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,670
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

407
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:10,883
What kind of life
will he have?

408
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,770
<i>Fly</i> me to the <i>moon</i>

409
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:27,149
<i>Let me play
among the stars</i>

410
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:30,236
Thanks.
Thanks, buddy.

411
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:32,196
You know she's gonna
make me dance again.

412
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,031
Now that I've gotta see.

413
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:35,199
You don't want
to see that.

414
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:36,951
Here she comes now.

415
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:38,244
Hold on to that.

416
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:39,578
Get out there, partner.

417
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,873
Every time.

418
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:47,795
Get her, boy.

419
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:55,344
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

420
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:59,765
<i>And let me sing forever more</i>

421
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:04,020
<i>You are all I long for</i>

422
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,188
<i>All I worship...</i>

423
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:08,232
Subject is
still dreaming.

424
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,152
He's retrieving memories,

425
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:14,655
trying to make sense of sensorial
stimulation package 37.

426
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:17,199
Perfect, Kim.

427
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,703
Let's reconnect the spine.

428
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:23,205
Time to wake him up.

429
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,837
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

430
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,507
<i>Let me sing forever more</i>

431
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:38,012
<i>You are all I long for</i>

432
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:42,433
<i>All I worship and adore</i>

433
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:45,102
<i>In other words</i>

434
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:49,607
<i>Please be true</i>

435
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,233
Excuse me?

436
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,444
What are you doing here?

437
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:55,196
Baby, where you going?

438
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,574
<i>In other words</i>

439
00:27:58,657 --> 00:27:59,784
Lewis.

440
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:03,746
<i>I love</i>

441
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,751
<i>You</i>

442
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:13,672
Subject regaining
cognitive functions.

443
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,842
What's happening?

444
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:20,262
Where am I?

445
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,934
You were in an explosion, Alex.
You're in a hospital.

446
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:29,855
Where's Clara? My wife.
Where's my wife?

447
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,358
I want you to calm down,
Alex. Listen to me.

448
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:36,112
You're okay. And your family's fine.
Both your wife and your son.

449
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,406
Who the hell are you?

450
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:41,575
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.

451
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,327
Heart rate rising.

452
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,456
I can't move.

453
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,628
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?

454
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:53,921
Visual input unstable.

455
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:55,506
I want you to relax, Alex.

456
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:56,966
Subject's dumping
too much epinephrine.

457
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,426
Should we purge it?
Not yet.

458
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:01,053
Unlock vertebrae.

459
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,393
Go ahead, Kim.

460
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:10,980
Unlock upper,
lower extremities.

461
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,744
What kind of suit is this?

462
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,415
It's not a suit, Alex.

463
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:32,793
It's you.

464
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,380
This was the only option.

465
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:40,050
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

466
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:42,011
Full body unlock.

467
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,472
I want you
to walk now, Alex.

468
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:46,140
You can do that.

469
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:11,665
This seems so real.

470
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,462
Alex,
it's very important

471
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,130
you understand
what is happening.

472
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:19,590
This is real.

473
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,843
It's not a dream, it's not
drugs or anesthetics.

474
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,846
I know I'm dreaming 'cause
I can feel all of this.

475
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,974
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

476
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,351
It's called
phantom limb sensation.

477
00:30:30,434 --> 00:30:31,685
What do you mean "amputees"?

478
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,021
What the hell did you do to me?
You need to relax.

479
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:35,481
Take this off me now.

480
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:38,108
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

481
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:40,236
What have you done to me?

482
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,738
Alex? Hey!

483
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:45,115
Shut him down.

484
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,826
No! Let him run!
Let him run!

485
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:09,682
Where am I?

486
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:35,749
<i>Alex, please.</i>

487
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:38,586
<i>stop-</i>

488
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:41,338
<i>Alex, you have to stop.</i>

489
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:44,008
<i>Please.</i>

490
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,260
<i>Alex.</i>

491
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,263
Please stop.

492
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,265
Stay where you are

493
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:54,184
and we'll come
and pick you up.

494
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,178
Okay, Kim.

495
00:32:30,471 --> 00:32:31,805
Shut him down.

496
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:59,249
Alex,

497
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,794
you can't run from this.

498
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:07,966
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

499
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:12,805
Show me.

500
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,183
Kim.

501
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:33,409
Oh!

502
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:36,870
No.

503
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,626
Holy Christ.

504
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:45,003
Holy Christ.

505
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:49,466
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

506
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:59,268
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

507
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:07,443
That's not even my brain.

508
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:10,738
We had to repair
the damaged areas.

509
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:14,032
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

510
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,660
Do you understand me, Alex?

511
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:20,122
You're in control.

512
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:23,375
I'm in control?
Yes.

513
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:27,421
Okay.

514
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:32,926
If I'm in control,

515
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:36,054
then I wanna die.

516
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:42,811
Just unplug whatever it is keepin'
me alive and end this nightmare.

517
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:45,189
Now, say I did that.

518
00:34:45,355 --> 00:34:47,900
Which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

519
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:49,985
but say I did.

520
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:54,114
What do I say
to your wife?

521
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:56,325
What does she say
to your son?

522
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:59,161
That it didn't work.
That you tried.

523
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:01,872
Somethin' went wrong.

524
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:05,751
You did everything
you could,

525
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:10,047
but I died.

526
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:12,049
So after all
they've been through,

527
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:15,469
all the pain,
all their hope restored,

528
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,763
we would just
rip that away?

529
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:21,350
Your wife
loves you, Alex.

530
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:23,602
She signed
the consent forms herself.

531
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,022
Otherwise, you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

532
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,829
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

533
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,625
I need you to take it.

534
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:53,590
I don't wanna see myself
like this again.

535
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,218
Even

536
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,554
And the same goes
for my family.

537
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,021
Just put me back in.

538
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:13,652
Zoom in.

539
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:17,239
Stop.

540
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:21,326
Zoom in.

541
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,038
Stop.

542
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,837
Accept the connection.

543
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:39,386
<i>It's so good
to finally see you.</i>

544
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:41,889
I was gonna say
the same thing.

545
00:36:43,056 --> 00:36:44,516
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,853
I know how I must
look to you.

547
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,355
<i>I think you look beautiful.</i>

548
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,153
<i>Are they treating you okay,
baby?</i>

549
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,741
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

550
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,244
Does David know
you're calling?

551
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,291
<i>He misses you.</i>

552
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:12,169
<i>I can go get him.
No.</i>

553
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:15,714
I don't want him
to see me like this.

554
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:18,967
Not yet.

555
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:20,344
<i>Sure.</i>

556
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:28,727
<i>We're gonna
get through this, baby.</i>

557
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,815
<i>We're gonna make it
like it was.</i>

558
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:39,863
<i>When are you comin' home?</i>

559
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,366
Well, they've still
got some tests.

560
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,577
But they're sayin'
it's goin' really well.

561
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:48,997
The minute they let me.

562
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,960
I gotta go.

563
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,379
I love you.

564
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,172
End the connection.

565
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:15,399
Okay,
blood cleansing initiated.

566
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:20,779
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

567
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:26,451
Releasing proteins, fats,

568
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:29,413
minerals and carbs.

569
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:36,628
Energy inflow
is at 1320 kilocalories.

570
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:42,384
Now starting anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones

571
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:45,470
and antibiotic protocols.

572
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:48,098
Standard daily intake.

573
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,644
Release antidepressants.

574
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:56,148
Let's give him a nice dream.

575
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:08,785
All right, here's
what you're dealin' with.

576
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,580
Modified M2 battle rifle.

577
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:14,124
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

578
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:16,043
Three-shot bursts
or full auto.

579
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:18,420
Heavy-duty.

580
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,883
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven
taser pistol.

581
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,387
Each projectile releases up to 200,000
volts. It can stun, it can kill

582
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:28,930
and it's nasty shit.

583
00:39:29,306 --> 00:39:30,348
Your armor,

584
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:31,767
state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

585
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,478
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and kill.

586
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:38,356
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

587
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:42,569
If you sense you need a
weapon or are threatened

588
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:47,699
the visor goes down and the system
makes the weapons available.

589
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:50,744
But you gotta remember, it's
not the weapons that count.

590
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:51,870
It's who's handling them.

591
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:54,164
Or, in your case, what.

592
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,084
You think you can do this?
Oh, just stick to your job.

593
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:00,045
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

594
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:04,299
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.

595
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,510
You ask me, stickin'
organics into the system

596
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:08,678
is a huge step backwards.

597
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:11,056
I don't care how well you
designed this thing.

598
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:13,517
Without my sign-off, it better
start learnin' Chinese,

599
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,060
'cause it ain't
never goin' home.

600
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,486
It's nice to meet you, too.

601
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:27,489
Let's do this,

602
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:29,116
Tin Man.

603
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:39,459
Quality control,
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

604
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:42,546
Rendering scenario one now.

605
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,006
Hey,Doc,
hope you don't mind.

606
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,216
I like a little music
while I'm workin'.

607
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:50,262
<i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>

608
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:55,392
All right. All right, let's let the
games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.

609
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,562
Commence scenario.

610
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,731
<i>Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human</i>

611
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:05,110
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

612
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:11,158
<i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental</i>

613
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:13,785
<i>Regarding love and art</i>

614
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:17,622
<i>I'd be friends
with the sparrows</i>

615
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,791
<i>And the boy
who shoots the arrows</i>

616
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,836
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

617
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:28,425
<i>Picture me a balcony</i>

618
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:32,429
<i>Above a voice sings low...</i>

619
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,389
<i>Laggin' on the comers.</i>

620
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:35,974
No, there,
d'you see that?

621
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:37,934
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

622
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,479
New product's afraid.

623
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:45,692
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

624
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:48,570
<i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>

625
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:49,696
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

626
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:53,158
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

627
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:55,619
<i>Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!</i>

628
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:58,955
Oh, well, it's worried that
the kid's gonna get hurt.

629
00:41:59,122 --> 00:42:00,624
<i>- Let the kid go!
- Too bad.</i>

630
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:06,129
Well, there you have it. 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

631
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,173
I wouldn't buy that
for a dollar.

632
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:16,056
Let's do it again.
Your funeral.

633
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:20,936
Detective Alex Murphy.

634
00:42:21,102 --> 00:42:22,312
<i>Search results.</i>

635
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:24,439
<i>"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."</i>

636
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:26,733
<i>"Alex Murphy.
Man or Machine?"</i>

637
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,278
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>

638
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:32,906
Antoine Vallon.

639
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,074
<i>Search results.</i>

640
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:38,286
<i>"DPD says Antoine Val/on no longer
suspect due to lack of evidence."</i>

641
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:43,708
<i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

642
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,962
<i>Unfortunately, Murphy's
investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>

643
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:48,463
<i>wasn't authorized
in the first place.</i>

644
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:52,259
<i>Look, Detective Murphy was
simply overzealous, okay?</i>

645
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:55,470
<i>We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>

646
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,847
<i>All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.</i>

647
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:01,434
<i>And I won't rest until the men who tried
to kill him are brought to justice.</i>

648
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:06,314
What's wrong with him?

649
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:07,482
No, nothing, nothing.

650
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,070
Watch the procedural bars
on the 208.

651
00:43:12,946 --> 00:43:16,449
The machine assesses
the threat and acts.

652
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:18,451
That's it.

653
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:21,329
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

654
00:43:22,372 --> 00:43:26,459
The software assesses the
threat, just like the robot.

655
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,503
And it sends the information
to the brain.

656
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,423
Alex's brain receives the information
and decides what to do with it

657
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:36,136
based on his emotional cognitive
abilities like any man would.

658
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:39,472
Then the brain relates this
to the Al module and...

659
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,350
Yeah, like, you know,
a year later.

660
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:43,643
And our computers
finish the job.

661
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:47,480
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

662
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,149
And that's what you've got.

663
00:43:49,232 --> 00:43:51,359
But the human element
will always be present.

664
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:54,029
Fear, instinct,
bias, compassion,

665
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,363
they will always interfere
with the system!

666
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:56,990
Okay, but, Dennett,

667
00:43:57,073 --> 00:44:00,493
I've gotta give the American people
something they can root for.

668
00:44:00,577 --> 00:44:02,329
Something aspirational, right?

669
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:03,830
They have to
believe in this thing.

670
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:07,417
"Pretty good"? I don't
know how to sell "okay."

671
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,127
We, you and I,
have got a release date,

672
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,628
and we've gotta
make it, okay?

673
00:44:10,712 --> 00:44:13,298
So I don't care how you do it. I'm
askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

674
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:16,843
Just get him to do that.
Get him to do that.

675
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:18,345
That is a machine.

676
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:19,888
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

677
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:22,849
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

678
00:44:22,932 --> 00:44:24,017
And his life depends on it.

679
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,477
And the future of Omnicorp
depends on it

680
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,396
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

681
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,648
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

682
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:49,209
It tastes like
peanut butter.

683
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:55,340
I can't get it
out of my mouth.

684
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:57,801
And you
don't like peanut butter?

685
00:44:57,967 --> 00:44:59,177
No.

686
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,513
You like peanut butter, Kim?

687
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,098
I love it.

688
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:06,226
Okay.

689
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:08,853
I'm gonna put you
to sleep now, Alex.

690
00:45:08,937 --> 00:45:10,021
Okay.

691
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:13,274
Now, put him under, Kim.

692
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,365
What are you planning to do?

693
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:25,245
Consciousness
is nothing more

694
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:28,123
than the processing
of information.

695
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,501
I'm gonna fix him.

696
00:45:32,919 --> 00:45:35,004
And he won't
know the difference.

697
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:47,934
Raymond?
Yeah?

698
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:51,479
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

699
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:55,442
We call this Combat Mode.

700
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:58,319
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

701
00:45:58,486 --> 00:45:59,612
Yeah, that's okay.

702
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:01,531
And get a load of this.

703
00:46:02,282 --> 00:46:06,119
What's that? He transforms.
Kids love it.

704
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:08,788
Really? Focus group
numbers through the roof.

705
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:10,290
Really?
Oh, yeah.

706
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:12,417
Well, that's really
embarrassing.

707
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:14,544
What is this?
You know what?

708
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:16,546
People really don't know
what they want

709
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:18,840
until you show it to 'em
most of the time.

710
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:21,926
Make him more, uh,

711
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,011
tactical.

712
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:24,637
Make him look, uh...

713
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:28,558
Let's go with black.

714
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:31,060
Yeah.

715
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:07,222
Alex.

716
00:47:07,388 --> 00:47:09,474
He looks
like a billion dollars.

717
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:11,601
2.6 billion.

718
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,770
Raymond Sellars.

719
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:15,980
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

720
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:18,149
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

721
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,443
Well, we funded
this program

722
00:47:20,527 --> 00:47:22,737
to give men like you
a second chance.

723
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:25,365
You just do
your best today.

724
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,991
Shall we?
Let's.

725
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,580
Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.
Okay, great.

726
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:34,207
Chief Technician Shuman.

727
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:35,750
Mornin', folks.

728
00:47:38,878 --> 00:47:41,089
<i>Okay, so
this is how it's gonna be.</i>

729
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:43,550
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

730
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,261
<i>I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.</i>

731
00:47:46,344 --> 00:47:48,846
<i>You hit me,
you get a ticket back home.</i>

732
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:52,684
My guys are gonna be
shootin' .47 caliber rounds.

733
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,019
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

734
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:58,523
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

735
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:15,123
Alex, listen to me.

736
00:48:15,665 --> 00:48:17,917
<i>The EM-208s will
try to maneuver you</i>

737
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,335
<i>so Mattox can
get a clear shot.</i>

738
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:22,547
<i>Do not let that happen.</i>

739
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:26,009
<i>If Mattox hits you, everything but
your life support will shut down.</i>

740
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:29,220
<i>You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.</i>

741
00:48:29,554 --> 00:48:32,223
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.

742
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:39,480
All right.

743
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:42,191
I say we go on three.

744
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:43,359
Three.

745
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,924
How's it going down there?

746
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:12,055
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

747
00:49:15,558 --> 00:49:16,559
Wow.

748
00:49:48,758 --> 00:49:51,552
Dr. Norton,
how is he doing this?

749
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:55,848
His software is faster.
His hardware is stronger.

750
00:49:56,015 --> 00:49:57,517
<i>He's a better machine.</i>

751
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,355
<i>But you said
humans hesitate.</i>

752
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,816
Only when they're
making decisions.

753
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:06,859
He's not
making decisions?

754
00:50:07,026 --> 00:50:08,778
Yes and no.

755
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:12,073
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

756
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,200
Alex makes his own decisions.

757
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:16,411
<i>Now, when he
engages in battle,</i>

758
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:19,706
<i>the visor comes down
and the software takes over.</i>

759
00:50:19,872 --> 00:50:21,833
<i>Then the machine
does everything.</i>

760
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:25,253
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

761
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:30,174
<i>But if the machine
is in control,</i>

762
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:31,676
<i>then how is Murphy
accountable?</i>

763
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:32,885
Who's pulling the trigger?

764
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:34,345
Well, when
the machine fights,

765
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,931
the system releases signals
into Alex's brain

766
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:39,600
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

767
00:50:39,684 --> 00:50:42,520
I mean, Alex believes right
now he is in control.

768
00:50:42,603 --> 00:50:46,065
But he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

769
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:56,868
Crap!

770
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,143
So you've circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

771
00:51:22,226 --> 00:51:23,227
But that's illegal.

772
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:25,188
No. No, no, no.

773
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:28,691
It's a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.

774
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:30,151
And in my book

775
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:32,111
that's legal.

776
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,239
Well done.

777
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:38,284
Well done.

778
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:46,125
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

779
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,505
I, uh, I think we're all
curious to find out.

780
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,006
Go ahead.

781
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:31,420
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

782
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:34,257
She's been waiting
four months.

783
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:36,592
I'm sure hers is, too.

784
00:52:39,011 --> 00:52:40,763
You're gonna do fine.

785
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:52,400
I love your sign, D.

786
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:56,863
Hey.

787
00:53:01,242 --> 00:53:02,952
There's nothin' to be
nervous about.

788
00:53:07,707 --> 00:53:08,875
<i>Thank you, Bennett.</i>

789
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,377
It's been a privilege.

790
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,223
Hi, Dad.

791
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:51,894
You know
I missed you, buddy.

792
00:54:52,895 --> 00:54:54,230
Me, too.

793
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:02,863
Wanna feel it?

794
00:55:06,742 --> 00:55:08,035
What is it?

795
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:10,913
It's okay, sweetie.

796
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:25,177
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

797
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,596
You did?

798
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,560
How'd they do?
I don't know.

799
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:34,937
I've been waiting
to watch them with you.

800
00:55:36,355 --> 00:55:38,190
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

801
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:40,609
But I can't tonight.

802
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:43,612
You know, 'cause Daddy's
suit needs some...

803
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,574
Some special handling.

804
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,618
Do you understand?

805
00:56:21,025 --> 00:56:22,234
Thanks for coming, Jack.

806
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:23,986
I heard you
went home already.

807
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,821
I know Clara must be
thrilled to have you back.

808
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:28,157
I saw Clara

809
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,492
and David.

810
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:34,497
That ain't my home right now.

811
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:37,917
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

812
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:39,794
I'm sorry, Alex.

813
00:56:40,169 --> 00:56:44,006
Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

814
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,966
I was waitin'
to hear you say that.

815
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,264
Least I know
you're the right color now.

816
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:27,341
<i>Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today</i>

817
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,593
<i>certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.</i>

818
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:32,138
<i>We're expecting people
from every corner of the city</i>

819
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:33,472
<i>here in Detroit</i>

820
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:35,432
<i>to come out and
show their support</i>

821
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:36,767
<i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>

822
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,396
<i>You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is what will he look like.</i>

823
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:42,314
<i>Is he a changed man?</i>

824
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:44,150
<i>Rumor has it
he is in the building</i>

825
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,734
<i>preparing to come out...</i>

826
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:51,866
Alex, we're gonna upload the entire
DPD database into your brain.

827
00:57:52,575 --> 00:57:56,829
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records

828
00:57:56,912 --> 00:58:01,083
plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

829
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,251
All right.

830
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,378
Hit me.

831
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:07,256
Okay. Kim,
it's all yours.

832
00:58:08,924 --> 00:58:11,510
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

833
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:14,263
Your system draws
connections automatically.

834
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:16,182
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes

835
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:19,602
and give you their exact
locations whenever available.

836
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:23,439
I got evidence
to make 138... No, no.

837
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:25,941
166 arrests.

838
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:28,652
His emotions are stable.

839
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:31,864
This is incredible.

840
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:35,034
<i>You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.</i>

841
00:58:35,117 --> 00:58:37,203
<i>The mayor is standing
onstage behind me.</i>

842
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:39,455
<i>Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.</i>

843
00:58:39,538 --> 00:58:40,789
<i>They seem like great friends</i>

844
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:43,792
<i>obviously echoing the partnership
that they've brought together.</i>

845
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:46,378
How much longer
will this take?

846
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:49,548
Well, the feed from the
database is almost done, so.

847
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:51,300
We're approaching
present day.

848
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:54,887
634 pending arrests.

849
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,389
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

850
00:58:59,808 --> 00:59:00,976
He's on top of her.

851
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,895
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

852
00:59:02,978 --> 00:59:04,563
I gotta do something!
Alex.

853
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:06,815
Alex, calm down.

854
00:59:07,316 --> 00:59:08,734
Take a breath.

855
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:10,402
Relax.

856
00:59:10,653 --> 00:59:11,904
Kim, what are the readings?

857
00:59:11,987 --> 00:59:13,781
I haven't seen him
at levels like this.

858
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:15,032
- He's gonna shoot 'em!
- Alex!

859
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:17,534
Alex, Alex, relax.

860
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:19,495
Relax.

861
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:21,497
Alex?

862
00:59:22,164 --> 00:59:24,166
What is this?
This just a computer glitch?

863
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,085
No. That's
his own crime scene.

864
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:27,169
Alex!

865
00:59:27,253 --> 00:59:28,254
He's spiking
all over the place.

866
00:59:28,337 --> 00:59:29,505
Alex!

867
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:31,924
The system
is crashing, Doctor.

868
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:33,175
Alex, can you hear me?

869
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,760
Alex! Alex!

870
00:59:34,927 --> 00:59:37,096
I'm not sure he can handle this.
I gotta do something!

871
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,180
He's emotionally overloaded.

872
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,431
Unlock me!

873
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:41,016
Alex! Stop!

874
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:43,143
Stop! He's having a seizure!

875
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,187
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

876
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:46,522
Get me a live feed!

877
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:47,773
I can't do it.
Dr. Norton's with the patient.

878
00:59:47,856 --> 00:59:48,857
Do it now!

879
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:50,150
Jesus Christ!

880
00:59:50,317 --> 00:59:51,944
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

881
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,487
What?
The press is waiting!

882
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:54,655
We have to
get him up there now!

883
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:55,864
What do you
want me to do?

884
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:58,826
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

885
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:02,246
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

886
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,207
We're running out of time.

887
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,293
Okay.

888
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:10,129
Everybody out!

889
01:00:11,714 --> 01:00:12,715
Out!

890
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:14,300
<i>Mayor Durant is
about to take to the stage</i>

891
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:17,970
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

892
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:21,307
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

893
01:00:25,853 --> 01:00:28,105
Heart rate rising. He
might start spiking, Doctor.

894
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,816
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

895
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:32,067
But you will be
taking away his emotions.

896
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:33,902
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

897
01:00:33,986 --> 01:00:35,988
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

898
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:37,698
Now, please!

899
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:45,581
Pull the footage.
Put it on a loop.

900
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,418
Dopamine level's at 20%.

901
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:50,586
More.

902
01:00:53,172 --> 01:00:54,340
Dopamine
level's at 10%.

903
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:55,549
More.

904
01:00:56,592 --> 01:00:58,385
Dopamine level's at 5%.
Lower.

905
01:00:58,552 --> 01:01:00,429
You're flattening him out.
Lower!

906
01:01:03,098 --> 01:01:05,100
2%.
Hold it there.

907
01:01:12,191 --> 01:01:13,442
Alex?

908
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:16,779
Alex, how do you feel?

909
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:22,868
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

910
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:28,957
Well, today I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

911
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:32,753
I am here
to give you the cure.

912
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:33,962
That's right!

913
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:42,763
Hi, Dad!

914
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,225
Dad?

915
01:01:52,272 --> 01:01:55,901
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now

916
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:58,987
with Detective Alex Murphy!

917
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:17,047
Detective.

918
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,356
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

919
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:37,359
I think he's
accessing criminal data.

920
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:45,993
Thomas King!
You are under arrest!

921
01:03:04,052 --> 01:03:07,764
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

922
01:03:07,848 --> 01:03:11,393
wanted for rape, arson,
and murder.

923
01:03:11,685 --> 01:03:15,564
This man has torn
apart American families.

924
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:19,276
On the loose for six years.

925
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:25,574
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

926
01:03:28,744 --> 01:03:33,707
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

927
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:38,420
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

928
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:42,508
These two officers
are completely unaware

929
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,594
of the monster
in their midst.

930
01:03:47,888 --> 01:03:50,474
And then, in 60 seconds...

931
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,561
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

932
01:03:54,728 --> 01:03:58,232
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

933
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:02,194
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.</i>

934
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:08,158
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

935
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:11,995
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

936
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,249
now that RoboCop is here?

937
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,209
Yes,

938
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:21,797
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

939
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:26,218
Men weren't up to the task.

940
01:04:26,385 --> 01:04:27,844
But Alex Murphy,

941
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,180
a <i>robot cop,</i>

942
01:04:30,264 --> 01:04:31,306
<i>was.</i>

943
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:33,892
We can't take him
off the street.

944
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:35,519
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.

945
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:37,312
A big, fat, stinking hit.

946
01:04:37,396 --> 01:04:39,648
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

947
01:04:39,731 --> 01:04:42,943
Hey, we all knew there would be issues.
It's inevitable.

948
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,696
Dennett, you're my guy. I just
need you to get a handle on this.

949
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:46,905
I know,
but I need more time.

950
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:49,491
Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

951
01:04:49,575 --> 01:04:51,743
We need to take him
back to the lab and do more tests.

952
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:55,247
I mean, it was like something was
interfering with our system.

953
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,749
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

954
01:04:57,916 --> 01:04:59,751
Like what? His soul?

955
01:04:59,835 --> 01:05:02,337
Hey, look, this train has
already left the station.

956
01:05:02,421 --> 01:05:04,715
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

957
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:07,301
"Sorry, I released
a defective product."

958
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:10,345
So, no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

959
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,097
What about the interviews?

960
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,600
Cancel 'em.
Cancel all of 'em.

961
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:16,101
Everything.

962
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,520
In fact, Dennett.

963
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:23,859
<i>Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.</i>

964
01:05:25,027 --> 01:05:26,194
<i>I'd like to see him.</i>

965
01:05:27,154 --> 01:05:28,488
Can you arrange that?

966
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:30,490
Look, I won't lie to you.

967
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:34,453
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

968
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,289
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

969
01:05:37,372 --> 01:05:41,335
And then he just shoots a man in front
of our son. That's not sedation.

970
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:45,672
He's responding
to drugs differently now.

971
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:50,010
We both knew from day one,

972
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:53,180
there would be complications.

973
01:05:57,476 --> 01:05:59,519
Just give me
a little more time.

974
01:06:00,479 --> 01:06:02,064
I promise,

975
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,192
you'll have your husband back.

976
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:11,198
This goes for every
squad in every department.

977
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:14,826
Detective Murphy will have full
access to all investigations.

978
01:06:14,993 --> 01:06:17,537
Robberies,
narcotics, homicides.

979
01:06:17,704 --> 01:06:20,165
If he requests
to take over a case,

980
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:21,833
the case will be
handed to him.

981
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,752
No arguments,
no complaints.

982
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:24,920
This is bullshit!

983
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:28,882
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

984
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:32,594
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

985
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,889
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

986
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:37,933
John Biggs
is target number one.

987
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,434
I'll be
taking over this case.

988
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:41,353
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

989
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:44,022
should be ready to
move in on my request.

990
01:06:44,189 --> 01:06:46,233
I wish you all
a very good day.

991
01:06:53,573 --> 01:06:54,783
Murphy.

992
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,868
You okay, man?

993
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:00,414
I'm fine, Sergeant.

994
01:07:00,956 --> 01:07:02,749
Can't wait to
get back to work.

995
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,710
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

996
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:06,461
Excuse me,
I have casework.

997
01:07:59,347 --> 01:08:01,016
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

998
01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,316
Walter Karrel,
look at me.

999
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:10,776
You have two options.

1000
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:11,943
Option one.

1001
01:08:12,986 --> 01:08:14,863
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

1002
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:18,366
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

1003
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,869
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control.

1004
01:08:20,952 --> 01:08:22,746
And then I arrest you.

1005
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:24,372
Option two.
You tell me where

1006
01:08:24,456 --> 01:08:26,792
John Biggs' drug
lab is located.

1007
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,960
And then I arrest you.

1008
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:32,005
You have
two seconds to decide.

1009
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:42,033
Totally justifiable.

1010
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,452
We are going to make
a lot of money.

1011
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:48,290
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

1012
01:09:48,456 --> 01:09:51,793
No traces of anger
whatsoever.

1013
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:54,379
Congratulations, Doctor.

1014
01:09:54,713 --> 01:09:56,047
You did it.

1015
01:09:57,299 --> 01:09:58,800
Yes, I did.

1016
01:10:07,142 --> 01:10:08,435
<i>I told you, sir.</i>

1017
01:10:08,602 --> 01:10:11,396
Norton clearly never had
control of the product.

1018
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:14,482
I agree. And that's
why I called you here.

1019
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:17,485
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

1020
01:10:17,652 --> 01:10:18,653
Okay.

1021
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,697
I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head

1022
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:22,908
plus full surveillance of the lab, and...

1023
01:10:23,074 --> 01:10:25,493
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

1024
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,495
If anything comes up,

1025
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:29,289
I'm gonna be in Washington.

1026
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:34,628
<i>He brought peace</i>

1027
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:37,255
<i>to this country's
most violent city.</i>

1028
01:10:37,505 --> 01:10:38,506
<i>He showed us all</i>

1029
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:41,676
<i>that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.</i>

1030
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:45,680
<i>A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.</i>

1031
01:10:46,014 --> 01:10:50,018
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

1032
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:53,772
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

1033
01:10:56,191 --> 01:10:57,192
Hello, Pat.
Raymond.

1034
01:10:57,275 --> 01:10:58,276
Thanks for havin' me.

1035
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:00,946
You must be doing
a victory lap about now.

1036
01:11:01,029 --> 01:11:02,030
Well.

1037
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:06,034
Two weeks ago, Omni's stock
went through the roof.

1038
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,453
And the Senate
has finally agreed

1039
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:10,497
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

1040
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:14,042
Well, look, I mean, the
tide is definitely turning.

1041
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:17,045
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.

1042
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:18,129
I certainly hope so.

1043
01:11:18,505 --> 01:11:21,466
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.

1044
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:22,550
Mmm-hmm.

1045
01:11:22,884 --> 01:11:24,010
Hubert Dreyfus.

1046
01:11:24,552 --> 01:11:26,388
Senator,
thank you for joining us.

1047
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:28,264
<i>Hello, Pat.
Mr. Sellars.</i>

1048
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:30,642
Senator, do you know
what this is?

1049
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:33,561
The American public
is divided

1050
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:35,063
on the Dreyfus Act.

1051
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:40,360
Our polls at Novakelement.com
are tight at 50-50.

1052
01:11:40,568 --> 01:11:44,322
<i>There is no doubt
Omnicorp created a sensation</i>

1053
01:11:44,406 --> 01:11:47,826
<i>but this bill is
not about Alex Murphy.</i>

1054
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:50,954
<i>It's about whether America's
willing to give robots</i>

1055
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:52,664
<i>the authority
over human lives.</i>

1056
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:54,332
No. Look, look, look.

1057
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:57,085
This sea change
we're witnessing,

1058
01:11:57,168 --> 01:11:58,586
and it is a sea change,

1059
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,338
shows that Americans
don't really care

1060
01:12:00,422 --> 01:12:03,174
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

1061
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:06,302
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

1062
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:07,637
<i>You're clouding the issue.</i>

1063
01:12:07,721 --> 01:12:09,264
<i>This is clearly an attempt</i>

1064
01:12:09,347 --> 01:12:11,766
<i>to sway public opinion
with a marketing stunt.</i>

1065
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:13,268
What's clear is

1066
01:12:13,435 --> 01:12:16,896
that with just one system in
place, we've cut crime by 80%.

1067
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,024
Just imagine if we put,

1068
01:12:19,107 --> 01:12:21,317
I dunno, let's say
100 systems in place.

1069
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:23,445
And then,
I want you to ask yourself,

1070
01:12:23,528 --> 01:12:25,321
why are you holding us back?

1071
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:26,740
<i>Is that your plan?
Thank you, Senator.</i>

1072
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:28,533
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.

1073
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,619
Well, there you have it.

1074
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:34,205
Who could argue with that?

1075
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:36,249
Which begs the question.

1076
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:41,504
Has the US Senate
become pro-crime?

1077
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:52,348
Yeah, hi.

1078
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,142
No, no, 5000.

1079
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:55,977
Call me tomorrow.

1080
01:12:57,395 --> 01:13:00,648
Hey, guys. Vallon's
waitin' for you inside.

1081
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,526
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

1082
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:05,070
I'm out here makin' money.

1083
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,073
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

1084
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,825
What the hell is all this shit?

1085
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:12,243
I can't move any product

1086
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:13,828
with this thing
on the streets.

1087
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:16,039
What are you doing
to protect me?

1088
01:13:16,206 --> 01:13:18,166
Relax. The guy's
a walkin' zombie.

1089
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,834
And tell me
your phones are off.

1090
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,170
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

1091
01:13:22,337 --> 01:13:24,506
He can't manufacture
evidence outta thin air.

1092
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:26,382
If he does,
I'm ready for him.

1093
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,184
Well?

1094
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,356
I've been getting calls.

1095
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:42,690
From whom?

1096
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:44,734
Well, Clara.

1097
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:48,530
You need to let her see her husband.
She has rights.

1098
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,075
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

1099
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,744
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

1100
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:56,704
before she turns up
on television.

1101
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:58,540
Well, she can try.

1102
01:13:59,207 --> 01:14:02,085
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

1103
01:14:03,545 --> 01:14:04,921
I'd hop to it.

1104
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:08,341
Alex. Alex!

1105
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:13,513
Alex. You need to come home.

1106
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,056
Clara, please stand aside.

1107
01:14:15,223 --> 01:14:16,558
You need to speak
to your son.

1108
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:18,685
Right now, I see three
crimes in progress.

1109
01:14:18,852 --> 01:14:20,270
Alex, listen to me.

1110
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:22,730
I know you're in there.

1111
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:27,402
David won't show
his face at school.

1112
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:29,863
He's having nightmares.

1113
01:14:31,698 --> 01:14:34,409
He's falling apart.
lam falling apart.

1114
01:14:35,702 --> 01:14:36,911
Please.

1115
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:40,790
I can't do this on my own.

1116
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:44,419
He's been scared
ever since that night.

1117
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:55,138
<i>What do you think
she's gonna do?</i>

1118
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:57,765
What's he gonna do?

1119
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,954
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1120
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,123
<i>David? David.</i>

1121
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:25,293
<i>Stand back.
Come on, stand back!</i>

1122
01:15:45,772 --> 01:15:47,815
He's supposed to be
watching this.

1123
01:15:47,982 --> 01:15:52,570
Instead, he's accessing images of
Clara and David arriving at school.

1124
01:15:52,654 --> 01:15:53,947
Over and over again.

1125
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:58,701
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

1126
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,297
<i>- Do you want me to shut him down?
- No.</i>

1127
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:12,840
Not yet.

1128
01:16:14,342 --> 01:16:16,052
I wanna see what happens.

1129
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:37,907
What's he doing
at his house?

1130
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:42,078
Look, he's disobeying
protocol.

1131
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:43,413
You have to shut him down.

1132
01:16:43,705 --> 01:16:46,666
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

1133
01:17:46,309 --> 01:17:48,936
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

1134
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:53,149
He's undoing
what we did to him.

1135
01:17:53,608 --> 01:17:56,277
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

1136
01:17:56,444 --> 01:17:58,905
How is that
even possible?

1137
01:18:00,114 --> 01:18:02,408
I haven't the faintest idea.

1138
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:04,118
<i>Alex.</i>

1139
01:18:30,603 --> 01:18:32,980
<i>Alex, please return
to the station.</i>

1140
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:35,817
I wanna run some tests.

1141
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:38,319
Well, this should
be interesting.

1142
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:56,504
<i>And your phone
on the table!</i>

1143
01:18:56,629 --> 01:18:58,840
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1144
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:01,217
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

1145
01:19:02,009 --> 01:19:03,845
We work for Antoine Vallon.

1146
01:19:32,707 --> 01:19:34,000
My hand, man!

1147
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,251
Where's Antoine Vallon?

1148
01:19:35,376 --> 01:19:36,586
You broke my hand, man!

1149
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:39,255
I know you
remember me, Jerry.

1150
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:44,469
Where's Vallon?

1151
01:19:44,552 --> 01:19:45,636
Wait a minute.

1152
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,889
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

1153
01:19:50,016 --> 01:19:53,269
Your wife left you in 2019 after
filing charges for domestic abuse.

1154
01:19:53,352 --> 01:19:55,229
And you don't have a kid.

1155
01:19:55,688 --> 01:19:56,647
But l do.

1156
01:19:58,274 --> 01:19:59,525
I'm not askin' again!

1157
01:19:59,692 --> 01:20:01,777
Look, I swear, man. I don't
know where Vallon is, okay?

1158
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:05,281
The only guy I talk to is his driver
Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!

1159
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:07,742
Does he have a phone number?

1160
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:27,303
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

1161
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,471
What's he doing?

1162
01:20:28,638 --> 01:20:30,765
He's off solving
his own murder.

1163
01:20:30,932 --> 01:20:33,684
Oh, that is genius.

1164
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:35,728
Why didn't I think of that?

1165
01:20:42,777 --> 01:20:44,278
<i>How long
till he gets here?</i>

1166
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:46,447
<i>Five minutes.
All</i> right.

1167
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:48,491
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

1168
01:20:48,658 --> 01:20:49,951
What happened?

1169
01:20:51,244 --> 01:20:53,955
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

1170
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:56,415
Shit.

1171
01:21:04,674 --> 01:21:06,300
All right, everyone,
listen up!

1172
01:21:06,676 --> 01:21:07,969
He's coming.

1173
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:10,972
He leaves alive, you don't.

1174
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,808
How do we stop him?

1175
01:21:15,184 --> 01:21:18,354
.50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

1176
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:31,826
This one's set.

1177
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:33,286
Let's go. Go!

1178
01:21:33,452 --> 01:21:34,787
All right, move! Let's go!

1179
01:21:36,163 --> 01:21:37,999
Come on. Come on!

1180
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:40,793
Ready to go!

1181
01:21:41,836 --> 01:21:43,170
They're all set.

1182
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:12,426
Finish it!

1183
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:28,109
You freak, die!

1184
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:18,659
Watch out.

1185
01:24:18,993 --> 01:24:20,453
Need me
to call a doctor?

1186
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:22,621
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

1187
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,417
What the hell
you doin' here?

1188
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,793
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

1189
01:24:27,877 --> 01:24:30,588
Nah, Daniels.
Bad cop, RoboCop.

1190
01:24:32,548 --> 01:24:35,676
I've recovered 26
guns from Vallon's warehouse.

1191
01:24:35,843 --> 01:24:38,637
Thirteen serial numbers match
weapons missing from Evidence.

1192
01:24:38,804 --> 01:24:40,639
And I got your prints
all over 'em.

1193
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:41,807
This is bullshit.

1194
01:24:41,974 --> 01:24:43,768
I also
have CCTV footage

1195
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:45,853
of you and Vallon the same
day he tried to kill me.

1196
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,189
<i>So put him on the payroll.
Why we talkin' about this?</i>

1197
01:24:48,355 --> 01:24:51,650
<i>It won't work. Now that his partner
got hit, he's never gonna let it go.</i>

1198
01:24:51,817 --> 01:24:53,235
<i>- What is that?</i>
<i>- Lewis' hospital.</i>

1199
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:54,862
<i>Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.</i>

1200
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:57,907
<i>I kill a cop, I'm lookin'
over my shoulder...</i>

1201
01:24:58,073 --> 01:25:00,367
You know what they do
to cops in prison, man?

1202
01:25:00,826 --> 01:25:03,412
Being locked up with the
same dudes you put in there?

1203
01:25:06,749 --> 01:25:08,459
How long you think
before he gives you up?

1204
01:25:12,213 --> 01:25:14,882
Don't shoot me. Okay?

1205
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:18,219
I swear to Christ.
It was Dean.

1206
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:21,263
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1207
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:25,226
Thank you
for your cooperation.

1208
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:28,896
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1209
01:25:37,988 --> 01:25:39,865
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1210
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,285
'Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1211
01:25:43,369 --> 01:25:45,079
Alex, I can explain.

1212
01:25:45,746 --> 01:25:47,122
You tipped
him off today.

1213
01:25:47,206 --> 01:25:48,457
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

1214
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:50,459
You tried to kill me twice.

1215
01:25:50,543 --> 01:25:53,838
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

1216
01:25:54,129 --> 01:25:55,130
Confess.

1217
01:25:56,465 --> 01:25:58,133
Now, in front of everyone.

1218
01:25:58,259 --> 01:25:59,260
Confess!

1219
01:26:09,103 --> 01:26:10,104
What happened?

1220
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:12,398
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.

1221
01:26:12,565 --> 01:26:13,566
<i>Why?</i>

1222
01:26:13,732 --> 01:26:14,984
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1223
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:16,527
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

1224
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:19,113
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

1225
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:20,656
We got anything on her?

1226
01:26:20,823 --> 01:26:23,158
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1227
01:26:23,242 --> 01:26:25,119
What do you think?

1228
01:26:28,956 --> 01:26:30,249
You know what?

1229
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:34,920
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

1230
01:26:41,343 --> 01:26:44,513
<i>Alex, I don't
know if you can hear me.</i>

1231
01:26:44,805 --> 01:26:48,100
<i>But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>

1232
01:26:48,267 --> 01:26:50,686
<i>inside
the Detroit Police Department.</i>

1233
01:26:50,853 --> 01:26:55,190
<i>And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.</i>

1234
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:57,276
Even the police,

1235
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,363
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

1236
01:27:02,156 --> 01:27:03,657
they can be bribed.

1237
01:27:04,283 --> 01:27:07,161
They can be bought.

1238
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:12,917
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

1239
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:16,086
Americans could be
living in a country

1240
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:19,506
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

1241
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,342
but incorruptible.

1242
01:27:22,676 --> 01:27:24,970
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done.

1243
01:27:25,137 --> 01:27:26,847
And for all that you are.

1244
01:27:27,348 --> 01:27:30,517
<i>Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.</i>

1245
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:33,938
Our doctors
are working ceaselessly

1246
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:36,774
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1247
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:40,069
<i>Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt</i>

1248
01:27:40,152 --> 01:27:42,029
<i>on Detective
Alex Murphy's life</i>

1249
01:27:42,112 --> 01:27:44,406
<i>will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?</i>

1250
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,367
<i>At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern</i>

1251
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:48,535
<i>is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.</i>

1252
01:27:49,662 --> 01:27:51,830
<i>How many times
does Detective Murphy</i>

1253
01:27:51,914 --> 01:27:54,333
<i>have to give his life
for his country?</i>

1254
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,838
<i>I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow</i>

1255
01:27:59,922 --> 01:28:04,510
<i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.</i>

1256
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:11,475
<i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>

1257
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:14,353
<i>He has been
my mentor and my strength</i>

1258
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:16,897
<i>in times of difficulty
on this floor.</i>

1259
01:28:17,398 --> 01:28:20,484
<i>But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,</i>

1260
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:23,696
<i>and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.</i>

1261
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:25,114
<i>So I vote yes.</i>

1262
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,574
<i>The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.</i>

1263
01:28:27,908 --> 01:28:30,077
That's us ahead,
39 to 10.

1264
01:28:30,244 --> 01:28:33,163
I spoke to the Senate liaison and
it looks like it's in the bag,

1265
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:36,333
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

1266
01:28:37,918 --> 01:28:40,170
<i>We're here live
at DPD headquarters</i>

1267
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:43,007
<i>where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.</i>

1268
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,299
What the hell?

1269
01:28:44,383 --> 01:28:49,430
<i>Omnicorp has denied me and my
son access to Alex for weeks.</i>

1270
01:28:50,097 --> 01:28:51,932
<i>I demand to know why.</i>

1271
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:57,938
<i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody
needs to be held accountable.</i>

1272
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,941
Oh, we're fucked.

1273
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:02,484
No, we only need 12 votes.

1274
01:29:02,568 --> 01:29:04,069
She shouldn't make
much difference.

1275
01:29:04,236 --> 01:29:06,447
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

1276
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:08,365
I mean, those two should
not be allowed contact.

1277
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:10,868
If she starts
putting ideas in his head...

1278
01:29:10,993 --> 01:29:13,662
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.

1279
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:15,289
And what about Alex?

1280
01:29:15,372 --> 01:29:17,624
You know, unfortunately,
we can't just keep him on ice.

1281
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,836
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1282
01:29:20,919 --> 01:29:23,422
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

1283
01:29:23,589 --> 01:29:27,009
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

1284
01:29:27,092 --> 01:29:30,387
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

1285
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:32,848
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

1286
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:34,892
It's property of Omnicorp.

1287
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:37,227
And politics are
the least of your concern.

1288
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:38,979
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

1289
01:29:39,146 --> 01:29:41,523
How long till it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?

1290
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:42,733
If that happens,

1291
01:29:42,816 --> 01:29:45,736
every journalist in this country
is dying to speak to him.

1292
01:29:45,819 --> 01:29:47,780
I mean, we created a hero.

1293
01:29:48,322 --> 01:29:50,991
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1294
01:29:54,495 --> 01:29:56,205
What's bigger than a hero?

1295
01:30:07,883 --> 01:30:09,176
Dead hero.

1296
01:30:13,514 --> 01:30:15,474
Get me Dr. Norton.

1297
01:30:24,525 --> 01:30:25,651
What is this, Raymond?

1298
01:30:26,777 --> 01:30:30,781
You have Mattox spying on me and now this
bullshit about a "critical condition"?

1299
01:30:30,948 --> 01:30:33,659
You know and I know
Alex is fine!

1300
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:34,993
Calm down.

1301
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,662
<i>Bennett.</i>

1302
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:37,996
Your work is so good,
I don't...

1303
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,414
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

1304
01:30:39,498 --> 01:30:41,416
You saw the woman on TV!

1305
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,710
This has to stop!

1306
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:46,839
You're right.

1307
01:30:47,548 --> 01:30:49,550
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

1308
01:30:49,716 --> 01:30:52,136
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1309
01:30:52,219 --> 01:30:55,764
He's never gonna be a normal
man, a father, a husband.

1310
01:30:55,848 --> 01:30:59,101
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...

1311
01:30:59,268 --> 01:31:00,352
<i>Bennett.</i>

1312
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:03,730
Let's face it.

1313
01:31:04,565 --> 01:31:06,066
We failed him.

1314
01:31:07,526 --> 01:31:09,444
We failed Alex Murphy.

1315
01:31:09,528 --> 01:31:11,155
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

1316
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:12,739
because that's what
we're talking about.

1317
01:31:12,865 --> 01:31:15,617
The work you've done with him is
gonna be studied for decades.

1318
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:17,911
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

1319
01:31:17,995 --> 01:31:22,291
No policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again

1320
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,585
because of you.

1321
01:31:26,253 --> 01:31:27,713
You think about that.

1322
01:31:36,221 --> 01:31:40,184
I want that family
taken care of

1323
01:31:40,267 --> 01:31:41,768
beyond their wildest dreams.

1324
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,896
We owe them that.
I agree.

1325
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:47,983
I want full funding.
Ten years.

1326
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,068
New staff, all my own people.

1327
01:31:50,235 --> 01:31:51,778
Fantastic.

1328
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:53,488
Deal.

1329
01:32:03,874 --> 01:32:05,375
Hey. What's going on?

1330
01:32:05,459 --> 01:32:07,544
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

1331
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:09,379
They're not waking him up.

1332
01:32:09,463 --> 01:32:11,340
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

1333
01:32:11,423 --> 01:32:12,966
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

1334
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,178
<i>The voting period has ended.</i>

1335
01:32:16,261 --> 01:32:18,847
<i>The clerks have
tabulated the results.</i>

1336
01:32:18,931 --> 01:32:20,974
<i>The yeas are 63.</i>

1337
01:32:21,058 --> 01:32:23,769
<i>The nays are 22.</i>

1338
01:32:23,852 --> 01:32:26,355
<i>A majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.</i>

1339
01:32:26,438 --> 01:32:30,192
<i>The Dreyfus Act has been
repealed by Congress.</i>

1340
01:32:35,697 --> 01:32:38,242
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

1341
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:39,409
This is Mattox.

1342
01:32:39,493 --> 01:32:40,869
<i>Dennett's on board.</i>

1343
01:32:40,953 --> 01:32:42,537
It's about time.

1344
01:32:47,626 --> 01:32:48,752
Call it.

1345
01:32:49,503 --> 01:32:50,921
<i>Get it done.</i>

1346
01:32:51,922 --> 01:32:53,340
My pleasure.

1347
01:33:02,057 --> 01:33:04,268
Mrs. Murphy... You can come
here as much as you want.

1348
01:33:04,351 --> 01:33:07,604
You can threaten me. You can sue me.
You can take my home.

1349
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:10,607
But I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

1350
01:33:10,899 --> 01:33:13,652
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

1351
01:33:15,195 --> 01:33:16,697
Is Alex okay?

1352
01:33:16,947 --> 01:33:20,409
He has important information to share
with you. Will you accompany me?

1353
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:23,912
David.

1354
01:33:25,622 --> 01:33:27,874
We gotta go.
Can you grab your coat?

1355
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:30,210
Hey!

1356
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:31,336
<i>I'm in the
elevator, on my way down.</i>

1357
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:32,963
I need access to the lab.

1358
01:33:33,046 --> 01:33:34,673
That's insane.
They're still here.

1359
01:33:34,756 --> 01:33:36,466
<i>Distract them.</i>

1360
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:37,676
Okay.

1361
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:39,928
I cannot...

1362
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:42,180
There's a
lady in here going hysterical.

1363
01:33:42,264 --> 01:33:44,141
She will not let us in. She's
got the codes for the door.

1364
01:33:44,224 --> 01:33:45,892
I repeat,
she will not let us in.

1365
01:33:45,976 --> 01:33:48,270
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

1366
01:33:48,353 --> 01:33:49,855
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1367
01:33:49,938 --> 01:33:52,774
Do you wanna be responsible for the
deaths of everyone in this building?

1368
01:33:53,066 --> 01:33:54,443
Hey! Stop!

1369
01:33:58,613 --> 01:33:59,740
Don't shoot!

1370
01:33:59,823 --> 01:34:01,199
Step outside.

1371
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:09,333
Unlock the transmitter!

1372
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:11,710
Transmitter
unlocked!

1373
01:34:19,176 --> 01:34:21,053
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

1374
01:34:21,136 --> 01:34:22,596
<i>Right</i> away, sir.

1375
01:34:24,765 --> 01:34:26,016
<i>Wake him up!</i>

1376
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:29,519
Alex! Alex!

1377
01:34:29,936 --> 01:34:33,106
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

1378
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,399
Alex, can you hear me?

1379
01:34:35,942 --> 01:34:37,694
These men are here
to kill us.

1380
01:34:37,778 --> 01:34:40,238
They're here to kill us,
for chrissakes!

1381
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:46,828
<i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>

1382
01:34:46,912 --> 01:34:48,914
Alex had a psychotic break.

1383
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:53,293
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

1384
01:34:54,419 --> 01:34:55,921
We did everything,

1385
01:34:56,004 --> 01:34:58,924
everything, we could, but the
doctors couldn't save him.

1386
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:02,427
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

1387
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,263
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1388
01:35:05,722 --> 01:35:08,183
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

1389
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:10,477
Mattox shut you down.

1390
01:35:11,812 --> 01:35:14,689
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

1391
01:35:15,107 --> 01:35:17,275
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

1392
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:20,445
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

1393
01:35:20,904 --> 01:35:24,408
He wants you dead, Alex.
Do you understand?

1394
01:35:24,574 --> 01:35:26,410
Sorry. If there's
anything we can do

1395
01:35:26,493 --> 01:35:27,828
for you and David,
we'll do it.

1396
01:35:27,994 --> 01:35:30,122
I want nothing from you.

1397
01:35:31,081 --> 01:35:32,374
I understand.

1398
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:35,252
You stay out of our lives.

1399
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:37,879
You and your company.

1400
01:35:38,171 --> 01:35:40,048
If that's what
you think is best.

1401
01:35:41,007 --> 01:35:42,467
There's one more thing.

1402
01:35:42,551 --> 01:35:45,387
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David

1403
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,681
if we kept
this matter private.

1404
01:35:47,931 --> 01:35:50,475
We don't wanna
damage Alex's legacy.

1405
01:35:53,145 --> 01:35:54,980
<i>DR. NORTON'.
Alex! Alex!</i>

1406
01:35:55,355 --> 01:35:56,982
I can fix this!

1407
01:35:57,065 --> 01:35:58,525
You lied to me.

1408
01:35:58,608 --> 01:35:59,860
You lied to my wife.

1409
01:35:59,943 --> 01:36:01,570
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

1410
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:02,904
You want me
to trust you, Doctor?

1411
01:36:02,988 --> 01:36:05,031
Alex, I can go to the press!

1412
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:09,035
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

1413
01:36:09,327 --> 01:36:10,787
Alex!

1414
01:36:11,329 --> 01:36:13,248
Listen to me, please!

1415
01:36:14,249 --> 01:36:17,544
Alex! Alex!

1416
01:36:29,181 --> 01:36:30,223
What the hell?

1417
01:36:38,607 --> 01:36:39,983
Keep all our systems
at green light,

1418
01:36:40,066 --> 01:36:42,152
and for chrissakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

1419
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:43,236
<i>Roger</i> that.

1420
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,280
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

1421
01:36:46,615 --> 01:36:48,200
Look at this city.

1422
01:36:50,035 --> 01:36:51,578
So beautiful.

1423
01:36:52,579 --> 01:36:55,248
It's become so peaceful.

1424
01:36:58,043 --> 01:36:59,377
I Wish

1425
01:37:00,378 --> 01:37:02,631
I had some good news
for Detroit.

1426
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:04,883
I have very sad news.

1427
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:07,719
Despite our best efforts
to save him,

1428
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:10,472
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

1429
01:37:10,889 --> 01:37:12,182
Alex Murphy was...

1430
01:37:12,265 --> 01:37:13,475
Mr. Sellars.

1431
01:37:13,892 --> 01:37:15,477
What is it?
Mattox just called.

1432
01:37:16,061 --> 01:37:17,896
We need you to
come with us now.

1433
01:37:24,194 --> 01:37:25,987
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

1434
01:37:26,112 --> 01:37:28,114
What are you talking about? We
have a security situation here.

1435
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:29,616
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

1436
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:31,576
Sir, there's a car outside
that's supposed to...

1437
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,286
That area is locked down.
Now go.

1438
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:35,038
What's happening?
I said go!

1439
01:37:35,372 --> 01:37:37,374
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

1440
01:37:40,293 --> 01:37:41,378
Mr. Sellars.

1441
01:37:41,545 --> 01:37:43,505
How close is that helicopter?
About 10 minutes, sir.

1442
01:38:01,356 --> 01:38:02,607
Excuse me.
Yes?

1443
01:38:02,774 --> 01:38:05,110
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1444
01:38:05,277 --> 01:38:06,486
It's an emergency.

1445
01:38:06,653 --> 01:38:08,280
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

1446
01:38:08,738 --> 01:38:10,448
Apparently there's a Clara
Murphy in the lobby.

1447
01:38:10,615 --> 01:38:13,952
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

1448
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:16,454
What do you wanna do?
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

1449
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:17,706
Yes, sir.

1450
01:38:21,626 --> 01:38:24,421
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

1451
01:38:24,588 --> 01:38:26,631
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1452
01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:29,426
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed. Clear?

1453
01:38:29,509 --> 01:38:30,510
Clear.
Clear.

1454
01:38:46,901 --> 01:38:48,278
Hold it right there.

1455
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:50,280
Don't move.

1456
01:38:54,034 --> 01:38:57,370
This is private property. You
are not authorized to be here!

1457
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:03,627
I'd put those guns down now
if I were you.

1458
01:39:03,793 --> 01:39:05,462
Stand down.
All right, man, we're good.

1459
01:39:51,925 --> 01:39:53,259
Head to the lower level.

1460
01:39:54,886 --> 01:39:55,887
Hold up, hold up!

1461
01:39:56,012 --> 01:39:57,222
Ram it!

1462
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:58,783
Gun it.

1463
01:41:00,243 --> 01:41:01,828
GO, go, go! Now!

1464
01:41:17,802 --> 01:41:19,304
Alex, run!

1465
01:41:20,138 --> 01:41:22,182
Omnicorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

1466
01:41:22,348 --> 01:41:24,267
Drop your weapon.

1467
01:41:24,434 --> 01:41:27,228
<i>Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.</i>

1468
01:41:42,494 --> 01:41:43,620
What's going on?

1469
01:41:43,703 --> 01:41:45,955
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

1470
01:41:46,122 --> 01:41:48,625
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

1471
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,835
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

1472
01:41:50,919 --> 01:41:52,003
and he's shooting up
the building.

1473
01:41:52,086 --> 01:41:54,881
So we've gotta get you and your
son out of here right away.

1474
01:41:55,048 --> 01:41:56,591
I gotta take this call.

1475
01:41:57,884 --> 01:41:59,469
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

1476
01:41:59,552 --> 01:42:01,095
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1477
01:42:01,513 --> 01:42:04,557
Don't shoot. My robot. You just flank.
Got it.

1478
01:42:04,724 --> 01:42:05,975
Tin Man.

1479
01:42:08,728 --> 01:42:09,938
Tin Man.

1480
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:12,232
Tin Man.

1481
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:13,983
Oh, there it is.

1482
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:16,027
You look like crap.

1483
01:42:18,655 --> 01:42:19,823
What's the matter?

1484
01:42:19,989 --> 01:42:21,199
Can't shoot?

1485
01:42:22,992 --> 01:42:24,077
Huh?

1486
01:42:24,828 --> 01:42:26,913
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1487
01:42:26,996 --> 01:42:27,997
You're a robot.

1488
01:42:28,206 --> 01:42:30,416
I'm a red asset.
Wrote that myself.

1489
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:32,168
What do you think?

1490
01:42:32,585 --> 01:42:35,421
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

1491
01:42:35,588 --> 01:42:36,589
Pull it.

1492
01:42:37,382 --> 01:42:38,466
You can run.

1493
01:42:39,008 --> 01:42:40,009
Go on.

1494
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,386
Run.

1495
01:42:41,845 --> 01:42:42,971
Run!

1496
01:42:43,304 --> 01:42:45,139
There you go. Run.

1497
01:42:45,598 --> 01:42:46,933
Run.Run!

1498
01:42:50,103 --> 01:42:51,521
Whoo!

1499
01:42:51,604 --> 01:42:53,731
Stings like a bitch,
don't it?

1500
01:42:53,898 --> 01:42:57,193
Aren't you lucky I didn't
have my gun set to "kill"?

1501
01:42:58,444 --> 01:42:59,779
Hey, listen.

1502
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:01,823
This isn't personal.

1503
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:04,617
Well, maybe a little.

1504
01:43:06,369 --> 01:43:08,204
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

1505
01:43:19,924 --> 01:43:21,384
<i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>

1506
01:43:21,467 --> 01:43:22,719
Mr. Sellars boards first.

1507
01:43:22,802 --> 01:43:25,763
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you
and your son can get on first.

1508
01:43:31,185 --> 01:43:32,478
Officer down.

1509
01:43:32,562 --> 01:43:33,688
Mechanical room.

1510
01:43:33,771 --> 01:43:35,356
Omnicorp Building.

1511
01:43:35,523 --> 01:43:37,400
<i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>

1512
01:43:39,027 --> 01:43:40,612
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

1513
01:43:40,695 --> 01:43:41,946
It's nonfatal.

1514
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:43,615
Go. Go.

1515
01:43:44,824 --> 01:43:47,619
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

1516
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:55,376
What's that?

1517
01:43:57,295 --> 01:43:58,421
He's got a gun!
What?

1518
01:43:58,588 --> 01:43:59,589
Pull up! Pull up!

1519
01:44:04,552 --> 01:44:06,846
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

1520
01:44:12,393 --> 01:44:13,394
Alex?

1521
01:44:13,561 --> 01:44:14,562
Dad?

1522
01:44:17,982 --> 01:44:19,400
Clara, David.

1523
01:44:20,401 --> 01:44:21,569
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1524
01:44:21,653 --> 01:44:22,654
Wait.

1525
01:44:23,738 --> 01:44:25,615
Get out of the way.
Alex, put down the gun.

1526
01:44:25,782 --> 01:44:27,867
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1527
01:44:29,744 --> 01:44:31,120
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

1528
01:44:31,204 --> 01:44:32,956
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1529
01:44:36,668 --> 01:44:39,170
Are you here to cuff me?
All right.

1530
01:44:39,963 --> 01:44:41,422
Go 'head, cuff me.

1531
01:44:42,632 --> 01:44:45,218
You can't. You're not
programmed that way.

1532
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:46,803
If you go against
the program,

1533
01:44:46,886 --> 01:44:48,721
the entire system
shuts down, so.

1534
01:44:48,888 --> 01:44:50,974
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1535
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:53,226
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

1536
01:44:53,393 --> 01:44:54,394
I'm just from marketing.

1537
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,896
Now! Ok a)', yep, yep, yep Yep

1538
01:44:57,063 --> 01:44:59,232
Alex, we need to
work together here.

1539
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:02,485
Because I'm the only one with the
technology to keep you alive.

1540
01:45:03,611 --> 01:45:05,238
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1541
01:45:11,369 --> 01:45:12,370
All right.

1542
01:45:12,537 --> 01:45:13,538
Weapon.

1543
01:45:15,206 --> 01:45:18,334
Alex, honestly,
I mean you no harm.

1544
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:20,795
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.

1545
01:45:20,962 --> 01:45:22,839
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1546
01:45:22,922 --> 01:45:24,757
Sellars, please! Don't!

1547
01:45:24,924 --> 01:45:27,468
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family

1548
01:45:28,803 --> 01:45:30,388
and I could just
kill them too.

1549
01:45:30,513 --> 01:45:32,181
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it

1550
01:45:32,265 --> 01:45:34,267
because, let's face it,

1551
01:45:34,892 --> 01:45:36,227
you're a robot.

1552
01:45:36,853 --> 01:45:38,312
Do you understand that?

1553
01:45:42,567 --> 01:45:43,568
Alex.

1554
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:47,989
Dad!

1555
01:45:52,118 --> 01:45:53,369
Baby.

1556
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:00,043
Hey.

1557
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:02,670
Hey.

1558
01:46:03,171 --> 01:46:05,173
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1559
01:46:06,132 --> 01:46:08,384
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1560
01:46:58,267 --> 01:47:00,019
How you feeling, Alex?

1561
01:47:01,938 --> 01:47:03,064
I'm ready.

1562
01:47:40,852 --> 01:47:42,228
He's ready.

1563
01:48:16,345 --> 01:48:17,513
There's still no word

1564
01:48:17,597 --> 01:48:20,600
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

1565
01:48:21,517 --> 01:48:25,271
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

1566
01:48:25,354 --> 01:48:28,065
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

1567
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:32,695
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by cell phone

1568
01:48:32,778 --> 01:48:35,198
that shows
the people of Detroit

1569
01:48:35,281 --> 01:48:37,366
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

1570
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:39,035
sooner than they think.

1571
01:48:41,078 --> 01:48:42,580
The real tragedy here

1572
01:48:42,663 --> 01:48:47,460
is that our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

1573
01:48:48,836 --> 01:48:53,591
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

1574
01:48:53,674 --> 01:48:57,136
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

1575
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:00,973
<i>I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.</i>

1576
01:49:01,974 --> 01:49:04,894
<i>But I do believe
my research program is sound.</i>

1577
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:07,730
<i>What I did With it</i>

1578
01:49:09,232 --> 01:49:10,274
<i>was wrong.</i>

1579
01:49:10,358 --> 01:49:13,361
The fact that this
mother...

1580
01:49:13,444 --> 01:49:16,697
is not serving time
in some federal penitentiary

1581
01:49:16,781 --> 01:49:20,785
is a huge, hot, heaping
pile of horse...

1582
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:30,920
Now I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous

1583
01:49:31,003 --> 01:49:35,007
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

1584
01:49:35,174 --> 01:49:39,303
Some of you even believe that the
use of these drones overseas

1585
01:49:39,387 --> 01:49:44,058
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists

1586
01:49:44,141 --> 01:49:46,894
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1587
01:49:47,353 --> 01:49:49,814
To you, I say...

1588
01:49:49,981 --> 01:49:52,358
Stop whining!

1589
01:49:54,193 --> 01:49:56,821
America is now

1590
01:49:56,904 --> 01:49:59,198
and always will be

1591
01:49:59,282 --> 01:50:03,703
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

1592
01:50:08,249 --> 01:50:09,792
I'm Pat Novak.

1593
01:50:11,294 --> 01:50:12,545
Good night.

1594
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:22,680
<i>Breakin' rocks in the hot sun</i>

1595
01:50:22,763 --> 01:50:25,766
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1596
01:50:26,183 --> 01:50:28,978
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1597
01:50:29,061 --> 01:50:32,273
<i>I needed the money
'cause I had none</i>

1598
01:50:32,356 --> 01:50:35,318
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1599
01:50:35,401 --> 01:50:38,487
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1600
01:50:38,571 --> 01:50:41,699
<i>I left my baby
and it feels so bad</i>

1601
01:50:41,782 --> 01:50:44,410
<i>I guess my race is run</i>

1602
01:50:45,036 --> 01:50:48,039
<i>She's the best girl
that I ever had</i>

1603
01:50:48,122 --> 01:50:51,250
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1604
01:50:51,334 --> 01:50:54,003
<i>I fought the law and the</i>

1605
01:50:54,503 --> 01:50:57,673
<i>Robbin' people with a six gun</i>

1606
01:50:57,757 --> 01:51:00,801
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1607
01:51:00,885 --> 01:51:04,013
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1608
01:51:04,096 --> 01:51:07,183
<i>I lost my girl
and I lost my fun</i>

1609
01:51:07,266 --> 01:51:10,519
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1610
01:51:10,603 --> 01:51:13,439
<i>I fought the law
and the law won</i>

1611
01:51:13,522 --> 01:51:16,859
<i>I left my baby
and it feels so bad</i>

1612
01:51:16,942 --> 01:51:19,487
<i>I guess my race is run</i>

1613
01:51:19,987 --> 01:51:23,199
<i>She's the best girl
that I ever had</i>

1614
01:51:23,282 --> 01:51:26,243
