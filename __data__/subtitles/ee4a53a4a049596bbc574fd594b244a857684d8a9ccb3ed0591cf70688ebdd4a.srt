1
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,226
That's them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:30,663
Just like that.

3
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:34,014
I wouldn't go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,865
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,692
I'll stay right here.
Thank you.

6
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,933
Those things scare me to death.

7
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,327
They been killing my honey bees.

8
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,850
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,286
they'll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,940
What are you gonna do with them?

11
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,376
Well, that's between
me and them,

12
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:50,422
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,641
That's okay.

14
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:54,904
I understand these things.

15
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:59,126
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,085
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,132
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,047
This place was crabgrass and weeds,

19
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,328
and you brought it back to life.

20
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,573
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:15,098
No one's ever taken care of me before.

22
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,018
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:25,500
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,984
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,661
Boss.

26
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:42,141
- You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,056
I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,536
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:48,365
Get this fucking
hippie shit down, please.

30
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,238
United Data Group.
Good afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,283
How may I help you?

32
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,154
Boyd.

33
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,374
Uh, hello.
I just got a message saying

34
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,376
that there's a problem
with my computer.

35
00:05:59,377 --> 00:06:01,160
<i>Don't you worry.
The message you received</i>

36
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,380
<i>is from our United Data Group
antivirus software.</i>

37
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,946
<i>It's part of
the software package</i>

38
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,507
<i>that you pre-installed
on your computer.</i>

39
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,733
I'm sorry.
I'm not a computer person.

40
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,736
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,179
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,050
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:24,662
So what I'm going to need you
to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,446
<i>and install the latest version.</i>

45
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,361
Well, I have no idea
how to do that.

46
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:29,928
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,538
<i>Well, I would recommend</i>

48
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,887
<i>you take your computer
to an IT specialist.</i>

49
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,454
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,456
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,720
since they'll have to replace
the hard drive.

52
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,506
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,509
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,119
<i>Okay.
There is actually</i>

55
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,860
<i>a software package
that you can download</i>

56
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,166
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,170
All right.
Tell me what to do.

58
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,042
It's okay. Can you, uh,
can you type this,

59
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,088
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,177
<i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>

61
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,050
Okay.
I'm there.

62
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,486
And there should be a button

63
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:07,574
on your screen
that says "install."

64
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:08,923
<i>Can you click on that button?</i>

65
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,795
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,057
So you're about
to see some windows

67
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,537
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,626
<i>as I reinstall
the virus shield for you.</i>

69
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:18,673
Okay.

70
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,761
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:21,981
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,637
but not so much that you sound
like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,855
All right?

74
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:30,554
She has got 10K checking,

75
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:33,470
life insurance annuity,
Roth IRA,

76
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,732
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,343
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,171
All right.

79
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,303
She is a signatory

80
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:44,350
on a $2 million dollar account.

81
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:47,484
Some, uh...
It's some fucking charity.

82
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:50,878
All right, kids,
let the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,665
Ooh.
My computer's going crazy.

84
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,536
<i>Totally normal.</i>

85
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:57,817
<i>Just do not touch your keyboard.</i>

86
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,546
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:08,026
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:09,201
How about that?

89
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,377
I've gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,293
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,555
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,296
That's an account that I manage.

93
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,776
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,560
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,477
Just hold on.

96
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,306
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,570
There's a transfer for $50,000?

98
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:35,575
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:37,186
Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,579
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,102
<i>I was supposed
to credit you 500,</i>

102
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,931
<i>but I don't know,
I got a stuck key here.</i>

103
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,281
<i>I'm gonna lose my job here.</i>

104
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,109
I got kids.

105
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,458
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,550
Oh, I don't want you
to get in trouble, but...

107
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:57,641
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:01,514
I will need
a different password though.

109
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,950
One second.

110
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:06,172
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:11,176
Okay, so the second we get it,
we zero out everything.

112
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:13,179
Um...

113
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,618
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:21,666
I think I should call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,405
<i>You know what?
You're probably right.</i>

116
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:26,018
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,325
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,988
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,602
Okay.

120
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,303
Boom!
Fucking yes!

121
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,958
That is what I am talking about!
Come on!

122
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,092
Let me fucking hear it!
I fucking love you people!

123
00:09:58,093 --> 00:09:59,441
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,752
Hello?

125
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,711
Hello?
You still there?

126
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,590
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,943
Oh.

128
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:29,298
Oh.

129
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,014
What did I do?

130
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,885
Stupid...

131
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:34,754
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:00,999
Don't move.

133
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,741
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:05,655
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:10,791
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,667
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,806
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,939
...and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:33,248
Verona...

140
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,077
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:38,079
How do you know my...

142
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,737
Mom.

143
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,700
<i>Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.</i>

144
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,137
Clear him?

145
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,529
Agent Parker, I know that's your mother.

146
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,575
I understand.

147
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:59,013
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,106
Suicide?
You can't be serious.

149
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:09,762
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,982
But by all means,
let's just completely ignore

151
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,027
the big white dude
in her house with a knife.

152
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,203
Get him up.

153
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:16,856
Come on.

154
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,428
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:24,124
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,779
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,302
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:29,608
Like, what the fuck
were you doing

159
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,871
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:33,482
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:36,268
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,879
Who the fuck are you?
Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:40,489
I keep bees.

164
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,710
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,495
I rent some space
in the barn from her.

166
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,671
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,762
But what the fuck
were you doing in her house?

168
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:56,722
She didn't answer
when I knocked.

169
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,029
I noted her car in the driveway.

170
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,379
I heard the smoke alarm
and I entered.

171
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,250
You "noted"?

172
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:04,343
You got a law enforcement
background?

173
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,907
I told you, I take care of bees.

174
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,562
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:19,240
His hands tested
negative for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,721
But the prints on the gun
were your mother's.

177
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,942
It seems, sadly, it was suicide.

178
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,738
Mr. Clay, I need to apologize
for last night.

179
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:42,307
I realize I may have been
a little aggressive.

180
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,399
That's understandable.

181
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:53,274
Could I interest you
in something a bit stronger?

182
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:56,843
No.

183
00:15:58,323 --> 00:15:59,846
But I'll sit with you
if you like.

184
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:08,027
No, thank you.

185
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,555
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,384
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,084
I tried to stay in her life
as much as I could.

188
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,725
Obviously, I could have
done a better job.

189
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:27,395
Being old can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:33,010
Turn a certain age, you cease to exist.
Cease to matter.

191
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,448
Used to be a part of life,
of the family.

192
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,233
Part of the hive,
I guess you could say.

193
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,933
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,894
I was born there.

195
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,768
I hated that she was
out here alone.

196
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,815
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,254
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,781
You know, I think I know
why she liked you.

199
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:07,957
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,483
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,964
He was killed
a few years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,881
She loved him.

203
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,622
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,582
and you'd think he invented fire.

205
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,584
You know, while I graduated
the FBI Academy

206
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,761
and she said,
"Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,026
She got scammed.

208
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,986
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:37,944 --> 00:17:39,771
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,774
Got every penny.
Maxed out all her cards.

211
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:44,689
She was an educator,

212
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,692
director of a charity for kids.

213
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,390
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,654
You know who did it?

215
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,535
I talked to an agent
in our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,702
This crew's been operating
for two years

217
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,008
and we don't even have names.

218
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,445
And even if we did, good luck
building an indictment

219
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,664
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,102
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,365
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:09,883
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,238
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,806
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,982
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,811
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,335
there are parents.

228
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:24,077
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:27,341
Someone hurts an older person...

230
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:32,041
sometimes they're left to face
the hornets alone.

231
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,133
Because either
it goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,006
or no one cares.

233
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,748
I care.

234
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,751
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,275
And so help me God,

236
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,712
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:58,459
I need to take care of the hive.

238
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:02,811
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,379
The hive is more important.

240
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,570
What are you doing?

241
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,530
- I thought you retired.
<i>- I did.</i>

242
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,923
I need a favor.

243
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,621
<i>What kind of favor?</i>

244
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,276
A name and address.

245
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:35,104
- <i>Easy.</i>
- Not easy.

246
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,760
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

247
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:40,979
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

248
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,721
<i>Shoot me the deets and stand by.</i>

249
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:50,728
Yeah.

250
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:52,489
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,079
They're routing
all over the world.

252
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,428
But you found them?

253
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,388
Sure.
But who are these people?

254
00:19:58,432 --> 00:19:59,912
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,355
The hell you think
you're going, pal?

257
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:10,356
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,750
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:14,882
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:16,145
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,670
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:20,932
Yeah, that's not happening, buddy.

263
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,455
You're not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,414
except right the fuck back
the way you came.

265
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,243
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,246
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,596
One, two, three.

268
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,946
There.
I did it for you.

269
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:38,255
You aware
this is a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,647
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:42,781
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,877
Do you know
that's who you work for?

273
00:20:58,187 --> 00:20:59,667
<i>I'm looking for the call center.</i>

274
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,233
Yeah, you're in the right place.

275
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:02,975
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,328
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,329
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,941
- There's going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:14,942
Thanks.

280
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,297
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:23,298
Nah, I'm good, buddy.
I'm just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:26,390
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,393
Uh, Miss Perkins, so sorry,
I'll have to

284
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:32,265
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,616
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:37,356
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:41,099
I will never steal from the weak

288
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,187
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:46,234
I sent you a department download,

290
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,846
and we'll find out
what's going on...

291
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:02,774
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:03,818 --> 00:22:05,776
I will never steal from the weak

293
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:07,168
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:08,953
I will never steal from the weak

295
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,564
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,047
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,919
I'm gonna burn this place
to the ground.

298
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:22,663
Might be a good time to go home.

299
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:25,056
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,798
- It's gas!
- Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:29,888
It's gas!

302
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,543
It's gas!
It's gas!

303
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,069
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,289
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,074
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

306
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,076
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,513
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,038
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:53,606
This a multi-million dollar
operation, asshole.

310
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,303
Okay, so you can't come up here,

311
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,741
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,747
Will you stomp
his ass out, please?

313
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,894
I got it.
You fucking get him.

314
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,810
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:34,431
Bet you feel
really proud of yourself.

316
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:57,584
Mister...?

317
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,498
Uh...

318
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,545
- Uh, uh, Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,983
I don't care if your friends
here live or die.

320
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:09,029
The next call
from your little phishing scam

321
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,509
to this call center

322
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,772
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:15,167
Given all of
the gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:17,996
I promise you...

325
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:22,042
anything alive in here won't be.

326
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,615
Uh, guys,
we might want to dip out.

327
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:57,425
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:24:57,426 --> 00:25:02,082
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,041
and, uh, extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,608
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,482
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:11,352
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:13,094
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,968
- Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,492
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:22,886
And it's like I can barely fucking move.

337
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,410
It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,760
- Oh, those are nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,588
- Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,244
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:40,251
What?
I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:41,469
<i>You said hit me on voice</i>

343
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,601
<i>if there's an emergency.</i>

344
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:45,039
Okay. Right.
Well, uh...

345
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,043
It seems we had
a disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:53,177
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,831
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:55,832
and start shoving back.

349
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:59,793
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,273
Okay, tell me what the fuck
is going on right now.

351
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,928
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,017
saying we're stealing
from people,

353
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:09,846
<i>and he just tears through
all my security guys,</i>

354
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:13,327
<i>like, fucking tissue paper
and, um...</i>

355
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,328
And what?

356
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,810
And he burns the place
to the ground.

357
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,508
<i>Yeah.
The call center is gone.</i>

358
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:23,033
<i>I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,</i>

359
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:26,080
it's now
a giant fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:28,560
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:30,083
You're telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,345
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,696
and dropped four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,219
Yeah, that's not exactly
a disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,873
<i>Who did this?
Give me a name right now.</i>

366
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,614
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,834
<i>All the cameras and the drives
burned up in the fire.</i>

368
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,662
He had a hat.

369
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:45,751
Oh, he had a hat.
Okay.

370
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:47,448
I'm gonna hit you back.
All right?

371
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,147
I got to go big-dog this shit
for a minute.

372
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,111
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:26:57,764 --> 00:26:58,896
What? What?
No, nothing.

374
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:01,854
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,204
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,903
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:07,817
Get him?

378
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:09,035
Yeah,
like disappear the problem.

379
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:11,559
Come on.

380
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,170
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:15,346
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,000
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,610
and you're telling me
you can't just find

384
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:20,090
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:21,891
Listen, this sounds
like a job for the police.

386
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,355
I just need a name.

387
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,183
Well, you won't get it from me.

388
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:28,185
And you keep me
a million miles away

389
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:29,665
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,666
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,364
Yup.

392
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:34,887
So check it out.

393
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,541
Daddy can't hold your hand
on this one.

394
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,326
Uh, this is clearly some kind
of crime of passion,

395
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:40,501
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:42,286
someone snapped, like, whatever.

397
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,635
But, uh,
what we're going to do is

398
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:44,897
I'm going to send you
some credentials,

399
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,377
you're going
to log into our cloud

400
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:47,857
and you're going
to look at anyone connected

401
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,380
to the last few deals you closed.
All right?

402
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,903
<i>Just, I don't know, start there.</i>

403
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:53,123
And, like,
what if I find this guy?

404
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:54,341
Then what?

405
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,604
You get a wrecking crew together

406
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:57,867
and you go <i>Goodfellas</i> on him.

407
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,390
I mean, come on,
you're a connected guy, right?

408
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:00,478
Do you understand?

409
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,657
Yeah. No, I understand.
I, uh...

410
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,224
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,806
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:25,896
<i>V, you good?</i>

413
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:27,724
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,622
I mean, you did
lose your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,731
Yeah.

416
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:39,169
<i>What do you want, Wiley?</i>

417
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,823
Are you leaving?
Please don't go.

418
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:42,826
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:45,543
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,007
<i>Go on.</i>

421
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,226
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:57,143
Yeah.

423
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,454
Give us a few seconds,
thank you.

424
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,152
Where's mine?

425
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:07,763
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,242
with instant
and gas station hot water.

427
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,591
Ew.

428
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:11,680
- You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:16,163
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,339
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,167
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:22,169
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:25,477
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,566
They're all frequent fliers
with perjury,

435
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,742
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:33,877
Fucking scumbags.
I want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,509
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:41,798
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:58,858
Eloise Parker.

440
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:01,512
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,906
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:05,951
widow, just has a daughter
in Boston.

443
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:08,172
I don't think this is it,
but, you know.

444
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,351
You said your boy
has an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:15,875
That's him.

446
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:28,496
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:31,325
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,544
Yeah, dickhead was talking
about them.

449
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:36,156
I guess he's a, like, bee lover.

450
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:38,897
You know what?

451
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:41,900
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:31,428
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,433
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,349
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,533
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,578
Let's go!

457
00:32:58,298 --> 00:33:00,126
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,824
Can someone,
like, fucking help me?

459
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:07,263
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,264 --> 00:33:09,135
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,226
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:15,706
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:17,664
Let's just work this out, me and you.
We can fix...

464
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,927
No, no!

465
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,063
Oh, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,208
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,774
What's the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:42,907
Don't know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:42,908 --> 00:33:44,474
So then why are people
just wiring you

470
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:45,953
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:48,913
Must be your winning personality.

472
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:50,045
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:51,698
so maybe
you want to talk to them.

474
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,180
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:57,356
Did you steal it out
of a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:59,097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh...

477
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:00,577
Verona, if you're done
shitting all over

478
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:02,144
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,755
can I speak to you for a moment?

480
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,323
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,762
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:13,286
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:16,115
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:17,856
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:20,554
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:23,339
'Cause apparently,
your mother's house

487
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,167
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:26,733
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:29,302
Yeah. Shit's on fire.
Let's go.

490
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,233
You good?

491
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:48,974
V, you okay?

492
00:34:50,323 --> 00:34:51,802
Yeah.

493
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,893
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,070
Where's Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,642
- United Data Group.
- Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,818
Thank you.

497
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,212
Are you okay?

498
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,215
Yeah, Wiley, I'm good.
I'm good.

499
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,217
You think there's
even the remotest chance

500
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:18,133
that the dude who burned down
United Data Group

501
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:19,351
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,353
from your mother?

503
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:25,141
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,885
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,636
Fucking shit.

506
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:58,042
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,262
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,570
Yo, what's up, playa?

509
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:05,919
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,356
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:09,967
and I put you on a G6
to Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,448
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,058
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,538
Are you fucking crying
right now?

515
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,063
I'm not crying.
I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:21,021
Bleeding?
Why are you bleeding?

517
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:22,371
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:26,027
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,680
He cut them off.

520
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:30,728
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:36,036
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:40,258
I don't know.
A fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:43,348
<i>Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.</i>

524
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,047
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,135
I don't know.
He said he was, like,

526
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:50,094
protecting the hive
or something.

527
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,965
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:53,924
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,273
No, no, no!
Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,796
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

531
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,972
You want money?
You want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,496
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:00,497 --> 00:37:02,280
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,457
No! Dude,
what the fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:08,853
Don't move.

536
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:12,073
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,206
<i>You're fucking crazy, man.</i>

538
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,035
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:34,007
What the fuck!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:37,316
Fucking stop the fucking car!
No! No!

541
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,900
Who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with?

542
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:00,687
Fuck you.
That's who.

543
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,384
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:03,385
fucking call center.

545
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:05,997
Now I'm going to burn you down.

546
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,781
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,435
I told you my name.

548
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:11,654
It's fuck you.
Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:12,916
You better fucking remember it.

550
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,352
<i>Because you don't burn me down.</i>

551
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:16,006
<i>I burn you down.
You understand me?</i>

552
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:18,444
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,533
You sound young.

554
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,105
I bet you don't
have estate planning.

555
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,060
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:28,411
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,386
<i>Breaking news in Springfield,</i>

558
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:50,040
<i>where three bodies
have been discovered</i>

559
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,390
<i>following an arson fire
at a small farm.</i>

560
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,261
<i>There was an office building explosion...</i>

561
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:57,353
- And you say one guy did this?
- Yup.

562
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:01,879
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:05,143
Yup. And he said
he was going to kill me.

564
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:07,319
And this is your

565
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:12,106
data mining consumer service
business, right?

566
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:14,674
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,110
Pulling in 9 million a month
in one office.

568
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,286
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:20,767
Yeah.

570
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,902
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:27,295
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,298
Yeah, it's like
his whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,608
Jesus.

574
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:37,609
What?

575
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:46,358
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,796
this might well
be your <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

577
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,538
How did I fuck up?

578
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:56,020
I don't know.
You've done something.

579
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:58,717
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,240
Oh.

581
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,199
Oh, okay.
So fucking what?

582
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,070
Why'd I care if the guy
keeps bees?

583
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,333
If a Beekeeper
says you're gonna die,

584
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,510
you're gonna die.

585
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:11,078
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

586
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:16,256
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

587
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:17,868
What good are you?

588
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:19,609
Yeah.

589
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:26,311
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

590
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,879
culminating as director
of the world's

591
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,750
premier intelligence agency.

592
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,317
I could have done anything,

593
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:35,712
but I chose this job
as a favor to your mother.

594
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:39,890
I keep
Danforth Enterprises safe.

595
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:44,546
Keep her reputation safe,
her name safe.

596
00:40:44,547 --> 00:40:46,635
It's my fucking name too,
all right?

597
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:48,463
Oh, sit down.

598
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:50,203
I put up with you.

599
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,988
I've put up with your tantrums,

600
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:55,079
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

601
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:59,518
The endless stream
of sex workers.

602
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,958
You're a drowning man.
Do you know that?

603
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,090
Mm.

604
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,048
You're scared.

605
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,572
Dead right I'm scared.

606
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:13,576
Terrified.
So should you be.

607
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:17,493
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

608
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:24,890
He's probably the last pair of eyes

609
00:41:24,891 --> 00:41:26,327
that you're going to sneer at.

610
00:41:32,551 --> 00:41:33,943
Okay, listen.

611
00:41:33,944 --> 00:41:35,466
Remember our favorite
burning building?

612
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:37,207
United Data Group.

613
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,556
The guys who work there are hackers,

614
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:40,819
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,909
Guy who ran it.
Garnett.

616
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:46,085
He's in the book.
He's a known mob associate.

617
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,174
He's missing, but I've got
PD chasing him down.

618
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,786
Okay, so I had some analysts
run some shit,

619
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:53,353
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

620
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:55,704
Dude, I think United Data Group

621
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:57,401
is one of several call centers.

622
00:41:57,402 --> 00:41:59,272
So there's got to be
like a central office

623
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:00,535
that's controlling all of them,

624
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:01,776
and that's what we got to find.

625
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,668
Wiley, this could be like

626
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,628
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

627
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,759
- Hello?
- Hey!

628
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,587
Did you hear a single word
I just said?

629
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:10,589
Yeah.

630
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,418
And?

631
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:15,941
I was just thinking
you come in here,

632
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:17,290
hungover on your day off,

633
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,770
and gain more yardage
on this thing

634
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,425
than the whole squad has
in two years.

635
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,255
Yeah, well,
they fucked with my family.

636
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,344
What'd you get on Clay?

637
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,737
- Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

638
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:29,913
He's a ghost.

639
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,305
What?

640
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:34,046
Yeah, all I have
is a birth certificate

641
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:35,048
and a social.

642
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:37,180
The guy's never even

643
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,268
had a bank account,

644
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:40,576
credit card, flown on a plane.

645
00:42:41,098 --> 00:42:42,751
I ran his prints through
every database

646
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:44,362
I can think of, no hits.

647
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:46,929
That's bullshit.

648
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,410
This dude is former military all day.

649
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,454
No hits.
I'm telling you.

650
00:42:50,455 --> 00:42:51,629
Either he's never been printed,

651
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,328
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

652
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:57,330
Which is terrifying to me

653
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:59,245
because he's probably
in a classified program.

654
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:03,163
Special Agent Wiley.

655
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:06,426
Okay.

656
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:07,950
- Let's go.
- What?

657
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,256
- They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

658
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:12,303
- They found him. Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

659
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:16,654
Jessica.

660
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,295
<i>I think you know
why I'm calling.</i>

661
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:21,312
You know,
I'd do anything for you.

662
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,011
Anything for you.

663
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:27,273
Derek's scared shitless.

664
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,972
I've never seen him this scared.

665
00:43:29,799 --> 00:43:31,452
Well, he's made his bed.

666
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,629
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

667
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,935
That's another million a year.

668
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:38,634
<i>Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.</i>

669
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,899
Look, I don't need that.
I have enough.

670
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:44,988
So you got this?

671
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,253
Yeah.
You have my word.

672
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:51,081
<i>Wallace...</i>

673
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,650
I still think of you...

674
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:58,217
<i>sometimes.</i>

675
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,218
Sometimes.

676
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:16,801
Why are you calling me

677
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,063
on the "never call
this line" line?

678
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:19,935
This is priority one, Janet.

679
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:21,806
Well, if it was priority one,
I would know about it.

680
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,634
Look, I'm heading downtown
to a POTUS brief.

681
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:24,680
<i>Just hear me out.</i>

682
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,768
Now, you know who I work for,
don't you?

683
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:28,813
<i>Oh, yeah.
God help you, Wallace.</i>

684
00:44:28,814 --> 00:44:29,815
Exactly.

685
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,077
Well, Director Harward,

686
00:44:32,078 --> 00:44:33,731
my young friend,
seems to have caught

687
00:44:33,732 --> 00:44:35,865
the unwanted attentions of...

688
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,518
I don't know
how else to say this.

689
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:39,695
Of a Beekeeper.

690
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,220
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

691
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:45,570
As in.

692
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:48,528
- <i>Well, that's not good.</i>
- No, it's not.

693
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,358
- What's the body count?
- <i>Seven today.</i>

694
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:55,057
You busy making funeral arrangements?

695
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:57,408
I need help, Janet.
Not jokes.

696
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:05,851
Is that Garnett?

697
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,027
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

698
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:10,072
Check this out.

699
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,919
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

700
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:34,401
So your problem?
He's retired from the program.

701
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:36,273
No longer active.

702
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:40,756
Well, that changes everything.

703
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:43,758
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

704
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,455
and is going to be taking things from here.

705
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:47,109
You can rest easy, old friend.

706
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,372
<i>Oh, no.
Janet.</i>

707
00:45:48,938 --> 00:45:51,417
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

708
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,463
<i>who should have been removed
months ago.</i>

709
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:54,770
God help us now.

710
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:36,463
Get out of here!

711
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:42,295
Shit!

712
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:46,343
- Excuse me.
- You're cool.

713
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:08,886
You've been a busy bee.

714
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:10,757
You're supposed to be retired.

715
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:12,630
I'm assuming
you're my replacement.

716
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,533
Fuck you!

717
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:41,414
I need your keys.

718
00:48:57,256 --> 00:48:58,692
There's an issue.

719
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:00,956
The problem has not been solved.

720
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:03,480
Well...

721
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:07,049
That is a surprise.

722
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,833
The Beekeepers
have studied the situation

723
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:11,967
and have decided
to remain neutral.

724
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,272
How can they do that?

725
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,275
He was their man,
for fuck's sake!

726
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,234
<i>I'm sorry, Wallace.</i>

727
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:20,497
You're on your own.

728
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,414
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

729
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:26,981
I can handle this!

730
00:49:40,386 --> 00:49:41,518
Thank you.

731
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,129
What you got for us, Detective?

732
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:46,217
That's her vehicle,

733
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:48,567
registered
to a Anisette Landress.

734
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,831
The ATF are en route inbound
to take care of it.

735
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:53,530
We're way cooler than ATF.

736
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,662
I'll show you why I called them.

737
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:03,974
That's a Minigun.

738
00:50:03,975 --> 00:50:05,672
They use those
on military vehicles.

739
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:08,675
Did you know that puppy shoots
6,000 rounds a minute?

740
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:10,676
I know.

741
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,375
Did you know
that's 100 rounds a second?

742
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:14,029
Yep, I know.

743
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,031
Did you know
that you know a lot?

744
00:50:17,032 --> 00:50:18,510
Yes, I do.

745
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:19,685
It's because I minored in math.

746
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,209
I'm a pretty smart guy actually.

747
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,341
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

748
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:25,256
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

749
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:27,084
Someone who doesn't exist

750
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:29,391
in any commercial
or government database.

751
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,740
Someone who's a ghost.

752
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,048
Like our good friend Adam Clay.

753
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:37,530
<i>"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."</i>

754
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,402
Here's another reason

755
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:41,707
that Anisette Landress

756
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,188
is like our good friend
Adam Clay.

757
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,062
Do you know what's that way?

758
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:50,716
Springfield...

759
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,589
...where the call center
was torched.

760
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:55,635
And that way
where Adam Clay's headed?

761
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,725
Boston.

762
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:00,858
Let's go.

763
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:03,904
Thank you.

764
00:51:19,137 --> 00:51:20,355
How are you, my friend?

765
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:22,270
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

766
00:51:22,271 --> 00:51:24,533
Yeah, come on,

767
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:26,012
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

768
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:27,753
Don't play with those things.
They go off.

769
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,365
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

770
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:34,848
When I was sworn in as director,

771
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:39,287
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

772
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,639
Well...

773
00:51:44,206 --> 00:51:48,862
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

774
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:52,039
Like the Beekeepers.

775
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:57,043
The honeybee has always

776
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:59,133
had a special relationship
with humanity.

777
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:00,657
A sacred relationship.

778
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:04,268
Why?
No bees, no agriculture.

779
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:06,445
No agriculture, no civilization.

780
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:10,753
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

781
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,930
with its complex systems
of workers,

782
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:15,932
caretakers, even royalty.

783
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:20,066
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

784
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,199
are compromised,

785
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,159
the hive collapses.

786
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,204
Someone a long time ago decided

787
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:29,424
that a mechanism was needed

788
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:30,903
to keep our nation safe.

789
00:52:30,904 --> 00:52:33,471
A mechanism
outside the chain of command,

790
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:36,083
outside the system.

791
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:41,959
Its one mission,
to keep the system safe.

792
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:45,701
Beekeepers are given
all resources,

793
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:49,922
empowered to act
on their own judgment.

794
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:52,403
For decades,
they have quietly worked

795
00:52:52,404 --> 00:52:54,667
to keep the hive safe.

796
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:58,062
That is, until now.

797
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:02,283
It appears that a retired Beekeeper

798
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:03,675
has gone off program

799
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:06,678
and is acting
in what he mistakenly believes

800
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,073
is the hive's best interest.

801
00:53:10,248 --> 00:53:11,553
Can't somebody just pick up the phone

802
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,685
and tell this yahoo
to stand-the-fuck down?

803
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:15,905
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

804
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:17,299
Stand down.

805
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,865
Not unlike bees themselves,

806
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:23,478
Beekeepers keep working
until they die.

807
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:25,262
So he's basically one of us.

808
00:53:25,263 --> 00:53:28,352
No. He's not like you.

809
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:30,050
You're tier one operators,

810
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,228
former SEAL Team Six,
Delta Group.

811
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:38,406
You are, in other words, pussies.

812
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:40,495
If you were in the same room,

813
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:41,627
he would kill you.

814
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:46,631
With enough of you,
then maybe you just might

815
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:49,112
in fact be able to kill him

816
00:53:49,113 --> 00:53:51,288
before he accomplishes his goal.

817
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:52,638
What would that be?

818
00:53:54,118 --> 00:53:57,208
To kill his way
to the top of the hive.

819
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:02,822
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

820
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:13,484
Dude, bees are interesting
little shits.

821
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:14,877
Did you know that?

822
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:16,966
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

823
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:18,359
and we'd be fucked without them.

824
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Listen.

825
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,536
"Some bees are queen slayers,

826
00:54:21,537 --> 00:54:23,102
"which will rise up
and kill their queen

827
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,582
"if she fails to produce

828
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,237
"the right kind
of male offspring."

829
00:54:27,325 --> 00:54:28,717
Fascinating.

830
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:31,937
- No.
- Hm. Nope.

831
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:33,243
- No.
- No!

832
00:54:33,244 --> 00:54:34,644
- It's your turn. You can't...
- No!

833
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:43,036
Special Agent Parker.

834
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,039
Yeah.

835
00:54:46,823 --> 00:54:48,040
Okay.

836
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,042
Thank you.

837
00:54:52,698 --> 00:54:53,743
What?

838
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,660
The deputy director is flying
up from DC to see us.

839
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,882
Oh, fuck.
This is your fault.

840
00:56:35,845 --> 00:56:37,802
Here's another
interesting factoid.

841
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:39,151
Thank fuck.

842
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:41,197
You know,
I was getting sick of enjoying

843
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,373
my peaceful thoughts.

844
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:46,985
Sir.

845
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,639
Sir,
this is Special Agent Parker,

846
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,901
Special Agent Wiley.

847
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:51,425
They'll be briefing you.

848
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:52,861
This is Deputy Director Prigg

849
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:55,298
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

850
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:56,735
Mr. Deputy Director,

851
00:56:57,344 --> 00:56:58,867
my colleague and I believe

852
00:56:58,868 --> 00:57:00,912
that three major crime scenes
in our area

853
00:57:00,913 --> 00:57:02,827
are connected
to a single subject.

854
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:03,915
Adam Clay.

855
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:05,395
He killed six people today.

856
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:08,093
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

857
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:09,705
and the nature of his alias,

858
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:11,706
we believe that Mr. Clay is connected

859
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:14,100
to a classified program named Beekeeper.

860
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:16,885
A program that none
of our partner agencies

861
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:18,061
seem willing to acknowledge.

862
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,500
Let's stick to what we know,
Special Agent Parker.

863
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:22,587
Yes, sir.

864
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,633
In any event, this individual
is highly capable

865
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:27,113
and extremely motivated,

866
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:29,375
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

867
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:30,768
if not already here.

868
00:57:30,769 --> 00:57:33,858
And we believe
that this is his next target,

869
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:35,381
Nine Star United,

870
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:37,122
which appears to be the entity

871
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:38,689
operating the regional call centers,

872
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,518
like the one that Mr. Clay burned down.

873
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:43,478
Why is Adam Clay on this rampage?

874
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:48,787
He's, um,
protecting the hive, sir.

875
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,702
It's what Beekeepers do.

876
00:57:51,224 --> 00:57:52,624
I have enough
to brief the director.

877
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,532
- What's your ask?
- My ask?

878
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:58,710
Uh, well, a SWAT team,
for starters.

879
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:01,844
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

880
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:04,063
That shouldn't be a problem.

881
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:05,456
Thank you.

882
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,335
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,473
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

884
00:58:23,474 --> 00:58:24,735
It's roll call time.

885
00:58:24,736 --> 00:58:27,085
I'm getting ready
for my dick to get hard

886
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,784
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

887
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:31,699
Let's start with Phoenix.
Where we at?

888
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,788
Phoenix is up 201K.

889
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:36,181
200K, I'm gonna suck your dick.
I love you.

890
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,053
New Orleans, show me,

891
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:39,620
tell me.
Where we at?

892
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,012
It's down 93K, boss.

893
00:58:41,013 --> 00:58:43,014
Down?
You're a fucking loser.

894
00:58:43,015 --> 00:58:44,799
You give me a fucking headache.

895
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,930
You give me fucking cancer.

896
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:48,019
New York, make me happy.
I beg you.

897
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,283
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

898
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:53,895
Yeah!
I love you, New York!

899
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:02,599
Gather around!

900
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,470
I want all weapons
front on entry.

901
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,168
- Everybody give me an oos!
- Oos!

902
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:07,256
Let's go!

903
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:15,264
Power down, my federal friend.
Power down.

904
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:17,527
Private security here
on the orders of the Governor.

905
00:59:17,528 --> 00:59:19,529
State Department certified
to carry weapons

906
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,618
in all 50 states.

907
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:23,707
Feel free to call
the highlighted numbers

908
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:24,840
to verify.

909
00:59:25,405 --> 00:59:27,625
You're not welcome here.
Get the fuck out.

910
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:30,410
All right, boys, let's go!

911
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:34,589
Set up a perimeter outside.

912
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,808
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

913
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:39,985
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

914
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,553
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

915
00:59:43,554 --> 00:59:45,642
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

916
00:59:45,643 --> 00:59:47,470
We're the guys
keeping you alive.

917
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:48,863
Shut it down now.

918
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:50,473
Everybody, listen up.

919
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:51,953
Anyone who's
not carrying a weapon,

920
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,476
get the fuck out!

921
00:59:53,477 --> 00:59:54,956
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

922
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:58,655
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

923
00:59:58,656 --> 01:00:00,439
No one's shutting down.

924
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,879
Anybody so much as puts
a phone down, they're fired!

925
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,141
I'm sorry to break it to you,

926
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:07,708
but bin Laden's been dead
for a while.

927
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:10,014
So I'm going to say this
one last time.

928
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:11,277
Shut it down.

929
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:13,453
The fuck I am.

930
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,194
Call your fucking boss.

931
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,457
You want me to call my boss?

932
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:19,372
I'll do that.

933
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:24,508
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

934
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:27,729
Don't be shy.
Come on.

935
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:30,774
What about the parking garage?

936
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:32,689
Closed and locked.
Steel gate.

937
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,257
I want a body on comms
watching it.

938
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,780
- Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

939
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,739
- Station an agent there too.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,871
Sure there's no back entrances
into this place?

941
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:42,351
Hey,
there're no other entrances.

942
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,658
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

943
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:45,920
Move along at a minimum retreat

944
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:47,356
to a safe distance.
Thank you.

945
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:48,792
Someone scout
the service tunnel.

946
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:51,708
The other option,
instead of going in

947
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:53,057
is to smoke them out.

948
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:54,363
Excuse me?

949
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:56,235
I figured I'd give
the firefighters a break.

950
01:00:57,497 --> 01:00:59,194
I've put them through
enough already.

951
01:00:59,195 --> 01:01:00,761
What'd you say your name was?

952
01:01:00,762 --> 01:01:02,372
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

953
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:04,982
Trust me,
if there was a back entrance,

954
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:06,244
I would've used it.

955
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,724
I don't want to injure anyone

956
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,005
who's innocent and non-involved.

957
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:11,511
But it is what it is.

958
01:01:12,077 --> 01:01:13,643
Somebody detain this guy!

959
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,454
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

960
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:53,683
Oh, wow, if it isn't the fucking

961
01:01:53,684 --> 01:01:55,076
golden goose himself.

962
01:01:55,077 --> 01:01:56,773
Sir, I got Captain Caveman here

963
01:01:56,774 --> 01:01:58,949
telling me
to send everyone home.

964
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,124
If we do that,

965
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,735
we're walking away
from a lot of money.

966
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:03,302
Mm. Put him on.

967
01:02:04,477 --> 01:02:05,522
It's for you.

968
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:09,046
Why are you fucking
with my business?

969
01:02:09,047 --> 01:02:10,831
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

970
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:12,877
to kick some fucking Beekeeper's ass.

971
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:15,792
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

972
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:17,969
which means
that you work for me.

973
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:19,927
Now, listen, that place

974
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:21,799
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

975
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:23,931
I'm not gonna
let some crash test dummy

976
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:25,323
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

977
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,151
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

978
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:28,326
Didn't this character
already burn

979
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,806
one of your centers
to the ground?

980
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:31,677
Well, you know,
they didn't have you,

981
01:02:31,678 --> 01:02:32,940
and that's why.

982
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:35,116
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

983
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:37,248
and don't tell me
how to do mine, please.

984
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:39,077
- <i>We got it?</i>
- Copy that.

985
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,733
Fall out.
Set up a perimeter outside.

986
01:02:43,734 --> 01:02:45,169
Let's go.
Move!

987
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,997
Round of applause.

988
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:48,912
Let's say goodbye
to our good friends.

989
01:02:48,913 --> 01:02:52,350
Bye-bye, Admiral.
Go join fucking Space Force.

990
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,832
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

991
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,268
Keep walking.

992
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:58,793
Bye-bye, dickhead.

993
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:02,491
What a bunch of jackoffs.

994
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,189
Yeah, we love you!

995
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:16,592
One time amnesty.

996
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,202
Whoever doesn't want to die
this evening,

997
01:03:18,203 --> 01:03:21,641
can in an orderly fashion
leave now.

998
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:24,034
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking way.
It's not happening.

999
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:25,819
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1000
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,212
- No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1001
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:29,301
Nada.
Zero!

1002
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:31,868
Are you fucking nuts?

1003
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,565
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1004
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:35,567
30 to 40 million a year
in profit.

1005
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:38,222
So no one is shooting no guns.

1006
01:03:38,223 --> 01:03:40,703
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1007
01:03:40,704 --> 01:03:42,618
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

1008
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,838
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1009
01:03:44,839 --> 01:03:46,535
some of them will get hurt.

1010
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:48,364
Let's start with this prick
right here.

1011
01:04:03,335 --> 01:04:04,467
On me!

1012
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:14,694
Take right!

1013
01:04:30,014 --> 01:04:31,407
Pettis, we got a man down.

1014
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:54,909
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1015
01:04:57,302 --> 01:04:58,564
<i>Fire.
Fire.</i>

1016
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:07,051
You know who you're working for?

1017
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,270
None of my fucking business.

1018
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,273
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1019
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:17,192
And you are our problem.

1020
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:19,585
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1021
01:05:42,608 --> 01:05:44,393
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1022
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,439
<i>Fire.
Fire.</i>

1023
01:05:58,494 --> 01:05:59,886
Dan, what the hell happened?

1024
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,975
Any dead?

1025
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:03,802
Not dead,
but we got our asses kicked.

1026
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:06,327
- Our guy. What do we know?
- He's in the building.

1027
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:07,720
I'm waiting more men to roll in.

1028
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:09,591
I don't know what this guy is,

1029
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:11,114
but nobody can do
what he's done.

1030
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:12,943
He's just a Beekeeper.

1031
01:06:14,162 --> 01:06:15,424
Bad idea.

1032
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:18,165
I'm not waiting.

1033
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,470
- V, wait!
- Move!

1034
01:06:19,471 --> 01:06:20,646
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1035
01:06:21,256 --> 01:06:22,344
Fuck.

1036
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,011
We got him!

1037
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:49,980
- You done?
- Reload.

1038
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,465
Everybody out!

1039
01:07:09,304 --> 01:07:10,348
You're done.

1040
01:07:27,452 --> 01:07:28,540
We should take the stairs.

1041
01:07:29,063 --> 01:07:30,064
Smart.

1042
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:32,936
<i>Subject is in the hallway.</i>

1043
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,722
<i>Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?</i>

1044
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,865
Please, please don't kill me.

1045
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:53,261
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1046
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:55,523
I'd respect you more
if you look people

1047
01:07:55,524 --> 01:07:57,526
in their eyes
when you steal from them.

1048
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,559
Now, you're making
a lot of money here.

1049
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:14,020
Tell me where it's all going.

1050
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:15,457
I don't know, man.

1051
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,331
I know you're the middle man.

1052
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:25,206
- Who's above you?
- No. They'll kill me.

1053
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,949
I'll torture you, then kill you.

1054
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:38,000
Come on, guys.
You got it.

1055
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,263
Wiley, get your ass up here!

1056
01:08:40,264 --> 01:08:43,179
Yeah, well, I'm not an Olympian.

1057
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,094
Make it stop.

1058
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:46,488
You can make it stop.

1059
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:49,620
You've stolen
hundreds of millions

1060
01:08:49,621 --> 01:08:50,926
from people who've done nothing

1061
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,320
but work hard all their lives.

1062
01:08:57,151 --> 01:08:59,587
She was an educator, a mom.

1063
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:01,851
Dedicated her whole life
to helping people.

1064
01:09:04,027 --> 01:09:05,594
Yesterday, she shot herself

1065
01:09:06,986 --> 01:09:09,467
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1066
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:17,214
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1067
01:09:21,218 --> 01:09:23,525
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1068
01:09:24,265 --> 01:09:26,353
- Tell me who and where.
- I can't.

1069
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,571
Look, these people,

1070
01:09:27,572 --> 01:09:29,138
they're untouchable.
I can't...

1071
01:09:29,139 --> 01:09:31,707
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1072
01:09:32,186 --> 01:09:34,144
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1073
01:09:52,597 --> 01:09:54,208
I told you
they were untouchable.

1074
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,559
Nobody's untouchable.

1075
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,826
Sometimes when the hive's
out of balance...

1076
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:07,612
you have to replace the queen.

1077
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:14,358
Clay!

1078
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,580
That man is directly responsible

1079
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:20,756
for your mother's death.

1080
01:10:24,325 --> 01:10:25,456
I believe you.

1081
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:28,459
But we have laws
for these things.

1082
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:33,856
You have laws for these things
until they fail.

1083
01:10:35,945 --> 01:10:37,120
Then you have me.

1084
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,784
Arrest him!

1085
01:10:49,132 --> 01:10:51,264
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1086
01:10:51,265 --> 01:10:53,309
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1087
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:54,398
Shut your fucking mouth!

1088
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:09,674
Whoa. I have four kids.

1089
01:11:11,328 --> 01:11:14,026
I know.
Three boys and a girl.

1090
01:11:26,604 --> 01:11:28,866
Wiley?
You okay?

1091
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,738
- Yeah. He went that way.
- You okay?

1092
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:32,130
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1093
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:33,436
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1094
01:11:33,437 --> 01:11:34,872
Well, I won't tell her
if you don't.

1095
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,265
- Have you been hit?
- No, I'm good, Mom.

1096
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:37,527
Did you get him?

1097
01:11:37,528 --> 01:11:39,355
- Did you?
- No, he's tricky.

1098
01:11:39,356 --> 01:11:41,052
- Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1099
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:42,576
I guess that's just evidence.

1100
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:45,143
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1101
01:11:45,144 --> 01:11:46,864
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
- Clear!

1102
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:56,199
I want interviews
with all of them.

1103
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:03,728
We're going to talk.

1104
01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:05,730
Get him out of here.

1105
01:12:23,269 --> 01:12:24,488
Wiley.

1106
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:33,149
Holy shit.

1107
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:45,856
Do you mind if I ask you

1108
01:12:45,857 --> 01:12:47,076
a really boring question?

1109
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:49,948
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1110
01:12:50,688 --> 01:12:51,819
Mm.

1111
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,951
That's deep.

1112
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:55,721
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1113
01:12:57,608 --> 01:12:59,566
Oh, God.
Uh...

1114
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:01,569
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Come upstairs.

1115
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:08,313
<i>You said these guys
were the fucking best. Uh...</i>

1116
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:09,359
Why are they all dead?

1117
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:11,926
You kicked the beehive

1118
01:13:11,927 --> 01:13:14,103
and now we have
to reap the whirlwind.

1119
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,498
- Unless...
- Unless.

1120
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:20,283
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1121
01:13:21,676 --> 01:13:23,677
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1122
01:13:26,681 --> 01:13:28,116
I'm paying you
so much fucking money

1123
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,557
and your advice
is to call my mother?

1124
01:13:30,554 --> 01:13:33,469
He can't make his move on us

1125
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:35,907
if we're in her proximity,
can he?

1126
01:13:36,473 --> 01:13:37,474
Her people.

1127
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:45,874
You're a fuck.

1128
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,310
- You're scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1129
01:13:48,311 --> 01:13:49,529
...and you want to use my mother

1130
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,704
as a human shield.

1131
01:13:50,705 --> 01:13:52,794
Just call her.
Just call her. Come on.

1132
01:13:53,664 --> 01:13:55,360
It's not a game now.

1133
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:56,450
Oh, it's all a game.

1134
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,321
Come on.

1135
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,801
Yes, Derek.
What do you want?

1136
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:02,803
<i>Hey, Mom. No, nothing.</i>

1137
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:04,631
<i>I was just, you know,
thinking about you.</i>

1138
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:07,243
<i>I miss you. I was hoping
to maybe see you this weekend.</i>

1139
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:09,287
I'm at the beach house.

1140
01:14:09,288 --> 01:14:10,728
You're welcome to join
if you behave.

1141
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,378
<i>I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,</i>

1142
01:14:13,379 --> 01:14:14,858
<i>you know,
get together with some of my</i>

1143
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:16,164
<i>tech homies and stuff,
if that's, uh,</i>

1144
01:14:16,165 --> 01:14:17,600
<i>if that's cool with you.</i>

1145
01:14:17,601 --> 01:14:19,167
Fine.
No drugs.

1146
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,170
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1147
01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:23,867
Derek's joining me this weekend.

1148
01:14:23,868 --> 01:14:25,129
Help me keep him sober.

1149
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,567
Yes, ma'am.
I love babysitting.

1150
01:14:27,132 --> 01:14:28,959
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1151
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,700
Hello.
Good to meet you.

1152
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:32,049
Sola Oyemade.

1153
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,529
Sola, thank you so much for coming.

1154
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:34,878
Susan Aneno.

1155
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,532
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

1156
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:37,665
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1157
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:40,387
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma'am.

1158
01:14:47,022 --> 01:14:48,806
You don't have to do this,
you know?

1159
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,070
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1160
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:56,466
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1161
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:06,215
Wherever it's headed...

1162
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:08,957
I swore an oath.

1163
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,438
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1164
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,925
Even if he's right?

1165
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:28,324
Even if he's right.

1166
01:15:31,022 --> 01:15:33,720
<i>Apologies.
Damn plane was delayed.</i>

1167
01:15:33,721 --> 01:15:34,765
<i>What have you got?</i>

1168
01:15:35,287 --> 01:15:38,551
We think we have a sense
of Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1169
01:15:38,552 --> 01:15:40,945
He seems to be
following the money.

1170
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,252
<i>What money is that?</i>

1171
01:15:43,774 --> 01:15:46,950
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1172
01:15:46,951 --> 01:15:49,605
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1173
01:15:49,606 --> 01:15:52,696
to identify these people
and then target their assets.

1174
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:56,481
There's another
company involved, sir,

1175
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:59,006
a company who is a vendor
to the intelligence community

1176
01:15:59,007 --> 01:16:00,398
and to the Justice Department.

1177
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:02,531
In fact,
we use this company's software

1178
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:04,141
in this very office

1179
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:06,710
to identify financial fraud.

1180
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,498
<i>Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?</i>

1181
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:18,373
Danforth Enterprises.

1182
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:21,724
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1183
01:16:21,725 --> 01:16:25,772
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1184
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:28,252
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1185
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:30,778
as President
of the United States.

1186
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:33,170
<i>She self-financed her campaign.</i>

1187
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:35,870
Yeah.
None of that money was clean.

1188
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:37,523
<i>Who else knows this?</i>

1189
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:40,308
Us three.

1190
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:42,832
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1191
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:45,835
<i>Let's, uh,
keep the circle small,</i>

1192
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:48,098
<i>until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.</i>

1193
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:50,100
<i>Not a word of this to anyone.
Understood?</i>

1194
01:16:50,101 --> 01:16:51,493
Yes, sir.

1195
01:16:51,494 --> 01:16:53,060
<i>And, Mr. Clay,
I see his kill count</i>

1196
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:54,627
<i>is steadily rising.</i>

1197
01:16:54,628 --> 01:16:55,932
In a beehive, there is something

1198
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:57,413
called a "queen slayer."

1199
01:16:57,805 --> 01:17:00,895
It's a bee that will rise up
and kill the queen

1200
01:17:01,504 --> 01:17:04,114
if she produces defective offspring.

1201
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:06,551
<i>I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.</i>

1202
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:09,598
Right. Yes.
Not that Beekeepers exist.

1203
01:17:09,599 --> 01:17:12,601
But Mr. Clay does keep honey bees.

1204
01:17:12,602 --> 01:17:14,690
He admires their willingness

1205
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:17,346
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1206
01:17:18,956 --> 01:17:22,873
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1207
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:25,659
is the defective offspring
of a queen,

1208
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:29,313
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1209
01:17:29,314 --> 01:17:31,534
and become a queen slayer.

1210
01:17:33,492 --> 01:17:36,757
<i>Adam Clay's next victim
is Derek Danforth's mother?</i>

1211
01:17:37,627 --> 01:17:39,760
President Danforth, sir.

1212
01:17:40,151 --> 01:17:42,806
<i>You have a blank check.
Good luck.</i>

1213
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:45,896
Thank you.

1214
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,826
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a private event.

1215
01:18:03,827 --> 01:18:06,046
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, go away.

1216
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:07,917
Federal Bureau of something
or another.

1217
01:18:07,918 --> 01:18:09,571
We're good.
We have invites right here.

1218
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:11,268
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1219
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,096
He's recently concussed
and hasn't slept in two days.

1220
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:14,097
We're on the access list.

1221
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:16,710
We're good, boss.

1222
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:46,739
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1223
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,914
I don't want them here.

1224
01:18:47,915 --> 01:18:49,917
They're C team.
B team at best.

1225
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:53,136
Uh, Mom's detail is not going
to like that.

1226
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:55,878
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way

1227
01:18:55,879 --> 01:18:57,010
of what's coming for us,

1228
01:18:57,011 --> 01:18:58,577
they're dead men and so are we.

1229
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,015
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1230
01:19:02,016 --> 01:19:03,016
Yes, sir.

1231
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,805
He has a little talent, doesn't he?

1232
01:19:09,806 --> 01:19:11,285
He's absolutely fucking terrifying.

1233
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:12,765
Yeah.

1234
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,446
Good men,
but clearly not good enough.

1235
01:19:14,898 --> 01:19:16,812
- Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1236
01:19:16,813 --> 01:19:18,814
How'd you piss this oak off, huh?

1237
01:19:18,815 --> 01:19:20,207
I...

1238
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,948
- You're looking at me?
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:23,602
How is any of this my fault?

1240
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:26,169
Wasn't your supersecret CIA

1241
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,780
data mining software
supposed to,

1242
01:19:27,781 --> 01:19:29,042
I don't know, maybe filter out

1243
01:19:29,043 --> 01:19:30,783
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1244
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:32,262
Don't you fuck with me,
young man!

1245
01:19:32,263 --> 01:19:34,047
Any other life,
you'd be in jail.

1246
01:19:34,048 --> 01:19:36,572
Hey, this is the fucking Beekeeper!

1247
01:19:40,184 --> 01:19:42,185
Yeah, you know I killed one once.

1248
01:19:42,186 --> 01:19:43,491
Oh, you see?

1249
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,710
Yeah.
Only 'cause I was lucky.

1250
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:48,323
- And un-fucking-lucky.
- Oh, jeez.

1251
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:53,283
Yeah, don't piss your pants, bruh.

1252
01:19:53,284 --> 01:19:54,677
My team will be out shortly.

1253
01:19:55,112 --> 01:19:56,460
If anyone can knock

1254
01:19:56,461 --> 01:19:58,288
this guy's dick in the dirt,
it's them.

1255
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:00,814
Ain't that right, money man?

1256
01:20:02,903 --> 01:20:04,382
Yeah.

1257
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:21,746
I'm supposed to be
at a kids' birthday party

1258
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:22,748
with my wife.

1259
01:20:26,796 --> 01:20:28,666
You are at a kids'
birthday party.

1260
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:29,930
And I'm your work wife.

1261
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:47,729
Madam President,
you look spectacular.

1262
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,252
When the fuck are you
going to tell me

1263
01:20:49,253 --> 01:20:50,689
what's going on, Wallace?

1264
01:20:54,345 --> 01:20:55,825
Good.
Go through.

1265
01:20:56,913 --> 01:20:59,001
Tell that guy to hurry up.

1266
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:01,830
I want every manhole
on this street welded shut.

1267
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:11,928
Six up.

1268
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:13,887
Good to go.

1269
01:21:15,192 --> 01:21:16,498
Let's go.
Let's go.

1270
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,338
Come on. Move it up.

1271
01:21:47,224 --> 01:21:49,139
Put your head
on a swivel, gentlemen.

1272
01:22:05,547 --> 01:22:06,548
Go!

1273
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:36,404
We got eyes on the second floor.

1274
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:45,804
All right, you're good.
Coming through.

1275
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,046
Oh.

1276
01:23:11,047 --> 01:23:14,441
Hey. When, uh, did you get in?
What a surprise.

1277
01:23:16,052 --> 01:23:18,532
You didn't hear
the giant Marine helicopter

1278
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:19,925
land on the front lawn?

1279
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,536
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1280
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,755
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1281
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:27,367
Uh, I wouldn't unless
you want to go

1282
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:28,499
talk with the machine elves.

1283
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:34,983
Hey, you look fucking great,
by the way.

1284
01:23:34,984 --> 01:23:37,813
I mean, power,
it just looks so good on you.

1285
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:40,597
Doing blow
on your father's desk.

1286
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,382
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1287
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:44,167
so I could kill him.

1288
01:23:46,387 --> 01:23:48,258
Stop picking your face.

1289
01:23:51,174 --> 01:23:53,958
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1290
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:55,265
What have you done to the man?

1291
01:23:56,092 --> 01:23:58,051
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1292
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,443
Well, he's there to protect you

1293
01:24:00,444 --> 01:24:01,445
if you'll let him.

1294
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:07,798
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1295
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:10,367
What does that mean?

1296
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:16,198
It means that God doesn't give
with both hands.

1297
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:18,461
Uh, okay.
I love you too, Mom.

1298
01:24:18,462 --> 01:24:20,072
Hm.

1299
01:24:20,073 --> 01:24:21,639
Gotta go run the free world.

1300
01:24:22,423 --> 01:24:23,554
Don't burn it down.

1301
01:24:30,518 --> 01:24:32,127
Fucking fantastic!

1302
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:41,150
Wiley, look.

1303
01:25:42,242 --> 01:25:44,112
Oh, shit.

1304
01:25:44,113 --> 01:25:46,073
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1305
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:48,639
Look at her body language.
Bad vibes.

1306
01:25:50,032 --> 01:25:51,381
She got caught riding dirty.

1307
01:25:52,817 --> 01:25:54,123
What have we done?

1308
01:25:54,993 --> 01:25:57,212
Are you, uh, fucking
with crypto at all, right now?

1309
01:25:57,213 --> 01:25:58,388
It's gonna pop.

1310
01:25:58,823 --> 01:26:01,085
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1311
01:26:01,086 --> 01:26:02,870
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1312
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:04,654
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1313
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:06,135
Speak to you a moment
in private?

1314
01:26:08,355 --> 01:26:09,355
Sorry.

1315
01:26:12,446 --> 01:26:13,924
Uh, who's this?

1316
01:26:13,925 --> 01:26:15,883
Jackson Prigg.
He's number two at the FBI.

1317
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,232
Have a seat.

1318
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:18,929
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand.
What is this, like,

1319
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,801
an ambush or something?
This feels weird. I don't like it.

1320
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,107
No, you'll sit.

1321
01:26:25,372 --> 01:26:26,547
I'll sit.

1322
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:31,594
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1323
01:26:31,595 --> 01:26:33,205
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1324
01:26:33,206 --> 01:26:34,685
I need you to step outside.

1325
01:26:43,216 --> 01:26:46,218
The deputy director
has flagged his, uh, concerns

1326
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:47,697
about some uncomfortable things

1327
01:26:47,698 --> 01:26:49,222
happening inside the family company.

1328
01:26:49,874 --> 01:26:51,701
Like what?

1329
01:26:51,702 --> 01:26:52,746
Uncomfortable things about

1330
01:26:52,747 --> 01:26:54,270
the source of my campaign funds.

1331
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,578
Sounds serious.
What's up?

1332
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,145
Deputy Director.

1333
01:27:00,624 --> 01:27:04,454
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar with, uh,
United Data Group?

1334
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,718
United Data Group.

1335
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:11,068
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1336
01:27:11,069 --> 01:27:13,115
I invested in that.

1337
01:27:13,768 --> 01:27:14,985
I invest everywhere.

1338
01:27:14,986 --> 01:27:16,509
I mean, there's...
It's everywhere.

1339
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:18,337
- It's very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:27:18,338 --> 01:27:21,210
How about, uh,
Nine Star United?

1341
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,822
Yeah, that was, uh...

1342
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:28,347
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1343
01:27:28,348 --> 01:27:30,566
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1344
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:33,177
I don't want to bore you
with all that.

1345
01:27:34,615 --> 01:27:38,095
What do you know
about a classified algorithmic

1346
01:27:38,096 --> 01:27:39,575
data mining software package

1347
01:27:39,576 --> 01:27:42,013
developed by
the intelligence community?

1348
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:57,246
He's here.

1349
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:00,117
All stations, target's
in the building. East wing.

1350
01:28:00,118 --> 01:28:01,641
<i>Give me everything you got.</i>

1351
01:28:01,642 --> 01:28:02,730
He's in the house!

1352
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:05,340
Assault team, saddle up!

1353
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:06,820
Let's move, boys!
Get a move on!

1354
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:08,343
Let's move!
Come on!

1355
01:28:08,344 --> 01:28:10,564
- Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1356
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:13,740
Break-break!
Package is in the house!

1357
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:15,568
Level three, side four.

1358
01:28:15,569 --> 01:28:18,354
Blue over blue, you see him,
you fucking get him!

1359
01:28:18,963 --> 01:28:21,488
Hey!
Put your fucking hands up.

1360
01:28:23,446 --> 01:28:25,230
Now turn the fuck around.

1361
01:28:29,713 --> 01:28:31,498
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1362
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:35,805
He's outside.
Target's outside.

1363
01:28:35,806 --> 01:28:37,329
Move!
Move!

1364
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:39,026
Let's get this fucking guy!

1365
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1366
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:43,073
Negative.

1367
01:28:43,074 --> 01:28:44,466
- Clay!
- That's right.

1368
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,471
That's right.
Now, on your knees!

1369
01:28:49,472 --> 01:28:51,213
On your knees!

1370
01:28:52,301 --> 01:28:54,521
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1371
01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:00,830
Down on your knees now!

1372
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:02,137
Do it now!

1373
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:10,972
Beekeeper, huh?
God's right hand?

1374
01:29:11,494 --> 01:29:12,625
You aren't shit.

1375
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:13,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1376
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,041
Hey, take a step back.

1377
01:29:15,672 --> 01:29:17,630
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1378
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:19,501
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1379
01:29:19,502 --> 01:29:21,634
Armed?

1380
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:23,592
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1381
01:29:23,593 --> 01:29:25,813
You're not fucking
executing him.

1382
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:27,989
Nice crowd you're rolling with.

1383
01:29:35,605 --> 01:29:36,780
Watch me.

1384
01:29:37,912 --> 01:29:39,261
V, what the fuck is going on?

1385
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,046
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1386
01:29:42,438 --> 01:29:44,527
Isn't that the bloody question?

1387
01:29:45,528 --> 01:29:46,747
I think I'll take

1388
01:29:47,748 --> 01:29:49,183
to "bee."

1389
01:29:59,455 --> 01:30:01,195
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1390
01:30:01,196 --> 01:30:02,240
- Yeah.
- Go.

1391
01:30:04,765 --> 01:30:06,462
Get off me!

1392
01:30:07,855 --> 01:30:09,334
He's fucking mine!

1393
01:30:10,248 --> 01:30:12,075
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1394
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,564
He's here!

1395
01:30:22,565 --> 01:30:24,393
Go! Go! All stations!

1396
01:30:27,309 --> 01:30:29,484
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1397
01:30:33,968 --> 01:30:35,185
Go with the flow.

1398
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:36,665
Not clear.
He's not clear.

1399
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,927
Hang tight.

1400
01:30:37,928 --> 01:30:39,147
On me.

1401
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,256
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1402
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:06,478
You understand you did this, right?

1403
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:07,828
You broke the rules.

1404
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,177
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1405
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:12,266
I was just trying
to get you into office, Mom.

1406
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:13,789
How else do you think
you got elected?

1407
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:15,550
I was going to win
with or without your help.

1408
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:19,360
We were already rich.
Your father built an empire.

1409
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:20,970
Yeah.
And you were going to fucking

1410
01:31:20,971 --> 01:31:22,842
break it up into pieces
and sell it off.

1411
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:24,321
Well, in the name
of public service

1412
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:26,976
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1413
01:31:26,977 --> 01:31:28,151
Okay.
Right.

1414
01:31:28,152 --> 01:31:29,892
Yeah, because you hate the fact

1415
01:31:29,893 --> 01:31:31,285
that being the president

1416
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:32,808
is just like
an endless cocktail party.

1417
01:31:32,809 --> 01:31:34,201
You realize that you were behind

1418
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:35,985
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1419
01:31:35,986 --> 01:31:37,639
15 of 20 counties!

1420
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,642
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1421
01:31:40,643 --> 01:31:41,905
and not terrorists.

1422
01:31:43,516 --> 01:31:44,821
You didn't hear that.

1423
01:31:58,356 --> 01:32:00,314
You got elected because of me,
and you know that.

1424
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:02,708
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1425
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:04,229
Now I know
where the money came from...

1426
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:06,625
...and all the people you hurt.

1427
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:08,540
Okay, whatever.
It's computer data, Mom.

1428
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,542
Somebody in this family has
to have their fucking feet

1429
01:32:10,543 --> 01:32:12,943
on the ground to actually get shit done.
You understand that?

1430
01:32:28,604 --> 01:32:32,565
Mom, the wolves are
at the fucking door right now.

1431
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,610
What are you going to do
to fix this?

1432
01:32:38,396 --> 01:32:39,441
Tell the truth.

1433
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:42,835
The fucking...

1434
01:32:42,836 --> 01:32:44,663
What does that even mean?

1435
01:32:44,664 --> 01:32:46,708
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1436
01:32:46,709 --> 01:32:47,970
You have an entire building

1437
01:32:47,971 --> 01:32:49,450
full of PR people

1438
01:32:49,451 --> 01:32:51,321
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1439
01:32:51,322 --> 01:32:53,193
That guy who's coming
to kill us, that Beekeeper,

1440
01:32:53,194 --> 01:32:56,065
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1441
01:32:56,066 --> 01:32:57,763
Then I'm telling
the entire nation.

1442
01:32:57,764 --> 01:32:59,635
And if it costs me everything,

1443
01:33:00,027 --> 01:33:01,506
well, so be it.

1444
01:34:15,102 --> 01:34:16,407
You fucking git!

1445
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:23,632
Fuck!

1446
01:34:28,681 --> 01:34:30,160
You're just a man.

1447
01:34:30,726 --> 01:34:32,074
I know.

1448
01:35:25,128 --> 01:35:27,261
Thank you.

1449
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,820
Jesus. Looks like
a tornado came through here.

1450
01:36:10,695 --> 01:36:12,087
What's your plan here, huh?

1451
01:36:12,088 --> 01:36:13,610
You're going to tell this guy
the fucking truth

1452
01:36:13,611 --> 01:36:15,351
and hope that he spares you
and kills me instead?

1453
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:16,613
No, Derek,
I'll tell him the truth

1454
01:36:16,614 --> 01:36:17,746
because it's the truth.

1455
01:36:27,887 --> 01:36:30,019
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1456
01:36:31,107 --> 01:36:33,327
Beekeepers live
for the good of society.

1457
01:36:34,981 --> 01:36:36,112
I'm retired.

1458
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:38,680
This is personal.

1459
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:41,204
All the more reason to stop.

1460
01:36:42,945 --> 01:36:45,208
Go back.
Live a quiet life.

1461
01:36:45,948 --> 01:36:47,602
Making honey for your neighbors.

1462
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:49,299
That's all I wanted.

1463
01:36:50,518 --> 01:36:53,346
- My neighbor's dead.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1464
01:36:53,347 --> 01:36:55,870
But do you live
in the real world

1465
01:36:55,871 --> 01:36:57,525
or just protect it?

1466
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,224
What does it matter to you

1467
01:37:02,225 --> 01:37:04,879
how presidents
come to be elected?

1468
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,100
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1469
01:37:07,709 --> 01:37:09,276
What does matter to you?

1470
01:37:10,146 --> 01:37:11,191
Right and wrong.

1471
01:37:12,366 --> 01:37:13,584
It's not fashionable.

1472
01:37:14,847 --> 01:37:16,412
I believe there's good
in the universe.

1473
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:20,591
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1474
01:37:21,854 --> 01:37:23,856
Until the Danforth family
bought you.

1475
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:26,249
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1476
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:30,036
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1477
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,124
Don't do that.

1478
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:33,342
Sir, you might want
to step back.

1479
01:37:33,343 --> 01:37:34,649
No.

1480
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:37,484
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1481
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,089
Now, have a seat.

1482
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:47,574
Nah, fuck the truth, man.
The truth...

1483
01:37:47,575 --> 01:37:48,923
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1484
01:37:48,924 --> 01:37:50,273
...comes out of your fucking...

1485
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:52,884
Jesus Christ!

1486
01:37:52,885 --> 01:37:54,165
That's fucking real right there.

1487
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:08,763
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1488
01:38:25,526 --> 01:38:27,223
You decide who you work for.

1489
01:38:29,573 --> 01:38:30,661
For the law

1490
01:38:32,446 --> 01:38:33,926
or for justice.

1491
01:38:37,103 --> 01:38:38,191
Fuck this.

1492
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:39,626
Bye, Mom.

1493
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,026
- Go! Go!
- Move. Move.

1494
01:38:48,027 --> 01:38:49,853
- Move it out. Out of the way.
- You're okay.

1495
01:38:49,854 --> 01:38:52,901
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1496
01:38:54,381 --> 01:38:55,425
Clay!

1497
01:38:58,907 --> 01:39:00,107
Come with us right now!

1498
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:04,216
- No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1499
01:39:04,217 --> 01:39:05,739
No!

1500
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:07,393
You need to come with me.
Come on.

1501
01:39:07,394 --> 01:39:09,091
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1502
01:39:10,179 --> 01:39:12,398
- Give me your hand. Come on!
- No!

1503
01:39:25,368 --> 01:39:26,848
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1504
01:39:27,675 --> 01:39:29,982
Keep eyes on! Let's go!
