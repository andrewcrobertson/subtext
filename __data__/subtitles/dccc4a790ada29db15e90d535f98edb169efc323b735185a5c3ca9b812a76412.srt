1
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,603
I told you not to look for me.

2
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,603
Please, Father.

3
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,645
That's all I have.

4
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:47,853
The only proof of what they've done.

5
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:50,353
But she looks so...

6
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,603
Human.

7
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,603
But don't let yourself be fooled.

8
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,645
She wasn't conceived naturally.

9
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:13,603
<i>They found a volunteer.</i>

10
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,603
<i>Someone devoted.</i>

11
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,437
<i>But how did they...</i>

12
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,062
<i>No, please.</i>

13
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>I can't...</i>

14
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,353
<i>I can't talk about that.</i>

15
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:51,437
What I can tell you...

16
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,145
is that the pregnancy happened quickly.

17
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,770
She'll be in her teens now.

18
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:08,020
They're just waiting until she's old enough.

19
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,353
Old enough for what?

20
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,812
Old enough for what?

21
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,228
Now, please.

22
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,478
I can't do this anymore.

23
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,478
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

24
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:31,312
I can't.

25
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:35,520
But please don't let it touch me again.

26
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:52,228
Father?

27
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,770
Father Harris?

28
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,103
Father?

29
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:11,353
Hiding won't absolve your sins.

30
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,895
You think I want to be forgiven?

31
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:28,645
I don't want to be forgiven, Father Brennan.

32
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,145
I just want it all to be over.

33
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,353
You'll understand...

34
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,687
soon enough.

35
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,145
Father, are you all right?

36
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,103
I'm fine.

37
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:48,645
Father.

38
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:09,853
- Margaret Daino?
- Yes.

39
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:12,728
- I'm Father Gabriel.
- Hello.

41
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,562
Cardinal Lawrence sent me to fetch you.

42
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,603
- Oh, sure. Thank you.
- Let me help you with that.

43
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,437
He's in the car outside.

44
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:22,187
I have heard so much about you.
I feel like I already know you.

45
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,645
Maggie!

46
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,978
I'm so happy to see you.

47
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,228
Me too.

48
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:32,228
It's so beautiful here. It's like a dream.

49
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,562
Well, wait till you see the actual city.

50
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,228
Look at you. It hasn't been a year...

51
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,520
and somehow, you've found a way to grow up
even more.

52
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
Is that all you've got?

53
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:42,020
That's it.

54
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,103
Well, my word. Come on.

55
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,103
I'll show you to your new home.

56
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:18,520
So, what do you think?

57
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,853
It's wild.

58
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:22,603
Everything's so different.

59
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,395
Every street that we pass,
there's something to look at.

60
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:26,228
I just wanna explore.

61
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:27,562
Isn't it beautiful?

62
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,520
What better place
for you to be taking the veil?

63
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,270
It's wonderful to see you, Maggie.

64
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:38,852
Even when you were little,
I knew you were destined for great things.

65
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,728
See if you can get around them, Damiano.

66
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,853
These protests have picked up recently,
I'm afraid.

67
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,770
What are they protesting?

68
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,687
For the workers,
it's about conditions and wages.

69
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:55,937
But for the students, well...

70
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,937
it's a rejection of authority...

71
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,520
even the church.

72
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:05,312
The world is changing, Maggie, very fast.

73
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,770
The younger generation no longer turn to us
for guidance, I'm afraid.

74
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,895
But it's a challenge we've embraced.

75
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:15,520
Perhaps you'll play your part
and help earn back their trust.

76
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:18,145
I'll try.

77
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,937
This is Sister Silva, the Abbess.

78
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
And she'll take good care of you.

79
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,062
Hello.

80
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,020
Welcome to our family.

81
00:09:58,228 --> 00:09:59,270
Thank you.

82
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,770
Come. Come with me.

83
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,562
Let me give you a tour.

84
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,812
We're so happy to have you here.

85
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,187
This way.

86
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,353
We take care of girls.

87
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,853
Girls only.

88
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,895
A total of 62.

89
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:26,270
Babies to 18 years of age.

90
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:27,645
Come this way.

91
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:39,353
The state has contracted with us
to take in many unmarried women...

92
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,978
who are about to give birth.

93
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,437
We have our birthing facilities
here in the hospital wing.

94
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:48,853
Come, come.

95
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,562
Our doctor will likely deliver this baby
within the week.

96
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,353
Sister Anjelica.

97
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:26,770
This is Margaret Daino from America.

98
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:36,895
She grew up here.

99
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,770
Abandoned on our front steps...

100
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,145
and very ill.

101
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,978
But she's very devoted...

102
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:47,812
and she keeps all the children smiling.

103
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,645
And they all seem very happy.

104
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,562
I should see what the trouble is.

105
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,728
Of course.

106
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,895
Amen.

107
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:55,812
Hail Mary.

108
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,770
<i>Ave Maria</i> is my favorite, too.

109
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:17,812
What's your name?

110
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:27,145
I'm Margaret.

111
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:41,603
Hi.

112
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:07,353
What are you doing?

113
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,103
Get off of me!

114
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,770
There you are.

115
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,270
Have you been behaving yourself, Carlita?

116
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:26,228
Carlita.

117
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,395
Did you do that drawing outside, Carlita?

118
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:34,062
The one where the girl's floating
above the other girls?

119
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,187
I thought it was very nice.

120
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:49,603
Thank you.

121
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:52,645
Come.

122
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,103
Why is she kept alone like that
in the middle of the day?

123
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,312
It's safer.

124
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:06,228
She hurt another child just yesterday.

125
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,978
Luca will be your driver.

126
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,853
Rome has become a bit dangerous
with the protests.

127
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Hello?

128
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,562
By Your divine mercy,
rein in the power of evil.

129
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,228
Build us into living stones
of a culture of life...

130
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:49,312
who demonstrates in both deed and word...

131
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:53,103
the truth that every life, no matter
its conditions, is precious and unrepeatable.

132
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:56,478
Lord, speak to every human heart
and fill it with the conviction...

133
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:57,853
I am wanted.

134
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,562
I have a task in history.

135
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,603
I am accepted, and I am loved.

136
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,270
It is good that I exist.

137
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:16,353
Margaret's one of our
worst-behaved children...

138
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,478
What if she has another episode?

139
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:24,061
Then you must tie her to the bed.

140
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:28,061
Here. Let me show you.

141
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,478
Hi.

142
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:11,937
You must be Margaretta.

143
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,353
Yes.

144
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,770
I'm Luz.

145
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,770
Did I wake you?

146
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:18,937
No, no.

147
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:21,353
I was having a nightmare.

148
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,895
First night nerves?

149
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,187
Don't worry, same thing happened for me.

150
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,395
If we can't admit how we are feeling...

151
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:31,520
our dreams do it for us, right?

152
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,020
You're a novitiate?

153
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,187
Yeah.

154
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:39,645
I just figured a little exploration
is healthy before the big day.

155
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,853
I mean, I will be hiding this body...

156
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,353
under a habit for the rest of my life.

157
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,312
So, why not let it breathe a little now?

158
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:53,395
Coffee?

159
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:00,437
So how does a girl from...

160
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,520
Pittsfield. Massachusetts.

161
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:10,270
So how does a girl from Pissfield
end up in Italy about to take the veil?

162
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:15,562
Well, Cardinal Lawrence was a priest
at the orphanage that I grew up in.

163
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:21,145
And we got pretty close because,
well, I was somewhat of a problem child.

164
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:22,562
Wait.

165
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,062
Wait, wait, wait. You were a problem child?

166
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:26,937
Like how?

167
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:29,728
I don't know. I guess...

168
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,520
I mean, I used to get punished a lot.

169
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,478
And how did they punish you?

170
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:39,562
And where did you get these?

171
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:40,562
Hey.

172
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,187
And you are a nosy girl.
Do you know that?

173
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,562
Well, would they beat you?

174
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,312
Would they beat me?

175
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,562
No, not really.

176
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,270
I used to have a pretty active imagination.

177
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,395
I'd get so convinced sometimes
that what I was seeing was real...

178
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,437
that the sisters would need to...

179
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:08,687
subdue me.

180
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:14,937
But then Cardinal Lawrence
came to the orphanage...

181
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:17,520
and he was really great, you know.

182
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,312
He really helped me to see
that all that stuff was just in my head.

183
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,812
Things got a lot better for me after that.

184
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,228
For me...

185
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,687
it was a voice.

186
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:35,312
I was 16.

187
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:38,312
Just kicked out of the house.

188
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:42,395
It was so cold that night,
and I didn't know what to do.

189
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:48,853
And then...

190
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,812
this warm wind came...

191
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,270
out of nowhere.

192
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,228
And suddenly it was
as if His voice was all around me.

193
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:06,687
Inside me even.

194
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:09,978
So clearly.

195
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,312
And He told me it didn't matter
if I had no earthly home...

196
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,853
because my true home was with Him.

197
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,853
And for the first time in my life...

198
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,645
I felt like I belonged on this Earth.

199
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:35,520
Yes, but even with the most handsome milkman
in town...

200
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:39,270
we still had a whole group of us
who took the veil together.

201
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,853
Yes. Now, instead, girls go off to college...

202
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,353
and poor Luz is taking the veil alone.

203
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,020
And Margaret...

204
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:50,353
Margaret will be alone in the chapel, too.

205
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,228
Don't worry. I'll warm it up for you.

206
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,937
Warm up? What is this "warm it up"?

207
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,353
As if Mr. Milkman didn't teach you.

208
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,812
I'm sorry!

209
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:07,020
It's true!

210
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,520
Practice it again.

211
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:22,770
No, no, no. Shy American.

212
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:24,478
Say it with <i>passione.</i>

213
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:25,645
With <i>passione?</i>

214
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,478
Okay. All right.

215
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,062
Good?

216
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:37,062
Good.

217
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,228
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

218
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:39,437
What does it mean?

219
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:42,062
"I am a teacher and I love to teach."

220
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,687
Margaret. There you are.

221
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:43,395
I'm sorry I scared you.

222
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:47,103
Come on.
I have something to show you for tonight.

223
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,645
You're gonna love it.

224
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:08,978
There she is.

225
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:11,895
Oh, my God, you look hot.

226
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,312
- I look naked.
- Yes.

227
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,853
What do you mean, naked? You look gorgeous.

228
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,978
Come on.

229
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:19,270
Up with your foot.

230
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,145
The other one.

231
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,145
Mother Mary.

232
00:25:24,853 --> 00:25:27,270
Don't be nervous. Can you stand?

233
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:28,478
No.

234
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,187
Yes, you can.

235
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:33,603
Perfect.

236
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:45,562
Luz?

237
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,145
Yeah?

238
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,562
I can't do this.

239
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,145
Tell me.

240
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,645
Have you ever been to a bar?

241
00:25:56,978 --> 00:25:57,853
No.

242
00:25:58,103 --> 00:25:59,562
- A disco?
- No.

243
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:01,103
Anything at all?

244
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,645
Because your whole life you've wanted
to give yourself only to Him, right?

245
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:09,687
Look, I know.

246
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,520
I know it's scary
coming out from under the habit...

247
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,062
but look at you!

248
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:17,603
You're a very beautiful girl, Margaretta.

249
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:21,353
And you have to understand that
about yourself.

250
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:24,812
If only to know what it means to give it up.

251
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:29,687
So, let yourself feel it. Okay?

252
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,520
Be brave.

253
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
So...

254
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,978
To the bravest girl I know.

255
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:12,145
Go.

256
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,603
Do you still feel your feet?

257
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:20,645
Oh, my.

258
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,103
Do you still feel your feet?

259
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:24,562
Yes.

260
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,228
Okay. Another then.

261
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,395
Hello.

262
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:29,020
<i>Parlate italiano?</i>

263
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:30,020
What?

264
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:32,062
<i>Parlate italiano?</i>

265
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:33,895
No. Not when I'm drinking.

266
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:35,062
Too hard.

267
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,103
<i>Inglese, per favore, no?</i>

268
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:40,895
If you can.

269
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,312
I'm Alfonzo, and this is Paolo.

270
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,312
Hi.

271
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:47,853
We can buy you a drink if you want.

272
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:16,812
Excuse me.

273
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:19,562
Can I have a sip of that?

274
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:22,437
Yeah, eat it.

275
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:27,937
- Eat it?
- Yes. Eat it.

276
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:32,978
I was watching this movie
with my mother yesterday.

277
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,103
- Yeah?
- And...

278
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,978
and was with Barbara Streisand, and I just...

279
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:38,270
I don't know. I love her and...

280
00:28:38,437 --> 00:28:39,937
- You do?
- I do.

281
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,853
- Barbra?
- I love Barbara. Yes...

282
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
- Barbara Streisand.
- Barbra?

283
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:44,145
Barbra, yeah.

284
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:47,937
I mean, it was the part
with the "Hello, gorgeous."

285
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,520
Hello, gorgeous.

286
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:50,520
Gorgeous.

287
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,937
Gorgeous.

288
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:55,603
What? Gorgeous.

289
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,312
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

290
00:28:57,478 --> 00:29:00,228
You know, it's...
Sorry if I'm not a professional...

291
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:02,312
- It was good.
- ...like Barbra.

292
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:05,895
But what do you do?

293
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,145
Well, since you asked...

294
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,853
I am a butterfly...

295
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,228
...And I must fly!

296
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,562
Okay.

297
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,062
A butterfly? Well then,
I must not keep you from flying!

298
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:36,895
What?

299
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:40,562
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

300
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:41,562
Come on.

301
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:51,062
<i>This is the BBC World Service,
and it's the 3rd of June, 1971.</i>

302
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:52,603
<i>Riots have erupted in Rome...</i>

303
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,562
<i>with clashes between the far left
and far right groups escalating rapidly.</i>

304
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:59,437
<i>The unrest has caused widespread damage
to property...</i>

305
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:01,770
<i>and has left several people injured.</i>

306
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:05,978
<i>Italian authorities are struggling
to contain the violence and restore order.</i>

307
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:09,145
<i>Public transportation, factories,
and schools are heavily affected...</i>

308
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:10,478
Good morning.

309
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:11,895
Good morning.

310
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:13,937
Did you have fun last night?

311
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:15,228
Yeah.

312
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,437
I'm guessing
you've never drunk like that before.

313
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:27,020
I didn't, like, embarrass myself
or anything last night, did I?

314
00:32:27,187 --> 00:32:28,353
No. No.

315
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Okay.

316
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,978
You were well-behaved.

317
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:34,978
Mostly.

318
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:40,395
Okay. I found you
before anything got out of control.

319
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:42,645
And for the record, I was a very nice friend.

320
00:32:42,812 --> 00:32:44,187
You came home with me.

321
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,062
Thanks.

322
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:50,562
But it wasn't easy pulling you away from him.

323
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,062
What do you mean? I didn't...

324
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:04,937
Let's just say you took my advice to heart.

325
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,062
You were a very brave girl, Margaretta.

326
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:14,020
But, hey, don't worry.

327
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,812
It's our little secret. Okay?

328
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,062
Excuse me.

329
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,228
May I sit?

330
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,145
No, please, please stay.

331
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:35,062
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

332
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:37,062
My name is Father Brennan.

333
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:39,562
I apologize for startling you.
Please sit with me.

334
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,562
This will only take a few minutes.

335
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,645
Your name is Margaret Daino.

336
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:45,228
You work at the orphanage.

337
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:46,603
You're new there.

338
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,812
I don't understand. How do you know that?

339
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,687
It's about the girl. Scianna.

340
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:55,020
- Carlita?
- You must be very careful, Margaret.

341
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,562
Bad things will start to happen around her.

342
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,728
Evil things.

343
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,103
No, I have to go now.

344
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,770
No, no. Please, please. Come see me tonight.

345
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:04,728
Saint Rita cloister, room 42.

346
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,312
I'll tell you everything.

347
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,895
Good morning, <i>farfalla.</i>

348
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:19,937
Good morning.

349
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:21,353
What's wrong?

350
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,937
Nothing. Just a little tired, that's all.

351
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,728
Where's Carlita?

352
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:35,228
She's in the bad room.

353
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,020
The bad room?

354
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:40,395
Dirty.

355
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:42,520
Dirty.

356
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,478
Dirty.

357
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,520
Dirty.

358
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:47,978
Sister.

359
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,395
Sister, I need your help.

360
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,728
Carlita, she's locked in a room.

361
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:58,603
That's right.

362
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,645
She bit Sister Romano just this morning...

363
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:05,437
so she had to go to the bad room.

364
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:09,895
Sister, why is there a bad room?

365
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:17,312
Because some girls are bad.

366
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,562
This room is suffocating.

367
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:44,145
It's not meant to be pleasant.

368
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,812
The things we do aren't always pleasant...

369
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:50,103
but they are in the name of God.

370
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,895
Do you wanna talk
about why they put you in that room?

371
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:02,687
I'm bad.

372
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:05,395
You're bad.

373
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:09,103
Well, guess who else was bad.

374
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,812
Who?

375
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,062
You?

376
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:18,853
Oh, yeah.

377
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:21,728
But you know what?

378
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,728
I realized that I'm not bad.

379
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,728
They just tell you that you are...

380
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:32,353
because you're not doing
what they want you to do.

381
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:39,562
Back then, I used to think that there
was something really, really wrong with me.

382
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,645
What did you do?

383
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,187
Well, I guess at first, I tried to run away.

384
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,770
But it didn't fix the feeling.

385
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,103
That's what I like about you, actually.

386
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:02,895
What?

387
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:07,562
What do you like about me?

388
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,437
I think that you feel
the same way that I felt.

389
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:16,645
But you're not scared, you don't run away.

390
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:18,187
You just...

391
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,395
You raise your little claws, and you fight.

392
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:29,020
Carlita, go to your room, okay?

393
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,562
I'll be right there.

394
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,187
No!

395
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,395
Everything looks all right.

396
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:02,395
You did say you didn't eat much
in the morning.

397
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:04,978
May be low blood sugar.

398
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,395
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

399
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,853
Sorry? Margaret, what for?

400
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:13,020
You wouldn't be the first to faint
witnessing the birth of a child.

401
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:15,603
Frankly, I'm surprised
it doesn't happen more often.

402
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,728
The miracle of life can be a messy business.

403
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:13,062
You guys mind if I join?

404
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,603
Carlita, did you do this drawing?

405
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,228
This part is mine.

406
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:30,312
It's a boy.

407
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,937
I don't think that
that's very appropriate, Sister.

408
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:07,728
You all right?

409
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:12,853
Yes?

410
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:28,395
Here. Let's go for a walk.

411
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:35,478
- Join the group.
- Oh, not today, girls.

412
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:36,645
- Come on!
- Okay.

413
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,520
No, no, no, not me.

414
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:46,145
It's all right. It's okay.

415
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:48,228
You ready?

416
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:43,062
It's all for you.

417
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,145
Oh, no.

418
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,103
No, no, no, don't. Don't!

419
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,103
Don't!

420
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:03,812
Oh, no!

421
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,270
Margaret. Come in.

422
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,687
Something happened, didn't it?

423
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,395
Yes.

424
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:52,187
One of the sisters took her own life.

425
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:57,645
You mentioned the name "Scianna."

426
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,103
That's right.

427
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:08,520
I assume you know these people.

428
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:11,853
The priest is named Spiletto.

429
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,312
He's a radical.

430
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:15,312
Yes, I've seen him.

431
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:16,478
Turn it over.

432
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:23,562
The baby in this photo is Carlita?

433
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:25,020
I believe so.

434
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:27,062
And this is why she's in danger?

435
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:31,770
I know these sisters.

436
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:33,478
They're women of God.

437
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:34,895
They belong to the Church.

438
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:36,270
Listen to me, Margaret.

439
00:47:37,228 --> 00:47:40,145
The truth is there are two Churches.

440
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:44,103
The one that follows the teachings of Christ,
the one that you and I are part of.

441
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,270
And the other.

442
00:47:47,395 --> 00:47:51,395
The Church that will turn a blind eye
to torture, to rape.

443
00:47:51,895 --> 00:47:53,770
To commit murder in the name of God.

444
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,687
All in the name of supreme power.

445
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,020
What do you think that Church
is most frightened of?

446
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:01,687
The Devil?

447
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,020
Secularism.

448
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:08,020
We are living in unprecedented times.

449
00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:11,020
Look at what's been occurring
in your very own generation.

450
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:14,270
A culture that is outspoken, rebelling.

451
00:48:14,437 --> 00:48:16,020
Sometimes violently.

452
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:19,437
People are turning away from the church
in droves.

453
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:22,687
And, Margaret, you know as well as I do...

454
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:24,937
that belief is power.

455
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:28,687
Now, how do you control people
who no longer believe...

456
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:31,187
in your stories of fire and brimstone?

457
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:34,270
People who do not seem to fear?

458
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:38,395
You create something to fear.

459
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:43,312
This Church has maintained power
for generations.

460
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,103
Thousands of years.

461
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,645
And they will stop at nothing
to keep it that way.

462
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:56,437
So, a small, but very powerful group
of priests and bishops...

463
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:58,687
even higher...

464
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,353
they decided...

465
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:04,187
something drastic had to be done.

466
00:49:05,603 --> 00:49:06,895
These priests...

467
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:11,562
...believe they can birth the Antichrist
and then control him.

468
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:16,312
Allow him to bring his dark forces
to bear on the world...

469
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:19,145
just enough
to drive people back to the Church.

470
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:20,645
That's insane.

471
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:22,895
Yes. Don't you see?

472
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,437
If no one believes such a thing can exist...

473
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:28,103
who will stand in their way?

474
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,062
What does any of this
have to do with Carlita?

475
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:35,770
I was excommunicated.

476
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,520
My contacts within the Church
are very limited.

477
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,728
That photo is all I have to go on.

478
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:45,478
But I believe the baby girl in the picture...

479
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:47,437
is to be the mother.

480
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:49,687
The mother of what?

481
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:57,270
Of the Antichrist?

482
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,812
Yes.

483
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:02,437
My God. You're crazy.

484
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:03,645
Though if I am right...

485
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:07,645
Carlita would have been born on the sixth day
of the sixth month at 6 a.m.

486
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:08,895
666.

487
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:11,562
It's the mark of the Devil
which she will have on her body.

488
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:14,145
I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

489
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,978
They're keeping her files at the orphanage.
Locked away.

490
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:19,562
I need you to get them to me.

491
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:22,478
I need to know how she was born.

492
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,895
What do you mean, how she was born?

493
00:50:25,062 --> 00:50:26,187
Listen to me, Margaret.

494
00:50:26,353 --> 00:50:27,687
There is a beast they're mating.

495
00:50:28,103 --> 00:50:30,353
A jackal. That's the father.

496
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,270
- I have to go now.
- No, no, Margaret.

497
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:35,478
If Carlita is, in fact, the mother...

498
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:38,937
the evil inside her
will do whatever it takes to stop us.

499
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,312
We must destroy it at all costs.

500
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:43,187
- Do you understand?
- No.

501
00:50:43,353 --> 00:50:45,603
Carlita is a little girl.

502
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,020
And she is not pregnant.

503
00:50:47,187 --> 00:50:50,062
But we're not talking about a human child!

504
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,062
It's almost June 6th.

505
00:50:52,228 --> 00:50:54,520
Look, we haven't a lot of time
and I need your help.

506
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:56,103
No, you need a doctor.

507
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,145
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

508
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:00,520
Will you let go of my arm?

509
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,645
Margaret.

510
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:33,145
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

511
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:36,270
I need to talk to you about Carlita.

512
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:41,937
Do you know anything about her history...

513
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,978
or how she came to the orphanage?

514
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,853
Not off the top of my head. Why?

515
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:53,520
Do you know where I could find
that kind of information?

516
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:59,687
I'm afraid this is not really my area,
you know?

517
00:52:58,978 --> 00:52:59,978
What?

518
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,103
Why do you keep staring at me?

519
00:53:04,645 --> 00:53:05,645
I'm not.

520
00:53:14,603 --> 00:53:15,812
Will you come with me?

521
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:18,812
Come on.

522
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:25,020
I need to talk to you about something.

523
00:53:25,895 --> 00:53:26,937
But before I do...

524
00:53:27,478 --> 00:53:30,437
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

525
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:33,062
Okay.

526
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,895
Has anyone ever done anything to you...

527
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:44,687
that might have scared you...

528
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:46,187
or upset you?

529
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:53,853
I don't know.

530
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:57,062
What don't you know?

531
00:54:01,062 --> 00:54:02,687
Sometimes I get this...

532
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,437
bad feelings.

533
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,728
I see...

534
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,395
I see things.

535
00:54:13,978 --> 00:54:18,520
And I can't tell if they're real or not.

536
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:21,687
Listen to me.

537
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:25,020
When I was younger...

538
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,645
I used to have these...

539
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,687
horrible visions.

540
00:54:31,437 --> 00:54:33,728
They were so terrible that I...

541
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:37,103
convinced myself that they were real.

542
00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:42,853
But I learned that those thoughts...

543
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,937
they were just lies.

544
00:54:46,478 --> 00:54:49,145
Just tricks that my brain
was playing on me...

545
00:54:49,312 --> 00:54:51,520
because I was so unhappy.

546
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:53,687
This isn't a lie.

547
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:55,478
How can you know that for certain?

548
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:00,312
Carlita.

549
00:55:00,728 --> 00:55:01,812
I'm sorry.

550
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:07,437
Carlita.

551
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,645
Carlita. I'm sorry.

552
00:55:37,395 --> 00:55:38,603
There you are.

553
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:40,728
A riot's broken out.

554
00:55:40,895 --> 00:55:42,103
We must go.

555
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:55,853
Listen. It's all right, girls.

556
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,687
It's okay. Stay close to me, okay?

557
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,562
Stay close to me, okay?

558
00:56:18,728 --> 00:56:20,062
Carlita!

559
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,020
Carlita!

560
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:57,812
Margaretta.

561
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:06,645
Sister Silva would like to see you
in her office.

562
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:15,520
Please take a seat.

563
00:58:22,562 --> 00:58:23,562
Margaret...

564
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:28,478
Part of my job here is to look out...

565
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:32,687
for the well-being of all those
who are under my care.

566
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:36,687
I'm sure this will come as no surprise...

567
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:39,853
but I've become concerned.

568
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:42,853
I'm fine.

569
00:58:47,353 --> 00:58:49,937
Perhaps I should have put it this way.

570
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,728
We are concerned.

571
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:56,478
Myself and Cardinal Lawrence.

572
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:01,603
We think it might be time for you
to take a step back.

573
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,728
And perhaps we postpone your vows.

574
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:05,853
What? No. Why?

575
00:59:06,353 --> 00:59:10,062
We're also concerned
about your attachment to Carlita.

576
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:12,603
Carlita? But...

577
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:16,478
Cardinal Lawrence told me
about your troubles growing up.

578
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:18,228
Your hallucinations.

579
00:59:18,812 --> 00:59:23,728
Perhaps being around Carlita
is not what's right for you.

580
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,520
Carlita is disturbed.

581
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:31,562
And her illness must not infect us...

582
00:59:31,728 --> 00:59:33,562
as her caretakers.

583
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:36,770
And clearly, it has.

584
00:59:38,937 --> 00:59:39,978
Wait.

585
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,020
I'm not ill.

586
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:48,728
I understand how hard you had to work...

587
00:59:48,895 --> 00:59:50,770
to get to where you are.

588
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:53,562
It would be a shame to give it all up now.

589
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:56,270
I am the only one who cares about her.

590
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:58,770
- You don't let her play with the other girls.
- I've told you...

591
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:01,478
- You keep her in the bad room.
- ...we're only doing what's right for her.

592
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:02,937
The girl is sick in the head.

593
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,687
Because of you!

594
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,187
If there was any doubt in our decision...

595
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:18,478
you've all but confirmed it.

596
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:20,228
You're clearly unwell.

597
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:23,645
And, Margaret...

598
01:00:24,145 --> 01:00:27,062
you will keep your distance from Carlita.

599
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:30,603
Or there will be consequences.

600
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:45,270
Stop the car, Luca.

601
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,353
I can just walk home from here, okay?

602
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,728
You don't have to wait.

603
01:00:53,312 --> 01:00:54,312
Paolo.

604
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,770
Paolo!

605
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:57,687
Paolo!

606
01:01:01,187 --> 01:01:02,187
No, no, no.

607
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:07,187
Paolo?

608
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:08,978
Just leave me alone, please.

609
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:10,062
Hey!

610
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:12,520
Sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't know.

611
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:13,687
Really, I didn't know.

612
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:14,853
You didn't know what?

613
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,228
Just stop following me!

614
01:01:22,437 --> 01:01:23,895
Paolo, talk to me.

615
01:01:26,312 --> 01:01:27,353
Just look for the mark.

616
01:01:54,603 --> 01:01:55,437
Okay.

617
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,520
All right. Oh, God. Okay.

618
01:01:58,978 --> 01:01:59,978
All right.

619
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:02,895
Hey, call an ambulance.

620
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,687
Call an ambulance.

621
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,562
- Help me.
- I'm gonna help you.

622
01:02:06,728 --> 01:02:08,645
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

623
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,145
I'm gonna help you.

624
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:11,937
- I can't move.
- I know.

625
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,478
- I'm stuck. I'm stuck.
- I know. Okay.

626
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,895
- I'm scared.
- Paolo, you're gonna be fine, I promise.

627
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:19,353
I don't wanna die.

628
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,603
No, no, no. You're not gonna die,
you're gonna be okay.

629
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:26,437
You ready?

630
01:02:39,562 --> 01:02:41,103
Oh, no, no.

631
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,853
Oh, God.

632
01:02:45,103 --> 01:02:46,020
Oh, God.

633
01:02:46,187 --> 01:02:47,728
Oh, no, God.

634
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,228
- Amen.
- Amen.

635
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:02,312
Amen.

636
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,478
Amen.

637
01:11:53,353 --> 01:11:54,353
Oh, God.

638
01:12:01,103 --> 01:12:02,228
Come on.

639
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:06,312
Oh, God.

640
01:12:12,978 --> 01:12:13,978
Carlita.

641
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:15,853
Come with me, Carlita.

642
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:28,562
Okay, you go to the bed.

643
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,728
I am so sorry that I didn't believe you.

644
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:41,353
But I believe you now.

645
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:42,812
Okay?

646
01:12:42,978 --> 01:12:43,978
I'm gonna keep you safe.

647
01:12:44,187 --> 01:12:45,478
I'm gonna get you out of here.

648
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,062
Margaret.

649
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:48,270
Go, go, go. Over there.

650
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:56,228
- Margaret.
- You stay away.

651
01:12:57,937 --> 01:12:59,437
- I know what you're doing.
- We don't want to hurt you.

652
01:12:59,603 --> 01:13:00,520
Just put that down.

653
01:13:01,103 --> 01:13:02,353
I know what you've done...

654
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,520
with the babies.

655
01:13:04,062 --> 01:13:06,228
You stay away! No!

656
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:08,437
You stay away from me!

657
01:13:11,603 --> 01:13:13,228
- Remain calm!
- No, no, no!

658
01:13:32,103 --> 01:13:33,895
Please, please, I'm sorry.

659
01:13:34,395 --> 01:13:35,937
No, no, no!

660
01:13:36,437 --> 01:13:37,978
Not in there! Not in there! Not in there!

661
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:41,020
No! No! No!

662
01:13:44,562 --> 01:13:46,312
Let me out!

663
01:13:46,937 --> 01:13:48,687
Please let me out!

664
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,520
Please!

665
01:14:14,937 --> 01:14:16,312
Breathe. Breathe.

666
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:21,812
...conviction: I am wanted.
I have a task in history.

667
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:25,978
I am accepted. It is good that I exist.

668
01:15:26,645 --> 01:15:28,062
It is good to be a human being.

669
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,603
Let every human heart experience your love.

670
01:16:25,187 --> 01:16:26,270
It's not real.

671
01:16:27,062 --> 01:16:30,437
It's not real. It's not real. It's not real.

672
01:16:30,645 --> 01:16:31,520
What's not real?

673
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:32,812
Who said that?

674
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:44,770
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

675
01:17:59,812 --> 01:18:01,020
No!

676
01:18:01,312 --> 01:18:03,145
Margaret. We have to go.

677
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:04,728
We have to go. I found the files.

678
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:07,062
We have to go now. It's just me.

679
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,437
It's just me.

680
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,270
Get me out of here.

681
01:18:12,895 --> 01:18:14,895
Yes. I know. I know.

682
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:22,187
All right, all right.

683
01:18:22,353 --> 01:18:24,312
Father Gabriel. Margaret.

684
01:18:30,812 --> 01:18:32,145
I don't understand.

685
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:35,895
How?

686
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:40,228
Well done, Margaret. Well done.

687
01:18:41,728 --> 01:18:42,728
Were you followed?

688
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:43,895
What? No.

689
01:18:44,062 --> 01:18:45,228
I don't think so.

690
01:18:45,395 --> 01:18:47,353
Luca, Margaret's driver, brought us.

691
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,562
We can trust him. He's keeping watch outside.

692
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:52,353
You two know each other?

693
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,520
- Yes.
- No.

694
01:18:54,478 --> 01:18:56,520
He tried approaching me.

695
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:58,103
I thought he was crazy.

696
01:18:59,062 --> 01:19:01,228
It is crazy.

697
01:19:02,853 --> 01:19:03,853
Carlita.

698
01:19:04,395 --> 01:19:05,395
We have to go get her.

699
01:19:05,562 --> 01:19:06,562
No, it's not safe.

700
01:19:06,728 --> 01:19:07,812
Not safe?

701
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:09,478
She's the one
who's not safe right now, Gabriel.

702
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:10,895
Margaret, after what just happened...

703
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:13,312
they're not gonna let us
anywhere near that orphanage.

704
01:19:13,478 --> 01:19:14,687
Especially Carlita.

705
01:19:14,853 --> 01:19:15,895
He's right.

706
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:18,937
It's only a matter of time
before they realize we've got these.

707
01:19:19,103 --> 01:19:21,312
And when they do, they will come for us.

708
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:22,478
We have to help her.

709
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:24,187
The only path forward...

710
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:25,853
is to prove what they've done.

711
01:19:26,478 --> 01:19:28,353
Otherwise, no one will believe a word we say.

712
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:38,187
There's so many of them.

713
01:19:38,353 --> 01:19:39,353
Yes.

714
01:19:40,062 --> 01:19:41,145
Too many.

715
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:45,312
I had no idea they'd gone to such lengths.

716
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,187
I don't understand.

717
01:19:53,812 --> 01:19:55,187
They need a male.

718
01:19:56,978 --> 01:19:58,687
They've only birthed females.

719
01:19:59,187 --> 01:20:01,270
They've all died except for Carlita.

720
01:20:01,437 --> 01:20:03,978
After all these years, so many failures...

721
01:20:06,853 --> 01:20:10,687
They believe the only way is for the beast
to mate with its own offspring.

722
01:20:30,728 --> 01:20:32,020
What is this?

723
01:20:32,437 --> 01:20:34,228
I told you,
it's the photo from Carlita's birth.

724
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,395
No.

725
01:20:36,145 --> 01:20:37,145
This.

726
01:20:43,145 --> 01:20:44,145
It's the mark.

727
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:46,520
Carlita doesn't have the mark on her head.

728
01:20:49,103 --> 01:20:50,228
Hers is here.

729
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:51,728
What are you talking about?

730
01:20:51,895 --> 01:20:52,937
I've seen it.

731
01:20:55,645 --> 01:20:57,478
{\an8}You see? Carlita.

732
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:58,645
{\an8}No mark.

733
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:01,520
The baby in this photo is not Carlita.

734
01:21:06,812 --> 01:21:08,020
What does that mean?

735
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:10,978
Brennan?

736
01:21:11,145 --> 01:21:12,187
I don't know.

737
01:21:15,812 --> 01:21:17,270
Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for...

738
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:20,187
then all we have to do is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

739
01:21:20,645 --> 01:21:22,062
We must have missed something.

740
01:21:22,228 --> 01:21:23,228
Right?

741
01:21:46,478 --> 01:21:47,312
Where is it?

742
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,562
{\an8}Why do they all look like this?

743
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,228
{\an8}The father. He's not human.

744
01:22:27,562 --> 01:22:28,687
It's her.

745
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,687
There was another survivor.

746
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:38,353
A sister?

747
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,562
Did you know about this?

748
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:41,728
No.

749
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:43,312
They must have kept it hidden away.

750
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:15,562
Look for the mark.

751
01:23:18,187 --> 01:23:19,645
How did he know?

752
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,020
He knew where it was.

753
01:26:42,228 --> 01:26:43,728
Margaret, Margaret. Hush.

754
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:46,978
Margaret. Margaret. Margaret.

755
01:26:48,312 --> 01:26:49,728
Just let me have a look.

756
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:51,687
Let me look.

757
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:21,020
Somebody say something.

758
01:27:23,187 --> 01:27:24,562
How is that possible?

759
01:27:25,228 --> 01:27:27,645
She's been a ward of the Church
her entire life.

760
01:27:28,853 --> 01:27:30,978
They must have moved her around
to cover their tracks.

761
01:27:32,103 --> 01:27:33,228
Carlita must be too young...

762
01:27:33,395 --> 01:27:36,145
so they brought Margaret back to Rome to...

763
01:27:36,312 --> 01:27:37,312
To what?

764
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:41,187
To what?

765
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:49,853
- I have to get out of here.
- You can't leave.

766
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,145
- Don't touch me.
- Margaret...

767
01:27:51,312 --> 01:27:52,937
- Don't you touch me!
- ...you can't just leave.

768
01:27:53,103 --> 01:27:55,437
You touch me again, I'll fucking kill you!

769
01:28:07,353 --> 01:28:08,562
I'm so sorry.

770
01:28:11,353 --> 01:28:14,062
I'm so sorry this is happening to you,
my child.

771
01:28:14,937 --> 01:28:17,353
But nothing will change
if you decide to leave.

772
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:21,395
It's June 6th.

773
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:22,562
Midnight.

774
01:28:22,728 --> 01:28:24,228
They will be coming for you.

775
01:28:29,603 --> 01:28:31,062
If this is true...

776
01:28:34,728 --> 01:28:36,353
If I am pregnant...

777
01:28:38,895 --> 01:28:40,687
then I need it out of me.

778
01:28:42,978 --> 01:28:44,770
I need it out of me now.

779
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,395
Margaret...

780
01:28:56,145 --> 01:28:57,353
you all right?

781
01:28:57,895 --> 01:29:00,187
This doctor knows what he's doing?

782
01:29:01,187 --> 01:29:02,978
He's experienced, yes.

783
01:29:30,978 --> 01:29:32,603
Wait. Stop. What are you doing?

784
01:29:32,937 --> 01:29:33,895
Don't stop.

785
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:35,853
Make like you're heading for the main road...

786
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,520
and then turn off before the arch.

787
01:29:50,145 --> 01:29:50,978
Margaret.

788
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:57,895
What's happening to me?

789
01:33:41,645 --> 01:33:42,937
Hello?

790
01:33:43,812 --> 01:33:44,937
Hello?

791
01:33:46,562 --> 01:33:48,478
Can anyone hear me?

792
01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:49,645
Yes.

793
01:33:50,645 --> 01:33:51,728
I can hear.

794
01:33:55,853 --> 01:33:58,937
I can't tell if this is real or not.

795
01:33:59,395 --> 01:34:03,353
This is very real, Margaret.

796
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,062
Can you untie me?

797
01:34:06,895 --> 01:34:08,062
Soon.

798
01:34:09,145 --> 01:34:11,812
Soon it will be all over, I promise.

799
01:34:16,103 --> 01:34:17,103
No.

800
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:19,437
No, no.

801
01:34:19,603 --> 01:34:21,395
You don't have to be afraid.

802
01:34:22,812 --> 01:34:25,353
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

803
01:34:28,895 --> 01:34:30,478
I've watched over you...

804
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,103
since you were a little girl.

805
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:39,520
The very first moment we met,
do you remember what I said to you?

806
01:34:41,103 --> 01:34:45,395
That you, Margaret, were the bravest girl
I'd ever known.

807
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,812
Now you know how special you are to me.

808
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:51,020
To us.

809
01:34:53,478 --> 01:34:57,937
The baby you're about to bear
will redeem the Church.

810
01:34:58,103 --> 01:35:01,312
Will bring the people back to God.

811
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,770
All because of you.

812
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:06,895
Don't you understand, Margaret?

813
01:35:08,645 --> 01:35:10,520
Your whole life, you've been searching...

814
01:35:10,687 --> 01:35:12,687
waiting for His voice.

815
01:35:14,978 --> 01:35:16,895
But the truth is...

816
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,562
He was always there with you.

817
01:35:26,312 --> 01:35:29,020
He brought you here.

818
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,020
He chose you.

819
01:35:35,853 --> 01:35:37,812
I... No.

820
01:35:54,895 --> 01:35:56,103
There.

821
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,687
You're ready now.

822
01:35:58,395 --> 01:36:00,228
Please know that I love you.

823
01:36:04,728 --> 01:36:06,562
I'll be right here.

824
01:37:17,978 --> 01:37:19,020
Stay down.

825
01:37:45,687 --> 01:37:46,687
No, no.

826
01:37:48,728 --> 01:37:50,228
No, no. Please.

827
01:38:02,478 --> 01:38:04,020
Please, please, please.

828
01:38:04,562 --> 01:38:05,770
No.

829
01:38:07,812 --> 01:38:09,103
No, no, no.

830
01:38:10,478 --> 01:38:11,478
No, please.

831
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,520
Please.

832
01:38:16,687 --> 01:38:17,687
Please.

833
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:51,562
Help me, please.

834
01:38:52,853 --> 01:38:54,770
Please help me. Please.

835
01:38:54,937 --> 01:38:56,312
Please, untie me.

836
01:38:57,562 --> 01:38:59,603
Please untie me, I'm in pain.

837
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,478
I'm in pain. Please.

838
01:39:07,853 --> 01:39:08,853
Help.

839
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:12,270
Help me, please.

840
01:39:12,437 --> 01:39:13,770
Please help me.

841
01:39:15,603 --> 01:39:16,603
Help me.

842
01:39:17,395 --> 01:39:19,687
Help. I'm in pain.

843
01:40:21,687 --> 01:40:23,395
What is it? A boy or girl?

844
01:40:33,062 --> 01:40:34,520
There are two.

845
01:40:35,728 --> 01:40:36,853
A girl...

846
01:40:40,895 --> 01:40:42,228
And the other?

847
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:44,478
A boy!

848
01:40:49,437 --> 01:40:50,687
We have him.

849
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:54,770
Help.

850
01:41:55,103 --> 01:41:57,770
- Help. Help.
- Of course.

851
01:41:57,937 --> 01:41:58,937
Of course, my dear.

852
01:41:59,103 --> 01:42:00,853
- I'm in pain.
- Of course.

853
01:42:05,895 --> 01:42:07,478
Can I hold him?

854
01:42:11,937 --> 01:42:13,228
You're sure?

855
01:42:15,978 --> 01:42:18,353
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.

856
01:42:20,187 --> 01:42:21,603
Bring him here.

857
01:42:24,395 --> 01:42:25,603
She's right.

858
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:31,062
It is important for a child
to bond with its mother.

859
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:41,062
We all need the comfort of our mothers
in the beginning.

860
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:43,020
Don't we?

861
01:42:47,978 --> 01:42:50,187
You did so well, my child.

862
01:42:57,187 --> 01:42:59,853
You are doing God's work.

863
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:02,603
He would be so proud of you.

864
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:05,103
Can't you hear Him telling you?

865
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,312
Don't you hear His voice?

866
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:13,478
No.

867
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,937
No, I only hear my own.

868
01:43:22,937 --> 01:43:24,187
No!

869
01:43:52,187 --> 01:43:53,145
Margaret.

870
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:56,270
Stop this.

871
01:43:58,853 --> 01:44:02,228
Margaret, give me the baby.

872
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:05,978
Just give me the baby.

873
01:44:16,937 --> 01:44:17,812
No!

874
01:44:41,687 --> 01:44:43,103
Burn everything.

875
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:44,937
Leave them both to die.

876
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:12,770
It's okay.

877
01:48:03,145 --> 01:48:05,020
The man you are looking for.

878
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,353
The US Ambassador to Rome.

879
01:48:08,312 --> 01:48:10,020
He will be the new father.

880
01:48:12,062 --> 01:48:15,145
<i>He and his wife will suffer a tragic loss...</i>

881
01:48:15,645 --> 01:48:16,978
<i>and be in need of a child.</i>

882
01:48:20,728 --> 01:48:23,145
<i>The boy will inherit their privilege...</i>

883
01:48:23,312 --> 01:48:24,395
<i>and power.</i>

884
01:48:26,895 --> 01:48:29,978
<i>Soon, his darkness will spread...</i>

885
01:48:31,312 --> 01:48:34,312
<i>and the world shall be saved.</i>

886
01:49:10,437 --> 01:49:12,562
Baby, you're supposed to eat them.

887
01:49:12,728 --> 01:49:13,895
You're supposed to eat them like...

888
01:49:14,645 --> 01:49:15,645
Like that.

889
01:49:19,103 --> 01:49:20,395
What are you doing?

890
01:49:22,562 --> 01:49:23,478
Come here.

891
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:29,728
No, no, no. Here.

892
01:49:30,728 --> 01:49:31,728
This.

893
01:49:31,895 --> 01:49:32,978
No, not this.

894
01:49:33,145 --> 01:49:34,145
You want one?

895
01:49:35,812 --> 01:49:36,812
You want it?

896
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,728
Give it to Mama. Give it to Mama.

897
01:49:39,895 --> 01:49:40,895
Give it to Mama.

898
01:50:02,895 --> 01:50:04,437
I'm so sorry, Margaret.

899
01:50:07,353 --> 01:50:09,020
I tried just to leave you be.

900
01:50:12,895 --> 01:50:14,270
You need to go.

901
01:50:15,103 --> 01:50:16,312
Now.

902
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,895
I came to warn you.

903
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:22,645
They know you're alive.

904
01:50:23,853 --> 01:50:26,395
You weren't supposed to survive.
None of you were.

905
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:28,312
Especially the girl.

906
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:33,020
She'll be important, Margaret.

907
01:50:35,812 --> 01:50:37,395
I just want to be left alone.

908
01:50:39,187 --> 01:50:40,228
I know.

909
01:50:42,228 --> 01:50:43,520
But they will come for you.

910
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,645
They've even given it a name.

911
01:51:05,478 --> 01:51:06,853
Your son.

912
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:10,353
Damien.
