1
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:09,241
An American, Colonel.

2
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,535
He was at the gate,
impersonating an officer.

3
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:52,034
Take him upstairs.

4
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,289
A moment. Please!

5
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,583
Stop! I must speak to the commander.

6
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,752
Colonel. I found it!

7
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:05,214
Do as he says. Open it.

8
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:21,605
The Lance of Longinus.

9
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:25,442
The blade that drew Christ's blood.

10
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:27,569
The Holy Lance.

11
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,040
Double the guard.
This is the prize the Führer seeks.

12
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:41,083
Colonel, we need to talk.

13
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,417
No time, Doctor.

14
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:44,044
The train to Berlin is waiting.

15
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:46,505
Search the woods!

16
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,548
Take the dogs.

17
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:49,925
Do you think that spy was alone?

18
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,052
Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!

19
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:53,262
On the double!

20
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,000
This man was with the American.

21
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,836
This is the American's bag.

22
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:33,672
What have I done?

23
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,595
Bring him to my carriage.

24
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:50,272
Careful.
This is the Führer's special relic!

25
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,136
Stay seated.

26
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,347
So...

27
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:28,143
you are a birdwatcher?

28
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,690
Yes. Because of the bombing,

29
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:36,610
the wagtails are following
a completely different trajectory.

30
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,282
We caught your accomplice.

31
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:44,993
The American.

32
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,690
There is a problem.

33
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,025
I must speak to the Colonel.

34
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,319
It's urgent.

35
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,588
I must speak with the Colonel.

36
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,924
It's about the Lance.

37
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,055
I only had a moment to look at it.

38
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,974
Of course, my training is in physics,

39
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,434
For God's sake, spit it out!

40
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,354
The Lance...

41
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,151
It's a fake.

42
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,653
A fake?

43
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,448
The blade is an alloy.

44
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:34,950
Fifty years old,

45
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:37,286
the engravings recent. It's a replica.

46
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:38,412
We're dead.

47
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,053
There is another relic on this train.

48
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,639
One with real power.

49
00:11:58,098 --> 00:11:59,224
What are you talking about?

50
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,186
The Antikythera.

51
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:03,729
The Antikythera?!

52
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,814
Enough about that old dial!

53
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:08,233
Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...

54
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,027
and his mind!

55
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:13,572
Let me explain.

56
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:18,035
The Antikythera's power
is not supernatural.

57
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,370
It is mathematics.

58
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,582
Whoever harnesses it...

59
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,169
will not be King...

60
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,921
nor Emperor...

61
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,507
or Führer.

62
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,803
He will be God.

63
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:03,330
And how do you propose we tell him this?

64
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:04,831
My Führer,

65
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:07,417
I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.

66
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:08,836
But here is...

67
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:13,006
half of something you've never heard of.

68
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,509
Tell me,

69
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,469
have you ever MET HITLER?!!

70
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,139
A saboteur aboard.

71
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:22,641
And Hitler's Lance is gone.

72
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,225
That way!

73
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,189
What are you doing here?!

74
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,077
Who are you?

75
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:15,874
They have the Antikythera!

76
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:04,209
Drop the gun.

77
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,505
Give me the Antikythera.

78
02:03:09,853 --> 02:03:11,188
Time to destination?

79
02:03:12,397 --> 02:03:13,941
60 seconds.

80
02:04:02,364 --> 02:04:03,949
30 seconds.

81
02:04:15,294 --> 02:04:16,211
20 seconds.

82
02:04:22,092 --> 02:04:23,385
15 seconds.

83
02:04:28,557 --> 02:04:29,391
10 seconds.

84
02:04:30,309 --> 02:04:31,143
9!

85
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:32,895
8!

86
02:04:33,187 --> 02:04:34,021
7!

87
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,522
6!

88
02:04:35,606 --> 02:04:36,857
Turn around!

89
02:04:37,566 --> 02:04:38,442
Abort!

90
02:04:38,942 --> 02:04:39,860
Turn around!

91
02:04:40,652 --> 02:04:41,528
ABORT!!!

92
02:04:41,778 --> 02:04:43,739
We're being pulled in!

93
02:04:53,749 --> 02:04:55,083
What are you doing?!

94
02:04:55,292 --> 02:04:56,126
This is my plane!

95
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:57,794
You're flying my plane!

96
02:05:22,611 --> 02:05:23,779
We're going to DIE!!!

97
02:05:25,113 --> 02:05:26,823
We need to pull up!

98
02:05:48,679 --> 02:05:49,847
Restart engines!

99
02:06:26,008 --> 02:06:27,718
Setting coordinates for Munich.

100
02:07:53,387 --> 02:07:54,263
Master...

101
02:07:54,346 --> 02:07:56,765
The Romans are getting closer.

102
02:07:58,517 --> 02:07:59,393
They have dragons!

103
02:08:44,146 --> 02:08:44,980
Master...

104
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:49,651
Don't ride out there, Master!

105
02:08:50,235 --> 02:08:51,445
The dragons!!

106
02:09:01,705 --> 02:09:05,209
We must take down their dragons!

107
02:09:13,383 --> 02:09:14,218
Change course!

108
02:09:14,468 --> 02:09:15,844
The portal closes in minutes!

109
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:17,179
I have to go back!

110
02:09:17,638 --> 02:09:18,764
I can't be here!

111
02:09:18,972 --> 02:09:20,057
I CAN'T STAY HERE!!

112
02:09:20,224 --> 02:09:21,683
The plane won't make it!!

113
02:11:35,776 --> 02:11:37,236
We're losing altitude!

114
02:11:38,487 --> 02:11:39,404
We're going down!

115
02:11:41,323 --> 02:11:42,908
I've lost control!

116
02:13:10,454 --> 02:13:11,830
Eureka.

117
02:15:21,543 --> 02:15:22,461
Master!

118
02:15:25,172 --> 02:15:26,965
We have to leave, Master.

119
02:15:44,024 --> 02:15:46,777
Two thousand years.

120
02:15:47,402 --> 02:15:48,570
We've come...

121
02:15:49,154 --> 02:15:52,157
two thousand years.

122
02:15:54,493 --> 02:15:57,621
But we didn't expect to meet...

123
02:15:58,163 --> 02:16:00,666
the great...

124
02:16:01,208 --> 02:16:03,252
Archimedes.

125
02:16:08,924 --> 02:16:09,842
You...

126
02:16:11,051 --> 02:16:12,386
were always...

127
02:16:13,053 --> 02:16:14,304
going to...

128
02:16:14,888 --> 02:16:16,473
meet me.

129
02:16:26,066 --> 02:16:27,692
Apologies, Archimedes.

130
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:29,236
I'm a fan...

131
02:16:29,486 --> 02:16:31,487
but we need to leave. He's hurt.

132
02:16:41,957 --> 02:16:42,790
I want...

133
02:16:42,875 --> 02:16:43,959
to stay...

134
02:16:44,334 --> 02:16:46,085
with you.

135
02:16:48,797 --> 02:16:51,049
You are a brilliant man...

136
02:16:51,299 --> 02:16:53,302
a wise man...

137
02:16:53,843 --> 02:16:55,179
a genius...

138
02:16:56,346 --> 02:16:58,682
a hero to your people.

139
02:16:59,391 --> 02:17:02,936
But he can't help you.

140
02:17:04,021 --> 02:17:05,731
This is your time.

141
02:17:06,772 --> 02:17:08,734
He must be in his own time -
