1
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:30,250
What's wrong?

2
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,500
There's someone on the roof.

3
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,500
Jules!
Baby, are you sleepwalking?

4
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,918
Listen.

5
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,125
I don't hear anything.

6
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,125
Come on, baby,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

7
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,626
What now?

8
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,751
I don't know, she said she heard something on the roof.

9
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,626
There were footsteps.

10
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,375
Naturally.

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,876
Jingle bells too, right?

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,125
Mark, stop.

13
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,250
But I heard him.

14
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,792
Can you take care of this,
please?

15
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,292
I gotta be up in three hours.

16
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,167
Come on, Jules,
let's get back into bed.

17
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,626
No more sugar after dinner,
okay?

18
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,250
Too many bad dreams
and not enough sleep.

19
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,167
But mom!

20
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,876
I didn't have a bad dream.

21
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,542
I really heard someone
on the roof!

22
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,167
Shh.

23
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,125
Keep your voice down.

24
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,042
Don't wake up your brother.

25
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,125
Nobody believes me.

26
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,751
Jules, it's probably just
the house settling.

27
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,042
Or an animal.

28
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,626
You know, sometimes a raccoon
or squirrel can get up there.

29
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,542
It was Santa.

30
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,292
I'm positive.

31
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,000
You know who I really think
it was?

32
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,500
Who?

33
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,167
One of Santa's elves.

34
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,125
An elf?

35
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,626
Mhm.

36
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,250
Sometimes Santa sends a scout
a few days before Christmas Eve

37
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,000
to make sure our house meets
all the necessary

38
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,542
safety requirements.

39
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,751
Like what?

40
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,626
Like making sure the roof
is sturdy enough

41
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,751
to hold all the reindeer,
for one thing.

42
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,042
Can't have them crashing
through the ceiling,

43
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,000
running all through the house,
pooping on everything.

44
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,751
What else?

45
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,667
They have to measure the chimney
to make sure it's wide enough

46
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,292
to fit Santa's big fat belly.

47
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,167
Sometimes he splurges
too much during the holidays.

48
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,876
Just like daddy?

49
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:09,417
Just like daddy.

50
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,667
Can we leave some milk
and cookies out for the elves?

51
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,375
If you go to sleep right now,

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll go downstairs
and leave them a plate.

53
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:17,626
Okay?

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
You forgot to lock
the front door again.

55
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,751
Perhaps you could have
a little concern

56
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,626
for your family's safety?

57
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,500
By the way, your daughter left
a glass of milk and cookies

58
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:19,417
for Santa's elves
in the kitchen.

59
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,626
Can you make sure to eat them before she gets up for school?

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Hello?

61
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,375
Can you take care of that
when you wake up, please?

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,000
When I wake up?

63
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,500
I am up, Jen.

64
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,250
I have been up
because you keep talking to me.

65
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:41,125
I will take care of it.

66
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,876
Thank you, Mr. Grinch.

67
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,375
Santa?

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,918
Timmy!

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,667
Timmy, wake up!

70
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,500
Santa's downstairs.

71
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,375
Timmy!

72
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,292
He was putting presents
under the tree, I saw him!

73
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,542
Go away!

74
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,375
Juliet, I told you
to stay out of my--

75
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,417
Babe, what are you doing?

76
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,042
Timmy, Juliet, run!

77
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,125
Juliet!

78
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,500
Timmy!

79
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Help me!

80
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,667
No, please!

81
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:42,417
Somebody fucking help me!

82
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,792
Help me, please!

83
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,918
Oh fuck, help me!

84
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Help me!

85
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,792
Be advised.

86
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,500
Anonymous caller says possible suspect on lower level.

87
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,751
Armed and dangerous.</Font>

88
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,876
Oh, fuck.

89
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,292
Dispatch, I got
a decapitated body down here.

90
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,125
Victim appears to be male.</Font>

91
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,375
</Font>All available units notified.</Font></Font>

92
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,876
That's a ten-four.

93
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,042
Dispatch,
I'm not alone down here.

94
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,751
What's-- what's the ETA
on the backup?</Font>

95
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,000
</Font>Multiple units
arriving shortly.</Font></Font>

96
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,751
</Font>Hold onto him, Eros,</Font></Font>

97
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,918
I'll have the ship
in the air in a minute!</Font>

98
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,500
</Font>Get out of here, Jeff!</Font></Font>

99
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:38,167
The ship's on fire.</Font>

100
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,667
Eros?</Font>

101
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,500
Dean,
I need you to get down here now.

102
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,417
Cell three, east wing.

103
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,626
I think we got
a situation.

104
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,000
Over.</Font>

105
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,417
</Font>I'm taking a shit.</Font></Font>

106
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,542
Aww!

107
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,375
Well, wipe your ass
and get down here, pronto!

108
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:28,042
Help.

109
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,167
Help me!

110
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,000
Please!

111
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,626
Please help me!

112
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,375
Oh, he made me do it.

113
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,125
Please just help me!

114
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,042
Help me!

115
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,876
Help me, fucker!

116
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,751
Help me!

117
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,125
Help me!

118
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,876
Help me!

119
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,500
Yes!

120
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:05,125
More!

121
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,792
Yo, yo!

122
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:23,751
You guys, you--
you look so good.

123
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:25,626
I mean, way better than mine.

124
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,375
I was gonna do
the blood thing, too,

125
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,250
but I was just worried
about the clean up.

126
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,125
But...Can I--
can I get a picture?

127
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,375
I'm gonna post this.

128
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,876
Guys, seriously?

129
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,751
You killed it.

130
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,876
This is awesome!

131
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:38,500
Aww.

132
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,375
Aww.

133
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,626
Vicky, you used to be so hot.

134
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,250
Now no one's gonna fuck you.

135
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Pretty girl.

136
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,125
Pretty girl.

137
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,626
Pretty girl.

138
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:48,626
Hi.

139
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,125
Good morning.

140
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:49,918
Morning.

141
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,918
I'm here to pick up my niece.

142
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,918
She's a patient here.

143
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What's her name?

144
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:53,751
Shaw.

145
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,000
Sienna Shaw.

146
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,417
Uncle Greg!

147
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,500
Never mind.

148
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,125
-Hey!
-Hey!

149
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,167
- How are you?
- Good.

150
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,417
-How are you?
-Good.

151
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,125
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

152
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:04,751
Wow.

153
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:05,667
You look good.

154
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,125
-No, I got it.
-No, no, no, I got it.

155
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,500
-I insist.
-Thanks.

156
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,125
Welcome.

157
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,626
So do we run, or...

158
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:12,751
Gotta sign out first.

159
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,292
So, uh, how's my little
partner in crime?

160
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,626
Oh,
she's not so little anymore.

161
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,000
Uh, she's great.

162
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,626
Man, beautiful.

163
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,500
Sassy as hell
and talented like you.

164
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,125
In fact,
you're all she ever talks about,

165
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,125
so, little warning,

166
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,918
just get ready
to have your hands full,

167
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,876
because she misses you.

168
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,500
I miss her, too.

169
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,918
Hey.

170
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,375
We're home!

171
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,375
All right.

172
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:27,167
Hello?

173
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,292
Sienna!

174
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,125
Incoming!

175
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,292
Oh, hey!

176
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:35,626
Hey!

177
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey, Gabs.

178
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh my god, you got so big!

179
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,167
When did that happen?

180
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,125
Never leave me
for this long ever again.

181
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,626
I won't.

182
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,125
I promise.

183
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,250
Oh, you got glitter
all over your face.

184
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,000
It's just sugar.

185
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,500
We were baking.

186
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:57,626
Did you want to help?

187
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,500
Gabbie, Sienna's not even
in here two minutes.

188
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:02,250
Why don't you let her
get settled first, all right?

189
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,250
Fine.

190
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah, I'd love to.

191
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm so happy to see you.

192
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:19,500
Me too.

193
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
How was the trip?

194
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:22,042
Fine.

195
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,500
Wanna see your room?

196
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,125
Go ahead.

197
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,751
We'll catch up later.

198
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:26,417
Yeah. All right.

199
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll see you guys later.

200
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:31,626
And don't pull her arm out.

201
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,626
- Ready?
- Yes.

202
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,417
Oh my God.

203
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:51,125
It looks like a fairy tale
exploded in here.

204
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,292
Do you like it?

205
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,876
Me and mommy redecorated,
but I picked out most of it.

206
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:58,375
I know how much you like
dragons and wizards.

207
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,626
I love it.

208
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,250
Really?

209
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes, really.

210
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,250
This is the coolest room ever.

211
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,542
Are you kidding?

212
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:09,500
I don't know what to say,
this is beautiful.

213
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,125
Made this for you too.

214
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,125
Gabs.

215
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:22,375
'To Sienna, my big sister
from another mister.

216
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,417
I've missed you more than ever.

217
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
And getting into trouble
hasn't been nearly as much fun

218
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,751
without you.

219
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,042
Looking forward
to the best Christmas ever,

220
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,250
filled with fun,
smiles, and laughter.

221
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,500
Love, Gabby.

222
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:40,000
P.S. We still haven't made it
to the moon.'

223
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,375
To the moon!

224
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,375
Our little cardboard
rocket ship.

225
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,626
You remember?

226
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:52,250
Of course I do.

227
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,542
Come here.

228
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,042
Jesus.

229
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,000
-Yeah.
-Stinks in here.

230
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,751
A real beaut, ain't she?

231
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,125
Shit!

232
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,918
It's a rat, kid,
not the devil.

233
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah.

234
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:37,792
Are you alright?

235
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, you've been skittish
all day.

236
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,292
I just hate places like this.

237
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,375
It's like they got a soul
and they're pissed that

238
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,000
-we're tearing 'em apart.
-Oh, shit.

239
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,751
Please don't tell me
you believe all the stories

240
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,000
about this place.

241
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,500
What stories?

242
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,876
Back in the early 90s,

243
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,375
some maniac abducted
and killed over a dozen kids

244
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:00,125
in this town.

245
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,792
They buried all the bodies
in the basement here

246
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,375
in this building.

247
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,918
Now everyone swears
the place is haunted.

248
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:18,500
Are you fucking with me?

249
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,876
You're fucking with me.

250
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:25,792
Of course I'm fucking with you.

251
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,125
Now come on.

252
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,918
I'll take the first floor
and the basement.

253
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,626
You... upstairs.

254
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,626
Skittish all day.

255
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:16,751
So, what do you think?

256
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:20,000
More Blaster Man?

257
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:23,250
What's the matter
with Blaster Man?

258
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,626
I thought you liked him.

259
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:26,375
You only draw boys.

260
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Boys, boys, boys.

261
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,918
That's not true.

262
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,876
I draw girls all the ti--
that is a girl right there.

263
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:33,500
Look at that.

264
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,751
That is a girl.

265
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:37,626
But she's not a superhero.

266
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,751
Last time you said
you were going to draw a girl

267
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:41,876
that could beat up Blaster Man.

268
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,167
Remember?

269
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,542
You pinky swore!

270
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,000
That's sacred.

271
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,876
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

272
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,000
I will tell you what, though.

273
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,751
As soon as I'm finished
with this comic,

274
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,292
I'm gonna make you
something really special.

275
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,000
How's that? Okay?

276
00:29:58,042 --> 00:29:59,667
Yeah, yeah.

277
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:01,250
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,626
Yeah, well.

279
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,250
Okay.

280
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,626
Time for bed.

281
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,000
Sisi!

282
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,167
Wait a minute.

283
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,375
I do have something for you.

284
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,542
I woke up back
in the clown cafÃ©,

285
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,417
encased in glass.

286
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,876
My lungs filled with ice water.

287
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,918
This wasn't a dream
or a hallucination.

288
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,626
Okay, give me that.

289
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:41,626
This isn't
for public consumption, nosy.

290
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:43,000
It's my diary. Okay?

291
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,667
It's for my eyes only.

292
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:45,918
Got it?

293
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,167
Got it.

294
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,500
What's the clown cafÃ©?

295
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,751
It's a bad place.

296
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,667
A place I don't want
to think about.

297
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:58,125
Happy thoughts
from now on. Okay?

298
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,417
Okay.</Font>

299
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:26,626
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
this place fucking smells</Font>

300
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,751
Disgusting.

301
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:58,876
What the hell is that?

302
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:04,751
Anybody home?

303
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,125
What the fuck?

304
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,042
Hello?

305
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,876
It's not real.

306
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,626
It's not real, right?

307
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,626
Hey, Jackson!

308
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,000
Anybody home?

309
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,626
Yoo-hoo.

310
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:53,125
What the fuck?

311
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,375
Holy shit!

312
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,667
Holy shit!

313
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,250
Dennis!

314
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,667
Dennis!

315
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,876
Hey!

316
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey!

317
00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:33,125
Dennis!

318
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,500
Get your ass up here!

319
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:36,751
Now!

320
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,125
Are you real?

321
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,167
No!

322
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,626
No! No!

323
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,250
I think we need to make
some cookies.

324
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,125
Yeah. For dessert!

325
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,751
We need to-- Yeah!

326
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:17,751
We're gonna go all out, man.

327
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,167
Chocolate and peanut butter,
you are right.

328
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,375
That's the combination.

329
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,042
You know, those coconut peanut
butter ones are amazing.

330
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,500
This is going to be
a Christmas extravaganza.

331
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,417
I'd like to go see
those lights again.

332
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,626
I wanna see the lights.

333
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:31,375
I like the holiday market that
they have over there.

334
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,876
Gabs, stop starin'.

335
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,542
It's rude.

336
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,125
What?

337
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,417
I like her scars.

338
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,876
Gabbie!

339
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,375
No, it's fine.

340
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:40,500
No, it's not.

341
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,792
It's very inappropriate.

342
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,626
I just think they're cool.

343
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:44,626
You know what?

344
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:46,918
Why don't you show her
your new scar?

345
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,292
Look at this thing.

346
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,000
Bad boy.

347
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:49,626
Ooh.

348
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,626
How'd you get that?

349
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,125
Fell off my bike
during summer break.

350
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,500
And landed on a broken bottle.

351
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:55,417
Oh, yeah.

352
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,751
Seven stitches, too.

353
00:36:56,876 --> 00:36:58,626
There was so much blood,
and like this piece

354
00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,667
of fat oozing out.

355
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,626
All right, all right.

356
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,000
Can we change the subject,
please?

357
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,417
I don't wanna think about blood
and fat while we're eating.

358
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,375
So much blood.

359
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,125
Okay, honey.

360
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,667
You're disgusting.

361
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:10,751
Regardless,

362
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,375
Christmas hasn't really been
the same around here

363
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,792
since someone stopped
believing in Santa Claus.

364
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,250
When did that happen?

365
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,542
When I was, like, eight.

366
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:18,250
Oh, stop.

367
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,250
You were older than that.

368
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,626
No,
I just went along with it

369
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,125
so you and Daddy
wouldn't feel bad.

370
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,500
I've been finding presents
stashed around the house

371
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,500
for years now.

372
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,125
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're a little snoop.

373
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:27,751
Yeah.

374
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:29,000
Finding is a loose term.

375
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,250
More like investigating
and discovering, really.

376
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,417
Can you pass the rice?

377
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
It's not my fault that
they're really, really bad

378
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:35,375
at hiding presents.

379
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,000
Dude, it was under
the floorboard,

380
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:37,876
under the carpet.

381
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:39,751
Pass the rice, please?

382
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,500
Oh, she's also notorious
for opening presents

383
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,542
and then re-wrapping them.

384
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:43,876
Not very well, either.

385
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,250
Sienna!

386
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,167
If you don't pass the rice,
I'm not gonna leave.

387
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,125
Please? Pass the rice?

388
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,876
Sienna?

389
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,292
Hello, Sienna?

390
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,500
You know, I'm dead because
of you, okay?

391
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:00,626
You led us to him.

392
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,626
You and that little shithead
brother of yours.

393
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:07,918
I'm dead and you killed me.

394
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:10,125
Just like you killed
your mother.

395
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,250
That was bad.

396
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,167
I didn't...

397
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,375
But anyway.

398
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,125
I mean,
that's how he always did it.

399
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:19,751
He's kind of cute.

400
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:23,000
Sienna?

401
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:24,876
You all right?

402
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,417
Yeah.

403
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,751
Sienna...

404
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,918
I mean, no amount of medication
is gonna stop me from being here

405
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,250
in front of you.

406
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,751
You killed me.

407
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,876
The least you can do
is pass the rice.

408
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,500
Pass the rice.

409
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,417
Pass the rice!

410
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Pass the rice!

411
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:52,542
Pass the rice!

412
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,417
Pass the rice!

413
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,375
Pass the rice!

414
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,000
Excuse me.

415
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,000
Finish eating, sweetie,

416
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,500
so we can have
our fortune cookies.

417
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:25,375
Whoa!

418
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,250
Okay, wow.

419
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,626
Thanks for knocking, Shaw.

420
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:28,792
Sorry.

421
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,000
Wait!

422
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,000
Um, aren't you going
to introduce us?

423
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:33,751
Wow.

424
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,667
Uh, Shaw, this is,
um, Mia.

425
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:37,876
Hi.

426
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,626
She's a really big fan
of yours.

427
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,125
I'm not a fan, you asshole.

428
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,876
She's obsessed
with the Miles County Clown.

429
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:46,375
Like all that true crime shit.

430
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,000
She thinks
you're a celebrity, dude.

431
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,042
Don't listen to him.

432
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,626
Like, literally, ever.

433
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:52,250
Um, hi.

434
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,375
It is so nice to meet you.

435
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,000
Hi.

436
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,500
I seriously know,
like, everything about you.

437
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,125
Everything online at least,
um, I've been following you

438
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,250
for years.

439
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,751
Dude, you're a legend.

440
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:07,250
You survived Art the Clown,

441
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,000
See? Fucking fangirl.

442
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,667
Eat me.

443
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,500
After you get his autograph.

444
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,000
Um, listen, I actually
had a little bit of a favor

445
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,250
that I wanted to ask you.

446
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,542
You see, my roommate and I,
we have a true crime podcast.

447
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,792
It's called Graven Image.

448
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,250
And our Miles County Massacre
episodes?

449
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,250
They get our biggest hits
by far.

450
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,250
So I was wondering
if maybe you'd be willing

451
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,626
to come on as a guest sometime?

452
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,250
I seriously would be so honored.

453
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,250
I don't really do
things like that.

454
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,125
Jesus, do you really think
he wants to dredge up

455
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,000
the worst experience
of his life?

456
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,375
I mean, the kid's just trying
to move on.

457
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Right, Shaw?

458
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,751
Okay, well, I get that,
but I just--

459
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:46,000
I think a lot of people would
really like to hear from you

460
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,250
after all this time.

461
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,500
Oh my god.

462
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,751
Come on.

463
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,292
I-- I'll think about it.

464
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,125
He'll think about it.

465
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:53,751
Great.

466
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:54,876
Hah.

467
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,167
Shaw, are you coming
to the Beta Christmas bash

468
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,751
tomorrow night?

469
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:57,626
I gotta take this.

470
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:58,500
Oh.

471
00:40:58,626 --> 00:40:59,125
Yeah.

472
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,500
Girl callin'

473
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,000
It was great meeting you,
Mia.

474
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,876
You too.

475
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,751
God, my man needs
to get laid so bad.

476
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Hey.

477
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:11,876
Hey.

478
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,125
How are you?

479
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:14,542
I'm, uh, doing good.

480
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:16,042
Just got out of class.</Font>

481
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,167
</Font>Good.</Font></Font>

482
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,626
I just got to Aunt Jess's.

483
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,375
Yeah, a couple hours ago.

484
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,125
It's really good to hear
your voice.

485
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,792
You know, I-- I miss you.

486
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:31,250
I miss you, too.

487
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,667
Is, uh, everything all right?</Font>

488
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:39,292
</Font>Yeah, yeah.</Font></Font>

489
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm calling because, um...

490
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,751
I'm-- I'm really excited
we're going to be spending

491
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:47,125
Christmas together.

492
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,876
It's been too long.

493
00:41:48,918 --> 00:41:50,250
Yeah, it has.

494
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,167
I'm, uh, really looking
forward to it.

495
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Well, uh,...

496
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,375
...I guess I'll see you
in a couple days?</Font>

497
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,876
</Font>See you soon.</Font></Font>

498
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,250
Love you.

499
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,375
Love you more.

500
00:42:19,918 --> 00:42:21,375
Are you okay?

501
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:23,751
Yeah.

502
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,375
It's, um, just this
new medication I'm on.

503
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,250
It makes me queasy sometimes.

504
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,250
Oh.

505
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,000
I need to be creative.

506
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,626
Wanna be my canvas?

507
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:40,751
All right.

508
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:42,125
Something's happening here.

509
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,417
Can I see already?

510
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,876
Hold your horses.

511
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,292
I mean, you are starting
to look quite enchanted,

512
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:48,751
if I do say so myself.

513
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:51,000
Like a fantasy princess.
All right.

514
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:53,167
We're going to put a little bit
more elven eyeshadow

515
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,500
to go with that magic blush.

516
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:55,292
Close your eyes.

517
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,500
You know,

518
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:58,667
you could be a professional
makeup artist, right?

519
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,375
Why, thank you.

520
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,792
I actually forgot
how much I enjoy this.

521
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:04,751
Eyes open.

522
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:05,500
Great.

523
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:06,876
All right, let's do some lips.

524
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,876
How'd you get those scars?

525
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,918
You and these scars.

526
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,125
I got into a fight.

527
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,626
Did you win?

528
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,417
Yeah, I won.

529
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,667
Chin up.

530
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,876
All right,
gimme one of these.

531
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:30,876
You're all done.

532
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:32,626
You wanna see this mystical
masterpiece?

533
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,751
Yeah.

534
00:45:34,918 --> 00:45:36,125
Wow!

535
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:39,375
It looks amazing.

536
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:42,250
Your face did all the work.

537
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,167
Take a picture!

538
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,667
Can I join the mile high club
in your sleigh?

539
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:52,417
Oh my god!

540
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,876
Oh, ho ho ho.

541
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,125
I'd fuck ya.

542
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:58,292
No, Mrs. Claus would shank me
in my sleep.

543
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,626
- My wife's dead.
- Okay.

544
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:01,000
Wanna come down my chimney?

545
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,167
Oh my god,
come in her chimney, come!

546
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,375
I've got a chimney.

547
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,125
Okay, girls.

548
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,375
I'm a naughty little reindeer.

549
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,542
I wanna do drugs
on your stomach!

550
00:46:10,626 --> 00:46:11,626
Be good.

551
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:12,751
Ho ho ho!

552
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:13,876
Ho ho ho!

553
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,125
Oh, shit.

554
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,292
God damn!

555
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,876
I think I know
what I want for Christmas.

556
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,876
That Santa outfit comes
with some perks, dude.

557
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,250
Girls!

558
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,042
I don't remember
if I told you, but,

559
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,000
so I've been in entertainment
for a long time.

560
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:29,500
I'm Santa now, I was Elvis.

561
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,542
Those girls!

562
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:32,375
Laughlin, 1980s.

563
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,000
Whoo!

564
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,375
Nothing like this.

565
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,250
To Laughlin.

566
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:36,876
Laughlin!

567
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,792
To Laughlin?

568
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:38,792
I'm good.

569
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:41,792
Ow, ow!

570
00:46:42,918 --> 00:46:44,918
You racist piece of shit!

571
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:50,125
Shit.

572
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,000
Get a load of this fucking guy.

573
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:54,125
Friend of yours, Eddie?

574
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,500
That is a fucking first.

575
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:58,375
All right, well,
now hold on now, listen.

576
00:46:58,417 --> 00:46:59,667
I'm wearing the outfit, right?

577
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:00,792
So it's just like Elvis.

578
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,375
He gets the full Santa
experience if he wants it,

579
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,751
all right?

580
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:05,751
Hello.

581
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:06,542
Hello.

582
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:08,542
Hi, hi!

583
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:09,417
You--
Come on over.

584
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,042
Come on over.

585
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:10,667
It's fine.

586
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:11,626
Yeah!

587
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,500
Hi, hi.

588
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:17,167
Yes, yes, yes, that's--
that's me, that's me.

589
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,250
Guilty as charged.

590
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,500
Hey Santa,
it looks like you got a fan.

591
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,417
What's with the outfit, pal?

592
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,876
Yeah, did the circus
come to town?

593
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,918
Hey, buddy.

594
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,751
Watch it.

595
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:28,792
That's the real deal.

596
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,000
That's my--
that's my beard.

597
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,125
If Santa doesn't have
a real beard,

598
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,000
he's not a real Santa Claus.

599
00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:40,042
Hey, fella,
what's in the bag?

600
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:42,626
Oh, he's gonna show us.

601
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:45,417
Hey, what do ya got?

602
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,375
What do ya--

603
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:47,876
Usually I'm the one
who's bringing

604
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,918
the magical sack of toys.

605
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,250
What?

606
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:05,876
Oh, that's good!

607
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,500
Okay. That's enough.

608
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:12,500
All right, now, look,
I'm startin' to like this guy,

609
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:13,542
I really am. Clowny.

610
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,250
Put--
put your little horn away.

611
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,500
Have a seat.

612
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:18,626
And, uh,
Santa'll buy him a drink.

613
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,250
Clowny,
I'm startin' to like you.

614
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:28,250
Here you go.

615
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,626
I hope I gave you
enough marshmallows.

616
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:30,167
Oh.

617
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,042
It's perfect.

618
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:32,751
Thank you.

619
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,292
Some peace and quiet
around here, finally, huh?

620
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,042
You must be exhausted.

621
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:43,751
No, I...

622
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,500
...I feel...

623
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,876
What?

624
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,000
Normal?

625
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,500
Look, I'm not going
to pretend that

626
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:00,876
I know what you're going
through, because I don't.

627
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I-- I can't even begin
to imagine it.

628
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:07,125
But I promise it'll get better.

629
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:11,042
You remind me so much of mom.

630
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,626
Before dad died,

631
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,918
she was the sweetest person.

632
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,250
Could talk to her
about anything.

633
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,500
Yeah, she was.

634
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:26,250
Mouth like a truck driver,
though.

635
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,751
She cursed so much.

636
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,250
So much!

637
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,542
She once called
Sister Rosemary a C-U-N-T

638
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:33,500
in the sixth grade.

639
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:35,626
I don't know
where she came from!

640
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,667
Nobody in our family
talks like that.

641
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,125
I miss her.

642
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,292
I miss her so much.

643
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,667
I know, sweetie.

644
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,000
I know.

645
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,792
I miss her, too.

646
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:00,667
Hey, Santa.

647
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,375
Looks like you got
some competition.

648
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:03,876
It's Clowny Claus!

649
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,125
No.

650
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,000
Hey, you're a natural.

651
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:07,667
You look good.

652
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:08,876
But don't get it dirty.

653
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,000
And remember to give it back.

654
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:12,042
You don't want to get
on Santa's naughty list.

655
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:14,876
Hey, why don't you tell Santa
what you want for Christmas,

656
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,876
little boy?

657
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:17,125
Better hygiene?

658
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,125
All right, come on,
let's have a drink, uh,

659
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,042
for everybody, okay.

660
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:20,626
Come on.

661
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:22,500
Got ID?

662
00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:23,250
Come on.

663
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:24,417
He's obviously old enough.

664
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
All right.

665
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:27,125
You think I'm gonna lose
my license for this guy?

666
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,667
Don't bust the clown's balls.

667
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,125
This is normal to you?

668
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,000
Sorry about this, Clowny.

669
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:34,250
There, see?

670
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,500
He's got it.

671
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:40,751
Maurice Jackson?

672
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:42,375
Eddie, you're killing me.

673
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,626
Can we just celebrate?

674
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:44,375
Come on.

675
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,125
Fuck it.

676
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,125
It's Christmas.

677
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,250
All right,
let's have a drink!

678
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:49,626
To my new friend, huh?

679
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,250
To Maurice Jackson!

680
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:53,667
-Maurice Jackson.
-Cheers!

681
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,626
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

682
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:01,876
What's your problem, pal?

683
00:51:01,918 --> 00:51:03,751
Guy buys you a drink
and you spit it back

684
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:04,751
in his fucking face?

685
00:51:04,876 --> 00:51:05,417
Hey, man.

686
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
That's--
that's wrong.

687
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:09,167
Now look, you see,
you-- you were just rude,

688
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,292
and you shouldn't have
been rude.

689
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,042
Let's go, Clowny.

690
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,167
Get up.

691
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:18,876
No, I'm not ki--

692
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,250
Oh, shit.

693
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,751
What the...

694
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,667
What the fuck are you doing?

695
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:26,500
He peed on him!

696
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,751
Fucking told you!

697
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,250
Are you fucking kidding me?

698
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:32,417
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you sick fuck!

699
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:35,918
I'll fucking kill him!

700
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,375
Hey, come on,
you motherfucker!

701
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,250
Fuck you!

702
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:39,500
Goddammit.

703
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:40,751
Smokey, get his bag!

704
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,042
Son of a bitch!

705
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,542
This is my busy weekend.

706
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:44,292
I know.

707
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,250
What the fuck is in this?

708
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,626
Jesus, fuck!

709
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:49,167
Get that the fuck out of here.

710
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:50,918
What? What? Hey!

711
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,042
You motherfucker!

712
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,626
I'll fucking kill you!
I got it.

713
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:54,876
- Goddammit!
- Want me to call the cops?

714
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:56,125
I don't want you to call
the cops.

715
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:57,542
I want you to call
a fucking dry cleaner.

716
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,042
- Dry cleaner!
- Smokey, get a fucking mop!

717
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,375
I told you, don't let him
the fuck in here.

718
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:02,417
You said he's fuckin' normal!

719
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,417
Sit down, sit down!

720
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,125
Fuckin' 'you told me.'

721
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,542
Have a fucking drink.

722
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,250
Can't take a fucking hint,
can you?

723
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,292
I'm not going to tell you again.

724
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,375
Oh, fuck.

725
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,417
Oh, fuck.

726
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,751
Eddie?

727
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,042
And Smokey?

728
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, god, Smokey!

729
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:31,042
Oh, no, oh, god, oh, god.

730
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:31,626
No!

731
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:32,375
Oh, god.

732
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:33,751
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

733
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:34,626
Sir! No, sir.

734
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:35,626
No, no, no, no, sir.

735
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:36,375
No, no, please.

736
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,375
Please, please.

737
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,626
Let me be the first to apologize
for whatever's happened

738
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:42,542
here tonight.

739
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:43,876
I don't--
I don't know what happened.

740
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:44,751
Here, take it!

741
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,250
Take it, take it, take it!

742
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:47,000
It's yours.

743
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,500
You looked really good in it!

744
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:49,417
Take it all!

745
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,626
You be Santa!

746
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,375
Clowny,
we're in the same business.

747
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,042
It's just me and you, remember?

748
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,250
It's just me and you.

749
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,751
We're in the same business.

750
00:52:57,626 --> 00:52:59,667
We make people happy.

751
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:11,751
Help me, help me!

752
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:13,792
God, help me!

753
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:16,375
Hey, you pay attention to me.

754
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,375
Help me!

755
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,751
That isn't even funny.

756
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:19,792
It's not funny.

757
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:20,375
The fuck?

758
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,417
Come on.

759
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,876
Oh, Clowny, please,
please, Clowny, help me!

760
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:26,751
Please, god!

761
00:53:26,876 --> 00:53:27,876
Oh, god help me!

762
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:28,876
Oh, god.

763
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:30,250
Clowny, come on.

764
00:53:36,626 --> 00:53:38,125
You look good, Clowny.

765
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,542
You look good.

766
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:41,375
Oh, yeah,
that's never looked better.

767
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,375
Look, I'll go now, then.

768
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:45,626
You know, you're--
you're Santa Claus, right?

769
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:47,250
So I can go.

770
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:47,876
Yeah.

771
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,918
Oh, help!

772
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,125
Help me!

773
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,918
Help me!

774
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,125
Clowny!

775
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:03,667
What the hell is that?

776
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:09,042
Oh god, oh god.

777
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,292
Clowny.

778
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,000
Clowny, look at me.

779
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:14,918
Clowny,
I'm not really Santa Claus.

780
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,042
No, no, wait.

781
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,167
Listen to me.

782
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:19,042
I have a name.

783
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,792
I have a real--
No, I have a real name!

784
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:23,626
My-- my name
is Charles Johnson.

785
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:25,667
Clowny, and I have a wife,
a wife!

786
00:54:25,751 --> 00:54:27,250
I have a wife and two kids.

787
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,125
Hey, Clowny.

788
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,626
No, no, no, Clowny, no!

789
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,918
Listen to me,
Clowny I beg you.

790
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,667
Listen, I have four gorgeous
grandchildren.

791
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:38,667
And their names, their names
are Brian and Denise and--

792
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,000
Clowny!

793
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:32,417
Clowny,
it hurts so much, please!

794
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,626
So, how is she?

795
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:50,042
As good as can be expected.

796
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,000
I think Gabbie brought some
life back into her today, right?

797
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,375
It's nice to see her smile
a little bit.

798
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,250
Oh my god, Gabbie.

799
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:00,000
She follows Sienna around like
a brand new puppy.

800
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,167
It's concerning.

801
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,667
Now they're going
Christmas shopping tomorrow.

802
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,042
Just the two of 'em?

803
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,125
Mhm.

804
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,375
Sienna wants to pick up
a gift for Jonathan.

805
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,751
You really think
that's a good idea?

806
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,250
They'll be fine.

807
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,167
Jess...

808
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,876
...did you not see
what happened today?

809
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:24,167
What if that little episode
was just a microcosm

810
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,751
of what's to come?

811
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,918
What if that shit gets worse?

812
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,876
I'm not gonna abandon her.

813
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:30,500
She's healing.

814
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:32,250
It's gonna take time.

815
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,125
She's taking her medication.

816
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,417
All I'm saying is, let's keep
our guard up, all right?

817
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,918
That's all I'm saying.

818
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:45,918
Okay.

819
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:47,626
Merry Christmas!

820
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:48,751
What is your name?

821
00:58:48,876 --> 00:58:50,125
This way please. This way.

822
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,500
All right, sweetie,
look over here.

823
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:52,751
Ready?

824
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,000
Don't go past this point.

825
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:55,042
You'll be in trouble.

826
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,751
Thank you.

827
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:57,667
Next.

828
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,500
All right, buddy,
smile for the camera.

829
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,500
You guys ready to meet Santa?

830
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:03,751
What are you going to ask for?

831
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,167
Makeup?

832
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,042
Yeah.

833
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,250
Are you old enough for makeup?

834
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:09,626
Okay. Thank you.

835
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:10,751
Next.

836
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:17,918
Hey, Gabs.

837
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,500
You think he'll like this?

838
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:20,250
Hmm.

839
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,500
Not sure.

840
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,876
I don't think Jonathan
is really into black anymore.

841
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,000
Jonathan doesn't wear black?

842
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,500
Mr. Death Metal?

843
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,876
I don't think he listens
to that anymore either.

844
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,626
Just a phase, I guess.

845
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:38,292
All right, well, then,
what does he wear now?

846
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,542
I don't know.

847
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,250
Normal clothes?

848
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:44,125
Really narrows it down.

849
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,918
Thanks, Gabs.

850
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,500
Okay, sweetie.

851
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:47,292
You ready?

852
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:50,542
Okay.

853
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:51,250
Thank you.

854
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,500
-Bye, Santa.
-Bye.

855
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,000
At least it's better
than Louisville.

856
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,250
You got a point, Bob.

857
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,626
Let's take a break.

858
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,751
Oh.

859
01:00:00,876 --> 01:00:02,876
Sorry, folks.

860
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,125
Santa's gotta go feed
his reindeer.

861
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,626
You know,
I'm not in charge here.

862
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:10,292
Can we go on a break too?

863
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,542
Sure.

864
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:15,042
This one's nice.

865
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,792
Hmm, not bad.

866
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:17,751
Is it your favorite?

867
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:18,876
Top three.

868
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,667
All right, well,
then you choose.

869
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,125
You know your dad
better than me.

870
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,417
Hey!

871
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:34,792
What are you staring at?

872
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:43,250
Nothing.

873
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:43,876
Come on, you ready?

874
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,500
Let's get going.

875
01:01:44,626 --> 01:01:45,375
You okay?

876
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:46,417
Yeah.

877
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:52,000
</Font>Look, you know my theory
on the subject hasn't changed.</Font>

878
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,125
</Font>Don't even say it.</Font>

879
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,792
</Font>Because you know I'm right.</Font></Font>

880
01:01:54,876 --> 01:01:57,125
Sienna Shaw
is the prime suspect.</Font>

881
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,626
</Font>Stop! That is ludicrous.</Font>

882
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,250
</Font>Look, we could just
look at the facts.</Font></Font>

883
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,500
Do you want to just do that?

884
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:03,876
Okay, she's linked
to every single victim?

885
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,667
Okay?

886
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:06,167
She was at every crime scene?

887
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,042
A history of mental illness
in her family?</Font>

888
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,667
</Font>Irrelevant.</Font>

889
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:11,375
</Font>Abusive father who just
so happened to be obsessed</Font></Font>

890
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,500
with Art the Clown?

891
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:13,626
And there's no body.

892
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:16,000
How about you show me
the dead clown's body?

893
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,000
Dude, there's so many holes
in that story.

894
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,125
Like, how do you not see that?

895
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,751
If Jonathan Shaw
hadn't testified

896
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,042
on his sister's behalf,

897
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,667
she'd probably be serving
a life sentence right now.

898
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:24,876
You shouldn't be saying
that shit.</Font>

899
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,626
You look great.

900
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,250
Your, uh, your scars
are healing up nicely.

901
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,542
Yeah, yours too.

902
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,125
Gabbie thinks I look cool,
apparently.

903
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:54,000
So...

904
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:55,751
...Why'd you want to see me
right now?

905
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,042
I-- I missed you.

906
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,876
I mean, can't a sister see
her little brother?

907
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:09,125
Um, actually,
I was, uh,

908
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,292
I was thinking,

909
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,000
why don't you come over
Aunt Jess's tonight?

910
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,375
I mean,
why wait till Christmas Eve?

911
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,542
You've gotta be done
with classes by now, right?

912
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,500
I can't, I can't tonight.

913
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:21,626
Why not?

914
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,375
There's a party on campus
that I was invited to.

915
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,542
Really?

916
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,375
Oh.

917
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:29,918
That's good.

918
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,751
No. I'm happy.

919
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:33,042
Jonathan Shaw spotted in public!

920
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,375
What is this,
a Christmas miracle?

921
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,417
Dick!

922
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,626
Um, Sienna, this is Cole,
my roommate. Cole.

923
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,375
Oh, wow.

924
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,918
Hey, big sis.

925
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,792
I've, uh, heard a lot about you.

926
01:03:45,876 --> 01:03:47,375
It's nice to finally meet you.

927
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,626
Hi.

928
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:52,125
Well, you've got a cool
baby bro here, and I treat him

929
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,167
like he's my own.

930
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,751
You treat me like shit.

931
01:03:55,876 --> 01:03:57,500
Oh, he jokes.

932
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:58,918
Oh, shit.

933
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,876
Let me get out of here.

934
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:01,292
Oh my God.

935
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,500
Sienna!

936
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:04,542
You're Sienna Shaw!

937
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:07,876
I, I seriously so--
I can't believe I'm sitting here

938
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:09,000
with you guys.

939
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,792
I was literally just telling
your little brother.

940
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:11,751
I'm sorry.

941
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:12,667
I'm probably being
a little weird.

942
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:15,918
I'm just super stoked
to see you.

943
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,167
Mia has been following
our story very closely.

944
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,626
I am a true crime enthusiast,

945
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:24,000
and I've actually been following
your case in particular

946
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:27,167
for years on my podcast,
and no rush or anything,

947
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,125
but I do know the five year
anniversary is coming up

948
01:04:29,167 --> 01:04:31,375
and the fanbase is rabid.

949
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:34,876
Like, we would literally
kill for anything.

950
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,542
I'm thinking, Get Readys
with Me, What I Eat in a Day...

951
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:38,626
Just show us how you're coping.

952
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,000
You know, what you do
on a daily basis,

953
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,542
anything like that.

954
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:42,792
How I'm coping?

955
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:44,292
Yeah.

956
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:47,751
How we're coping?

957
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:54,000
Well, uh, I've been in and out
of a psychiatric hospital

958
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,250
for the past five years.

959
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,667
Oh.

960
01:04:56,751 --> 01:05:00,500
I see images of my dead friends
and relatives on a daily basis,

961
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:03,792
images that wake me up screaming
in the middle of the night.

962
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:06,500
I have hideous scars
all over my body,

963
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,000
and every time I see them,

964
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:11,375
I think of how that sick fuck
who ruined our lives

965
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:12,542
is still out there.

966
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:14,417
And you want to know
how I'm coping with everything?

967
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,876
You guys are all
the same leeches.

968
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,125
Sienna.

969
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:25,751
Can't you act like a human being
for one fucking second?

970
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,626
Sienna, what's wrong with you?

971
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:38,500
I saw him today.

972
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:39,876
Who?

973
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:43,042
Where?

974
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,500
At the mall, with Gabbie.

975
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:47,000
How can you be sure
it was really him?

976
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,626
I'm not, I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

977
01:05:48,751 --> 01:05:51,125
I don't know what's real
or what's in my fucking head.

978
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:53,417
Well,
what'd you see exactly?

979
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,167
He was dressed as Santa Claus.

980
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,626
Santa Claus?

981
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,292
Okay, I know, I know
how that sounds...

982
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:03,626
...but it was him.

983
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,792
I could--
I could feel it.

984
01:06:07,626 --> 01:06:09,125
We both know this isn't over.

985
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,125
You don't know that.

986
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:13,250
I mean, Jesus Christ,
you cut his fucking head off.

987
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,292
Come here.

988
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,042
Hey, what is this?

989
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:20,876
Jonathan!

990
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:23,000
Hey, why are you
shutting me out?

991
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,167
I'm not shutting you out.

992
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,000
You don't believe me?

993
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,292
Why would he come back here?

994
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:30,375
Even if he was alive,
which he isn't.

995
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,250
Wouldn't you want to get as far
away from here as possible,

996
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:33,375
as far away from you?

997
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:35,000
Maybe it's me they want.
Isn't that what you said?

998
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:36,167
Boy genius.

999
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,250
What are you,
Mr. Academic now?

1000
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:39,375
You think you're too good
for your own--

1001
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

1002
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,000
At least I'm fucking trying.

1003
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,167
I'm proud of you.

1004
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,375
We need each other, okay?

1005
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:57,167
I need you.

1006
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:01,000
What we need to do
is move on.

1007
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:02,375
Let it go.

1008
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,375
It's over.

1009
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,667
'We have to destroy
the little girl

1010
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,876
before it's too late, Sienna.

1011
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,417
Destroy her because
she's inhuman.

1012
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,667
A demon.'

1013
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,042
I still have your letters.

1014
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:19,250
You wrote me almost every week
when I first went away.

1015
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,542
Remember that?

1016
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:23,500
All your theories
about demonology, possession.

1017
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:24,125
You became obsessed.

1018
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,500
But you weren't crazy.

1019
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:26,626
You were right!

1020
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,626
I'm not listening to this.

1021
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:29,292
You listen to me!

1022
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:35,250
'Sometimes demons
try to enter our world,

1023
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:37,125
only they can't do it alone.

1024
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,751
They have to choose a vessel,
someone recently deceased

1025
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:42,000
who functions as a bridge
between worlds.

1026
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,000
But not just anyone.

1027
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:46,125
Someone sinister, depraved.

1028
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,292
The worst kind of evil.

1029
01:07:49,876 --> 01:07:51,500
Like a serial killer?'

1030
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:13,500
'If a demon enters this world
in the flesh,

1031
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:15,250
a counterpart must be
appointed to stop it

1032
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,542
from becoming too powerful.

1033
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,792
It's you, Sienna.

1034
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:19,792
As long as you're alive,

1035
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:21,542
they're vulnerable,
and they know it.'

1036
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,042
That's why Daddy created
the sword.

1037
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:26,000
Whoever chose me
was guiding him.

1038
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,626
He was preparing me for this.

1039
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:34,667
It's using Victoria Heyes
as a host now, isn't it?

1040
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,125
That's why she disappeared
that night.

1041
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,500
What do you wanna do?

1042
01:08:51,626 --> 01:08:53,751
What, do we just up
and leave town?

1043
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:57,667
Call the cops, tell Aunt Jess
and Uncle Greg?

1044
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:58,876
No. They'll never believe us.

1045
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,500
Especially me.

1046
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:09,375
I have to go back
to the Terrifier.

1047
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,292
Why?

1048
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,918
It's still buried there,
isn't it?

1049
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,375
And if I'm right,
it might be the only thing

1050
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,876
that can stop them.</Font>

1051

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way

Oh, what fun it is to ride in

Hey, Santa!</Font>

1056

Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh

O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright

What fun it is to ride and
sing a sleighing song tonight</Font>

Sarah, get back over here!

1061
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:27,292
Wow.

1062
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,500
Thanks, Santa.

1063
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,417
Hey, Santa's handing out
presents!

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way

Santa claus is coming along
Riding down this way</Font>

That's not Bill.

1070
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,292
What?

01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:00,918
That's not our Santa Claus.</Font>-

Who is this Santa?

1080
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:25,792
He's scaring my kid.

1081
01:11:25,876 --> 01:11:28,751
Yeah, he's scaring me, too.

1082
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:30,250
What do you think you're doing?

1083
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,918
You can't be here.

1084
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,918
I said, let's go.

1085
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:40,876
Come on.

1086
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,375
Get the kids out of here.

1087
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,125
Sarah!

1088
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,417
What did I say?

1089
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,751
Christ almighty,
what's the uproar, people?

1090
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:49,125
Get the fuck out!

1091
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,667
Don't come back!</Font>

1092
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:54,876
And makes the nations prove</Font>

No!</Font>

Back in line, kids.

1101
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,375
Time for the real Santa.

1102
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:14,751
I wonder what I got.

1103
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:15,375
Corey!

1104
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:40,000
What's that?

1105
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:43,500
Jesus! You scared me.

1106
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:45,250
What are you doing,
snooping around like that?

1107
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,500
Is it for me?

1108
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:50,042
None of your business,
nosy.

1109
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,000
It is, isn't it?

1110
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,125
No, it's not.

1111
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,000
And don't even think about
opening it, all right?

1112
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:56,000
What happened to your hands?

1113
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:57,292
My hands?

1114
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:03,417
I fell, okay?

1115
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,125
I slipped on some ice
and took a ridiculously nasty

1116
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,751
spill in front of, like,
20 college students.

1117
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:08,667
Is that what you wanna hear?

1118
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,751
I wish I saw that.

1119
01:15:11,876 --> 01:15:12,876
You think that's funny?

1120
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,417
Come here!

1121
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,667
No!

1122
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,250
Christmas

1123
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,792
Shady

1124
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:45,125
Save us all
from satan's power

1125
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:48,292
Save us all
from satan's power

1127
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:57,876
Save us all

1128
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,042
Save us all
from satan's power

1129
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:04,125

1130
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:14,000

1131
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,000
Yo, grab that door?

1132
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:19,250
Here we go.

1133
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,167
Thank you.

1134
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,417
That is wicked!

1135
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,667
Kegs here!

1136
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:30,918
Oh.

1137
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,626
Something smells amazing.

1138
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:34,876
You're back late.

1139
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,125
How's your brother?

1140
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,375
Oh, he's good.

1141
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:38,042
Yeah.

1142
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,250
He's going to a campus
Christmas party tonight.

1143
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,125
Jonathan's going
to a Christmas party?

1144
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,792
Oh!

1145
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:46,250
Nice to hear
he's socializing.

1146
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:47,667
Yeah.

1147
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,792
God, these are so freaking cute,
Aunt Jess.

1148
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:52,500
Those are my favorite.

1149
01:16:52,626 --> 01:16:53,751
Do you want some?

1150
01:16:54,626 --> 01:16:56,292
No, thanks.

1151
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:59,250
Oh, sorry, I forgot you don't
like cereal anymore.

1152
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:00,500
Who doesn't like cereal?

1153
01:17:00,626 --> 01:17:01,375
Sienna.

1154
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,125
What? Sienna,
you don't like cereal?

1155
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:08,042
I mean, I can understand tofu
or Lima beans,

1156
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:08,918
but cereal's the best.

1157
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,375
I know, honey. Chill.

1158
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,167
Yeah, I just try to stay away
from too much sugar.

1159
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,751
You got more willpower than me.

1160
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,876
Hey Gabs, what do you say
we go upstairs

1161
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,042
and play some board games?

1162
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,375
Let's go.

1163
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Yeah.

1164
01:17:22,626 --> 01:17:24,500
I think we need some
Christmas tree sprinkles.

1165
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:26,250
You need
Christmas tree sprinkles.

1166
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:27,375
What are you in the mood for?

1167
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,542
I have a ton.

1168
01:17:28,626 --> 01:17:32,042
Pictionary,
Guess Who, Monopoly.

1169
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,417
I like Monopoly.

1170
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,042
Takes forever, though.

1171
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:41,167
I never told you
I don't like cereal.

1172
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:44,125
What?

1173
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,375
How'd you know
I don't like cereal?

1174
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,918
Gabbie?

1175
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,375
Did you read my journal?

1176
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,751
I'm sorry.

1177
01:17:56,876 --> 01:17:58,626
Please don't be mad at me.

1178
01:18:01,751 --> 01:18:02,500
Where is it?

1179
01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:03,918
I put it back in your room.

1180
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,417
How much of it did you read?

1181
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:08,250
Tell me.

1182
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,751
All of it?

1183
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:11,626
Jesus, Gabbie.

1184
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:15,000
You-- you promised me.

1185
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

1186
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:18,042
I wanted to know
what happened to you.

1187
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,626
Is it true?

1188
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:24,542
All that stuff about
the clown and Uncle Michael?

1189
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,167
You saw him today,
didn't you?

1190
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:28,500
At the mall.

1191
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,042
That's why you freaked out.

1192
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,626
Gabbie, I'm sick.

1193
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:37,500
I see things that aren't there.

1194
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:42,500
And sometimes I write about it
in my journal and talk about it

1195
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:44,167
with people who can help me.

1196
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:47,250
So you didn't really chop off
the clown's head

1197
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,250
with the magical sword?

1198
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,000
No.

1199
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,500
Damn,
that would've been so cool.

1200
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,876
Gabs.

1201
01:19:04,918 --> 01:19:08,125
You have to promise me
you're not gonna tell anyone

1202
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:10,125
what you read
in my journal, okay?

1203
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,500
Not your parents,
not your friends at school?

1204
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:13,500
No one.

1205
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:14,792
Promise me.

1206
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,125
I promise.

1207
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,667
Pinky swear.

1208
01:19:23,876 --> 01:19:25,250
Okay.

1209
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:31,125
Let's play Pictionary
so I can kick your ass.

1210
01:19:37,626 --> 01:19:38,918
You're probably
still passed out.

1211
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,626
Uh, look, I just wanted
to call and see if...

1212
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:43,417
...you're okay, man?

1213
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,626
Um...

1214
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:45,751
Yeah.

1215
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:47,375
Gimme a call back whenever
you get this, but, uh,

1216
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,500
if you can't reach me,
I'll be at the Beta bash, so...

1217
01:19:50,626 --> 01:19:51,918
Peace.

1218
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:55,918
You don't think I was that
insensitive before, do you?

1219
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,876
Uh, yes.

1220
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,542
Yes, I do actually.

1221
01:19:59,626 --> 01:20:01,250
Okay, I get
it's like a touchy subject

1222
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,500
and all, but come on,
it didn't happen yesterday.

1223
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:04,792
It happened five years ago.

1224
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:06,167
Yeah, I don't think
that's something

1225
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,792
you ever really get over.

1226
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:10,375
Well, she still didn't mean
to snap at me the way she did.

1227
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:13,167
Besides, talking it out
is good therapy.

1228
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,375
I was basically doing
her a favor.

1229
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:17,751
Wow, how selfless of you.

1230
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,292
Well, what about Jonathan?

1231
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,626
Do you think he'd still be
willing to do it?

1232
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:26,000
I don't know, Mia.

1233
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,542
Cole,
I want that interview.

1234
01:20:29,626 --> 01:20:30,751
I mean, sitting across
from someone

1235
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,292
who actually encountered
Art the Clown?

1236
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:36,167
The most famous serial killer
since Jack the Ripper.

1237
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,876
It's historic.

1238
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:38,876
'Encountered.'

1239
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,626
That's putting it mildly,
wouldn't you say?

1240
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:43,292
The kid was almost butchered.

1241
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:45,375
You know what I mean.

1242
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,000
I want to know
what it's like to be

1243
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:50,751
in the presence
of that kind of evil.

1244
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:53,500
What goes through
your brain

1245
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,250
when he's close enough to you
that you feel his breath

1246
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,000
on your body?

1247
01:20:58,042 --> 01:20:59,792
What does he smell like?

1248
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,542
When you look into his eyes.

1249
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:03,250
What do you see?

1250
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,000
Is there a soul or...

1251
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,876
'His eyes!'

1252
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:12,000
You sound like
you want to fuck him.

1253
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:13,375
I don't want to fuck him.

1254
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:18,250
I mean,
you're friendly with Jonathan.

1255
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:20,042
You said he looks
up to you, right?

1256
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,042
Maybe you can convince him
for me,

1257
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:23,125
Mia...

1258
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:25,292
Come on.

1259
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,626
Do it for me.

1260
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:29,042
Please?

1261
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,626
I'll be nice,
I promise.

1262
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:33,626
Mhm.

1263
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:36,375
All I need is 20 minutes,
tops.

1264
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,042
I'll make it worth your while.

1265
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:53,042
Oh, wow.

1266
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,250
You are very persuasive.

1267
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,876
I'll see what I can do.

1268
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:05,250
Okay, so remind me
how to play this again.

1269
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,250
It's been a while.

1270
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:06,918
Wait.

1271
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,042
We need more players.

1272
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,792
Dad, come on.</Font>

1276

Again, five people have been
declared dead at this time

1277
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:21,375
and six
are in critical condition.

1278
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,751
The explosion happened
around 5pm this afternoon

1279
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:26,751
at the Centerville Mall,
as the children gathered around

1280
01:22:26,792 --> 01:22:28,500
the holiday center display.

1281
01:22:28,626 --> 01:22:30,751
No suspects are in custody
at this time,

1282
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:33,876
as the investigation
is still underway.

1283
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,751
Close?

1284
01:22:34,876 --> 01:22:36,876
I was pretty damn close!

1285
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,751
Too close for my liking.</Font>

1286
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:39,918
Was it a terrorist attack?

1287
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I don't know, baby.</Font>

1288
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,375
</Font>Anyway, here's what I saw.</Font></Font>

1289
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:44,000
There was this guy, and he
was dressed as Santa Claus,

1290
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,918
and he was handing out
presents to kids.

1291
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,751
Every little kid that was there.

1292
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,792
I heard a commotion,
and then I saw security

1293
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:50,667
leading the guy out.

1294
01:22:50,751 --> 01:22:51,626
And then, bam!

1295
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:53,751
There was an explosion
right there.

1296
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:54,751
Holy shit.</Font>

1297
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:58,125
He's here, he's here.

1298
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,125
It's not safe.

1299
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,042
It's not safe.

1300
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:04,876
It's not safe.

1301
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,876
It's not safe.

1302
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:07,042
Sienna,
what are you talking about?

1303
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,167
The Miles County Clown.

1304
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,375
I saw-- I saw him today.

1305
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,000
Listen to me.

1306
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,042
No, I saw him today.

1307
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,751
- All right.
- Okay, I saw him.

1308
01:23:14,876 --> 01:23:16,042
And I wasn't gonna say
anything

1309
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,250
because I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

1310
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,000
Okay.

1311
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,000
And he's gonna come for us.

1312
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,417
-No, honey. No.
-He's gonna come.

1313
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,667
All right.

1314
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,417
We have to get-- As long as
I'm here, we're in danger.

1315
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,542
Okay? We're in danger.

1316
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,417
We have to get as far away
from here as possible.

1317
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,000
There's no Miles County Clown,
Sienna.

1318
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:30,375
No, it was him, okay?

1319
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,542
I saw him.

1320
01:23:31,626 --> 01:23:32,375
- Nobody's coming for--
- Listen to me.

1321
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,042
Stop it!

1322
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:34,000
You are scaring Gabbie.

1323
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:34,542
Stop it!

1324
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:35,417
Jonathan!

1325
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,375
Jonathan!
We have to call Jonathan.

1326
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:37,542
I will call Jonathan.

1327
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:39,792
If they know-- Jonathan,
then we have to call Jonathan,

1328
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,125
right now.

1329
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,292
Hey, Uncle Greg.

1330
01:23:58,375 --> 01:23:59,417
Jonathan.

1331
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,375
Dude, your sister
is freaking out over here, man.

1332
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,918
She saw something on the news,

1333
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,500
and she's adamant
about getting you over here

1334
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:07,125
as soon as possible.

1335
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:10,000
She thinks you're in danger.

1336
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,667
What'd she see?

1337
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:18,626
She saw the news, man,
about the explosion.

1338
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:21,250
Look, I think a few people
were killed, and now she's--

1339
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:22,000
Look, dude. It's bad.

1340
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:23,500
I need to talk to him, okay?

1341
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:24,167
Sienna!

1342
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,500
Jonathan.

1343
01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:27,500
Oh! It's happening,
it's happening, okay?

1344
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:29,542
You need to let Uncle Greg
come and get you right now.

1345
01:24:29,626 --> 01:24:30,542
You're not safe.

1346
01:24:30,626 --> 01:24:31,375
You're not safe.

1347
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,292
Okay, I'll come over.

1348
01:24:37,042 --> 01:24:38,542
Did you get it?

1349
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:43,000
Yeah, I got it.

1350
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:46,000
See you soon.

1351
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,042
Okay.

1352
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:00,751
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

1353
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:02,125
Good.

1354
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,667
You were right.

1355
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,876
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

1356
01:25:13,918 --> 01:25:15,876
Be careful.

1357
01:25:15,918 --> 01:25:17,667
Call me if anything.

1358
01:25:21,876 --> 01:25:24,000
Hey, sweetie.

1359
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:25,000
You okay?

1360
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,500
Where's Sienna?

1361
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,751
She's sleeping.

1362
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,751
She's gonna go back
to the hospital, isn't she?

1363
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:40,500
I don't know, baby.

1364
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,417
I don't want her to.

1365
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,125
But if she's not well,
we gotta do what's best for her.

1366
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,125
What if she's right?

1367
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,876
What if the Miles County Clown
is back?

1368
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:53,250
He's not, Gabs.

1369
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:54,751
You're safe.

1370
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:55,792
Sienna's just scared.

1371
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:59,042
Nothing's going to happen
to any of us, okay?

1372
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,792
Just get some rest.

1373
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:02,667
Jonathan and Daddy
will be back soon.

1374
01:26:03,876 --> 01:26:05,042
Okay.

1375
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:07,876
I love you.

1376
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,125
Love you too, mom.

1377
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,542
Help!

1378
01:28:57,626 --> 01:28:58,876
Help us!

1379
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:03,918
Oh, Mia, no, Mia!

1380
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,375
Mia!

1381
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:31,125
No!

1382
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:10,876
Hey, Uncle Greg.

1383
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,667
Jonathan.

1384
01:32:11,751 --> 01:32:13,250
I'm here.

1385
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:15,667
Where? I don't see you.

1386
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:16,792
I'm parked right
where you told me.

1387
01:32:16,876 --> 01:32:18,500
I'm in front of your dorm.

1388
01:32:20,751 --> 01:32:23,125
Jonathan,
can you hear me?

1389
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,751
</Font>I'll be right there.</Font></Font>

1390
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:38,792
Sisi, wait a minute.

1391
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:42,500
I do have something for you.

1392
01:32:49,626 --> 01:32:51,125
Ta-da!

1393
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:53,125
You drew it!

1394
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,626
I knew you would!

1395
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:58,292
Yeah, I just-- I didn't think
it was really ready,

1396
01:32:58,375 --> 01:32:59,751
but, um...

1397
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,792
...you like her?

1398
01:33:02,876 --> 01:33:04,542
I love her.

1399
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:07,125
She's beautiful.

1400
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,667
Is she an angel?

1401
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,667
Not just an angel.

1402
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:13,792
She's an angel warrior.

1403
01:33:14,542 --> 01:33:16,542
You see that fire sword?

1404
01:33:16,626 --> 01:33:18,500
It has special powers.

1405
01:33:18,542 --> 01:33:21,792
She can defeat any bad guy
with that sword,

1406
01:33:21,876 --> 01:33:23,542
and he can never hurt her.

1407
01:33:23,626 --> 01:33:25,042
Wow.

1408
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,000
Can she defeat Blaster Man?

1409
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,250
Oh, yeah.

1410
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:30,125
Ten Blaster Men.

1411
01:33:32,042 --> 01:33:33,918
So cool.

1412
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,626
Well,
now you get to name her.

1413
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:39,125
I can name her?

1414
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,626
Of course you can.

1415
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:42,250
It's your character,
isn't it?

1416
01:33:44,042 --> 01:33:45,918
Thanks, Dad.

1417
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,167
You're very welcome,
sweetheart.

1418
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,500
Dad?

1419
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:04,250
Daddy?

1420
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:09,626
Go!

1421
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:11,125
Daddy!

1422
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,876
Let go.

1423
01:34:28,626 --> 01:34:30,542
What's that?

1424
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:33,876
Sisi,
I need you to listen to me.

1425
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,626
Look.
Look at me, look at me.

1426
01:34:37,876 --> 01:34:39,918
I am always with you.

1427
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,125
We have got to put
a stop to this before

1428
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,125
it goes too far, Jess.

1429
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:34,042
What do you suggest we do?

1430
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,000
I think we should call
the doctor immediately.

1431
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,250
That's what we should do.

1432
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:38,375
I'm not doing that.

1433
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,500
It's obvious she's unstable.

1434
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:42,167
She's just confused.

1435
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,375
Confused my ass.

1436
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,375
Come on.

1437
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,417
There's no telling
what she's liable to do.

1438
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm not sending her back
to that place on Christmas Eve.

1439
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,876
Listen to me.

1440
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,667
She is a danger right now.

1441
01:35:52,751 --> 01:35:56,626
Not only to herself,
but to us, to our family.

1442
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,000
We have to think about Gabbie.

1443
01:35:58,042 --> 01:35:59,375
Shh!

1444
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,375
Keep your voice down.

1445
01:36:01,417 --> 01:36:02,626
I don't want Sienna to hear us.

1446
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:05,125
Oh, I don't give a fuck
if she hears us or not.

1447
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,751
As a matter of fact,
you know what I think

1448
01:36:06,792 --> 01:36:08,292
we should do to Sienna?

1449
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:12,167
I think we should go upstairs
and smother her in her sleep.

1450
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,042
Then we'd be free.

1451
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:17,000
Free from her bullshit.

1452
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,667
Free...

1453
01:36:18,751 --> 01:36:19,500
Free...

1454
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:20,626
Free...

1455
01:36:21,626 --> 01:36:25,250
Free, free, free, free, free...

1456
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:28,250
Free!

1457
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:29,292
Crazy lady!

1458
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:30,375
Crazy lady!

1459
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,250
Crazy lady!

1460
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:32,751
Crazy lady!

1461
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:34,667
Crazy lady!

1462
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:36,792
Crazy lady!

1463
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:41,250
Crazy lady!

1464
01:36:41,292 --> 01:36:42,876
You're a danger to yourself
and everyone else

1465
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:44,250
in this fucking house.

1466
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,375
Crazy lady!

1467
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:48,876
Crazy! Crazy!

1468
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,500
Gabbie!

1469
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:13,292
Cheese, bitch.

1470
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,042
Cheese.

1471
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,000
To Mommy.

1472
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:55,250
Love, Gabbie.

1473
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:29,918
Try it on, Mommy.

1474
01:39:31,918 --> 01:39:33,876
Aww, it looks good on you,
Mommy.

1475
01:39:33,918 --> 01:39:35,042
Hah!

1476
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:48,167
If you scream, I'm gonna rip
your fucking tongue out.

1477
01:39:56,876 --> 01:39:58,751
Where's my daughter?

1478
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:00,626
Oh, what did you do
to my daughter?

1479
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,250
I thought you'd never ask.

1480
01:40:25,626 --> 01:40:28,167
Merry Christmas, Mommy.

1481
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:34,626
Hi, Gabbie!

1482
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,000
No!

1483
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,876
Hi, Mommy!

1484
01:40:41,918 --> 01:40:43,375
We love you.

1485
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:44,667
We miss you.

1486
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,250
That's not my daughter.

1487
01:40:50,292 --> 01:40:51,667
That's not my daughter.

1488
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:53,125
But it is!

1489
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,292
Can't recognize
your own flesh and blood?

1490
01:41:04,167 --> 01:41:08,042
I gave you a present,
Mommy.

1491
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:10,792
And now I want you
to give me one.

1492
01:41:11,626 --> 01:41:12,751
Fuck you!

1493
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:41,375
No, no!

1494
01:41:44,125 --> 01:41:45,918
I love you, Sienna.

1495
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:51,292
Kill them both.

1496
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:53,250
Make them suffer.

1497
01:41:55,876 --> 01:41:57,751
You first.

1498
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:02,375
No, no!

1499
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:22,667
No, no!

1500
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:25,667
Stop!

1501
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,500
No!

1502
01:42:40,292 --> 01:42:41,626
Stop!

1503
01:43:41,626 --> 01:43:42,417
You're no savior.

1504
01:44:22,292 --> 01:44:25,500
I'm gonna take
everything you love.

1505
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:31,375
Then I'm gonna invade that
pretty pink flesh of yours.

1506
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,375
And destroy you
from the inside out,

1507
01:44:33,417 --> 01:44:35,751
just like I did this bitch.

1508
01:44:36,792 --> 01:44:40,375
But first,
I have a confession to make.

1509
01:44:45,876 --> 01:44:48,000
That's not Gabbie.

1510
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:51,751
Gabbie!

1511
01:44:51,876 --> 01:44:52,626
Gabbie!

1512
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:53,417
Gabbie!

1513
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,417
Let me go!

1514
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:57,751
Gabbie!

1515
01:45:09,751 --> 01:45:12,876
Please,
just let her go.

1516
01:45:12,918 --> 01:45:16,000
You can have me,
you can have me.

1517
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:19,751
I already have you.

1518
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:21,667
Gabby!

1519
01:45:21,751 --> 01:45:24,250
I'll fucking kill you!

1520
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:25,667
Stop!

1521
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You cruel fuck,
she's just a baby,

1522
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:31,000
leave her alone!

1523
01:45:31,918 --> 01:45:33,751
Stop.

1524

</Font>Sienna.</Font></Font>

1525
01:46:02,626 --> 01:46:05,500
It's all your fault.</Font>

1526
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,250
I told you that wasn't Gabbie.</Font>

1527
01:46:10,375 --> 01:46:12,000
See you soon.

1528
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:13,542
Love you.</Font>

1529
01:46:13,626 --> 01:46:15,000
Jonathan!

1530
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,250
No, no!

1531
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:18,542
No!

1532
01:46:18,626 --> 01:46:20,042
You fucking bitch!

1533
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,500
No!

1534
01:46:24,876 --> 01:46:26,417
That's it!

1535
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,167
Come on!

1536
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:30,876
Kill me! Kill me!

1537
01:46:30,918 --> 01:46:32,250
No!

1538
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:34,667
Everything you love is gone.

1539
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:37,667
There is no hope,
there is no God.

1540
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:39,751
Just let go!

1541
01:46:39,876 --> 01:46:41,375
So you can let me in!

1542
01:46:46,876 --> 01:46:48,751
Sienna!

1543
01:46:48,876 --> 01:46:49,667
Sienna!

1544
01:46:49,751 --> 01:46:50,918
Let her go!

1545
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,918
Sienna!

1546
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,500
Oh, you are strong,
aren't you?

1547
01:47:21,542 --> 01:47:23,500
Now I know why they chose you.

1548
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:27,500
You really love that one,
don't you?

1549
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:30,375
She's fighting for you,
Gabby.

1550
01:47:30,417 --> 01:47:32,626
You're all she's got left.

1551
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:38,375
And you're the only thing
that's keeping her

1552
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:41,626
from letting me in.

1553
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:44,500
Gabby! No!

1554
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:45,125
No!

1555
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:47,042
Don't fucking touch her!

1556
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:48,542
No!

1557
01:47:48,626 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm sorry you didn't get
to open my present.

1558
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,417
That's not fair.

1559
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,042
Which one is yours, sweetie?

1560
01:47:58,626 --> 01:47:59,751
I said which one?

1561
01:47:59,876 --> 01:48:02,500
The one at the back
with the angels.

1562
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,125
The angels, of course.

1563
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,792
Did you wrap this yourself?

1564
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:34,375
Shitty job.

1565
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,667
Do you want to know
what Gabbie got you

1566
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:41,250
for Christmas?

1567
01:48:43,042 --> 01:48:44,542
Yes.

1568
01:48:45,042 --> 01:48:47,626
Do you want to open it
yourself?

1569
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,000
Yes.

1570
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:52,375
So do it.

1571
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,250
No!

1572
01:49:23,042 --> 01:49:24,751
Enough!

1573
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:35,125
You said you wanted to open it.

1574
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,375
Stop it, stop it!

1575
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,626
Let her go!

1576
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:44,667
Open it!

1577
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:02,500
We're waiting.

1578
01:50:06,876 --> 01:50:07,876
Stop it!

1579
01:50:07,918 --> 01:50:08,417
Let her go!

1580
01:50:29,292 --> 01:50:31,417
Hope you like it.

1581
01:50:38,751 --> 01:50:40,375
Best gift ever.

1582
01:51:04,542 --> 01:51:06,125
Tell me how this tastes.

1583
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:31,375
Oh, Gabs!

1584
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,626
Oh, God.

1585
01:51:32,751 --> 01:51:33,792
Oh, God.

1586
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,500
How did you know?

1587
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:40,125
I opened it.

1588
01:51:40,167 --> 01:51:42,000
I'm a snoop, remember?

1589
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,417
Yeah.

1590
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:47,125
Get down!

1591
01:52:20,876 --> 01:52:22,167
Gabbie!

1592
01:52:42,918 --> 01:52:44,626
Come on, fucker!

1593
01:53:24,918 --> 01:53:26,918
Mommy!

1594
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:29,375
Mommy.

1595
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:31,250
Mom!

1596
01:53:31,375 --> 01:53:33,542
Please!

1597
01:53:33,626 --> 01:53:35,000
Wake up!

1598
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:41,292
Sienna!

1599
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:43,125
Gabbie!

1600
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:52,751
Sienna, I'm slipping!

1601
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,751
Gabbie!

1602
01:56:01,876 --> 01:56:03,751
Reach up, Gabbie!

1603
01:56:03,792 --> 01:56:05,500
Hold on!

1604
01:56:05,626 --> 01:56:07,626
Sienna,
I can't, I can't!

1605
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:14,000
Grab on!

1606
01:56:14,125 --> 01:56:15,167
Sienna, I can't!

1607
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:17,125
Yes you can, baby,
reach out!

1608
01:56:17,167 --> 01:56:18,292
Come on!

1609
01:56:19,918 --> 01:56:21,417
Grab it!

1610
01:56:25,167 --> 01:56:26,626
Come on, baby, work with me!

1611
01:56:26,751 --> 01:56:27,667
Come on.

1612
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:29,125
Reach for it.

1613
01:56:31,626 --> 01:56:32,500
Hold, baby.

1614
01:56:32,542 --> 01:56:33,751
Pull up!

1615
01:56:33,792 --> 01:56:35,125
Sienna, I'm slipping!

1616
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:37,500
Oh, God, help!

1617
01:56:37,542 --> 01:56:38,250
Sienna!

1618
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,751
I love you.

1619
01:56:46,417 --> 01:56:48,876
Sienna!

1620
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Gabbie!

1621
01:56:58,375 --> 01:57:00,626
Gabbie!

1622
01:58:26,792 --> 01:58:28,542
Gabbie.

1623
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:35,375
I'll find you.

Round yon virgin--</Font>

1627
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,042
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you reading a book?

1628
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,751
Just tell me
to shut up next time.

1629
01:59:15,876 --> 01:59:16,417
Oh, no.

1630
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:17,626
It's okay.

1631
01:59:17,751 --> 01:59:19,417
This book is actually
a lot creepier

1632
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,000
than I anticipated.

1633
01:59:21,042 --> 01:59:22,000
Horror?

1634
01:59:22,042 --> 01:59:23,167
Yeah.

1635
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,876
I don't, uh...

1636
01:59:24,918 --> 01:59:27,792
I don't get
into all that blood and gore.

1637
01:59:27,876 --> 01:59:29,500
I'm more of a rom-com guy.

1638
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:32,167
Frankenstein.

1639
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,125
That's a good movie.

1640
01:59:33,167 --> 01:59:34,751
A classic.

1641
02:00:27,626 --> 02:00:29,167
You ok hun?

1642
02:00:42,918 --> 02:00:45,375
It's a Terrifier Christmas

1643
02:00:45,417 --> 02:00:48,125
Let the horror
fill your heart

1644
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,667
Do you hear footsteps,
that's not Santa

1645
02:00:50,751 --> 02:00:53,542
It's a jolly clown named Art

1646
02:00:53,626 --> 02:00:56,125
He is a Miles County legend

1647
02:00:56,167 --> 02:00:58,876
With a smile that brings
on chill

1648
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,250
On a journey
to outdo himself

1649
02:01:01,375 --> 02:01:04,000
Let's talk his latest kill

1650
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:09,375
We saw your gleaming eyes

1651
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:12,125
He'll kill the flesh right
off your bones

1652
02:01:12,167 --> 02:01:14,876
And shock with
a silent laugh

1653
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,876
It's a Terrifier Christmas

1654
02:01:20,751 --> 02:01:24,500
Tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta
