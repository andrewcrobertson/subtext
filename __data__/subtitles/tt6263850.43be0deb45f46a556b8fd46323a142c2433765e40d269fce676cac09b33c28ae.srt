00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,094
That was weird.

43
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:15,679
I'm much calmer now.

But, no. No, no, no.

57
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:57,929
You had to get
all noble and die for real.

58
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,723
Goddamn it!

59
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,518
I could really use your help right now.

60
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:15,405
Wait!

61
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,325
I'm warning you, I'm not alone.

62
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,993
Wade Winston Wilson,

63
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,913
you are under arrest by
the Time Variance Authority...

64
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,164
Oof.

65
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,208
- ...for too many crimes to list.
- Come out...

66
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,502
...and we'll extend you the courtesy

67
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,170
- of taking you in one piece.
- Death by day-player.

68
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,671
Last chance.

69
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,006
Throw out your weapons

70
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,925
and come out peacefully.

71
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,802
I'm not gonna
give you my weapons,

72
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,012

73
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,891

{\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.

144
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,317
{\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.

145
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,778
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

146
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:26,740
I... I firmly believe

147
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,951
that my services could be of
great use to your organization.

148
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,119
Now, I know

149
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,496
I was caught smashturbating
in the lobby of Stark Tower,

150
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,956
- but I can assure you that--
- Smashturbating?

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,291
I'm sorry, what... what was that?

152
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:40,754
No, I'm sorry. That... That's when
you get those toy Hulk hands, right?

153
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,131
And then you just,
you look down, and you just...

154
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,092
you brace yourself,
and you ravage the midsection.

155
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,094
- Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.
- I get it. Okay, thank you.

156
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,013
- The picture's painted.
- You get the gist.

157
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,349
Uh, what exactly brings you here today?

158
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,226
Why am I... Wow. Okay. Uh...

159
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,270
I... I care.

160
00:07:57,354 --> 00:08:00,106
I know I turn everything
into a joke, but I...

161
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:04,819
I care, and I wanna use that feeling...

162
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:07,614
for something important.

163
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,491
I... I wanna matter.

164
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,120
I need to show my girl that I matter.

165
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,498
And...

166
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,292
You know, I feel like I'm wasting
the good stuff here.

167
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,669
Is the man not gonna be joining us?

168
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,836
- The man?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,963
I should save this if he's gonna...

170
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,007
Uh, as far as you're concerned
right now, I'm the man.

171
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,759
- No.
- The man is me.

172
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,679
I am the man in this circumstance.

173
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:31,971
- Mm.
- He doesn't do

174
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,473
this kind of thing anymore.

175
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,557
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

176
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,059
- Meetings.
- Entry-level meetings.

177
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:37,143
Entry-level?

178
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,229
Aren't you the chauffeur...

179
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,314
- maybe?
- I... Common misconception.

180
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:42,857
- Okay.
- I did begin my career

181
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,526
as Mr. Stark's driver.

182
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,610
- Okay.
- Quickly pivoted to...

183
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:47,362
- Chauffeur.
- ...the Head of Security.

184
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,280
The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.

185
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:52,325
And why I am vetting your résumé.

186
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,577
You seem to have left out
whether or not you had

187
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,788
any experience as a member of a team.

188
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,707
Could you maybe add
a little bit of perspective there?

189
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,959
Oh. No, yes, of course.
I was Special Forces...

190
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,127
- Okay.
- ...but I was...

191
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,628
Mainly, I was team leader...

192
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,004
founder, really, of X-Force.

193
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,965
Sadly, they... they all
perished in action though.

194
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,758
Oh. How exactly did that happen?

195
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,552
Well, the police say gravity, but if...

196
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,137
Just between us, they didn't test well

197
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,555
- in the focus group.
- I see.

198
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,140
- Particularly Cable.
- X-Force.

199
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,392
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look, I can see this isn't going well.

200
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,727
Please stop writing. Look, I... I...

201
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,603
I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,107
I wanna be an Avenger.

203
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,402
Why do you wanna be an Avenger?

204
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,905
Look around you. I mean, they're the...
they're the best of the best.

205
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,991
And... And what they do matters.

206
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,367
I need to be an Avenger.

207
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,954
Sir, my girl has kinda had it
with my shtick,

208
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,748
and I... if I don't, you know,

209
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,167
turn things around and
do something with my "gifts,"

210
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,877
I don't think it's gonna
really work out for me,

211
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,211
and I wouldn't blame her.

212
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:50,717
Avengers are a very unique group
of superheroes

213
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,885
that stand for something

214
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,846
more than just fighting
and wearing costumes.

215
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,849
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

216
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,225
- They--
- I'm sorry. "Us"?

217
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,019
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

218
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:02,854
Avengers-adjacent, technically.

219
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,439
Oh, wow. What's your superpower?

220
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,066
Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.

221
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,359
That was cruel.

222
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,737
I lash out when I'm nervous.
Won't happen again.

223
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,197
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

224
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,698
You just said moments ago

225
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,950
that you wanted to be an Avenger because

226
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:17,577
you need it.

227
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:19,329
Yes, sir, I do.

228
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,955
But the Avengers don't do the job

229
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,540
because they need it.

230
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,417
They do the job
because people need them.

231
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,170
Do you see the distinction?

232
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,298
Yes, sir.

233
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,801
Please, Mr. Hogan.

234
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:36,679
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
like an annoying one-trick pony.

235
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,099
All right.

236
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,061
Oh, my God, you're standing.

237
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,313
- Yeah, now's the time that we stand.
- Damn it.

238
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,731
Now, the problem might be that

239
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,359
you're reaching a little...
little too high.

240
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,861
Aim for the middle,
and you'll never miss.

241
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,322
Right? I think you got a good heart.
I believe what you're saying.

242
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,574
But not everybody's
the world-saving type.

243
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:58,243
I'm not, and I'm happy.

244
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,662
Right? I found my place.

245
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,622
Find your place.

246
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,208
All right? Get back out there.

247
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,460
- We'll keep an eye on you.
- Okay.

248
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:08,795
Good luck.

249
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,298
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,926
Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.

251
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,427
Rejection makes me hungy.

252
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:18,972
- No, no. Please.
- No?

253
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,598
- Yeah, no, no, no.
- Okay.

254
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:21,766
Okay, thank you.

255
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,936
<i>You know what they say.</i>

256
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:26,896
<i>When one door closes,</i>

257
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,941
<i>your locker at work opens.</i>

258
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,662
Now let's go sell some certified
pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...

259
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:48,209
Technically, the...
the Carnival's not a minivan.

260
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,336
It's an MPV.

261
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,047
So how does the Kia compare
to the Honda Odyssey?

262
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,799
The Odyssey? That's a great question.

263
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,885
Um, it doesn't fucking suck.

264
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,345
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

265
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,222
I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't...
I don't have kids.

266
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,725
Not that I haven't dreamt of that,

267
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,852
but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

268
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,732
{\an8}- You'll get 'em next time, pal.
- Yeah.

269
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,234
And look,
you can always go back to superhero-ing.

270
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,403
I mean, I know I'd like
to see you back in the suit.

271
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,406
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

272
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:21,451
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to saddle up again.

273
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,370
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that doing in there?

274
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:25,538
I'm done.

275
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,374
I'm done.

276
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,252
And I'm fine with being done.

277
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,046
Look, is sales the best match?

278
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,213
Probably not.

279
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:37,467
Is this the life that I always
imagined for myself? Fuck no.

280
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,304
But this is the right fit
for me, Sugar Bear, it is.

281
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,764
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

282
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,849
I'm just saying, once a month,

283
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,976
we could go on a little mission.

284
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,771
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

285
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,606
After all, we're Deadpool.

286
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:54,150
Please stop saying that.
We're not Deadpool.

287
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,652
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

288
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,322
Well, if you're gonna have
a midlife crisis, go big.

289
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,366
A few years ago, a friend of mine

290
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,660
got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain

291
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,788
that goes down and attaches
to his Van Johnson.

292
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,252
Are... Are you feeling grumplestiltskin

293
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,420
'cause it's your birthday?

294
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,006
What?

295
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,841
No.

296
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:20,885
No.

297
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,349
Surprise!

298
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,685
Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.

299
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:30,645
Get in here.

300
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,939
If this were six years ago,
you'd all be dead.

301
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,774
So then, he gets out of the cab,

302
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,984
and you will not believe it.

303
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,902
I turn around, and what do I find?

304
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,862
- AirPods. His AirPods.
- His AirPods!

305
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,072
- Come on.
- Crazy story.

306
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,491
- Every time. Come on.
- Every single time.

307
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,203
Make any sales today?

308
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,746
You know I didn't.

309
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,958
Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy
or whatever it is that you do?

310
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,668
Our rent's due in three days, Wade.

311
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,003
I can't keep carrying you.

312
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:56,879
Relax. I have the money.

313
00:13:56,963 --> 00:13:59,173
I sold some old
blood pressure medication

314
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,258
I found lying around.

315
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,176
You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?

316
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,429
I'm not the one dousing
everything in salt, motherfucker.

317
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:08,516
I pray every day
that fire finds your body

318
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,893
and finishes the job God didn't have

319
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,645
- the nuts to do.
- That's hurtful.

320
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:15,523
If you could hear the look on my face,
you'd smell how sad I am.

321
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,025
You watched anything good?

322
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,776
<i>Great British Bake Off.</i>

323
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,236
Oh, goddamn.

324
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,572
That show stood between me
and suicide for 10 years.

325
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:25,283
Those are my feelings on
abortion, religious freedom,

326
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,535
animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines,

327
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,829
free-market capitalism,
global climate change.

328
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,998
Yeah, duh-duh-duh.
No, no speaking lines, Buck.

329
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,208
- Hi, Yukio.
- Hi, Wade.

330
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,502
Nice fake o'clock shadow.

331
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,757
It's a summer balayage. From the French.

332
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,218
It's meant to mimic
the natural highlights of the sun.

333
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:46,179
- It's a toupée.
- It's a hair system.

334
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,930
I love your hair system, Wade.

335
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,390
Thank you. Heh.

336
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,975
Wanna do some cocaine?

337
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,520
Hey, cocaine is the one thing
that Feige said is off limits.

338
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,230
What about Bolivian marching powder?

339
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,483
They know all the slang terms.
They have a list.

340
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,318
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

341
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,402
White girl interrupted?

342
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:02,904
- Even Forrest Bump.
- Booger sugar?

343
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,238
I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.

344
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,700
- Do you wanna build a snowman?
- Yes. But I can't.

345
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,369
Pull here.

346
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,871
- Here?
- Yeah.

347
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,665
- What happened?
- That's the fun part.

348
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,002
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

349
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,462
How's work?

350
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,089
Oh, I got a promotion.

351
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,049
No way.

352
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:26,344
Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle
management, but I'm happy.

353
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,428
That's great.

354
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,848
- You, uh, seeing anyone?
- How about you?

355
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,351
Um... Yeah.

356
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,270
A guy from work. Dermot.

357
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:37,647
Dermot.

358
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,190
- He's kind.
- Good.

359
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,274
Likes to go hiking.

360
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,401
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

361
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,612
Well, it's the early days.

362
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,493
What about you? You seeing anyone?

363
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,577
Mm...

364
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,371
No, no, I live
in a one-bedroom apartment.

365
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,747
I share a bed with Blind Al.

366
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,417
Okay.

367
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,794
- All right.
- All right.

368
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,799
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

369
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,425
- Speech! Speech!
- Yes!

370
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,386
All right. Okay, okay, okay. Uh...

371
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,429
Birthdays.

372
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:13,182
Boy, every spin around the moon
is a new adventure indeed.

373
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:15,393
- Sun, dumbass.
- Okay, round-earther.

374
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,855
- Where was I?
- The adventure of life.

375
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,022
Right. Um...

376
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:21,649
It's been a challenging few years.

377
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:23,818
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

378
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,070
Been through a lot, uh, change of life.

379
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,156
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

380
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,782
- Mm-mm.
- Sorry.

381
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,702
I'm sorry that
you had to see that, Yukio.

382
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,370
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

383
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,706
But I'm happy.

384
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:41,335
You know, and that's... that's
because of each and every one of you.

385
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,296
I guess, what I'm trying to say is

386
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,839
how proud I am, how grateful I am

387
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,257
to be standing in a room

388
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,093
with every single person I love.

389
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,602
I'm the luckiest man alive.

390
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:59,770
Make a wish, buddy.

391
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,523
Ten-four, good buddy.

392
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,733
Going down.

393
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:10,990
Wade Wilson?

394
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,617
Oh, yeah. Dancers.

395
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,951
Dopinder must have ordered you.

396
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,786
Are those supposed to be cop costumes?

397
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,830
Never mind.

398
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,041
Take your clothes off
but leave the helmets.

399
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,250
And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

400
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,461
We're kissing. All right?

401
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,171
What song do you guys normally dance to?

402
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,383
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

403
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,885
Is that supposed to be scary?

404
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,970
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.

405
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,096
But it is for Disney.

406
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,265
Ah, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta!

407
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,226
Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,

408
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,228
so we're gonna take things real slow.

409
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,104
And I want some crazy eye contact.

410
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,314
Not you. You.

411
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:45,775
Can't see your eyes through
the mask, but I can feel them.

412
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,318
We're gonna move on down the hallway

413
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,403
so we can spare a cleanup
on aisle asshole.

414
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,655
How's everyone feel about this plan?

415
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,991
- I don't like you.
- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.

416
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,660
And we're gonna do it angry.

417
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:14,971
Mr. Wilson...

418
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,892
you appear to have soiled yourself
while unconscious.

419
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,186
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

420
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,522
I go by the name of Paradox.

421
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,025
Mr. Paradox.
And you're sitting here at the TVA.

422
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,736
The Time Variance Authority.

423
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,655
We're really a watchdog organization,

424
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,283
except we're more lighthearted
than that sounds,

425
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,744
with a sort of throwback, ironic twist.

426
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,371
And we're in charge of defending

427
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,124
what's known as the Sacred Timeline.

428
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,460
Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton
of exposition for a threequel.

429
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,379
Is this because
I used Cable's time machine?

430
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,172
Brought a couple of people back to life,

431
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:51,299
then I destroyed it.

432
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:52,842
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes,

433
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,553
we're aware of your abuse
of your timeline.

434
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,972
And you were
so abusive of it.

435
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,683
Uh, no, it has nothing to do with that.

436
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:01,767
Walk with me.

437
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:10,484
I brought you here,
Mr. Wilson, to tell you

438
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:11,986
that you're special.

439
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:15,614
In fact, you've been chosen
for a higher purpose,

440
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,366
a purpose unclear even to me.

441
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,039
But one that could
save the entire Sacred Timeline

442
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,791
from a possibly grisly fate
sometime in the future,

443
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,585
which may very well need to be...

444
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,129
avenged.

445
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,922
This Sacred Timeline,

446
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,800
I assume I'm going to marvel

447
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,344
at how

448
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,888
cinematic it feels?

449
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,931
Gratuitous cameos,

450
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,933
indiscriminate use of Variants,
the whole package?

451
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,935
Well, you tell me.

452
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,110
Cap!

453
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,745
You are no longer lost, Wade.

454
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,247
You can be a hero among heroes.

455
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,084
We've been surveilling you
for quite a while.

456
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,003
- Subway station.
- A TVA outpost, yes.

457
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:13,214
- And what is that?
- Hmm?

458
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,635
Is that me? Is that Thor?

459
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:21,055
- Is he crying?
- Uh, let's not

460
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,431
get ahead of ourselves.

461
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:23,808
That happens in the distant future.

462
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,518
Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.

463
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,395
Do not speak to her.
Stop that. Eyes on me.

464
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,688
I brought you here
to offer you an opportunity.

465
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,690
The opportunity you sought years ago,

466
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,192
but for which you were not ready.

467
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,902
We believe you're ready now.

468
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,946
Ready for a chance
to leave your timeline

469
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,240
and join the greatest universe of all.

470
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,367
I am about to give you the thing
you've always wanted.

471
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,868
Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.

472
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,329
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

473
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,375
I am the Messiah...

474
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,462
I am...

475
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,173
...Marvel Jesus.

476
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,176
Can you excuse me for just a moment?

477
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,636
I'm just gonna go over here.

478
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,307
Suck it, Fox!

479
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,725
I'm going to Disneyland.

480
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,352
Get fucked!

481
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,899
- Where do I sign?
- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.

482
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,068
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

483
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:17,653
Oh.

484
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,280
There is one thing I will need, though.

485
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,953
Oh, fuck off!

486
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,872
Adorn me, Beardo.

487
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:49,477
Fuckin' A!

488
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,645
Uhh! It's perfect!

489
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:55,483
FYI, your tailor is a predator,
but I love it. Snug.

490
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,234
No camel toe.

491
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,904
New car smell and adamantium katanas?

492
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,739
You shouldn't have.

493
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,200
Go ahead. Take it in.

494
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,994
And yes, your underwear
is getting tighter.

495
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,662
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

496
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:10,331
His clothes says middle management,

497
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,958
but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.

498
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,919
Yes. You look very nice.

499
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,086
"Nice"?

500
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,130
Your buddy here is ready
to throw it all away for me.

501
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,507
- You callin' your wife?
- HR.

502
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,841
Does your wife work in HR?

503
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,968
I'm really glad
you're taking this so well.

504
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:25,221
Oh, I'm taking it well.

505
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,765
I have never had a problem
traveling for work.

506
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,558
That said, we should talk vacation days.

507
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm more of a one-week-on-
one-week-off kind of guy.

508
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,063
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

509
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,856
You know, you'll never see
a Danish flag on the moon,

510
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,733
but
goddamn it, they're happy.

511
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,402
Now, let's power up
your little Amazon Fire phone there

512
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,946
and zip me back home

513
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,115
so I can let my friends know
that they've been upgraded to disciples.

514
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,285
Yeah. I don't think you...
quite understand.

515
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,955
Um, you will not be returning
to your home

516
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,249
because there will be
no home to return to.

517
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:54,333
Come again?

518
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,417
This time in my ears.

519
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,925
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

520
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,636
That is what happens

521
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,973
when a universe
loses their Anchor Being.

522
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,308
See how it decays from the inside?

523
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:14,061
- This is how a reality dies.
- What's an Anchor Being?

524
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,355
An Anchor Being is an entity
of such vital importance

525
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,439
that when they die,

526
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:21,110
their whole world slowly
withers out of existence.

527
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,029
You've just won the lottery
because I didn't die.

528
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:25,781
It was just a little midlife crisis.
I'm better now.

529
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,158
Oh, no, no, no.

530
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,915
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I love to laugh.

531
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,585
Can you imagine
if you were the Anchor Being?

532
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,962
- Yeah.
- Oh!

533
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,256
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

534
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,383
Your Anchor Being died

535
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,261
in an act of self-sacrifice so epic

536
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,139
that it sent shivers down the Timeline.

537
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:53,350
I am referring, of course, to...

538
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:58,272
Logan. The Wolverine.

539
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:04,028
<i>Don't be what they made you.</i>

540
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,707
<i>Ah, so this is what it feels like...</i>

541
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,543
Logan.

542
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,921
Of course. Logan.

543
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,259
Logan?

544
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:29,261
The guy with forks for hands?

545
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:31,305
That Wolverine?

546
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,349
Yeah, I got it.

547
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:36,226
You can turn your retro graphics
of death off now. Make it stop.

548
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,729
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.
We certainly can't stop it.

549
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,107
How long have we got?

550
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:45,611
- In most cases, couple thousand years.
- Well, sweet.

551
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,905
Well, most cases aren't fast enough.
Not for me.

552
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:49,615
What does that mean?

553
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,950
It means that I have been tasked

554
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:54,286
with overseeing
the end of your universe.

555
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,371
And regardless of what

556
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,164
the pencil pushers upstairs
would prefer,

557
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,958
I will not waste my life

558
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,211
watching it die
slowly of natural causes.

559
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,338
We used to just prune these things.

560
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,547
Simple. Elegant. Efficient.

561
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,759
But I'm told the TVA doesn't like to
do that anymore. Well, I do.

562
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,636
And no matter what
my so-called superiors say,

563
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,180
the multiverse does not
need a babysitter.

564
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,057
We need a mercy killer.

565
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,725
And in this instance,

566
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:19,770
I am the mercy killer. Ha!

567
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,235
What in
the MacGuffin is that?

568
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,445
That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.

569
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,364
An accelerant.

570
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,033
Once completed,
it will allow me to destroy

571
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,035
the spacetime matrix of your universe.

572
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,287
You see, I don't want
to work for the TVA.

573
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,331
I want to be the TVA.

574
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,042
And the first step involves
showing this organization

575
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,002
how much more efficient it can become.

576
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,838
To wit, I will be giving your universe

577
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,465
a swift and compassionate end.

578
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,925
And don't worry,
your friends won't feel a thing.

579
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,886
It'll be over just like this.
"Oh, what's that?"

580
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,346
Trust me.

581
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,361
You're gonna Old Yeller
my fucking universe?

582
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,739
Mm... In your parlance, yes.

583
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,198
Two in the heart, one in the head.

584
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,325
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

585
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,121
You can either rejoin your loved ones
and collectively cease to exist in,

586
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,039
I'd say, 72 hours. Or...

587
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,418
you join the Sacred Timeline.

588
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,797
And you end your days
of insignificance and mediocrity.

589
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,090
Wade.

590
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:35,012
Wade, you can finally, finally matter.

591
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,899
That's all I've ever really wanted.

592
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,108
I know.

593
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,860
I know.

594
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:54,198
And you know I'm... I'm nothing
if not morally flexible.

595
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,659
Yep, yep.

596
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:00,996
I'll do it.

597
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,164
Wise choice.

598
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,999
The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.

599
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,751
I was actually
talking about finding the Wolverine

600
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:06,835
and breaking your fucking nose.

601
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,885
<i>♪ And I'd give up forever to touch you ♪</i>

602
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,596
<i>♪ 'Cause I know
that you feel me somehow ♪</i>

603
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:23,143
Find him. Find him!

604
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,937
<i>And boy, did he ever.</i>

605
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,232
<i>Which brings us back to this.</i>

606
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,778
<i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>

607
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,325
Oh, my God!

608
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,787
Oh! My own fucking arm!

609
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,543
Now we're talkin'!

610
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:48,585
Not like this!

611
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,171
No, dear God! No!

612
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,048
I'm sorry!
Wolverine-ing is hard!

613
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,424
Make it stop!

614
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,134
Mangold tried.

615
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,556
You sick fuck!

616
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:01,682
Logan was a hero.

617
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,559
And the only thing worth a shit

618
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:04,768
to ever come out of Canada.

619
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,070
Get my country's name

620
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,155
out of your fuckin' mouth.

621
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:19,867
And my sword. Give me that.

622
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,622
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

623
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,541
An alive one.

624
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,793
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.

625
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,093
Logan!

626
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,932
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

627
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,767
Who's asking?

628
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,188
Oh, look at
this little Hairy Lou Retton.

629
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,357
Did you stick the landing, little guy?

630
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,319
Yes, you did! Comic-accurate short king.

631
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,279
Such a cute wittle Wolvie.

632
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,448
Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.

633
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,199
Ahoy!

634
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,201
Everything seems to be on fire.

635
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,494
You have a dragon?

636
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,664
Ooh, you have Anchor Being
written all over--

637
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:15,339
<i>♪ Make a one man weep,
make another man sing ♪</i>

638
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,424
<i>♪ Change a hawk... ♪</i>

639
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,675
Patch!

640
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,803
Oh, now we're talkin'.

641
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,722
Oh, yeah.

642
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,642
That's the whole goddamn package
right there.

643
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,226
Howdy!

644
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,104
I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.

645
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,607
Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need
some coconut oil.

646
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,821
What in the fuck?

647
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,740
Are you okay?

648
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,492
Oh, yes, yes.

649
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,953
Classic John Byrne brown and tan.

650
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,412
Now, you fought the Hulk
in this outfit. No?

651
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,

652
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,085
and I will not--

653
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,764
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

654
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,978
You know, from behind,
you look a little bit like Henry--

655
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,229
Oh, my fuck!

656
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:15,273
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

657
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,694
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity,

658
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,696
this just feels right.

659
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,824
We will treat you so much better
than those shit fucks down the street.

660
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,951
- You were just leavin'.
- No, sir.

661
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,494
Not while the fate
of my universe is at--

662
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,667
This one looks promising.

663
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,751
Down you go.

664
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,504
Again.

665
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,590
I told you. You're not welcome here.

666
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,175
You're not welcome anywhere.

667
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,552
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

668
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,179
Just give me one more drink
and then I'll leave.

669
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:47,973
That's not how it works.

670
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,183
It does now.
Leave the bottle.

671
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,601
I know you, bub?

672
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,437
Nope. But I know you.

673
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,355
Everybody knows me.

674
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,983
I'm the Wolverine.

675
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,569
Yes, you are.

676
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,404
And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

677
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,323
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

678
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,201
- Really gettin' into your cups here.
- Why would I go with you?

679
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,121
Because, unfortunately,

680
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,497
I need you,

681
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:16,585
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

682
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,754
You two gonna fuck or fight?

683
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,925
You gonna take that from him?

684
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,053
Yep.

685
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,013
I can tell you have
a sort of don't-get-too-close-

686
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,806
I'll-only-break-your-heart vibe
going here,

687
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,309
but every other Wolverine
would've really hurt me by now.

688
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,602
And I'm sort of on the tick-tick.

689
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,270
- So, upsy-daisy. Here we go.
- Whoa, whoa.

690
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:37,022
- Up you go. I got you, big guy.
- Hey, hey!

691
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:39,524
Oh.

692
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,194
Whiskey dick of the claws.

693
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,653
It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.

694
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,322
You don't want this.

695
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,616
You're right. I don't.
And you don't want this.

696
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,410
Unless you wanna take a deep breath
through your fuckin' forehead,

697
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,579
I suggest you reconsider.

698
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:53,705
Let's go, peanut.

699
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,878
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

700
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,671
Watch this.

701
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,716
All right. That-- Whoa.

702
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:06,093
Easy.

703
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:10,889
Good God.

704
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,225
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?

705
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,061
It's okay. Keep goin'.

706
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,938
Audiences are accustomed
to long run times.

707
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,445
Guess you'll have to do.

708
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,030
Okay, here we--

709
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,450
Oh! Look at those jammies.

710
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:34,037
That only took 20 fucking years.

711
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,623
One Anchor Being coming right up!

712
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,583
On your left, baby girl.

713
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,587
This Logan has the same
he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.

714
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,506
And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

715
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,883
like he's not embarrassed to be
in a superhero movie for once.

716
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,802
I don't understand.

717
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,178
You said my universe is dying

718
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,140
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

719
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,267
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

720
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,646
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

721
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,022
with this?

722
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,401
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

723
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,444
But you have outdone yourself

724
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,613
and brought me the worst Wolverine!

725
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,907
- What do you mean, the worst one?
- Mr. Wilson.

726
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,536
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

727
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,289
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

728
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,957
And what he did,

729
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,542
well,

730
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,752
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

731
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,047
Okay.

732
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,884
How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

733
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,345
I gave you a chance at greatness.

734
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,973
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

735
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,600
Clearly not special in a good way.

736
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,603
Apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

737
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,770
With Thor. He holds me.

738
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,898
But I did my duty.

739
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,900
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

740
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:48,278
And instead of accepting my offering
with humility and gratitude,

741
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,279
you broke my nose.

742
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,447
It looks great.

743
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,407
And you decimated dozens of my men

744
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,117
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

745
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,328
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

746
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:57,537
What are you, the Internet?

747
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,956
Your world is dying!

748
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,416
Thank you very much.

749
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,542
And there's no stopping it.

750
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,505
The humane thing to do
is to make it quick.

751
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,258
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
making you peckish?

752
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,843
I'm eating my feelings.

753
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm about to lose everything
that I've ever cared about

754
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:17,849
because that hairy thundercunt
from down undercunt finally dies,

755
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,393
and he's standing
right behind me, isn't he?

756
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:21,978
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

757
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,105
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

758
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,733
As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

759
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,026
I want you to get him on the phone

760
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,070
and you tell him, her, or them,

761
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,239
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

762
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,745
Holy shit.

763
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,456
I just heard a symphony

764
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,416
of buttholes clenching all at once.

765
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,876
You're off grid.

766
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,504
Your bosses don't know what
you sick fucks are doing down here.

767
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,215
Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen...

768
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,633
And I'm gonna go upstairs

769
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,760
and I'm gonna tell 'em
all about you and your--

770
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,471
Oh, silence is nice, isn't it?

771
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,639
Where the fuck did he go?

772
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,391
To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.

773
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,561
Whew. That was close.

774
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,085
Don't just
stand there, you ape.

775
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,545
Give me a hand up.

776
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,798
Nope. I'm actually okay.

777
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,466
Thank you very much.

778
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,011
Where the hell are we?

779
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,305
I don't know.
Looks kind of Mad Max-y.

780
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,348
But that would be
IP infringement, right?

781
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:41,683
Fucking jokes.

782
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,646
Fuck! Fuck.

783
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,273
Were you even listening back there?

784
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,026
If we don't make it back
to that Mr. Paradox asshole,

785
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,485
everyone I know is gonna die.

786
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,237
Not my fuckin' problem.

787
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,613
Oh, is that all you got?

788
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,533
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

789
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,828
Come again?

790
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,371
Yeah, I heard all about you.

791
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,082
How you screwed up everything.

792
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,169
You should be thankin' me for
pulling you out of that bed you shit in.

793
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,212
You back-stabbing
son of a bitch!

794
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,678
Are you ready to be calm now?

795
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,313
Rest in pieces, Fox.

796
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,704
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

797
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,582
Doesn't matter what you did.

798
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,250
I just need your help.

799
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,045
I don't fuckin' care.

800
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,298
Uh... Uh-oh.

801
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:03,181
Fuck. This is gonna hurt.

802
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,686
All right.

803
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,146
Fuck it.

804
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,649
Let's give the people
what they came for.

805
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,193
Let's fuckin' go.

806
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,571
Get your special sock out, nerds.

807
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:20,365
It's gonna get good.

808
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,151

809
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,989

Baby Knife!

818
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,682
Let's see you grow

819
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,766
your fuckin' head back.

820
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,768
Wait, wait, wait!
I can fix it! I can fix it.

821
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:32,854
- Fix what?
- Whatever it is that you did.

822
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,023
Whatever made you so bad.

823
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:39,444
Those... Those pricks in the TVA.
You heard him.

824
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:41,821
They have the power to end my universe,

825
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,074
but they also have
the power to change yours.

826
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,913
We get back there,
and we can fix your world.

827
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,080
Together.

828
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,625
I promise.

829
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,377
They can fix it.

830
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:58,755
Hey!

831
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:00,924
We fight each other, we lose.

832
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,217
Dear God, it's him.

833
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,385
- Who?
- The one.

834
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,222
The superhero equivalent
to comfort food, or Molly.

835
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:10,308
White guys' answer
to all the disappointments.

836
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,726
And another A-lister.

837
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,269
Fair warning, gorgeous.

838
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,396
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language,

839
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,316
a smidge of ass play,
but we've been prohibited

840
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,235
from using cocaine. On camera.

841
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,986
- They're coming.
- Who's "they"?

842
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,994
Oh, they're driving angry.

843
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,877
Now that's a superhero landing.

844
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,094
I got this.

845
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,160
Stay close.

846
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:12,412
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

847
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:14,789
You got this.

848
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,545
Cassandra is gonna be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

849
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:22,589
You can't run.

850
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:23,965
Everybody knows that.

851
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,259
You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?

852
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:29,429
You're not gonna love what happens next.

853
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,180
Oh. Oh, my God.

854
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,224
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.

855
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:34,350
- Ah! Fuck.
- Ha!

856
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,644
- Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!
- Say what?

857
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:37,812
Avengers, assemble...

858
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,105
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

859
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,796
Ohh! Fuck!

860
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,756
Ahhh!

861
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,053
- We don't know that guy.
- We thought we did.

862
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,721
I know you.

863
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,766
Holy sh--

864
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,436
Sabretooth. Your brother.

865
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,314
Ready to die?

866
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,858
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Time!

867
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,277
You look ridiculous.

868
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:28,905
People have waited decades
for this fight.

869
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:30,782
It's not gonna be easy. Baby Knife.

870
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,950
Shoot the double, you take him down.

871
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,786
Side control, then full mount,

872
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,371
and you ground and pound

873
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:37,997
till he makes no sound
because he's dead.

874
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,916
- Shut the fuck up!
- Oh, my God!

875
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,834
Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.

876
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,973
What is it, girl?

877
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:58,017
Is there trouble at the well?

878
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,273
Big trouble.

879
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,234
Behold!

880
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:09,153
The head of your precious queen,

881
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,238
Furiosa!

882
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,199
I have the Wolverine!

883
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:16,536
I alone control her!

884
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,413
You come for me,

885
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:21,290
you come for her.

886
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,002
So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."

887
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,879
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

888
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:28,131
Who's next?

889
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,340
Toad!

890
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:30,258
You're up.

891
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:38,891
Uh-oh.

892
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,976
- Oh, holy sh--
- Fuck.

893
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,989
God of Thunder.

894
00:42:56,993 --> 00:42:58,286
How long was I asleep?

895
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:00,121
Not all of you was asleep.

896
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:01,664
Don't bother.

897
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,624
They're very thorough.

898
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:06,127
If you know where we are, start talking.

899
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:08,004
You're in The Void.

900
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:09,922
Think of it as purgatory.

901
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,092
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.

902
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:14,594
Where anything useless goes

903
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,512
before it gets annihilated forever.

904
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,599
And where the TVA sends
people that don't play nice

905
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:20,933
with the rest of the multiverse.

906
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,935
- Like you?
- And you.

907
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:24,812
What does the annihilating?

908
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,105
Alioth.

909
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:29,817
Alioth is in this thing?
From <i>Loki,</i> Season 1, Episode 5?

910
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,527
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.

911
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:33,738
Most don't make it.

912
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:35,114
There's a resistance, though.

913
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:38,534
Other people like us
that managed to survive.

914
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:40,411
They're hidin' out in the borderlands,

915
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,705
trying to find a way
the fuck outta here.

916
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,207
Then that's where we go.

917
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,209
"We"? Us? A team?

918
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,044
The answer is yes. Shake on it.

919
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,296
Fuck! You nicked it.

920
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,173
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

921
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:54,133
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

922
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:55,259
Make 'em fix things.

923
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,138
Something funny, bub?

924
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,890
She might have somethin'
to say about that.

925
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:02,016
Who's "she"?

926
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:04,685
In The Void,

927
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,437
you're either food for Alioth

928
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,148
or you work for her.

929
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,514
Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.

930
00:45:24,682 --> 00:45:26,601
Oh, you must be this year's Juggernaut.

931
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:28,227
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

932
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,437
She don't like the chatter.

933
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,646
She's gonna love you.

934
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,205
Is it... Is that Charles?

935
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:50,791
Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

936
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,001
That's not Chuck.

937
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,294
Ah, shit.

938
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:56,422
Oh, ableism. Great.

939
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:58,799
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

940
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:00,426
A Wolverine.

941
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:03,387
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

942
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:05,264
You're one of Xavier's.

943
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:06,891
You-You know him?
You know Chuck?

944
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:08,017
Oh, I knew him.

945
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,810
We shared a womb.

946
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:12,146
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow

947
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,731
with my umbilical cord.

948
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:16,817
Amen. I've never
loved roommates. Mine's blind.

949
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,694
Except she can see cocaine.

950
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,279
For some... reason.

951
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:23,449
You want to chime in,
Your Majesty? I'm dying here.

952
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:24,533
Who are you?

953
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:27,495
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

954
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:29,080
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

955
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:31,123
Hmm. You two are cute.

956
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,250
I have a good feeling about this.

957
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,298
And I've been trying to catch
this little firefly for years.

958
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:41,676
Haven't I, Johnny?

959
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:45,763
Aw... You picked the wrong time
to make new friends.

960
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:47,765
Oh, Johnny told us
all about you.

961
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,141
- Maybe shut up now.
- Yeah, maybe don't--

962
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,352
We're just talkin' here.
Yeah, Johnny told us

963
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,729
you're a psychotic
megalomaniacal asshole.

964
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:57,066
His words, not mine.
Hellbent on domination and pain.

965
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,236
You said all that about me?

966
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,737
No! No! I don't...

967
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:03,864
- I didn't say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

968
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,368
Don't let her intimidate you.

969
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:09,245
It's like you said in the convoy.

970
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,580
This finger-lickin' dead-inside

971
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:14,625
pixie slab of third rate
dime-store nut-milk

972
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:15,960
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring

973
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:18,212
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

974
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,339
Okay. I have never said
any of those words

975
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,550
- in my entire life!
- Ha! The modesty.

976
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,343
People think I'm a shit talker.

977
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,511
But this guy...

978
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:26,595
Next level.

979
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,889
What? This... I... We...

980
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,266
I don't even know
what half of that means!

981
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,059
- This... I...
- My hat's off to you, sir.

982
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,686
- Truly.
- What? This... I didn't... He's...

983
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:35,396
That's... I...

984
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:36,647
I... I don't--

985
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:42,945
Not my favorite Chris.

986
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:45,573
You stupid piece of shit.
You just got him fucking killed!

987
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:47,825
Hey! We're all grieving!

988
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:49,577
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

989
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:53,998
Alioth is hungry.

990
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,500
There's been
some kind of mistake.

991
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:58,586
Big yellow is a back-up Anchor Being,

992
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:01,088
and I'm Marvel Jesus.
MJ, if you're nasty.

993
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,256
This may be hard to hear,

994
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:05,009
but there's another British villain
who's gonna destroy my universe,

995
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:06,302
and I'm gonna stop him.

996
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,221
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me
as the world-saving type.

997
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:12,725
Did I hit a nerve?

998
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,020
I didn't want it
to come to this.

999
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,104
Either you help us

1000
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:20,274
or my friend here is gonna sing
the entire second act of <i>Music Man</i>

1001
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:21,358
with zero warm-up.

1002
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,569
Where'd you get the chair?

1003
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,447
Well, once in a while,
I do get a Charles through here.

1004
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,032
Never mine, though.

1005
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:31,368
No. He didn't care to find me.

1006
00:48:31,452 --> 00:48:35,122
Gen Z
and their trauma-bragging!

1007
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:37,833
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

1008
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:39,543
or cancer like the rest of us?

1009
00:48:39,627 --> 00:48:41,462
But I'm not like the rest of you.

1010
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,380
Except maybe the Wolverine.

1011
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,925
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

1012
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:47,343
You're that scary, huh?

1013
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,345
The TVA certainly thought so.

1014
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,931
They sent me here before I could walk.

1015
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:54,934
And you know, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1016
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,560
I love it here.

1017
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:58,062
You live in a garbage dump.

1018
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:01,315
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

1019
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,234
The Void is a paradise.

1020
00:49:03,317 --> 00:49:06,987
I can wield my power here without shame.

1021
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,406
Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier

1022
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,866
to teach me temperance.

1023
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:13,327
What about your Charles?

1024
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,620
Did he protect you?

1025
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:17,790
Did he make you feel safe?

1026
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,458
We're mutants. We're never safe.

1027
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't... I don't want the smoke.

1028
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,637
I don't have any beef with you.

1029
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,264
I just want to save my friends.

1030
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:34,557
I just... I want to go home.

1031
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,392
Well, the thing is,
I could get you home.

1032
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:38,144
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

1033
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:40,396
Not good.

1034
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:45,526
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

1035
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:47,945
Your... fingers are inside me,

1036
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,155
but not in a good way.

1037
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:52,283
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

1038
00:49:52,366 --> 00:49:54,702
I have to get my hands dirty.

1039
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,914
I've got you.

1040
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,918
<i>I've got you...</i>

1041
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:06,463
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1042
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:10,676
I can't... I can't reach you.
You're not here.

1043
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,052
I'm right here.

1044
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:15,556
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

1045
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,641
Then show me. You got to do something.

1046
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:20,436
Show you what?

1047
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,272
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

1048
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:28,194
<i>Ever since they turned you down,
you took a knee.</i>

1049
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:30,863
Baby, you never got back up.

1050
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,909
I know you're going through something.

1051
00:50:34,992 --> 00:50:36,785
Let me go through it with you.

1052
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,414
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

1053
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:44,710
Where'd you go?

1054
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:46,795
Oh, my God.

1055
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,300
<i>You just say it. Okay?</i>

1056
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:54,803
<i>Say, "I don't want you.
I don't want to be with you."</i>

1057
00:50:55,596 --> 00:50:57,181
<i>Go ahead. Say it. Say... Say, "I don't..."</i>

1058
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,432
Say it. You don't wanna be with me.

1059
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:01,227
<i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.
Say, "I don't want you."</i>

1060
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,109
Fuck...

1061
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:11,737
You'll never fucking matter.

1062
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:16,659
What?

1063
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:20,329
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

1064
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:28,796
- <i>You'll...</i>
<i>- You'll...</i>

1065
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:30,756
- never...
<i>- never...</i>

1066
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,174
- fucking...
- fucking...

1067
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,927
- matter.
<i>- matter...</i>

1068
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:38,389
She never said that.

1069
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,473
No.

1070
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:41,517
But I bet she thought it.

1071
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,396
You are so mean!

1072
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:48,190
My brain could taste your fingers,
and they tasted like hate!

1073
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:51,402
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

1074
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,320
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

1075
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:56,490
And long before you came here.

1076
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,411
This is Baby Knife.
She's gonna fuck you in the face now.

1077
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:01,870
If you want to kill me,

1078
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:03,622
it's going to take
more than a little blade.

1079
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:04,790
How about six?

1080
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,627
My boy's wicked strong.

1081
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:10,671
That's my big boy.

1082
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:12,298
Yes, you are.

1083
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,722
Well, this has been fun.

1084
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:22,308
But the big guy needs to eat,
and the rent is due.

1085
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,562
By the way,

1086
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:28,147
you're the rent.

1087
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:50,169
Come on! Fuck!

1088
00:52:50,252 --> 00:52:51,420
You comin' or what?

1089
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:52,713
Coming!

1090
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:13,692
What you thinkin' 'bout?

1091
00:53:13,776 --> 00:53:15,486
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Shh, shh, shh.

1092
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,571
- Almost done.
- Almost done what?

1093
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,490
Getting my knife out of your buttocks,

1094
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:21,200
- pervert!
- Aah! Fuck!

1095
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:23,077
Get your mind out of my pants!

1096
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,412
- I'm telling Blake.
- New rules.

1097
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:27,039
I talk now.

1098
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:28,374
That's gonna be very hard
on the audience.

1099
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,250
Shut the fuck up!

1100
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:31,877
Let me fuckin' think.

1101
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,129
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?

1102
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:36,924
Right?

1103
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,718
<i>Je m'excuse.</i> Am I allowed
to speak now or--

1104
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:42,096
Just nod, asshole.

1105
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:45,349
- Right.
- Then we find the others

1106
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,768
that poor kid, Johnny, was talking about
before you got him killed!

1107
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,561
"Poor kid." He's, like, 50!

1108
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:52,231
Yeah, if there's a chance they know
how to get out of here, we find 'em.

1109
00:53:52,314 --> 00:53:54,316
And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit

1110
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,651
like you fucking promised!

1111
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:57,027
I smell quest.

1112
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,156
I smell food.

1113
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:07,538
So what made you finally wear
an honest-to-God costume?

1114
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:11,458
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

1115
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:14,294
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

1116
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:15,879
Have you been checked for ADHD?

1117
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:17,089
Mm-mm.

1118
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:19,466
But I've had several STDs,

1119
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,468
which were probably caused by ADHD.

1120
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:22,928
Fuck!

1121
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,721
What are you looking for?

1122
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:26,723
Oh. Thank fuck.

1123
00:54:28,183 --> 00:54:29,977
No, no, no, no, no.
That's rubbing alcohol.

1124
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,311
You don't want to drink-- Oh, yeah.

1125
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:33,063
There you go. Fuck that liver.

1126
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:36,483
Good. Okay.

1127
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,445
- What the fuck are those?
- Oh.

1128
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:41,864
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupée,

1129
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,449
but nobody knows.

1130
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,244
Everybody knows.

1131
00:54:50,164 --> 00:54:51,582
Wanna talk about what's haunting you,

1132
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:53,834
or should we wait
for a third act flashback?

1133
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:55,752
Ah... Go fuck yourself.

1134
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:00,215
You know...

1135
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:04,261
in my world, you're...

1136
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:06,513
You're well regarded.

1137
00:55:06,597 --> 00:55:08,223
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1138
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:11,059
They don't like me much in mine either.

1139
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,519
You don't say.

1140
00:55:12,603 --> 00:55:14,521
I wanted to be something, you know. I...

1141
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:17,149
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

1142
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:19,234
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1143
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,945
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1144
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,073
When my girlfriend left me,

1145
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:26,742
- and I just--
- You had a girlfriend?

1146
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:27,826
Yeah.

1147
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:29,453
Vanessa.

1148
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:31,371
When we met, she was a dancer.

1149
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:33,582
We had a whole life.

1150
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:35,876
It was good.

1151
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:38,670
But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.

1152
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:41,507
Fucked that right up.

1153
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,593
But you, you were an X-Man.

1154
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:46,887
Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...

1155
00:55:48,805 --> 00:55:49,973
The Wolverine.

1156
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,894
He was a hero in my world.

1157
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:56,855
Yeah, well...

1158
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,107
he ain't shit in mine.

1159
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,157
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1160
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:09,368
He died.

1161
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:10,744
How?

1162
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,830
Well, technically, you were
chest-fucked by a tree, but,

1163
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:15,666
really, you just ran out of batteries

1164
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:17,918
- trying to save someone.
- Who?

1165
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,878
The shitheels that grew her in a lab

1166
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:21,380
called her "X-23." But...

1167
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,257
she was just a kid.

1168
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:27,553
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

1169
00:56:27,636 --> 00:56:29,304
You died trying to save her.

1170
00:56:29,388 --> 00:56:30,389
It was beautiful.

1171
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:33,267
Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.

1172
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:36,478
My blind, elderly,
African-American roommate,

1173
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:39,565
Blind Al, always says that
pain teaches us who we are.

1174
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:42,276
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain
instead of running from it.

1175
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:44,111
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

1176
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:46,655
No, no, no. That's her name?
You call her "Blind Al"?

1177
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:47,739
Well, she's blind.

1178
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,423

She's coming with us.

1186
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,740
- No, she's not. Fuck no!
- Oh, yes, she is.

1187
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:31,825
- Oh, yes--
- Sorry!

1188
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:33,577
Sorry about that!

1189
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,121
Come here, girl!

1190
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:37,497
Who are you?

1191
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:40,208
Oh, I'm Deadpool.
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1192
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:42,377
But in here, everybody
calls me "Nicepool."

1193
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:44,463
Oh, my goodness.
Wait till you see Ladypool.

1194
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:45,964
She is gorgeous.

1195
00:57:46,048 --> 00:57:47,841
She just had a baby too.
And...

1196
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:48,925
Can't even tell.

1197
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:50,427
I don't think you're supposed
to say that.

1198
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,678
That's okay.

1199
00:57:52,179 --> 00:57:53,555
I identify as a feminist.

1200
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:54,598
Right.

1201
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:59,811
Are those gold-plated,
.50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

1202
00:57:59,895 --> 00:58:01,021
'Course.

1203
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,230
To match my ear huggie.

1204
00:58:02,314 --> 00:58:03,273
Can I have 'em?

1205
00:58:03,357 --> 00:58:05,567
Over my dead body.

1206
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,152
You're fun.

1207
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,363
And I guess
you've already met Mary Puppins.

1208
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:11,239
AKA Dogpool.

1209
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:13,116
Careful where you put your hands.

1210
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,452
She's ninety percent g-spot,
and she'll let you know it.

1211
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:19,081
You let this little flirt out
of your sight for one second

1212
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,291
and she starts shopping for a new papa.

1213
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,585
If you can't be a responsible pet owner,

1214
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:25,921
then maybe you don't deserve
this little unicorn.

1215
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:28,006
Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.

1216
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:29,424
Shan't happen again.

1217
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:31,134
Why are you so nice?

1218
00:58:31,218 --> 00:58:32,594
Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.

1219
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:34,388
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1220
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:36,056
<i>- Caliente.</i>
- This is Logan.

1221
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:37,140
He's usually shirtless,

1222
00:58:37,224 --> 00:58:38,850
but he's let himself go
since the divorce.

1223
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:41,728
Where's your mask?

1224
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:45,565
Come on, guys.

1225
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,235
Ugh, this guy.

1226
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,696
- We're looking for a group of survivors.
- Oh, they're out there.

1227
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:52,614
Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope

1228
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:54,366
that you don't run
into the Deadpool corps.

1229
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:55,367
Yeah, they're crazy.

1230
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,244
They will chop you up
into a thousand pieces

1231
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:58,495
and hide you all over The Void.

1232
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,622
If they could only process
their childhood trauma,

1233
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:02,374
they'd go on one heck
of a healing journey.

1234
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,543
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.
You know where it is?

1235
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:07,713
Yeah, that... that's 12 klicks due west.

1236
00:59:07,796 --> 00:59:09,047
I can lend you my ride, if you like.

1237
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,841
It would be my honor.

1238
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,638
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.

1239
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:18,807
Uh-uh. What the... No! No!

1240
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:19,975
Just get in the car.

1241
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,226
This isn't a car.

1242
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:23,520
This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.

1243
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,647
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1244
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:26,940
Dated infotainment system.

1245
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:29,735
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia
was makin' a comeback,

1246
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,487
they invented
the Honda Odyssey to compete.

1247
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:35,365
Get in the fucking car.

1248
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,701
She'll get you there safe and sound.

1249
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:39,244
Old Betsy always does.

1250
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:41,913
You're gonna have to
give me my dog back, though.

1251
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:43,790
I know. Listen.

1252
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:45,459
Yes, child.

1253
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:47,627
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home,

1254
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:49,671
or if something should happen to you,

1255
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:50,839
I'd love to be her papa.

1256
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,175
What would ever happen to me?

1257
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,384
Lots of stuff.

1258
00:59:58,013 --> 00:59:59,389
- Jesus.
- No!

1259
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:01,099
We're running away.

1260
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:03,101
- Give me that.
- The corn was too dense, girl!

1261
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:04,102
- There.
- Come here!

1262
01:00:04,186 --> 01:00:05,520
- Fuck!
- Hello!

1263
01:00:07,397 --> 01:00:08,815
Bye.

1270
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:37,177
Okay, I'm just gonna ask...
What's with the suit?

1271
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,887
First thing I did when I flamed out,

1272
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:39,971
- I took mine off.
- Drop it.

1273
01:00:40,055 --> 01:00:41,097
It's not that ugly.

1274
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:43,517
- Stop talking about my suit.
- Did you make it yourself?

1275
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,559
- Been there.
- Quit. Now.

1276
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:47,687
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

1277
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:49,356
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

1278
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:51,858
Friends don't let friends
leave the house lookin' like

1279
01:00:51,942 --> 01:00:53,693
they fight crime
for the Los Angeles Rams.

1280
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:54,945
Shut the fuck up about this, or--

1281
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:57,322
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.

1282
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:58,532
I'm just trying to bond a little bit.

1283
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,116
Yeah, well, then talk
about somethin' else.

1284
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,243
Fine.

1285
01:01:04,246 --> 01:01:06,122
Pshew. Pshew, pshew.

1286
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:07,833
Pshew!

1287
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,918
- Stop it.
- Pshew.

1288
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,170
If they can fix your world,
what's the first thing

1289
01:01:12,254 --> 01:01:13,547
you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

1290
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,591
Get some rubbing alcohol shots,
maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1291
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,343
- What did you say?
- I said when you get back,

1292
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,846
- what's the first thing you're gonna do?
- No, no, no. Before that.

1293
01:01:22,222 --> 01:01:23,765
If... they can fix your world?

1294
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,354
What do you mean, "if"?

1295
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:31,231
- I mean--
- You lied to me.

1296
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:33,733
You don't have a fucking clue
if they can help me fix things, do you?

1297
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:35,610
No. I mean-- Ow!

1298
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:38,446
Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!

1299
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,533
- You lied!
- No! I made an educated wish!

1300
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:44,119
Because I need you.

1301
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:48,456
This. This is why. Right here.

1302
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:51,001
'Cause if we don't do
something, they die.

1303
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:53,545
I don't know anything
about saving worlds.

1304
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:55,255
And why would I even care?

1305
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:58,133
Because my entire world
is right here in this picture.

1306
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:01,011
It's only nine people,

1307
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:02,929
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1308
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:07,893
I know how to fuck people up for money.
But you, you know how to save 'em!

1309
01:02:08,977 --> 01:02:10,228
At least the other Wolverine did.

1310
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:13,899
Fuck! I guess I'm stuck
with the worst one.

1311
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:16,526
Did you say you made

1312
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,196
an educated fucking wish?

1313
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,282
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

1314
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:26,745
They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,
the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."

1315
01:02:30,123 --> 01:02:31,124
One more word.

1316
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:34,836
Please give me one.

1317
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:38,465
Gubernatorial.

1318
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:40,342
Oh, fuck!

1319
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,637
You know what? You're a fucking joke.

1320
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,681
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1321
01:02:46,765 --> 01:02:48,892
Or the X-Men.
And they'll take fucking anyone.

1322
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:54,356
I mean, you are
a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1323
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:56,983
I have never met

1324
01:02:57,067 --> 01:03:00,820
a sadder, more attention-starved,
jabbering little prick

1325
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:02,280
in my entire life.

1326
01:03:02,364 --> 01:03:04,407
And that says a lot,
'cause I've been alive

1327
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:07,035
for more than 200 fuckin' years,

1328
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:08,411
and I'll tell ya,

1329
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:10,163
that bald chick
was right about one thing.

1330
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:12,707
You will never save the world!

1331
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:15,460
You couldn't even save a relationship

1332
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,504
with a goddamn stripper!

1333
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:20,131
And motherfucker, I wish
I could say you'd die alone,

1334
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:23,218
but it's one of God's
best jokes that you can't die,

1335
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:24,803
except that's on all of us!

1336
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,351
Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?

1337
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:41,569
I'm gonna fight you now.

1338
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:45,156
Oh, are you?

1339
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,752

No clue, but... I like it here.

1370
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:26,067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1371
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:16,075
Okay.

1372
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,537
Look at you... all.
You must be the others.

1373
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,372
Terrific.

1374
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:24,667
So just to refresh, you are

1375
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:26,002
- Wonder--
- Elektra.

1376
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:27,795
Elektra?
Yes. Who could forget?

1377
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:31,591
And you. I was not expecting
to see you here.

1378
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:33,343
I thought you were, you know,

1379
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,011
retired.

1380
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,346
Retarded?

1381
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:38,890
"Retired."

1382
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,184
I'm already in The Void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1383
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,478
- I don't like you.
- You never did.

1384
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:48,650
And who's this succulent reminder
of my own inadequacies?

1385
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:49,901
Look at you.

1386
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:52,654
You look like
the superhero version of Hawkeye.

1387
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:56,074
The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>

1388
01:07:56,783 --> 01:07:58,117
But you can call me the Gambit.

1389
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,995
It's been a while since
I've seen <i>Sling Blade.</i> Hit me again.

1390
01:08:01,621 --> 01:08:03,206
- They call me the Gambit.
- Do they?

1391
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:05,458
Are you sure you didn't
just really, really want them to,

1392
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:06,793
but it never quite worked out?

1393
01:08:09,504 --> 01:08:11,673
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

1394
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:13,800
But I can tell you now,

1395
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:15,635
it's just a common courtesy to ask

1396
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:17,262
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1397
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:19,597
Well, it's a good thing
I don't give a fuck.

1398
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:23,893
Fuck.

1399
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,897
So embarrassing.

1400
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,066
Boo, boo, boo.

1401
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,777
Well, now that that's settled, look,
we came a long way to find you three.

1402
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,612
- There's four of us.
- There's four...

1403
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:36,572
Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1404
01:08:36,656 --> 01:08:38,574
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto,

1405
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:39,784
- because with him--
- He's dead.

1406
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:41,953
Fuck! Now Disney gets cheap?

1407
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:44,038
It's like Pinocchio jammed
his face in my ass

1408
01:08:44,122 --> 01:08:46,082
- and started lying like crazy.
- Ooh, you nasty!

1409
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:48,710
<i>Mon petit rouge.
Laissez les bons temps rouler, huh?</i>

1410
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:51,587
Not a single word.
What do you do exactly?

1411
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:54,340
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1412
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:56,342
Your power's close-up magic.
That's good.

1413
01:08:56,426 --> 01:08:58,261
We're not totally fucked at all.

1414
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:00,054
So who brought us here?

1415
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:01,264
That would be me.

1416
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:12,233
Don't make me regret it.

1417
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:17,488
Holy shit. Logan.
That's her. That's X-23.

1418
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:19,157
She's the one I told you about.

1419
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,705
Hey, how did you all get stuck
in The Void?

1420
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:27,415
There was a knock at the door.

1421
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:29,417
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1422
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,919
Well, maybe I was born here.
It's... It's hard to know for sure.

1423
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:34,464
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1424
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:37,342
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1425
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,388
People like us
don't go quietly.

1426
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,265
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1427
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,976
The answer is yes. I'm in.

1428
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,686
- In what?
- A team.

1429
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,230
Me, you, you, and me.
All of us together.

1430
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:52,732
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1431
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:54,484
Don't listen to him.
He's a fucking liar!

1432
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:55,943
It was an educated wish!

1433
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:57,945
- Ha!
- Look.

1434
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:01,032
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1435
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:03,910
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1436
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,828
She can get us home. She told us.

1437
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:07,663
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1438
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,333
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1439
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,335
- Nobody's ever done that.
- We did.

1440
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:14,295
Every time one of us
has gone up against her,

1441
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:16,047
they die.

1442
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,716
The Punisher, the Quicksilver,
the Daredevil.

1443
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,385
Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1444
01:10:20,468 --> 01:10:21,969
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1445
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,307
Even that sweet, baby angel,
Johnny Storm.

1446
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,601
He up and gone missing like,

1447
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:30,019
what, two days ago?

1448
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,438
Ugh. That's so sad.

1449
01:10:33,147 --> 01:10:35,775
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1450
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:39,070
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1451
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:40,988
All right? Us... plus, you guys.

1452
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:44,075
We can put Cassandra over our knee
and force her to let us out of The Void.

1453
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:45,618
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1454
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:47,370
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1455
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:49,414
Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1456
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:51,124
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1457
01:10:51,207 --> 01:10:54,127
You guys may not have
been able to save your universes.

1458
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,670
But you can avenge them.

1459
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:57,713
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1460
01:10:57,797 --> 01:11:00,550
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1461
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:02,844
Oh, yeah.

1462
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:04,929
Dickhead here talked him into a team-up,

1463
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:07,390
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1464
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:09,183
No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1465
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:11,102
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1466
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,688
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1467
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:15,440
Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!

1468
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:17,608
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1469
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:18,943
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1470
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,945
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1471
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:22,029
Look.

1472
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:24,282
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1473
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:25,908
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1474
01:11:25,992 --> 01:11:28,578
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1475
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:31,205
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1476
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:32,582
He was like a brother to me.

1477
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:36,252
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1478
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,297
Look, maybe you couldn't
save your worlds, but...

1479
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,549
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1480
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:44,135
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1481
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:47,138
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1482
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,056
we can get back in and take her down.

1483
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,642
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chére.</i>

1484
01:11:51,726 --> 01:11:54,145
If we can block
her psychic powers,

1485
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,022
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1486
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:57,523
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1487
01:11:58,191 --> 01:12:00,651
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1488
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:02,653
- around here somewhere--
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1489
01:12:02,737 --> 01:12:03,905
- Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1490
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,865
- Fuck!
- She don't play.

1491
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:07,492
She knows that helmet was the only way

1492
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,076
to protect anyone from her powers.

1493
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,953
The only other helmet that strong
is Juggernaut's,

1494
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:12,079
but he works for Cassandra.

1495
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:13,706
Juggernaut's helmet.
That's it.

1496
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,416
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1497
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,876
without that dome gonna come off wit'it.

1498
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,086
I'm so sorry, beautiful.
I want this to be gentle.

1499
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,589
Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?

1500
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:24,383
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1501
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,221
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1502
01:12:30,014 --> 01:12:31,933
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1503
01:12:32,016 --> 01:12:33,726
Or never learned about us.

1504
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,061
The heroes we were.

1505
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:36,479
Lives we saved.

1506
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,980
Or wanted to save.

1507
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:39,815
Maybe these two are our chance.

1508
01:12:41,317 --> 01:12:42,944
To be remembered.

1509
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,070
The way we deserve.

1510
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,615
- Yes.
- An ending.

1511
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:49,283
- Legacy.
- Yes!

1512
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,035
Yes! Let this man cook.

1513
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:52,453
This is what I'm talking about.

1514
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,455
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1515
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:55,748
Everybody working together.

1516
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,583
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1517
01:12:57,667 --> 01:13:00,044
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1518
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,129
- Yes! Gambit?
- I ain't know my daddy,

1519
01:13:02,213 --> 01:13:04,131
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1520
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:06,050
Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1521
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,094
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1522
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:10,054
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1523
01:13:10,137 --> 01:13:12,473
Johnny must have loved you.

1524
01:13:12,557 --> 01:13:14,767
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1525
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:15,851
The name's Laura.

1526
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:18,896
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

1527
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,231
It's on like chicken and corn.

1528
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:21,649
- Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1529
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:22,775
You're all fuckin' dead.

1530
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,986
My God! Read the room.

1531
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:39,208
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin' for company.
Get out of here.

1532
01:13:41,294 --> 01:13:42,336
You remind me of him.

1533
01:13:42,962 --> 01:13:44,714
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1534
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:46,716
- Sounds like a great guy--
- Wasn't finished.

1535
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:50,261
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1536
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:54,098
Couldn't help it.

1537
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:58,728
You might not know it, but...

1538
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:01,105
you're a good man, Logan.

1539
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,319
You might not know it, but apparently,
I'm the worst Logan.

1540
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:09,989
I got to have a life because of you.

1541
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:14,535
I got to grow up because of you.

1542
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:18,164
A lot of kids did.

1543
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:20,458
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1544
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,170
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1545
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:26,922
That suit says different.

1546
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:29,675
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1547
01:14:31,761 --> 01:14:33,387
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1548
01:14:35,723 --> 01:14:38,225
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1549
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:41,312
All of them.

1550
01:14:42,647 --> 01:14:45,816
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1551
01:14:46,442 --> 01:14:49,487
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1552
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,991
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1553
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,832
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1554
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:03,000
the humans came...

1555
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,002
and went mutant hunting.

1556
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,505
I can guess the rest.

1557
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:08,589
No, no, let me...

1558
01:15:10,132 --> 01:15:11,133
Let me say it. I...

1559
01:15:13,886 --> 01:15:14,887
I need to say it.

1560
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:20,017
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1561
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:21,435
it was too late.

1562
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:27,191
They were dead. Every...

1563
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:36,158
This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1564
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,203
And what I did.

1565
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:53,926
We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.

1566
01:15:54,844 --> 01:15:56,846
Have fun. Not my fight.

1567
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:01,684
We won't pull this off without you.

1568
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:11,902
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1569
01:16:14,989 --> 01:16:16,449
You were always the wrong guy.

1570
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:43,184
What?

1571
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:45,686
Alioth didn't get them.

1572
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,980
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1573
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:49,148
<i>They got away.</i>

1574
01:16:49,231 --> 01:16:50,649
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1575
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:52,234
Good. All right. Phew.

1576
01:16:52,318 --> 01:16:54,361
<i>- The others found them.</i>
- Oh, very cute.

1577
01:16:54,445 --> 01:16:56,363
Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1578
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,032
<i>- You really got me there.</i>
- Relax.

1579
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:01,118
If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

1580
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:03,329
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1581
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:05,498
Why do you think we put her there
in the first place?

1582
01:17:05,581 --> 01:17:07,666
Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.

1583
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,377
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1584
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:11,462
I cannot take any chances.

1585
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:12,671
Well, maybe not.

1586
01:17:12,755 --> 01:17:13,756
<i>But I can.</i>

1587
01:17:13,839 --> 01:17:15,257
For a price.

1588
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:16,675
<i>Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?</i>

1589
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:18,052
It's so icky.

1590
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:19,929
<i>- You want it done or not?</i>
- All right. Your price.

1591
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:21,347
<i>Take her out.</i>

1592
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:23,682

1645
01:19:29,224 --> 01:19:31,477
Whoo! I'm about to make
a name for myself here.

1646
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,479
I don't think you guys
walk away from this.

1647
01:19:33,562 --> 01:19:35,439
You just make sure people know
what happened here today.

1648
01:19:35,522 --> 01:19:37,691
And when you get out of here,
you have a drink for me, yeah?

1649
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:40,069
You just stay on our six and get inside.

1650
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:42,112
We'll make sure you get the package.

1651
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,948
And we'll get our ending.

1652
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:55,185
And boom!

1653
01:21:26,842 --> 01:21:29,053
Heh. Some motherfuckers still
trying to ice skate uphill.

1654
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,020
You two escaping, I could live with.

1655
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:41,065
But coming back? Willingly?

1656
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:44,568
Boys are so silly.

1657
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:45,736
I just need to get home.

1658
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:48,322
Well, that's not on the menu,
I'm afraid.

1659
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:51,742
It's death or enslavement.
À la carte, of course.

1660
01:21:51,825 --> 01:21:53,202
Upsy-daisy.

1661
01:21:58,499 --> 01:21:59,500
Finally,

1662
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:02,252
it's nice to give someone else
a chance to talk.

1663
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:03,504
Not my strong suit.

1664
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:22,648
You shouldn't have done that.

1665
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:43,836
<i>Adiós, pendejo.</i>

1666
01:22:45,963 --> 01:22:48,674
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1667
01:22:49,383 --> 01:22:52,469
I do feel like you get lost
behind all of his...

1668
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:58,183
Deadpools are a dime a dozen
here in The Void.

1669
01:22:59,143 --> 01:23:00,394
But you...

1670
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:03,897
What's going on in here?

1671
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:14,950
<i>Logan!</i>

1672
01:23:17,494 --> 01:23:18,704
Interesting...

1673
01:23:19,872 --> 01:23:21,748
Not what I expected back here.

1674
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,084
Behind the anger.

1675
01:23:28,005 --> 01:23:29,006
You're hiding.

1676
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:31,425
From them.

1677
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,177
From all the ones you let down.

1678
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:37,389
So much pain.

1679
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:41,185
I walked away.

1680
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:43,562
They called after me and I...

1681
01:23:43,645 --> 01:23:44,688
I walked away.

1682
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:46,982
I always do.

1683
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,066
- <i>Logan!</i>
- I know.

1684
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:51,904
That's not all you did.

1685
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:53,530
Is it?

1686
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,327
You found them.

1687
01:23:59,328 --> 01:24:00,746
The X-Men.

1688
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:06,752
Dead.

1689
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:10,714
Piled like wood.

1690
01:24:12,424 --> 01:24:13,675
<i>What did you do?</i>

1691
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:17,512
I started killing.

1692
01:24:18,305 --> 01:24:20,807
And I couldn't stop.
I didn't wanna stop.

1693
01:24:22,017 --> 01:24:24,728
<i>All those bad men.</i>

1694
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,275
It's not just the bad ones.

1695
01:24:31,944 --> 01:24:33,111
My little animal.

1696
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:38,992
And I turned the whole world
against the X-Men.

1697
01:24:39,076 --> 01:24:40,035
Blade!

1698
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:46,959
Just once...

1699
01:24:48,919 --> 01:24:51,463
I wanna be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1700
01:24:52,589 --> 01:24:53,799
Logan...

1701
01:24:55,384 --> 01:24:59,054
in The Void, you can be what you are.

1702
01:25:01,473 --> 01:25:02,933
I just wanna be free.

1703
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:05,519
I can set you free.

1704
01:25:16,488 --> 01:25:21,827
I can silence all those voices.

1705
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:29,793
I've got you.

1706
01:25:32,421 --> 01:25:33,630
I've got you.

1707
01:25:33,714 --> 01:25:35,132
No.

1708
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:37,384
I got you.

1709
01:25:45,392 --> 01:25:47,811
Get it off!

1710
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:49,271
You're gonna send us home,

1711
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:50,981
or I'm gonna twist
your fucking head off.

1712
01:25:51,064 --> 01:25:52,357
Why are you laughing?

1713
01:25:53,025 --> 01:25:54,318
I can't send you home

1714
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:57,237
unless you get this thing off my head.

1715
01:25:57,321 --> 01:25:58,989
And as soon as you do that,

1716
01:25:59,072 --> 01:26:01,325
I'm going to boil your brains
on an atomic level

1717
01:26:01,408 --> 01:26:04,369
whilst flicking my bean
to the Enya box set.

1718
01:26:04,453 --> 01:26:05,829
There's an Enya box set?

1719
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:07,331
Either you kill me

1720
01:26:07,414 --> 01:26:08,415
or I kill you.

1721
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,751
Both wonderful options.

1722
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:12,961
You want me to do it?

1723
01:26:13,045 --> 01:26:15,005
- No, I'll do it.
- I have her neck right here.

1724
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:16,673
- It's really no problem.
- You'll screw it up.

1725
01:26:16,757 --> 01:26:19,259
Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,
except the last one!

1726
01:26:19,343 --> 01:26:21,595
What the fuck?

1727
01:26:22,763 --> 01:26:24,848
You have no idea

1728
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:25,932
what it's like!

1729
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:28,894
Day after day. Shovel the shit.

1730
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:30,395
Fetch the meats.

1731
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:33,523
I have spent my entire exis--

1732
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:37,027
Not everyone gets a speech.

1733
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,113
She's gonna die.

1734
01:26:40,197 --> 01:26:42,199
Okay. Hey, hey.
If I take this helmet off,

1735
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:43,450
do you promise you won't kill us?

1736
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:44,576
- Fuck!
- I promise...

1737
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:46,286
I will kill you first thing.

1738
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,163
Oh! Why are you like this?

1739
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:49,498
I wish I knew.

1740
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:50,874
- Take it off.
- What?

1741
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:52,209
- Take it off.
- Why?

1742
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:53,585
- Just take it off.
- This is our only chance

1743
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:55,379
- to fix our shit!
- Take it off!

1744
01:26:57,214 --> 01:26:58,673
I am wearing this suit.

1745
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:02,010
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all...

1746
01:27:03,512 --> 01:27:04,846
it means I'm an X-Man.

1747
01:27:05,764 --> 01:27:07,265
And I know your brother.

1748
01:27:09,393 --> 01:27:10,894
As much as I want to fucking kill you,

1749
01:27:10,977 --> 01:27:13,772
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you,

1750
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:16,733
he would not let me stand here
and watch you die!

1751
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:20,404
Take your hands off.

1752
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:23,323
This is for him.

1753
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:26,493
This is for Charles.

1754
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:38,630
Hey, no, no, no!

1755
01:27:38,713 --> 01:27:40,090
Don't you dare do me like Johnny!

1756
01:27:45,846 --> 01:27:47,305
My brother loved you.

1757
01:27:49,182 --> 01:27:50,725
He loved all of us.

1758
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:51,893
Hmm.

1759
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:54,855
Must be nice.

1760
01:27:55,564 --> 01:27:56,857
He would've loved you, too.

1761
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:00,902
If he knew about you...

1762
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:04,156
if he knew where you were,

1763
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,283
he would've torn a hole
in the fucking universe

1764
01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:07,659
to bring you home.

1765
01:28:11,246 --> 01:28:12,330
This is my home.

1766
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:15,542
Well, then at least let us save his.

1767
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:21,339
You want to hear something crazy?

1768
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,178
An amateur magician rolled
through here a while back.

1769
01:28:27,012 --> 01:28:28,555
I killed him, of course.

1770
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:31,516
Wore his skin around for four days.

1771
01:28:32,559 --> 01:28:36,396
But I found this little trinket

1772
01:28:37,147 --> 01:28:39,274
on his lovely fingers.

1773
01:28:39,357 --> 01:28:40,484
Strange!

1774
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:45,697
- Marvel sparkle circle.
- What is that?

1775
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,867
This is your way home.

1776
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,827
I do owe you for saving my life.

1777
01:28:50,911 --> 01:28:52,370
But let's keep things interesting.

1778
01:28:52,454 --> 01:28:54,289
I'd say you have about four seconds

1779
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:55,624
before you're Alioth's food.

1780
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,046
Race ya.

01:30:26,923 --> 01:30:28,174
{\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.

1797
01:30:28,258 --> 01:30:30,176
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1798
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,886
And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,

1799
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:33,805
so I'll see he gets
half the commission--

1800
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,600
Whoa.

1801
01:30:36,683 --> 01:30:38,602
That feels like a Kia.

1802
01:30:38,685 --> 01:30:41,062
It's a fucking Kia Carnival,
isn't it?

1803
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:45,191
Holy shit. That's Deadpool.

1804
01:30:45,275 --> 01:30:46,401
And that's Wolverine.

1805
01:30:46,484 --> 01:30:48,612
You're damn straight it is.
Fox killed him.

1806
01:30:48,695 --> 01:30:49,779
Disney brought him back.

1807
01:30:49,863 --> 01:30:51,323
They're going to make him
do this till he's 90.

1808
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:52,991
Let's go.

1809
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:54,701
I'll clock you out!

1810
01:30:54,784 --> 01:30:56,286
Forever!

1811
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,246
Forever.

1812
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:06,171
Wakey-wakey.

1813
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:08,340
God?

1814
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:12,385
Now, you put all these bullets
in my belly,

1815
01:31:13,094 --> 01:31:14,638
and I'm gonna find out why.

1816
01:31:15,305 --> 01:31:16,389
Whoa, whoa!

1817
01:31:17,057 --> 01:31:18,433
I'll just say it.

1818
01:31:19,142 --> 01:31:20,769
You don't have to stick
your fingers in me.

1819
01:31:20,852 --> 01:31:23,521
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

1820
01:31:23,605 --> 01:31:24,773
Fine.

1821
01:31:25,982 --> 01:31:26,983
Really?

1822
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:28,735
Hands in pockets.

1823
01:31:30,445 --> 01:31:31,613
Guy named Paradox.

1824
01:31:32,364 --> 01:31:33,615
He said he'd get me out of The Void.

1825
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:35,825
All I know is he works for the TVA.

1826
01:31:35,909 --> 01:31:37,952
The TVA. We had an agreement.

1827
01:31:38,036 --> 01:31:39,788
I don't think this guy cares.

1828
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:42,582
Huh. He will.

1829
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:44,084
Hey, people!

1830
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:46,336
How much longer before
the Time Ripper is active?

1831
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:48,296
We're running the final safety checks.

1832
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,423
Oh, okay. All right.
Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.

1833
01:31:50,507 --> 01:31:52,050
- Take your time.
- Really?

1834
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:53,718
No, you drooling boob!

1835
01:31:53,802 --> 01:31:55,136
No! We have company.

1836
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:58,223
Cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now!

1837
01:31:58,306 --> 01:31:59,849
Oh, I hate you so much.

1838
01:32:01,935 --> 01:32:02,936
No! Stop!

1839
01:32:03,019 --> 01:32:04,813
Piss off! You're too late.

1840
01:32:04,896 --> 01:32:06,815
- You're fuckin' done.
- Why was Thor crying?

1841
01:32:06,898 --> 01:32:10,235
How dare you!
No one comes back from The Void.

1842
01:32:10,318 --> 01:32:11,903
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1843
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:22,497
Paradox. We have a problem.

1844
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,668
Paradox.

1845
01:32:29,295 --> 01:32:31,589
Well, you are doughier than
you looked in Pyro's head.

1846
01:32:31,673 --> 01:32:33,049
You tried to kill me.

1847
01:32:33,133 --> 01:32:34,509
I literally have no i--

1848
01:32:35,093 --> 01:32:36,845
<i>You come for the king,</i>

1849
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:38,596
<i>you better kill the king.</i>

1850
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:39,806
Oh-ho-ho!

1851
01:32:39,889 --> 01:32:42,016
Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.

1852
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:44,185
You know she doesn't wash that hand.

1853
01:32:44,269 --> 01:32:46,020
Oh.

1854
01:32:46,104 --> 01:32:47,230
What's this?

1855
01:32:48,565 --> 01:32:49,774
A Time Ripper?

1856
01:32:49,858 --> 01:32:51,443
- Naughty boy.
- Oh, no. We're on it.

1857
01:32:51,526 --> 01:32:53,653
We're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1858
01:32:53,737 --> 01:32:56,114
We got ya, boo.
You just keep playing those keys.

1859
01:32:56,197 --> 01:32:57,699
I don't want to destroy it.

1860
01:32:58,366 --> 01:33:00,034
I want to use it.

1861
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:02,829
Now, shoo. Mummy and Daddy
are having a conversation.

1862
01:33:09,461 --> 01:33:11,337
You know, the funny thing is,

1863
01:33:11,421 --> 01:33:12,881
I was happy in The Void.

1864
01:33:13,923 --> 01:33:16,926
You sent your trash to me.
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

1865
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:18,970
Everyone was happy.

1866
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:23,016
And then you had to go
and piss on my side of the fence.

1867
01:33:23,099 --> 01:33:25,268
And so now the fence must come down.

1868
01:33:25,977 --> 01:33:27,896
I'm going to use
your little Time Ripper.

1869
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:30,648
And I'm going to destroy this universe

1870
01:33:30,732 --> 01:33:33,526
and the next and the next and the next

1871
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:37,030
until all that's left is The Void.

1872
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:39,073
And I get to play God.

1873
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:41,034
Come on.

1874
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:43,912
Now you're going to show me
how to use this fancy gadget of yours.

1875
01:33:43,995 --> 01:33:45,997
And don't worry,
I've called some friends

1876
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,457
to make sure we're not disturbed.

1877
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:52,086
Sorry to bother, madam,

1878
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:53,713
but there's something you need to see.

1879
01:33:54,255 --> 01:33:56,508
We're getting indications
of an unsanctioned Time Ripper

1880
01:33:56,591 --> 01:33:58,760
activating on Earth-10005.

1881
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:01,638
Whose district is that?

1882
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:03,556
Paradox.

1883
01:34:15,026 --> 01:34:17,403
Well, thank you so much
for your help, darling.

1884
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:19,906
God. Good to get out of that head.

1885
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,825
Whew! What a mess!

1886
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:30,166
Stop!

1887
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:32,335
Let's give it a beat
for the extras to clear.

1888
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,337
Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God!

1889
01:34:39,259 --> 01:34:41,803
- Oh. My. God.
- Fuck.

1890
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:51,104
It's her!

1891
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:54,148

1892
01:34:56,693 --> 01:34:58,695

1893
01:34:58,778 --> 01:35:00,405

1899
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:17,755
That's my girl!

1900
01:35:17,839 --> 01:35:21,301
We don't have to be apart
ever, ever again. Never, ever...

1901
01:35:21,384 --> 01:35:22,552
- Sorry!
- Fuck!

1902
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,597
What's Café Gratitude doing here?

1903
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,015
Sorry about that.

1904
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:29,267
Tremble not,
sweet Mary Puppins.

1905
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:30,393
I'll handle him.

1906
01:35:31,144 --> 01:35:32,270
Come here, girl. Papa's here.

1907
01:35:32,353 --> 01:35:35,398
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

1908
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,609
She can decide who her papa is.

1909
01:35:37,692 --> 01:35:38,818
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

1910
01:35:38,902 --> 01:35:41,279
Original recipe or Van Milder here?

1911
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:44,782
Ah, that's funny.
I can gently tap the fourth wall too.

1912
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,576
<i>The Proposal.</i>

1913
01:35:48,077 --> 01:35:49,203
The fuck was that?

1914
01:35:49,287 --> 01:35:50,872
Bitch, you think that's what I do?

1915
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:52,165
Both of you shut up.

1916
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:53,958
You smell somethin'?

1917
01:35:54,042 --> 01:35:55,043
Yeah, you.

1918
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:57,503
A lot of you.

1919
01:36:12,727 --> 01:36:14,938
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

1920
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,659
That's bad.

1921
01:36:50,223 --> 01:36:51,516
I take it they're not friendly.

1922
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:52,976
Goodness, no.

1923
01:36:53,059 --> 01:36:54,769
Sorry about this, boys. Mission over.

1924
01:36:54,852 --> 01:36:57,563
Cause of death,
one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.

1925
01:36:57,647 --> 01:36:58,731
They're dumb.

1926
01:36:58,815 --> 01:37:00,483
But they can fight. Not me, though.

1927
01:37:00,566 --> 01:37:01,734
Would love to get in the mix,

1928
01:37:01,818 --> 01:37:04,654
but I have low bone density
and I have to keep my face safe.

1929
01:37:04,737 --> 01:37:06,072
Hold, please.

1930
01:37:06,155 --> 01:37:08,116
- Oh, God.
- All right. Look.

1931
01:37:08,783 --> 01:37:09,784
Guys!

1932
01:37:10,994 --> 01:37:12,829
Deadpool Prime here.

1933
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:14,247
- Our fight isn't with you--
- Hey!

1934
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,915
When I want your opinion,

1935
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:18,042
I'll take Wolverine's dick
out of your mouth.

1936
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:19,794
That's Kidpool. She's the dirtiest.

1937
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:21,379
Can we just be done?

1938
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:22,922
Ooh,
we're just getting started.

1939
01:37:23,006 --> 01:37:26,509
No, no, no, no, no.
With the whole multiverse thing.

1940
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:28,302
It's not great.

1941
01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:29,929
It's just been miss

1942
01:37:30,638 --> 01:37:32,098
after miss

1943
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:33,766
after miss.

1944
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:36,602
Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
did the multiverse first,

1945
01:37:36,686 --> 01:37:38,730
and they did it best. The gays knew it.

1946
01:37:39,522 --> 01:37:40,648
But we didn't listen.

1947
01:37:40,732 --> 01:37:43,693
Let's just take the L and move on.

1948
01:37:43,776 --> 01:37:46,195
I think it's been
steadily great since <i>Endgame.</i>

1949
01:37:46,279 --> 01:37:47,697
What are you talking about?

1950
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,449
The multiverse is over.

1951
01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:52,493
Cassandy gonna destroy
the fuck outta every timeline.

1952
01:37:52,577 --> 01:37:55,038
- Heh. Y'all can't do shit about it.
- Do you not get it?

1953
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:57,206
If we don't go down to the subway
and stop her, we all die.

1954
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:59,625
Say, the boss lady
don't want no disturbances.

1955
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:02,503
You wanna get down to the subway,
you gotta go through us.

1956
01:38:02,587 --> 01:38:03,629
Uzi time, baby.

1957
01:38:03,713 --> 01:38:04,922
Uzi time, baby.

1958
01:38:05,006 --> 01:38:06,466
Look alive!

1959
01:38:15,683 --> 01:38:17,351
- I think I'm hit.
- No shit.

1960
01:38:17,435 --> 01:38:18,436
You did that on purpose.

1961
01:38:18,519 --> 01:38:20,146
I did no such thing!

1962
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:21,314
Listen to me, gorgeous.

1963
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:22,732
How long does it take
for you to regenerate?

1964
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:24,400
Regenerate?

1965
01:38:30,406 --> 01:38:32,158
You really are
God's perfect idiot, aren't you?

1966
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:33,785
- I'm okay.
- How dare you!

1967
01:38:33,868 --> 01:38:35,870
You insensitive son of a bitch!

1968
01:38:35,953 --> 01:38:37,872
How was I supposed to know
he doesn't regenerate?

1969
01:38:37,955 --> 01:38:39,040
I'm not a medicine woman.

1970
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:40,750
Look. A donut cart.

1971
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,126
- They're practically hospitals.
- What?

1972
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:43,461
They sell portable triage units.

1973
01:38:43,544 --> 01:38:45,379
- They don't.
- I'm gonna get you to safety.

1974
01:38:45,463 --> 01:38:47,048
- He's not.
- Deep breath.

1975
01:38:55,473 --> 01:38:59,018
- Hey, why are we stopping?
- I'm just catching my breath.

1976
01:38:59,102 --> 01:39:01,687
What, are your legs on vacation?
You're dead weight!

1977
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,523
That's because I'm paralyzed.

1978
01:39:03,606 --> 01:39:05,608
We all have problems.
Listen to me.

1979
01:39:05,691 --> 01:39:06,651
You're gonna live.

1980
01:39:07,568 --> 01:39:09,028
Look at me, Nicepool.

1981
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:14,158
You're gonna live.

1982
01:39:14,992 --> 01:39:16,244
Say it!

1983
01:39:16,786 --> 01:39:17,995
I'm gonna live.

1984
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:20,456
Say it with me. You're gonna live.

1985
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:22,667
I'm gonna live!

1986
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:26,170
Ha-hah! Say it louder!

1987
01:39:26,254 --> 01:39:27,505
I'm gonna live--

1988
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:38,057
Hold your fire!

1989
01:39:39,684 --> 01:39:40,935
Sweet little puppy.

1990
01:39:51,237 --> 01:39:52,822
God damn it!

1991
01:39:52,905 --> 01:39:54,240
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1992
01:39:54,907 --> 01:39:56,701
God, he loved his face.

1993
01:39:56,784 --> 01:39:59,245
I can taste his final thought.

1994
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:00,746
He was so afraid.

1995
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:02,081
But he died a hero.

1996
01:40:02,165 --> 01:40:04,083
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

1997
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,043
And all I have
to remember him by

1998
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:10,506
are these two gold-plated,
.50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.

1999
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:11,924
This is for him.

2000
01:40:12,675 --> 01:40:13,843
Are you ready?

2001
01:40:14,427 --> 01:40:16,262
I get to kill a hundred yous?

2002
01:40:16,345 --> 01:40:17,430
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

2003
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:21,267
- Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.
- That's a good girl.

Uh-oh.

01:43:20,154 --> 01:43:21,614
I guess these ones regenerate.

2051
01:43:23,783 --> 01:43:26,243
Come on. We don't have time for this.

2052
01:43:26,327 --> 01:43:27,328
Deadpools!

2053
01:43:27,411 --> 01:43:28,579
Stand down.

2054
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:40,591
This Deadpool's with me.

2055
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:41,967
Oh, no.

2056
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,469
Holy shit.

2057
01:43:43,552 --> 01:43:44,970
That's fuckin' Peter!

2058
01:43:47,723 --> 01:43:49,475
Wait, you...
You guys know Peter?

2059
01:43:49,558 --> 01:43:52,061
You kidding me?
Every Deadpool has a Peter.

2060
01:43:52,144 --> 01:43:54,438
Shit.
Peter's a goddamn legend

2061
01:43:54,522 --> 01:43:55,815
in every Deadpool's world.

2062
01:43:55,898 --> 01:43:58,359
Peter-<i>san. Hai.</i>

2063
01:44:05,491 --> 01:44:07,535
Peter. Peter. Peter.

2064
01:44:07,618 --> 01:44:10,913
Peter. Peter. Peter.
Peter. Peter. Peter.

2065
01:44:10,996 --> 01:44:13,082
Peter. Peter. Peter.

2066
01:44:13,707 --> 01:44:15,251
Enjoy my Peter.

2067
01:44:42,778 --> 01:44:44,738
Oh, now you're here.
Oh, well, you're too late.

2068
01:44:44,822 --> 01:44:46,532
- It's all over.
- Not yet, it's not.

2069
01:44:46,615 --> 01:44:48,159
Whoa. No, no, no.
We're very close.

2070
01:44:48,242 --> 01:44:49,452
Homestretch, folks. Promise.

2071
01:44:49,535 --> 01:44:51,287
Quick, let's up the stakes.

2072
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,830
If she steals the Time Ripper's energy,

2073
01:44:52,913 --> 01:44:55,249
she has the power to shred
the fabric of all realities

2074
01:44:55,332 --> 01:44:56,959
until there is nothing left
but The Void.

2075
01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:58,210
How do we shut it down?

2076
01:44:58,294 --> 01:44:59,545
I don't know.

2077
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,506
How about now?

2078
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:04,467
The mask
is really intimidating, huh?

2079
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:06,051
It's like Batman,
except he can move his neck.

2080
01:45:06,135 --> 01:45:07,636
Okay, look, look, look.

2081
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:11,599
The Ripper is fed from
a secure chamber below ground.

2082
01:45:11,682 --> 01:45:14,685
It is powered by twin matter
and anti-matter feeds

2083
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:15,978
<i>converging inside the device.</i>

2084
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:18,439
<i>Now, Cassandra Nova
is redirecting the Ripper's power</i>

2085
01:45:18,522 --> 01:45:20,733
to eliminate all timelines,
starting with this one.

2086
01:45:20,816 --> 01:45:22,234
Theoretically, you could stop her

2087
01:45:22,318 --> 01:45:24,195
by short-circuiting the feeds
in the chamber below.

2088
01:45:24,278 --> 01:45:26,780
One of you were to create
a circuit between the two feeds,

2089
01:45:26,864 --> 01:45:30,159
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

2090
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:31,952
- But, well... But--
- Come on, man.

2091
01:45:32,036 --> 01:45:34,121
If you're not gonna swallow,
spit it out.

2092
01:45:34,205 --> 01:45:37,333
Whoever formed the bridge
would be annihilated.

2093
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,334
I could live with that.

2094
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:39,543
Yeah, I could live
with that, too, actually.

2095
01:45:39,627 --> 01:45:41,086
You know, we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

2096
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,796
Not this time.

2097
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,090
This is matter and anti-matter.

2098
01:45:45,174 --> 01:45:47,176
They do not play nicely with each other.

2099
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:50,012
When they mix in your body,
you will be atomized.

2100
01:45:50,638 --> 01:45:52,681
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

2101
01:45:52,765 --> 01:45:54,850
Even if you lived long enough
to make the circuit,

2102
01:45:54,934 --> 01:45:57,436
you will die down there.

2103
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,255
Hold off. Hold.

2104
01:46:24,338 --> 01:46:25,923
You heard that asshole upstairs.

2105
01:46:26,006 --> 01:46:30,177
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead. Permanently.

2106
01:46:30,761 --> 01:46:32,805
- That's why it's got to be me.
- What?

2107
01:46:36,725 --> 01:46:38,018
Look, man...

2108
01:46:38,811 --> 01:46:40,437
you didn't ask for any of this.

2109
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,022
You were right.

2110
01:46:42,106 --> 01:46:43,482
I lied.

2111
01:46:44,358 --> 01:46:46,151
I lied right to your face

2112
01:46:46,235 --> 01:46:48,112
just to get you to help me. And you did.

2113
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:50,364
You didn't lie.

2114
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:53,867
You made an educated wish.

2115
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:57,955
Come on.

2116
01:46:59,123 --> 01:47:00,958
You got a whole world to go back to.

2117
01:47:02,585 --> 01:47:03,586
I got nothin'.

2118
01:47:05,754 --> 01:47:06,755
I got nothin'.

2119
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:12,845
Give me this.

2120
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:20,978
Hey.

2121
01:47:25,608 --> 01:47:27,443
I waited a long time for this team-up.

2122
01:47:29,737 --> 01:47:31,196
You know something?

2123
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:34,241
You were the best Wolverine.

2124
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:44,793
Say hi to your friends for me.

2125
01:47:56,764 --> 01:47:57,973
No!

2126
01:47:58,057 --> 01:47:59,099
Open the door!

2127
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:02,019
I can't hear you
over all the noble sacrifice.

2128
01:48:02,102 --> 01:48:03,187
Why are you fucking doing this?

2129
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,482
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

2130
01:48:08,192 --> 01:48:09,193
Or Spock.

2131
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:11,779
Hard to say.

2132
01:48:16,116 --> 01:48:17,326
Wade!

2133
01:48:17,785 --> 01:48:19,620
You fucking idiot!

2134
01:48:23,749 --> 01:48:25,876
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

2135
01:48:26,627 --> 01:48:28,879
I think I'm nervous about dying.

2136
01:48:28,962 --> 01:48:30,631
This should be me.

2137
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,841
Say hi to
my friends for me, peanut.

2138
01:48:32,925 --> 01:48:33,884
Wade!

2139
01:48:33,967 --> 01:48:36,303
You want to be an annoying prick,
do it this side!

2140
01:48:36,387 --> 01:48:38,305
You're gonna die in there,
you dumb fuck!

2141
01:48:45,396 --> 01:48:47,106
Hey! You don't need to do this.

2142
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:49,149
I'm not doing it
'cause I need it.

2143
01:48:50,109 --> 01:48:52,194
I'm doing it because they do.

2144
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,707
No!

2145
01:49:33,777 --> 01:49:35,154
He's not gonna make it.

2146
01:49:43,996 --> 01:49:44,955

You've been busy.

2189
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:47,054
Well, somebody had to be.

2190
01:52:47,137 --> 01:52:49,056
We had some strange readings
from this location.

2191
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:52,017
You wouldn't know anything about
an unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?

2192
01:52:52,935 --> 01:52:56,188
Uh, no. No. I wouldn't know anything
about an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

2193
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:57,856
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.

2194
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,149
Because I was assured

2195
01:52:59,232 --> 01:53:01,109
that she was safely held in The Void.

2196
01:53:01,193 --> 01:53:03,946
But no, she was here.
And she fondled my brain.

2197
01:53:04,029 --> 01:53:06,073
- How did you let this happen?
- You weren't involved at all?

2198
01:53:06,156 --> 01:53:08,825
In stopping her, yes! Yes, I was.

2199
01:53:08,909 --> 01:53:10,535
But not nearly enough.

2200
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:12,829
Not as much as the men
who went down there after her.

2201
01:53:13,497 --> 01:53:14,581
My men.

2202
01:53:15,332 --> 01:53:16,333
My friends.

2203
01:53:17,417 --> 01:53:18,251
I warned them.

2204
01:53:18,335 --> 01:53:20,462
That they would be completely
obliterated if they went.

2205
01:53:20,545 --> 01:53:22,047
But they went anyway. Like...

2206
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,217
Like heroes.

2207
01:53:27,052 --> 01:53:29,221
Because that's who they were.

2208
01:53:31,598 --> 01:53:33,016
They just did what they had to do.

2209
01:53:34,351 --> 01:53:35,894
With no concern for their own safety.

2210
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:43,026
The fact that we are
all still standing here

2211
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:45,737
is a testament to their heroism.

2212
01:53:49,574 --> 01:53:51,952
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
to bring them back now.

2213
01:53:53,787 --> 01:53:55,539
He has risen, baby girl.

2214
01:53:55,622 --> 01:53:56,623

And we're doing just fine,
you piece of shit.

2221
01:54:20,272 --> 01:54:21,898
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

2222
01:54:21,982 --> 01:54:23,275
Fine indeed.

2223
01:54:23,358 --> 01:54:26,194
All right.
Put your greasy tits away,

2224
01:54:26,278 --> 01:54:27,320
you preening slut.

2225
01:54:27,404 --> 01:54:29,781
I don't understand.

2226
01:54:29,865 --> 01:54:31,033
How are you two still alive?

2227
01:54:31,116 --> 01:54:33,160
You were right.
One of us would have been killed.

2228
01:54:33,243 --> 01:54:34,953
But you put a Deadpool

2229
01:54:35,037 --> 01:54:36,496
and a Wolverine together,

2230
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:38,749
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

2231
01:54:38,832 --> 01:54:40,792
indestructible, motherfucker.

2232
01:54:41,418 --> 01:54:43,628
Let's get this Deadpool Variant
back to The Void.

2233
01:54:43,712 --> 01:54:45,630
- Wait, hold on. What?
- Nope. Actually...

2234
01:54:45,714 --> 01:54:47,382
This one's homegrown, like me.

2235
01:54:47,466 --> 01:54:48,467
He belongs here.

2236
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:49,843
And you are?

2237
01:54:49,926 --> 01:54:52,554
Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.

2238
01:54:54,347 --> 01:54:55,432
And I hope that you do.

2239
01:55:01,855 --> 01:55:03,356
What the fuck is happening here?

2240
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,192
You are under judgment

2241
01:55:05,275 --> 01:55:07,069
for operating
an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

2242
01:55:07,152 --> 01:55:08,403
- Take him.
- I was just doing what

2243
01:55:08,487 --> 01:55:09,946
you don't have the guts to do.

2244
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:13,825
Get your insolent hands off me! Get off!

2245
01:55:15,202 --> 01:55:16,745
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

2246
01:55:17,704 --> 01:55:19,331
Let's hold the bows.

2247
01:55:19,414 --> 01:55:21,374
You led an Omega-level mutant
to this timeline.

2248
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:23,001
- You're welcome.
- And you

2249
01:55:23,085 --> 01:55:25,629
- shouldn't even be near this timeline.
- He's welcome.

2250
01:55:25,712 --> 01:55:28,590
And you look damn good in that suit.

2251
01:55:28,673 --> 01:55:30,050
I'm so sorry.

2252
01:55:34,304 --> 01:55:35,931
I wanna show you something.

2253
01:55:37,015 --> 01:55:38,016
Something huge.

2254
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,102
That's what
Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

2255
01:55:41,269 --> 01:55:42,229
Do you see that?

2256
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:45,357
Your universe is regenerating.

2257
01:55:46,149 --> 01:55:47,818
Whatever you did here,

2258
01:55:47,901 --> 01:55:49,778
you not only saved your world.

2259
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,697
You spared your timeline
from extinction.

2260
01:55:54,533 --> 01:55:55,909
I'd rest up.

2261
01:55:55,992 --> 01:55:58,203
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

2262
01:55:58,286 --> 01:56:00,413
Till you're 90.

2263
01:56:00,497 --> 01:56:01,873
Wait! Um...

2264
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:05,252
We couldn't have made it out
of The Void without some help

2265
01:56:06,086 --> 01:56:08,505
from some people that the world kind of...

2266
01:56:09,089 --> 01:56:10,298
kind of forgot.

2267
01:56:10,382 --> 01:56:12,884
Is there any way that
you could maybe find a way

2268
01:56:12,968 --> 01:56:14,177
to bring them home?

2269
01:56:15,929 --> 01:56:17,305
I'll see what I can do.

2270
01:56:17,389 --> 01:56:19,975
And, um,
I promised my friend here

2271
01:56:20,058 --> 01:56:23,436
that the TVA could undo
some pretty awful shit in his timeline.

2272
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,604
What would you say to that?

2273
01:56:24,688 --> 01:56:26,106
Change the past?

2274
01:56:26,648 --> 01:56:28,942
Well, he did
help me save the world.

2275
01:56:29,025 --> 01:56:31,361
And his past made him
the man who did it.

2276
01:56:32,445 --> 01:56:34,698
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

2277
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:37,409
Logan.

2278
01:56:40,579 --> 01:56:42,372
- Shawarma? Yeah.
- I could eat.

2279
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:54,509
You know, the Avengers
discovered shawarma.

2280
01:56:55,635 --> 01:56:57,137
They'd be lucky to have you.

2281
01:57:04,144 --> 01:57:06,730
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

2282
01:57:06,813 --> 01:57:07,856
Fuck off!

2283
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,483
Come here, my little cunchkin.

2284
01:57:10,567 --> 01:57:11,860
Yes, it's you.

2285
01:57:11,943 --> 01:57:13,904
You're a survivor.

2286
01:57:13,987 --> 01:57:15,071
Mwah.

2287
01:57:15,155 --> 01:57:16,948
Oh, all is right in the world.

2288
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:19,242
Yes, it is.

2289
01:57:21,036 --> 01:57:22,454
So what are you gonna do next?

2290
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:25,832
I'll figure it out. I always do.

2291
01:57:26,499 --> 01:57:27,709
All right.

2292
01:57:28,877 --> 01:57:30,503
So I'll probably see you around?

2293
01:57:35,133 --> 01:57:36,134
Probably not.

2294
01:57:39,471 --> 01:57:40,472
See you, bub.

2295
01:57:50,106 --> 01:57:51,191
Logan.

2296
01:57:57,697 --> 01:57:59,366
Al. I'm back.

2297
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:01,409
About damn time.

2298
01:58:01,493 --> 01:58:04,204
You holdin'?
I'm all outta devil's dandruff,

2299
01:58:04,287 --> 01:58:06,539
and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.

2300
01:58:06,623 --> 01:58:08,500
Thank you, Al. We have company.

2301
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:10,627
Althea, this is...

2302
01:58:11,378 --> 01:58:12,420
This is Logan.

2303
01:58:12,504 --> 01:58:14,714
- Nice to meet you, Logan.
- Nice to meet you, too.

2304
01:58:14,798 --> 01:58:18,218
And this little ancient anal shit-knot
is Mary Puppins.

2305
01:58:18,301 --> 01:58:20,887
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

2306
01:58:20,971 --> 01:58:22,931
You want to treat yourself
to a little stroke?

2307
01:58:24,307 --> 01:58:27,769
- Get the tongue. There it is.
- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!

2308
01:58:27,852 --> 01:58:31,231
Right? It's like an armadillo
fucked a gremlin, angrily,

2309
01:58:31,314 --> 01:58:32,899
- in a bed of gonorrhea...
- Wow.

2310
01:58:32,983 --> 01:58:35,110
...and didn't stop till
the sun came up.

2311
01:58:36,528 --> 01:58:38,113
<i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>

2312
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:41,533
<i>Turns out that you don't need
to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>

2313
01:58:42,492 --> 01:58:44,744
<i>You just need to open
your eyes and look around.</i>

2314
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:46,454
<i>And if you're lucky,</i>

2315
01:58:47,455 --> 01:58:48,748
<i>you'll find a few friends.</i>

2316
01:58:49,332 --> 01:58:50,333
<i>Old friends,</i>

2317
01:58:51,376 --> 01:58:53,503
<i>and some new ones too.</i>

2318
01:58:57,799 --> 01:58:59,718
Give me the fucking dog.
Talk to the girl.

2319
01:59:10,312 --> 01:59:11,521
Oh, hi.

2320
01:59:11,604 --> 01:59:13,231
Hi.

2321
01:59:14,858 --> 01:59:16,276
You've been busy.

2322
01:59:19,362 --> 01:59:20,739
I did it for you.

2323
01:59:22,907 --> 01:59:25,243
And even if you don't want me,
I... I did it for you.

2324
01:59:34,502 --> 01:59:35,503
<i>Turns out,</i>

2325
01:59:36,338 --> 01:59:37,756
<i>I am the world-saving type.</i>

2326
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:40,675
<i>Just look around this table
if you want proof.</i>

2327
01:59:41,676 --> 01:59:42,677
<i>And the best part?</i>

2328
01:59:43,595 --> 01:59:45,347
<i>Sometimes the people we save,</i>

2329
01:59:46,389 --> 01:59:47,682

<i>You know, I just always felt

2358
02:01:47,802 --> 02:01:50,847
I was there for three weeks
before I shot a single thing.

2359
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:52,474
{\an8}At our first day of shooting,

2360
02:01:53,016 --> 02:01:54,517
<i>I was so nervous, man.</i>

2361
02:01:55,101 --> 02:01:57,270
Everyone was sort of going,
"Who's this guy?"

2362
02:01:57,353 --> 02:02:00,773
<i>You know, there was a lot of that and,
you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"</i>

2363
02:02:00,857 --> 02:02:02,817
You can feel all that kind of pressure.

2364
02:02:04,152 --> 02:02:07,322
It's always the suit's fault.
Never the actor.

2365
02:02:15,914 --> 02:02:17,540
- This is...
- The only way.

2366
02:02:17,624 --> 02:02:20,168
<i>♪ It's something unpredictable ♪</i>

Ah, so this is what it feels like.

2370
02:02:31,471 --> 02:02:33,097
And there's the lights.

2371
02:02:33,181 --> 02:02:34,516
For medical research.

2372
02:02:35,141 --> 02:02:36,976
- Bye-bye, video.
- Bye.

2373
02:06:51,105 --> 02:06:53,775
I'm tired of
these absolutely vile rumors

2374
02:06:53,858 --> 02:06:54,984
that I got Johnny killed.

2375
02:06:56,068 --> 02:06:57,111
Let's look at the tape.

2376
02:06:58,362 --> 02:06:59,614
<i>In The Void,</i>

2377
02:06:59,697 --> 02:07:02,366
<i>you're either food for Alioth
or you work for her.</i>

2378
02:07:05,953 --> 02:07:06,954
Go on, Johnny.

2379
02:07:07,413 --> 02:07:08,831
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2380
02:07:08,915 --> 02:07:09,916
Cassandra Nova.

2381
02:07:09,999 --> 02:07:12,335
A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.

2382
02:07:12,418 --> 02:07:14,295
A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab

2383
02:07:14,378 --> 02:07:17,048
of third rate dime-store nut-milk.
And I'll tell you what she can do.

2384
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:18,716
- I'm listening.
- She can lick

2385
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,636
my goddamn cinnamon ring clean
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2386
02:07:21,719 --> 02:07:24,013
In fact, I don't give a shit
if she removes all my skin

2387
02:07:24,096 --> 02:07:26,057
and pops me like
some nightmarish blood balloon.

2388
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,183
If the last thing I do

2389
02:07:27,266 --> 02:07:29,185
in this godforsaken cum-gutter existence

2390
02:07:29,268 --> 02:07:31,562
is light that fuck-box on fire,
I still won't die happy.

2391
02:07:31,646 --> 02:07:33,815
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2392
02:07:33,898 --> 02:07:36,442
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until I've urinated

2393
02:07:36,526 --> 02:07:37,944
on her freshly barbecued corpse

2394
02:07:38,027 --> 02:07:39,737
and husk-fucked the charred remains

2395
02:07:39,821 --> 02:07:42,156
- while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.
- Wow!

2396
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:43,699
- And you can quote me.
- 'Kay.

2397
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,035
Got you, fuckface.
