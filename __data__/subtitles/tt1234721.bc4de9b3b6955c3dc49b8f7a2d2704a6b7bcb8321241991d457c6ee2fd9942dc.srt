1
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:01,103
What if I told you that even the worst

2
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:05,054
neighborhood in America
could be made completely safe.

3
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,923
What if I told you that
this can be accomplished

4
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,816
without risking the life of one
single law enforcement officer.

5
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,453
How do I know this? Because
this is happening now.

6
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:19,456
In every country in
the world but this one

7
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:26,296
I'm Pat Novak, and
welcome to Novak Element.

8
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:30,936
In tonight's State of the Union segment,

9
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,742
we'll be joined by
General, "Curtis Monroe"

10
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,500
live from the war room at the Pentagon.

11
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
General "Monroe", Welcome back.

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,474
Good to see you, "Pat".

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,453
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

14
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:48,500
Can you walk us through
what we're seeing here.

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,069
This is a routine
operation, We found that

16
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,251
random patrols help
the local population.

17
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:56,441
Feel safer, and to trust us.

18
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,561
It's amazing.

19
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:01,500
And, what are these colored dots
that we're seeing here general?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,019
These are our assets on the ground.

21
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:08,209
In green we got the "ED209s"
They're the big boys.

22
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,318
They secure the perimeter.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,264
Purple are the smaller "EM
208s" They sweep and mop up.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,211
And the red dots Pat
that's your film crew.

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,181
It's great to see
American machines helping

26
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,525
to promote peace and freedom abroad.

27
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:27,500
This is standard Op alright,
there is no opposition expected.

28
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,627
I'm gonna set your markers to code red.

29
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:36,092
All our drones are going to
give top priority to your safety.

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,419
No red assets have ever been lost.

31
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:39,500
OK

32
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,500
Does this make you feel better?

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,317
But listen, keep those
bracelets on you completely safe.

34
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,067
Okay? Good.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Enjoy the show!

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Alright, let's go.

37
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,000
(Robotic voice) May peace be upon you.

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,377
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,175
For a non-evasive scanning procedure.

40
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:11,643
No one will be harmed.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,280
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised.

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,359
For a non-evasive scanning procedure.

43
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,109
Scott, get me a shot of this.

44
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,205
Incredible. Incredible!

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,294
Not long ago that
would have been American

46
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,943
men and women risking their lives.

47
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:01,500
To pacify these people.

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,901
General, care to comment on this?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,413
Well, Pat, We had Vietnam, we
had Iraq we had Afghanistan,

50
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,394
Never again. From a military
perspective this has been invaluable.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,307
We can accomplish our objectives
without any loss to American lives.

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,922
And I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.

53
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,500
Why wouldn't they?

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,540
For the first time in their lives, they
get to watch their children grow up.

55
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:34,461
In an environment of
safety and security.

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Let's go

57
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,156
Kelly, can you hear me out there?

58
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,384
Loud and clear Pat.
I'm here in Sunny Tehran.

59
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,418
Where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

60
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:27,290
As you can see behind me, they are
working in collaboration with the robots.

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,889
And obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

62
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,918
You'll notice children in the streets
as well, this is every day life.

63
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,500
Happening in perfect harmony.

64
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,098
Oh great, here here, stay put, stay put.
It's fine don't worry my guys got it.

65
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:09,422
Drop your weapon.

66
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
"Kelly, Kelly," Are you alright?

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,970
"Kelly."

68
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,500
We're okay, Pat.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry Kelly but

70
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,134
for security reasons the Pentagon
is going to cut our feed to Tehran.

71
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,322
But Please be careful.

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, I'll continue to stand by.

73
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,139
So then tell me, why can't we
use these machines here at home?

75
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:48,500
Why is America so robophobic?

76
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,250
On the one hand, we
have Raymond Sellers.

77
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,151
An entrepreneur,

78
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,045
And true American, who's product
just saved my colleague's life.

79
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
On the other, "Hubert Dreyfuss".

80
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,369
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

81
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,744
who's bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

82
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,326
The American people
support the Dreyfuss act.

83
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,699
Because they haven't

84
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,524
experienced this technology.

85
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:22,500
And they fear what
they don't understand.

86
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,144
We at the Novak Element
support Mr. Seller's

87
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,302
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

88
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,399
After all, what's more important then
the safety of the American people?

89
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Hey "Murphy".

90
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Hey.

91
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,932
How is Jack?

92
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
We don't know yet.

93
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
How's it going?

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Good.

95
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,494
What the hell are they doing here?

96
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:25,500
Six in the morgue, Louis in hospital.

97
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,500
This was the mother of all bad ideas.

98
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,831
We got a lead on Anton
Vallon, we took it.

99
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,500
What lead?

100
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,500
Not in front of them.

101
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,716
This is bullshit.

102
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:35,514
Yeah?

103
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,133
Yeah, you got something to say Murphy?

104
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,177
Vallon's our case.

105
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:40,898
You got two years without
no arrests, no nothin.

106
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,721
He's got to be dumb or dirty.

107
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:45,500
You got something on
us? Or is this personal?

108
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,500
No, it's nothin personal.

109
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:49,442
Although I don't like you as a person.

110
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,500
Okay, you two, out.

111
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,500
No problem.

112
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,537
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation

113
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,326
your partner would still be standing.

114
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:00,000
What did you say to me? That's enough!

115
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Okay, "Alex".

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
It's just you and me now.

117
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,216
Me and jack, we've been
doing some street buys.

118
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,254
We get a line on some guns.

119
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,975
And we met with this low
level G called Jerry who

120
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:19,423
ends up having a peace
he's not suppose to have.

121
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:21,807
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry

122
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,916
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Two crates?

124
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:28,312
No disrespect Jay, but how a clown
like you get so much product, man?

125
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:29,916
What's it matter where it comes from?

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,812
It matters, we don't
want no dirty guns Jerry.

127
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,076
These guns got bodies on them Jerry?

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,749
They're clean alright. You
gonna buy this shit or not?

129
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,124
Why you acting so nervous man?

130
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,730
You fishin on us Jerry?

131
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
What'd you say?

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You think he's fishin D'?

133
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,148
I think he's fishin on us.

134
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,456
What the hell are they talkin about man?

135
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:46,899
Let me see your phone,
let me see your phone

136
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,676
I'm not showing you my phone, man.

137
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,341
Are you recording this?

138
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,298
What?

139
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,464
I think you're a God Damn cop.

140
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:53,500
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,451
Lie down to the ground.

142
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,500
Put your gun down.

143
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:59,432
We're not cops alright,
we work for, "Anton Vallon".

144
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:00,500
Hey, Hey, Hey!

145
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:02,873
Shut up, shut up, what did you say?

146
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,470
Ends up he works for "Vallon".

147
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:07,488
Before the meeting we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

148
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:10,086
They were supposed to
be in our evidence room.

149
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,778
Not out on the street. The intake

150
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:15,113
papers were blank, no signatures.

151
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
What have you got?

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Nothing.

153
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,086
How do you think that happened?

154
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,466
I tell you Murphy this is a mistake.

155
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,567
These guys will shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
We need backup.

157
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,250
We call for backup words going
to get around the station.

158
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,721
And he's going to disappear.

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
It's gonna be alright.

160
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,302
We told Vallon we were gun
buyers, and he bought it.

161
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,229
What do you two need
with that much product?

162
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:42,524
You plotting a coup?

163
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,214
Hey, don't trip. We ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

164
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,673
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

165
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:49,336
Yeah,

166
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I heard you don't like cops.

167
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Hey, boss.

168
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,841
What do you got for me?

169
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,721
Really.

170
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,451
Just about to close the deal.

171
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,796
Someone tipped him off.

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,278
Gentlemen I gotta deal with this.

173
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,817
Few minutes.

174
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,182
Make sure you kill them both.

175
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,484
I've got two handguns, one automatic.

176
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,989
You've gotta get out of here,
I'm going to take the automatic.

177
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,125
You sure of this?

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,052
You ready?

179
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Move

180
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Louis.

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,447
Officer down, officer down,
331 Hamilton.

182
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,926
This is detective Alex Murphy in
need of immediate medical assistance.

183
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,437
331 Hamilton Road.

184
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
"Jack."

185
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
"Jack," come on "Jack," Do you hear me?

186
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
"Jack," Stay with me.

187
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
"Jack."

188
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:19,500
"Alex," you don't do something like
this unless you bring it to me first.

189
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:25,293
Vallon's connected. I'm warning you don't
make any more moves until I vet this.

190
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,023
If officers are supplying them guns.

191
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,875
That's up to IAD.

192
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:30,971
I'll handle it.

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Washington, DC

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,493
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are Mr. Sellers.

195
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:46,129
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

196
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,394
Can't understand the value of human life.
Why should it be aloud to take one?

197
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:58,326
To legislate over life and death, we need
people who understand right from wrong.

198
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,854
What do your machines feel?

199
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,418
Well, they feel no anger, the feel
no prejudice, they feel no fatigue.

200
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,413
Which makes them ideal
for law enforcement.

201
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:16,647
Putting these machines on the streets
will save countless American lives.

202
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,436
Your evading the question. No I'm not.

203
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,697
Yes, your evading the question. I
asked "What do these machines feel?"

204
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:26,456
If one of them, uh, killed a child.

205
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,711
What would it feel?

206
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Nothing.

207
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:34,980
That's the problem.

208
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:41,004
That's why 72 percent of Americans will
not stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

209
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,278
America is the world's most valuable
market, and we can't touch it.

210
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:56,374
With a domestic expansion we'd
clear 600 billion dollars per annual.

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,489
In other words, every second that law is
in existence we're hemorrhaging money.

212
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,773
What do you want me to
do? We've thrown cash at

213
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,061
senators on both sides of
the isle. Nobody's budging.

214
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,070
They don't want to vote against their

215
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,524
constituents, so unless
we sway public opinion.

216
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,028
The battles lost. Now to that effect.

217
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,355
My team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

218
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Wow factor off the charts.

219
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,495
We need to give the Americans
a product they can love.

220
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:25,500
A figure they can rally behind.

221
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,282
Sir, I have dissected this bill.

222
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:31,239
There are no loop holes. We
can't put a machine on the street.

223
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:33,500
Forget the machine, you saw the polls.

224
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:36,296
Americans don't want a machine.

225
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
They want a product with a conscious.

226
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,206
They want.

227
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:47,118
Something that knows.

228
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:52,605
What it feels like to be human.

229
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,572
We're gonna put
a man inside the machine.

230
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:09,057
You're not you because of your
legs, your arms, your hands.

231
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,737
You're you because of your
brain. It's your brain's

232
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:15,401
capacity to process information
that makes you who you are.

233
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

234
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:26,500
I've never played with these.

235
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,343
The music doesn't come from your fingers
Michael, it comes from your mind.

236
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,943
All you have to do is let it out.

237
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:36,500
Please.

238
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,287
Oh my God.

239
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
That's okay.

240
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,326
His emotions are peaking, the
readings are getting clouded.

241
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,683
It's okay.

242
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,054
Relax, if you get too
emotional, it'll change the

243
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:26,872
chemistry in your brain.
It'll throw the system out.

244
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,288
You're doing great. Come on.

245
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:48,500
I need emotion to play.

246
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,028
(Speaking french)

247
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,500
It's a beautiful piece,
Dennett can we have a moment?

248
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Thank you.

249
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:00,288
We have agreed on this
a long time ago Raymond.

250
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:03,679
I, I, I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat application.

251
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,403
My work here is driven
by it's own question.

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,354
And your work is brilliant, but
your ideas are being underutilized.

253
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Look, I think I found a way.

254
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,921
To put real revenue stream
behind your research,

255
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:21,910
and to save thousands
of lives in the process.

256
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,324
You're not keeping up your end,
making me exposed like that.

257
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,326
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

258
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,018
So, put him on the payroll,
Why are we talking about this?

259
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:45,325
It won't work. And now that his partner
got hit he's never going to let it go.

260
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,376
What is that?

261
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,247
Louis' hospital. Alex is
dropping by this afternoon.

262
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,307
In case you want to send flowers.

263
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,846
Yeah.

264
00:19:57,057 --> 00:20:00,153
Kill a cop, look over my
shoulder the rest of my life.

265
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,384
It's not good for business.

266
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,519
Who do you thinks going
to be investigating you"?

267
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:12,778
I'm going to go hard after them, Dennis.

268
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,951
And have them in
bracelets within a month.

269
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:21,933
Hey, Vallon I'm locking up right now.

270
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Camera's off?

271
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Clear.

272
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,536
You were right, we should've had backup.

273
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,046
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
You're not really sleeping are you?

275
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Asshole.

276
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,278
Sergeant, "Thomas Ryan," NYPD,
paralyzed from the waist down.

277
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,183
He has let himself go a little.

278
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Since the accident.

279
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,184
Pass Yep, yeah,

280
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:56,480
fair enough.

281
00:20:56,564 --> 00:21:00,000
The officer "Alfred Miller", Denver.

282
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,471
Severe...

283
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,269
Seri, cerebellerd..

284
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:04,891
Cerebellum ataxia.

285
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,499
That's why you're the Doctor, Doctor.

286
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,333
He scored through the
roof with our urban demos.

287
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,259
Lets keep this one in
mind, I like this guy.

288
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Very good sir, I saved
the best for last.

289
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:20,265
I give you Sargent "Jack
Freeman" Masculinity incarnate.

290
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:24,298
Led Pittsburgh Swat for five years, now.

291
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,076
Confined to a wheel chair.

292
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I think I can see the appeal.

293
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
No.

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What? Why?

295
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,333
I checked the Psych evaluations.
He's far too unstable.

296
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:38,298
He's trying to say,
that he has a temper.

297
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,059
Have you any idea what
we'd be putting him through?

298
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:44,500
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

299
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,968
We have to be scientific.

300
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:49,182
We're not selling a
soft-drink here are we?

301
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,865
You're right, okay, Keep looking.

302
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,459
"David," What did I say?

303
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,217
Not until you're finished.

304
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,451
Hey guys.

305
00:21:58,536 --> 00:21:59,500
Hi dad.

306
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,183
Hey little monkey.

307
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,778
How's the game buddy?

308
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,942
Dane got rejected, but we
have a two man advantage.

309
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,288
Oh yeah? That's fantastic.

310
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,134
Hey D, why don't you head upstairs,
start getting ready for bed?

311
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,192
But he just got home.

312
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,134
I'll be up in a second
to tuck you in okay?

313
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Alright?

314
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:28,500
Now give your Mom a kiss.

315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,750
Good night baby.

316
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,500
Too slow boy.

317
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
You're just too slow.

318
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,086
How is Jack holding up?

319
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,130
They said a week till
he's back on his feet.

320
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
It's my fault, we shouldn't
have even been there.

321
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Here.

322
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,423
(Car alarm) Somebody's gotta fix that.

323
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:00,500
Stop.

324
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,354
Let's not wake up David.

325
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,798
He's suffering 4th degree burns
over 80 percent of his body.

326
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:59,798
Lower spine has been severed.

327
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,250
If he survives.

328
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:06,798
He'll be paralyzed from the waist
down, confined to a wheel chair.

329
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:11,798
Mrs. Murphy.

330
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,798
We don't have to do this.

331
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,798
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

332
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:25,284
Please continue.

333
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:32,169
Consider the cochlear optic
nerves have been critically damaged.

334
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,798
He'll be blind in one eye.

335
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,855
And most likely deaf.

336
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:41,663
Frankly, Dr. Norton and the Omni
foundation are the leaders in this field.

337
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:45,730
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

338
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:48,134
I'd seriously consider their offer.

339
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,250
I'm sorry, Doctor.

340
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:54,625
I need time to think

341
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:58,884
I'm afraid Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

342
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,065
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

343
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:11,288
What kind of life will he have?

344
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:28,596
Thanks.

345
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:30,096
Thanks buddy.

346
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:32,403
You know this is going
to make me dance again.

347
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:34,153
Now that I gotta see.

348
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:35,549
You don't wanna see that.

349
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:36,554
Here she comes now.

350
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:37,969
Hold on to that.

351
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,401
Good idea partner.

352
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:42,596
Every time.

353
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,596
Get er' boy!

354
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,586
Subject is still dreaming.

355
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:14,400
He's retrieving memories, trying to make
sense of sensory stimulation package 37.

356
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,145
Perfect Kim.

357
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,067
Let's reconnect the spine.

358
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Time to wake him up.

359
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:52,400
Excuse me?

360
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:54,400
What are you doing here?

361
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,400
Babe, where are you going?

362
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
"Louis."

363
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,548
Subject regaining cognitive functions.

364
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,400
Whats happening?

365
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Where am I?

366
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:22,576
You were in an explosion, Alex.

367
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:24,400
You're in a hospital.

368
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Where?

369
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,227
Where's "Claire" My
wife? Where is my wife?

370
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
I want you to calm down Alex, listen to
me, you're okay. You're family's fine.

371
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,400
Both your wife and your son.

372
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,355
Who the hell are you?

373
00:28:38,442 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton

374
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,355
I'm treating you.

375
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:44,400
Heart rate rising.

376
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,721
I can't move.

377
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,346
I can't move. What the hell is all that?

378
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,355
Visual input, unstable.

379
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:55,400
I want you to relax.

380
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,864
Subject's dumping too much
epinephrine, should we purge him?

381
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:58,942
Not yet.

382
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Unlock vertebrate.

383
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,115
Go ahead, Kim. Unlock
Upper, Lower extremities.

384
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:26,019
What kind of suit is this?

385
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
It's life.

386
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Your suit "Alex".

387
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
It's You.

388
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,932
This was the only option, We're here,
all of us, to make you whole again.

389
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Full body

390
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,160
I want you to walk, now Alex.

391
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
You can do that

392
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
seems so real

393
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:19,057
Alex it's very important you
understand what's happening.

394
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:23,191
This is real. It's not a dream,
it's not drugs, or anesthetics.

395
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,807
I know I'm dreaming, because
I can feel all of this.

396
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:28,442
Alex, Amputees can often
feel their missing appendages.

397
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:30,237
It's called Phantom Limb sensation.

398
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,153
What do you mean amputee?
What the hell did you do to me?

399
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,285
Alex you need to relax.

400
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,355
Take this off of me now.

401
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,278
Alex you need to relax

402
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:39,538
I need to get out of this
thing. What did you do to me?

403
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:40,942
What have you done to me?

404
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,364
Alex, HEY!

405
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:45,371
Shut him down!

406
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:47,670
No! Let him run, Let him run!

407
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Where am I?

408
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
"Alex," Please.

409
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Stop.

410
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,807
"Alex," you have to stop.

411
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Please.

412
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
"Alex."

413
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Please stop.

414
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,265
Stay where you are, and
we'll come and pick you up.

415
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Okay, "Kim".

416
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,259
Shut him down.

417
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
"Alex."

418
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:01,818
You can't run from this.

419
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,400
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.

420
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:12,997
Show me.

421
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
"Kim."

422
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
No.

423
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,145
Holy Christ.

424
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:45,400
Holy Christ!

425
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,384
Holy Christ there's nothing left!

426
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Your body may have gone,
but your still here.

427
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:08,528
That's not even my brain.

428
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,405
We had to repair the damaged areas.

429
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:14,400
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion, or your intellect.

430
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:16,358
You understand me, Alex.

431
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:20,561
You're, You're in control

432
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:22,835
I'm in control?

433
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,210
Yes.

434
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,934
Okay,

435
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,016
If I'm in control.

436
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Then, I want to die.

437
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:43,318
Just unplug what ever it is keeping
me alive and end this nightmare!

438
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:48,842
Let's say I did that, which as a doctor
would be almost impossible for me.

439
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,916
But, say I did.

440
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,400
What do I say to your wife?

441
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,349
What does she say to your son?

442
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:57,400
That it didn't work.

443
00:34:58,038 --> 00:35:02,309
That you tried, but
something went wrong.

444
00:35:02,688 --> 00:35:07,193
You did everything you could but...

445
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,387
I died.

446
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:14,556
And so, after all they've
been through all the pain.

447
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,436
All their hope restored,
we just rip that away?

448
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:23,400
Your wife loves you Alex. She
singed the consent forms, herself.

449
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:27,905
Otherwise you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

450
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,693
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

451
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:48,583
I need you to take it.

452
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:54,702
I don't want to see
myself like this again.

453
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,853
Ever.

454
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:58,400
The same goes for my family.

455
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,637
Put me back in.

456
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:14,731
Zoom in.

457
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,306
Stop.

458
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:21,331
Zoom in.

459
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Stop.

460
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,297
Accept the connection.

461
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:39,360
It's so good to finally see you.

462
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:42,652
I was gonna have to say the same thing.

463
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,722
I'm sorry

464
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,670
I know how I must look to you.

465
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
I think you look beautiful.

466
00:36:54,827 --> 00:36:56,597
Are they treating you okay, babe?

467
00:36:57,373 --> 00:36:58,362
So far.

468
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:00,400
Dr. Norton seems like a nice guy.

469
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,351
Does David know you're calling?

470
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:11,436
He misses you. I can go get him, I just.

471
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:12,507
No

472
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:16,400
I don't want him to see me like this.

473
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Not yet.

474
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Sure.

475
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:29,342
We're going to get through this baby.

476
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,400
We're going to make it like it was.

477
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,565
When are you coming home?

478
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:42,400
We still got some tests.

479
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:47,273
But they are saying
it's going really well.

480
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:49,514
The minute they let me

481
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,400
I gotta go

482
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I love you.

483
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,951
End the connection.

484
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:16,400
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

485
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:21,400
Viral, and bacterial
screening activated.

486
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,362
Releasing proteins.

487
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:29,400
Fats, Minerals, and Carbs.

488
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Energy in-flow is
at 1320 Kilo-Calories.

489
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,393
Now starting Anti-inflammatory corticoid,
hormones and antibiotic protocols.

490
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Standard daily intake.

491
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,400
Who has Anti-depressants?

492
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,393
Let's give him a nice dream.

493
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,242
Alright, here's what
you're dealing with.

494
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Modified M2 Battle Rifle.

495
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,958
50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition, and 30 round clips.

496
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,425
3 Shot burst or full auto.

497
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,398
Heavy Duty.

498
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,039
TSR-66 Cartridge driven taser pistol.

499
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,128
Each projectile releases
up to 200,000 volts.

500
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,360
It can stun, it can
kill, it's nasty shit.

501
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,992
Your armor. State of the
art but not invulnerable.

502
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:34,744
50 caliber or larger can
penetrate and kill, multiple

503
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:38,887
hits and guess who ends
up in the recycling bin.

504
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
If you sense you need a
weapon, or are threatened.

505
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:48,103
The visor goes down, and the
system makes the weapon available.

506
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:50,925
Gotta remember, it's not
the weapons that count.

507
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:52,356
It's who's handling them.

508
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,360
Or in your case .. What..

509
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:56,400
Do you think you can do this?

510
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:57,898
Just stick to your job.

511
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,398
Just stick to my job?

512
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,340
Combat robots are my job
doc. Rio, Congo, you name it.

513
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:04,369
I was there. Our machines run perfectly.

514
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:08,400
You ask me, sticking an organic in
the system is a huge step backwards.

515
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,532
I don't care how well you
design this thing, without

516
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:13,351
my sign off it better
start learning chinese.

517
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:15,400
Because it ain't never going home.

518
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,847
It's nice to meet you too.

519
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:29,425
Lets do this, Tin man.

520
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,351
Quality control EM208, Vs. Tin man..

521
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,143
Rendering Scenario one, now.

522
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:47,873
Hey, Doc. I hope you don't mind. I
like a little music while I'm working.

523
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,335
Alright, Alright, lets
uh, let the games begin.

524
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,400
Rock and roll.

525
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Commence scenario.

526
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,358
Lag in the corners.

527
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:38,400
Did you see that? What my
robot did. That's how you do it.

528
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:42,355
Your products afraid.

529
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,335
2.3 seconds behind.

530
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,400
Great.

531
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Drop your gun!

532
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,373
Drop your gun!

533
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:56,364
Drop your weapon let the kid go.

534
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,335
He's worried that the
kids going to get hurt.

535
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,400
Let the kid go!

536
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:06,123
Well, there you have it 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

537
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,289
I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.

538
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,356
Let's do it again.

539
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,400
It's your funeral.

540
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,056
Detective, "Alex Murphy".

541
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,342
Search results: Detective Alex
Murphy making a speedy recovery.

542
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:26,400
"Alex Murphy" Man or machine.

543
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,081
Thrust into the spotlight,
Clair Murphy won't talk.

544
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,380
"Anton Vallon."

545
00:42:33,465 --> 00:42:37,139
Search Results: DPD says Anton
Vallon is no longer suspect.

546
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,284
Due to lack of evidence

547
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,253
Detroit free press.

548
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:46,436
Unfortunately Murphy's
investigation into

549
00:42:46,518 --> 00:42:49,867
Anton Vallon wasn't
authorized in the first place.

550
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:52,371
Murphy was simply over zealous, Okay?

551
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:55,987
We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.

552
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:59,103
All I'm gonna say is that my
partner's a great cop. And I won't

553
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:02,106
rest until the men who tried to
kill him are brought to justice.

554
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:06,849
What's wrong with him?

555
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:08,902
No, Nothing, Nothing.

556
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:12,628
Watch the procedure bar on the 20A.

557
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:17,123
Our machine assesses
the threat and acts.

558
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,956
That's it, two steps. Now watch Alex.

559
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,737
The software assesses the
threat just like robots.

560
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,351
And it sends the information to
the brain. Alex's brain receives.

561
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:32,846
The information and then
decides what to do with

562
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:35,400
it based on his emotional
and cognitive abilities.

563
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:39,400
Then the brain relates
this to the AI module.

564
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,380
And...

565
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:42,364
Yeah, like a year later.

566
00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:44,400
Computers finish the job, a brain...

567
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,400
You wanted a man inside a machine!

568
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,164
That's what you've got, but the
human element will always be present.

569
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,634
Fear, instinct, bias, compassion. They
will always interfere with the system.

570
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:56,375
Okay, but Dennett

571
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:59,327
I've gotta give the
American people something

572
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:02,143
they can root for. Something
aspirational. Right?

573
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,818
They have to believe in
this thing. Pretty good,

574
00:44:04,902 --> 00:44:07,025
that's not.
I don't know how to sell okay.

575
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
We, you and I, have got a release
date. We've gotta make it, okay"?

576
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,335
I don't care how you do it, I'm asking you.
Come on can you help me? Just get him -

577
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,599
to do that. Him to do that.

578
00:44:17,684 --> 00:44:18,376
He's a machine

579
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,351
I know but it's a man
inside of a machine.

580
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:22,371
That's a man inside a machine.

581
00:44:22,456 --> 00:44:25,351
His life depends on it, and the
future of Omnicorp depends on it.

582
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:28,695
So, get your ass back to
China and get it fixed.

583
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,378
I don't care how you
do it, just go do it.

584
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Tastes like peanut butter

585
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,407
I can't get it out of my mouth.

586
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:57,326
You don't like peanut butter?

587
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:58,400
No.

588
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:01,338
You like peanut butter Kim?

589
00:45:01,422 --> 00:45:03,400
I love it.

590
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
OK

591
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:08,322
I'm gonna put you to sleep now Alex.

592
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,400
OK

593
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,503
Put him under, Kim.

594
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,360
What are you planning to do?

595
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,920
Consciousness is nothing more
then the processing of information.

596
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm going to him.

597
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,079
He won't know the difference

598
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:47,324
Raymond.

599
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:48,391
Yeah.

600
00:45:48,474 --> 00:45:51,400
We just ran focus groups at
Ryan Correctional facility.

601
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,400
We call this combat mode.

602
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:58,228
It really put the fear
of God into the prisoners.

603
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,358
Yeah, that's okay.

604
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:01,400
Get a load of this.

605
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,371
What is that?

606
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:06,112
He transforms. Kids love it.

607
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,384
Really?

608
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,289
Focus group numbers, through the roof.

609
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,380
Really?

610
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:12,344
That's really embarrassing.

611
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:13,358
What is this?

612
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:14,385
You know what,

613
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:19,222
People don't really know what they want
until you show it to them most of the time.

614
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,327
Make him more uh.. tactical
Make him look uhh...

615
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:28,400
Let's go with black.

616
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,070
Yeah.

617
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,382
"Alex."

618
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:09,695
He looks like a billion dollars.

619
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
$2.6 billion.

620
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
"Raymond Sells"

621
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,818
I've looked forward to
meeting you detective.

622
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,161
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

623
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:23,077
Well, We've found this program to
give men like you a second chance.

624
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,835
You just do your best today.

625
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,355
Shall we?

626
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,400
Alright.

627
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,925
Mr. Sellers We're ready for you.

628
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,101
Okay great.

629
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,347
This is a detective "Sherman".

630
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:36,400
Good morning folks.

631
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,748
Okay, so this is how it's gonna be.

632
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,858
We're going toe to toe.

633
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:44,304
The last man standing wins.

634
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,713
If I hit you, you go
back to the drawing board.

635
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:50,009
You hit me You get a ticket back home.

636
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:52,518
My guys are going to
be shooting.47 rounds.

637
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,074
Do a little damage, but
they can't take you out.

638
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:58,456
But make no mistake,
Tin Man. My gun will.

639
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,706
Alex, listen to me.

640
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:18,344
The EM208s will try to maneuver you.

641
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,472
So Mattox can get a clear shot.

642
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:22,518
Do not let that happen.

643
00:48:23,152 --> 00:48:26,451
If Mattox hits you everything but
your life support will shut down.

644
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:29,460
You will feel more pain then
you've ever felt in your life.

645
00:48:29,543 --> 00:48:32,454
I don't know about that
I've been through a lot.

646
00:48:38,634 --> 00:48:39,934
Alright.

647
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:42,273
I say we go on Three.

648
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:43,637
Three.

649
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,762
How's it going down there?

650
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:12,324
Whatever you do, don't
get shot in the face.

651
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:52,014
Dr. Norton, how is he doing that?

652
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:56,092
His software is faster,
his hardware is stronger.

653
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:57,530
He is a better machine.

654
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,192
But you said that humans hesitate.

655
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:06,652
Only when there making decisions.
He's not making decisions?

656
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:08,916
Yes and no.

657
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:12,076
In his every day life
man rules over machine.

658
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:13,867
Alex makes his own decisions.

659
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:17,947
When he engages in battle
the visor comes down

660
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:22,204
and the software takes over and,
uh, the machine does everything.

661
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:25,489
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

662
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:30,809
But, if the machine is in control how is

663
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:32,947
Murphy accountable?
Who's pulling the trigger?

664
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,119
When the machine fights the system
releases signals into Alex's brain.

665
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:39,817
Making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

666
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,349
I mean, Alex believes
right now he is in control.

667
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:46,431
But, he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

668
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:57,530
Crap.

669
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,523
You circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

670
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:25,056
- But that's illegal.
- No, no.

671
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:28,831
It is a machine that
think it's Alex Murphy.

672
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:31,746
And in my book - That's legal.

673
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,449
Well done.

674
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,789
Well done.

675
00:51:41,606 --> 00:51:43,693
Hey Doctor what happens if I tase an

676
00:51:43,777 --> 00:51:46,429
exoskeleton with a little
asshole on the side?

677
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,273
I think We're all curious to find out.

678
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:52,650
Go ahead.

679
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:32,047
If I had a pulse, it would be racing.

680
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,791
She's been waiting for months.

681
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:37,297
I'm sure hers is too.

682
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:40,871
You're gonna do fine.

683
00:52:49,976 --> 00:52:52,585
I love your sign D.

684
00:52:55,974 --> 00:52:57,438
Hey.

685
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,766
There's nothin to be nervous about.

686
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:11,880
Thank you, Dennett.
It's been a privilege.

687
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:47,916
Hi, Dad.

688
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:54,590
I missed you, buddy. Me too.

689
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,543
Want to feel it?

690
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:08,833
What is it?

691
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:11,195
It's okay, sweety.

692
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,811
Saved all the redwings
games on my computer.

693
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:28,443
You did?

694
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,130
- How'd they do?
- I don't know.

695
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:34,994
I've been waiting to
watch them with you.

696
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:38,380
I'd love to kiddo.

697
00:55:38,864 --> 00:55:43,777
But I can't tonight.
Daddy's suit needs some.

698
00:55:45,577 --> 00:55:47,443
Special handling.

699
00:55:48,664 --> 00:55:50,505
You understand?

700
00:56:21,396 --> 00:56:24,545
Thanks for coming, Jack.
I heard you went home already.

701
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:26,489
Clara should be
thrilled to have you back.

702
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:27,239
I saw Clara.

703
00:56:27,322 --> 00:56:29,690
And David.

704
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,166
That ain't my home right now.

705
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:40,025
It's in a damn lab across
the hall I'm sorry, Alex.

706
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,958
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

707
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,239
I was waiting to hear you say that.

708
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:53,469
At least I know you're
the right color now.

709
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:30,405
Cooler temperatures here today certainly
have not stopped people from showing up.

710
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:33,800
We're expecting people from every
corner of the city here in detroit.

711
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:37,451
To come out and show their
support for Detective Alex Murphy.

712
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:41,250
You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is "What will he look like?"

713
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:45,027
"Is he a changed man?" Rumor
has it he is in the building.

714
00:57:45,112 --> 00:57:46,577
Preparing to come out.

715
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:52,864
Alex, We're going to upload the
entire DPD database into your brain.

716
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,244
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records.

717
00:57:57,327 --> 00:58:01,273
Plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

718
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:04,527
Alright, Hit me.

719
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,572
Kim, it's all yours.

720
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,768
Archive footage uploading successfully.

721
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:15,217
You're system draws
connections automatically.

722
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,472
It will link perpetrators
to the crimes and

723
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:19,869
give you exact locations,
whenever available.

724
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:24,143
I have evidence to make 138
I don't know.

725
00:58:24,228 --> 00:58:25,925
166 arrests.

726
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,994
His emotions are stable.

727
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:32,177
This is incredible.

728
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,731
You will notice his family is
here in the building as well.

729
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:39,021
The mayor is standing on stage
behind me, also Raymond Sellers,

730
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:41,784
from Omnicorp. They seem
like great friends. Obviously

731
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:44,181
echoing the partnership
they brought together.

732
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:47,257
How much longer will this take?
Well the

733
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,085
feed from the database is almost done.

734
00:58:49,168 --> 00:58:51,782
We're approaching present day.

735
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:55,157
634 pending arrests.

736
00:58:55,547 --> 00:58:57,333
We're gonna need a bigger prison.

737
00:59:00,155 --> 00:59:03,237
He's on top of her..
Doctor Norton he's getting to emotional.

738
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,768
I've gotta do something.
Alex, calm down.

739
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,413
Take a breath. Relax.

740
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:14,614
Kim, what are the readings?
I haven't seen them at levels like this.

741
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:17,896
He's gonna shoot him! Alex, relax.

742
00:59:19,018 --> 00:59:20,757
Relax.

743
00:59:21,146 --> 00:59:23,721
Alex... What is it?

744
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:26,920
A computer glitch?
No that's his own crime scene.

745
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:29,527
He's spiking all over the place Alex!

746
00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:31,496
Alex!

747
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,003
The system is crashing
Doctor. Alex, can you hear me?

748
00:59:34,197 --> 00:59:35,536
Alex, Alex.

749
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:37,626
I'm not sure he can handle this.
Do something.

750
00:59:38,027 --> 00:59:40,050
He's emotionally Overload! Unlock Me!

751
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:43,353
Stop it! Stop it! He's having a seizure.

752
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:46,184
Kim, shut it down. Alex!

753
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:48,492
Give me a live feed I
can't do it. Doctor Norton..

754
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:50,922
- Now!
- Jesus Christ!

755
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:52,824
Dr. Norton? What?

756
00:59:52,907 --> 00:59:55,177
The press is waiting. We
have to get him up there now.

757
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,851
What do you want me to
do? I don't know, fix him.

758
00:59:57,934 --> 00:59:59,108
Do what you have to do.

759
00:59:59,192 --> 01:00:02,275
Your reputation is on the
line every bit as much as ours.

760
01:00:03,722 --> 01:00:05,201
We're running out of time.

761
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,166
Okay.

762
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:11,235
Everybody out.

763
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:13,219
OUT!

764
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:15,085
Mayor Duran Is about
to take to the stage

765
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:18,492
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

766
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,525
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

767
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:28,474
Heart rate rising, he
might start spiking Doctor.

768
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:31,369
To absorb dopamine and noradrenaline.

769
01:00:31,454 --> 01:00:34,632
But you'll be taking away his emotions.
Drop the levels until I tell you to stop.

770
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,039
Doctor you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

771
01:00:37,123 --> 01:00:37,775
Now, please.

772
01:00:43,742 --> 01:00:46,231
Hold the footage, put it on a loop.

773
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,797
- Dopamine levels 20 %.
- More.

774
01:00:53,536 --> 01:00:55,907
- Dopamine levels 10 %.
- More.

775
01:00:57,172 --> 01:00:58,358
- Dopamine levels 5 %
- Lower.

776
01:00:58,442 --> 01:01:00,596
You're flatting him out. Lower!

777
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:05,478
2 %. Hold it there.

778
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,181
Alex?

779
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:16,797
Alex, how do you feel?

780
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,213
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

781
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:29,074
Today, I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

782
01:01:30,132 --> 01:01:33,567
I am here to give you the cure.

783
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:43,625
Hi, Dad.

784
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:47,021
Dad?

785
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,251
NO DANGER

786
01:01:52,693 --> 01:01:56,552
Ladies and gentlemen, the
revolution begins right now,

787
01:01:56,635 --> 01:01:59,652
with Detective Alex Murphy.

788
01:02:32,306 --> 01:02:34,556
What's he doing?
He looks like a Zombie.

789
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,677
I think he accessing Criminal data.

790
01:02:44,713 --> 01:02:46,706
Thomas King! You're under arrest.

791
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:07,829
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

792
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:11,293
wanted for rape, arson, and murder.

793
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:15,570
This man has torn
apart American families.

794
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:19,454
On the loose for 6 years.

795
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:25,425
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

796
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,431
Right in front of the
police headquarters.

797
01:03:34,128 --> 01:03:38,155
Here he is just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

798
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:42,376
These two officers
are completely unaware

799
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,661
of the monster in their midst.

800
01:03:48,248 --> 01:03:50,885
And then, in 60 seconds..

801
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:54,561
I repeat, just 60 seconds.

802
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:58,449
Detective Murphy brings him down.

803
01:03:58,532 --> 01:04:00,856
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford an attorney.

804
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,530
One will be provided for you.

805
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:08,447
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

806
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:13,054
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes now

807
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:16,367
that RoboCop is here.

808
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,780
Yes!

809
01:04:17,862 --> 01:04:21,713
Let's not shy away from
what this means people.

810
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:26,501
Men weren't up to the task.

811
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:31,509
But Alex Murphy, a robot cop was.

812
01:04:32,878 --> 01:04:35,925
We can't take him off the
street. This is what I'm saying.

813
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:37,753
He's a hit. A big fat stinking hit.

814
01:04:37,835 --> 01:04:39,853
Until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

815
01:04:39,936 --> 01:04:41,849
Hey we all knew
there would be issues.

816
01:04:41,931 --> 01:04:46,094
It was inevitable. Dennett You're my guy.
I just need you to get a handle on this.

817
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:49,704
I need more time. Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

818
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:52,469
We need to take him back to
the lab and do more tests,

819
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:55,498
It was like, something was
interfering with our system.

820
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:58,327
Something beyond chemistry or physics.

821
01:04:58,409 --> 01:04:59,693
Like what? His soul?

822
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:02,581
Hey look this train
has left the station.

823
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:04,989
We can't exactly go
out to the world and say.

824
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:07,713
"Sorry, we released
a defective product."

825
01:05:07,797 --> 01:05:10,701
So no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

826
01:05:10,784 --> 01:05:14,414
What about the interviews?
Cancel them, cancel all of them.

827
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:18,639
Everything. In fact, Dennett...

828
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:21,244
Let's uh...

829
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:23,878
Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now as well.

830
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:28,663
I would like to see him.
Can you arrange that?

831
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:30,271
Look, I won't lie to you

832
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,965
Alex was so nervous
we had to sedate him.

833
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,481
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

834
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:39,878
And then he just shoots
a man in front of our son.

835
01:05:39,963 --> 01:05:41,239
That's not sedation.

836
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:45,496
He's responding to
drugs differently now.

837
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:52,728
We both knew from day one
there would be complications.

838
01:05:57,675 --> 01:06:02,059
Just give me a little
more time. I promise...

839
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,262
You'll have your husband back.

840
01:06:07,773 --> 01:06:11,311
This goes for every
squad in every department.

841
01:06:11,393 --> 01:06:14,893
Detective Murphy will have
full access all investigations.

842
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,215
Robberies, narcotics, homicide.

843
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:22,603
If he requests to take over a case,
the case will be handed to him.

844
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:24,347
No arguments, No complaints.

845
01:06:24,429 --> 01:06:27,275
This is Bullshit!
I said "no complaints"!

846
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,797
And I mean it!

847
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:32,820
Good morning, chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

848
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,445
I selected 13 targets
today, all wanted for murder.

849
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:39,800
John Biggs is? 1. I will
be taking over this case.

850
01:06:39,884 --> 01:06:43,911
Ambulances detention vehicles and coroners
should be ready to move in on my request.

851
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:46,248
I wish you all a very good day.

852
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:55,702
Murphy...

853
01:06:55,786 --> 01:06:57,672
You okay man?

854
01:06:57,755 --> 01:07:00,588
I'm fine sargent.

855
01:07:01,297 --> 01:07:04,195
Can't wait to get back to
work Thinkin Daniels is -

856
01:07:04,277 --> 01:07:06,554
Excuse me, I have casework.

857
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:00,032
Don't shoot!

858
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:01,929
Don't shoot!

859
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,628
Walter Karrel, look at me.

860
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:15,030
You have two options Option 1:
I shoot you with 50,000 volts.

861
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:17,168
Which can cause respiratory failure.

862
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:19,676
Organ malfunction, internal burns,

863
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,792
and loss of bowl and bladder
control. And then, I arrest you.

864
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,578
Option 2: You tell me where
John Biggs drug lab is located.

865
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:28,993
And then I arrest you.

866
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,984
You have two seconds to decide.

867
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,636
Totally justifiable.
We are going to make a lot of money.

868
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,756
Nothing. No fear, no
increase heart-rate,

869
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:51,764
no traces of anger, whatsoever.

870
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:56,587
Congratulations, Doctor. You did it.

871
01:09:57,546 --> 01:09:58,975
Yes, I did.

872
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:11,626
I told you, sir. Norton clearly
never had control of the product.

873
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,448
I agree. And that's
why I called you here.

874
01:10:14,885 --> 01:10:17,701
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

875
01:10:17,783 --> 01:10:21,336
Okay, I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head.

876
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,404
Plus full surveillance of the lab.

877
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:26,087
You're gonna have full
access to everything.

878
01:10:26,171 --> 01:10:27,404
If anything comes up

879
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:29,622
I'll be in Washington.

880
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:37,301
He brought peace to this
country's most violent city.

881
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:40,462
He showed us all that
Detroit and America

882
01:10:40,546 --> 01:10:42,404
can have a brighter future

883
01:10:42,487 --> 01:10:44,238
a future of economic growth.

884
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,251
Freedom and happiness.

885
01:10:46,335 --> 01:10:49,926
On tonight's show, a
visionary and true patriot.

886
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:54,626
The CEO of Omnicorp, Raymond Sellers.

887
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,250
Hello, Pat - Raymond.

888
01:10:57,332 --> 01:10:58,586
Thanks for having me.

889
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:01,617
You must be doing a
victory lap about now.

890
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:05,917
Two weeks ago, Omni stock
went through the roof.

891
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:11,029
And the Senate finally agreed to vote
on the repeal of the Dreyfuss act.

892
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:14,100
Well, look, I mean the
tide is definitely turning.

893
01:11:14,595 --> 01:11:17,515
I just feel certain that soon
we'll be keeping all Americans safe.

894
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,256
I certainly hope so. But I think our next
guest will have a different point of view.

895
01:11:23,015 --> 01:11:26,854
Hubert Dreyfuss. Senator,
thank you for attending.

896
01:11:26,939 --> 01:11:28,760
Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellers.

897
01:11:28,844 --> 01:11:31,139
Senator, do you know what this is?

898
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,051
The American public is
divided on the Dreyfuss act.

899
01:11:35,136 --> 01:11:39,439
Our polls at Novakelement.com are tight.

900
01:11:39,524 --> 01:11:40,804
50 % to 50 %.

901
01:11:41,095 --> 01:11:44,625
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,

902
01:11:44,707 --> 01:11:48,323
But this bill is not about Alex Murphy.

903
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,720
It's about weather America's
willing to give robots

904
01:11:50,805 --> 01:11:52,600
the authority over human lives.

905
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,046
Look.

906
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:58,421
This uh C-change we're
witnessing. And it is a C-change.

907
01:11:58,506 --> 01:12:01,779
Shows that Americans don't really
care if our law enforcement systems

908
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:06,532
manned or unmanned. What they care about
is efficiency, and they care about safety.

909
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:07,970
You're clouding the issue.

910
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:12,546
This is clearly an attempt to sway
public opinion with a marketing stunt.

911
01:12:12,631 --> 01:12:15,752
What's clear is, with
just one system in place.

912
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:19,594
We've cut crime by 80 %.
Just Imagine if we put...

913
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:21,725
I don't know, lets say
100 systems in place.

914
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:25,301
And then I want you to ask yourself.
Why are you holding us back?

915
01:12:25,386 --> 01:12:26,912
Is that your pla.
Thank you, Senator.

916
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:28,988
And thank you, Raymond. Thank you, Pat.

917
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:32,087
Well, there you have it.

918
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,046
Who could argue with that?
Which begs the question.

919
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:41,783
Has the US Senate become Pro-Crime?

920
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:53,849
Yeah Hi No. 5000.

921
01:12:55,095 --> 01:12:56,395
Call me tomorrow.

922
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:01,180
Hey guys. Vallons
waiting for you inside.

923
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:05,194
What, you're too busy to walk us in?
I'm out here making money.

924
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,939
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

925
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:11,899
- What took you so long?
- What the hell is all this shit?

926
01:13:11,983 --> 01:13:14,268
I can't move any product with
this thing on the streets.

927
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:16,765
What are you doing to protect me?

928
01:13:16,845 --> 01:13:20,828
- Relax, the guys a walking zombie.
- Tell me your phones are off.

929
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,154
He's not going after you,
we've covered our tracks.

930
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,819
Can't manufacture
evidence out of thin air.

931
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:27,296
If he does, I'm ready for him.

932
01:13:35,595 --> 01:13:36,899
Well?

933
01:13:40,488 --> 01:13:43,087
I've been getting calls.
From whom?

934
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:49,060
Clara. We need to let her see
her husband. She has rights.

935
01:13:50,094 --> 01:13:52,671
That's not your decision.
That's legal's call.

936
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,877
But it is only a question of time
until she turns up on television.

937
01:13:57,841 --> 01:13:59,804
She can try.

938
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,493
I'll issue a gag order before
I'll let her see her husband.

939
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:05,886
I'd hop to it.

940
01:14:07,228 --> 01:14:09,402
Alex. Alex!

941
01:14:11,265 --> 01:14:12,850
Alex.

942
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:15,667
You need to come home.
Clara, please stand aside.

943
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:17,162
Need to speak to your son.

944
01:14:17,247 --> 01:14:19,519
Right now I see 3 crimes in progress.

945
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,011
Alex, listen to me.

946
01:14:22,389 --> 01:14:23,698
I know your in there.

947
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:27,617
David won't show his face at school.

948
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:30,595
He's having nightmares.

949
01:14:31,943 --> 01:14:34,747
He's falling apart I'm falling apart.

950
01:14:36,216 --> 01:14:37,515
Please...

951
01:14:38,984 --> 01:14:41,362
I can't do this on my own.

952
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:44,810
He's been scared ever since that night.

953
01:14:54,305 --> 01:14:58,045
What do you think she's
gonna do? What's he gonna do?

954
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:21,631
You Okay? David?

955
01:15:46,466 --> 01:15:48,435
He's supposed to be watching this.

956
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:52,237
Instead, he's accessing
images of Clara and David

957
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,578
arriving at school over and over again.

958
01:15:54,662 --> 01:15:59,095
Somehow he's overriding
the system's priorities.

959
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:11,702
You want me to shut him down?
No.

960
01:16:11,786 --> 01:16:13,350
Not yet.

961
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,567
I want to see what happens.

962
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:38,323
What's he doing at his house?

963
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,988
Look, He's disobeying protocol.
You have to shut him down.

964
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:46,895
As far as I can tell
he's still doing his job.

965
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,310
Adrian, give me an image of his brain.

966
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:53,786
He's undoing what we did to him.

967
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:56,939
His Dopamine levels it
are coming back to normal.

968
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,417
How is that even possible?
I haven't the faintest idea.

969
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,939
Alex?

970
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:33,274
Alex, please return to the station.

971
01:18:34,537 --> 01:18:36,279
I want to run some tests.

972
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,492
Well this should be interesting.

973
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:59,578
We're not cops alright,
we work for Antoine Vallon!

974
01:19:00,658 --> 01:19:01,957
What did you say?

975
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:04,511
We work for Antoine Vallon.

976
01:19:33,211 --> 01:19:34,703
My hand, man!

977
01:19:34,787 --> 01:19:37,180
Where is Antoine Vallon?
You broke my hand man!

978
01:19:37,904 --> 01:19:39,800
I know you remember me, Jerry.

979
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:45,770
Where's Vallon? Wait!

980
01:19:45,854 --> 01:19:48,720
If I tell you where Vallon is
he'll kill my wife and kid man.

981
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:53,626
Your wife left you in 2019 after filing
charges on you for domestic abuse.

982
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,363
And you don't have a kid.

983
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:58,109
But I do.

984
01:19:58,952 --> 01:20:00,381
I'm not asking again!

985
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,662
Look, I swear man, I don't
know where Vallon is okay?

986
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:04,729
The only guy I talk to
is his driver Marcus.

987
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:05,938
That's it man that's it!

988
01:20:06,662 --> 01:20:08,184
Does he have a phone number?

989
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:27,264
We have a problem. Alex
is breaking protocol.

990
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:29,225
What's he doing?

991
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,448
He's off solving his own murder.

992
01:20:31,532 --> 01:20:36,087
That is genius. Why
didn't I think of that?

993
01:20:43,095 --> 01:20:44,948
How long until he gets here?

994
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:46,942
- 5 minutes.
- Alright.

995
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:49,140
Johnny, you stay on these monitors.

996
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:50,502
What happened?

997
01:20:51,702 --> 01:20:54,555
Some idiot used an unencrypted phone.

998
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:57,104
Shit!

999
01:21:05,113 --> 01:21:06,716
Alright, everyone listen up!

1000
01:21:07,317 --> 01:21:08,693
He's coming.

1001
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:11,720
If he leaves alive, you don't!

1002
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,171
How do we stop him?

1003
01:21:15,523 --> 01:21:19,126
With 50 caliber and
above. Aim for the head.

1004
01:21:30,737 --> 01:21:32,136
This one's set.

1005
01:21:32,537 --> 01:21:33,988
Go! Go!

1006
01:21:34,072 --> 01:21:35,542
Run!

1007
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:37,943
Come on!

1008
01:21:40,545 --> 01:21:41,845
Ready to go!

1009
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:44,046
They're all set.

1010
01:23:11,627 --> 01:23:13,078
Finish it!

1011
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,841
Free shot!

1012
01:24:17,006 --> 01:24:19,774
Watch out.

1013
01:24:19,858 --> 01:24:23,689
Need me to call a doctor?
Come on Jack you're gonna like this.

1014
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:26,626
What's going on? What
the hell you doin here?

1015
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,850
Y'all gonna play good cop bad cop?

1016
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:31,250
No, Daniels. Bad cop, RoboCop

1017
01:24:32,908 --> 01:24:36,398
I've recovered 26 guns
from Vallon's warehouse

1018
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:38,479
13 serial numbers match

1019
01:24:38,564 --> 01:24:41,402
weapons missing from evidence, and
I got your prints all over them.

1020
01:24:41,484 --> 01:24:43,179
- This is bullshit!
- I also..

1021
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:46,149
I also have CCTV footage of
you and Vallon the same day

1022
01:24:46,234 --> 01:24:47,680
he tried to kill me.

1023
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:49,189
Why don't we talk about this?

1024
01:24:49,273 --> 01:24:52,648
It won't work, now that his partners
hit he's not gonna let it go.

1025
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:54,194
His hospital.

1026
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:56,180
Murphy's dropping by this afternoon.

1027
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:58,265
If I kill a cop I'm
looking over my shoulder..

1028
01:24:58,349 --> 01:25:00,287
You know what they do
to cops in prison man?

1029
01:25:00,368 --> 01:25:04,328
You get locked up with the
same doods you put in there.

1030
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:09,783
Think before he gives you up.

1031
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,737
Don't shoot me.

1032
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,006
I swear to Christ it was dean.

1033
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:22,094
He helped pull those
guns. Just don't shoot me.

1034
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:26,345
Thank you for your cooperation.

1035
01:25:28,247 --> 01:25:29,951
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1036
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:41,260
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1037
01:25:42,234 --> 01:25:44,100
Vallon was protected from up on high.

1038
01:25:44,185 --> 01:25:46,162
Alex, I can explain.

1039
01:25:46,863 --> 01:25:49,162
- You tipped him off today.
- Come on, man don't do this.

1040
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:50,868
You tried to kill me twice!

1041
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:55,073
I trusted you, and you
destroyed my family.

1042
01:25:55,573 --> 01:25:56,881
Confess. Now

1043
01:25:57,573 --> 01:25:59,118
in front of everyone.

1044
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:00,679
Confess!

1045
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:12,537
What happened? Tin man is down.

1046
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:14,453
Had to be done. Why?

1047
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:16,063
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1048
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:17,962
2 more seconds the
Chief's brains would have

1049
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:19,868
been splattered across
the 6 O'clock news.

1050
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:21,769
We got anything on her?

1051
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:24,738
No, she's Chief of the
Detroit Police Department.

1052
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:26,301
What do you think?

1053
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:31,203
You know what?

1054
01:26:32,506 --> 01:26:35,707
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

1055
01:26:42,314 --> 01:26:45,377
Alex, I don't know if you can hear me

1056
01:26:45,462 --> 01:26:49,126
but tonight you uncovered
a nest of vipers,

1057
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,390
Inside the Detroit Police Department.

1058
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:55,827
And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.

1059
01:26:56,627 --> 01:26:58,104
Even the police,

1060
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:02,326
the men and women sworn to keep us safe,

1061
01:27:02,408 --> 01:27:04,792
they can be bribed.

1062
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:08,337
They can be bought.

1063
01:27:09,537 --> 01:27:14,143
Machines, however, are corruption free.

1064
01:27:14,694 --> 01:27:17,987
Americans could be living in
a country where law enforcement

1065
01:27:18,069 --> 01:27:20,149
is not only efficient,

1066
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:22,251
but incorruptible.

1067
01:27:23,649 --> 01:27:25,706
Thank you Alex for all you've done.

1068
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,756
And for all that you are.

1069
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,457
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1070
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:34,823
Our Doctors are working ceaselessly.

1071
01:27:34,908 --> 01:27:37,716
But this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

1072
01:27:38,265 --> 01:27:41,029
Mrs. Klein how do you think
the attempt on Detective

1073
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:45,470
Alex Murphy's life will effect
tomorrow's vote for the Dreyfuss act?

1074
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,332
At this time Omnicorp's soul concern is.

1075
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:49,627
The full recovery of
Detective Alex Murphy.

1076
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:54,979
How many times does Detective Murphy
have to give his life for his country?

1077
01:27:55,505 --> 01:27:59,435
I sincerely hope the
Senate makes the right vote

1078
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:03,140
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices.

1079
01:28:03,225 --> 01:28:05,590
Will not have been in vain.

1080
01:28:10,193 --> 01:28:12,171
Senator Dreyfuss is my friend

1081
01:28:12,255 --> 01:28:17,323
he has been my mentor and my strength
in times of difficulty on this floor.

1082
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,813
But despite all that, I
work for the state of Ohio

1083
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:24,404
and the safety of It's
citizens is my top priority.

1084
01:28:24,904 --> 01:28:28,109
So, I vote yes. The Dreyfuss
act must be repealed.

1085
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:31,175
That's us ahead 39 to 10

1086
01:28:31,256 --> 01:28:32,835
I spoke to the senate liaison.

1087
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:35,314
It looks like it's in the
bag, but we still have to tred

1088
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:36,871
carefully with the politicians.

1089
01:28:38,073 --> 01:28:41,131
We're here live at DPD headquarters.

1090
01:28:41,212 --> 01:28:43,234
Where moments ago Clara Murphy

1091
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,086
made a shocking statement.

1092
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:48,279
Omnicorp as denied me and my son

1093
01:28:48,363 --> 01:28:50,081
access to Alex for weeks.

1094
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:52,881
I demand to know why.

1095
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,899
This treatment is inhumane

1096
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:58,938
and someone has to be held accountable.

1097
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:01,725
We're fucked.

1098
01:29:01,809 --> 01:29:04,884
No, you only need 12 votes. She
shouldn't make much difference.

1099
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,622
What about after the vote?

1100
01:29:06,707 --> 01:29:11,394
Those two should not be aloud contact.
If she starts putting ideas in his head..

1101
01:29:11,475 --> 01:29:14,716
Bring her in. I'll
handle the explanation.

1102
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,113
What about Alex? Unfortunately
we can't just keep him on ice.

1103
01:29:19,194 --> 01:29:21,711
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1104
01:29:21,795 --> 01:29:24,322
They're our clients we
have to take care of them.

1105
01:29:24,404 --> 01:29:26,912
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate

1106
01:29:26,997 --> 01:29:30,108
when a man is
investigating city politics

1107
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:31,439
they get nervous.

1108
01:29:31,523 --> 01:29:33,920
Alright. First, it's not a man okay?

1109
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:35,640
It's property of Omnicorp.

1110
01:29:35,724 --> 01:29:38,127
And politicians are the
least of your concern.

1111
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,045
I mean this thing
solved it's own murder.

1112
01:29:40,127 --> 01:29:42,685
How long until it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it.

1113
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:45,429
If that happens, every
journalist in this country

1114
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:48,279
is dying to speak with him
I mean We created a hero.

1115
01:29:49,082 --> 01:29:51,783
What happens when he opens his mouth?

1116
01:29:55,287 --> 01:29:57,189
What's bigger then a hero?

1117
01:30:08,796 --> 01:30:10,300
A dead hero.

1118
01:30:14,505 --> 01:30:16,206
Get me Doctor Norton.

1119
01:30:25,215 --> 01:30:26,912
What is this, Raymond?

1120
01:30:27,613 --> 01:30:29,287
You have Mattox spying on me

1121
01:30:29,368 --> 01:30:31,569
and now this bullshit
about critical condition?

1122
01:30:31,654 --> 01:30:34,770
You and I know that Alex is fine!

1123
01:30:34,854 --> 01:30:37,002
Calm down, Dennett.

1124
01:30:37,085 --> 01:30:40,371
- Your work is so good that...
- It is not my work!

1125
01:30:40,453 --> 01:30:42,581
You saw the woman on TV!

1126
01:30:42,662 --> 01:30:44,332
This has to stop!

1127
01:30:46,332 --> 01:30:50,198
You're right, but Let
me ask you something.

1128
01:30:50,283 --> 01:30:53,103
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1129
01:30:53,185 --> 01:30:56,703
He's never going to be a
normal man, a father, a husband.

1130
01:30:56,787 --> 01:31:00,845
By the time we put the other units
on the street he's just Dennett...

1131
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:06,551
Face it. We failed him.

1132
01:31:08,402 --> 01:31:10,328
We failed Alex Murphy.

1133
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:12,193
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture.

1134
01:31:12,274 --> 01:31:13,725
Because that's what we're talking about.

1135
01:31:13,809 --> 01:31:16,711
The work you've done with him is
going to be studied for decades.

1136
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:18,877
You've changed the
face of history Dennett.

1137
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,399
No Policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again.

1138
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:25,167
Because of you.

1139
01:31:26,969 --> 01:31:28,770
Think about that!

1140
01:31:36,978 --> 01:31:41,046
I want that family taken care of.

1141
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,613
Beyond their wildest
dreams. We owe them that.

1142
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,265
I agree.

1143
01:31:45,345 --> 01:31:48,337
I want full funding. 10 years.

1144
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,136
New staff. All my own people.

1145
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:54,795
Fantastic. Deal!

1146
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:07,149
Hey, what's going on?
Security's here their

1147
01:32:07,234 --> 01:32:08,484
clearing everyone out.

1148
01:32:08,568 --> 01:32:12,256
Their not waking him up. What
ever you do don't leave him alone.

1149
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:14,278
What do you mean their
not waking him up?

1150
01:32:15,412 --> 01:32:19,261
The voting period has ended. The
clerks have tabulated the results.

1151
01:32:19,345 --> 01:32:23,920
The yeas are 63 The neighs are 22.

1152
01:32:24,621 --> 01:32:26,979
The majority of senators
have voted in the affirmative.

1153
01:32:27,063 --> 01:32:30,823
The Dreyfuss act has
been repealed by congress.

1154
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:39,286
God, you guys are slow.
Like a bunch of girls.

1155
01:32:39,368 --> 01:32:41,582
This is Mattox.
Dennetts on board.

1156
01:32:41,662 --> 01:32:43,140
It's about time.

1157
01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:50,011
Call it.

1158
01:32:50,095 --> 01:32:51,550
Get it done.

1159
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:54,319
My pleasure.

1160
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,113
Mrs. Murphy.

1161
01:33:03,197 --> 01:33:05,274
You can come here as much as you want

1162
01:33:05,354 --> 01:33:08,515
you can threaten me, you can
sue me, you can take my home

1163
01:33:08,599 --> 01:33:10,618
but I'm not going to stop
until I see my husband.

1164
01:33:10,701 --> 01:33:11,634
Do you understand that?

1165
01:33:11,716 --> 01:33:14,064
Mr. Sellers would very
much like to see you.

1166
01:33:15,944 --> 01:33:16,577
Is Alex okay?

1167
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:18,912
He has important
information to share with you.

1168
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:21,171
Will you accompany me?

1169
01:33:23,372 --> 01:33:24,876
David...

1170
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:28,595
We gotta go, can you grab your coat?

1171
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:30,725
Hey!

1172
01:33:30,809 --> 01:33:33,126
I'm in the elevator on my way
down. I need access to the lab.

1173
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:35,426
That's insane, they're still here.

1174
01:33:35,511 --> 01:33:37,229
Distract them.

1175
01:33:37,313 --> 01:33:38,591
Okay.

1176
01:33:39,305 --> 01:33:42,779
- I can not...
- There's a lady in here going hysterical.

1177
01:33:42,863 --> 01:33:44,935
She will not let us in, she's
got the codes for the door.

1178
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,872
I repeat she will not let us in.

1179
01:33:46,956 --> 01:33:49,042
Lady, you need to let us in there
now. We have to get in there.

1180
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:50,836
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

1181
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,899
Do you want to be responsible for the
death of everyone in this building?

1182
01:33:53,979 --> 01:33:55,470
Hey! Stop!

1183
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:01,439
- Don't shoot!
- Step outside.

1184
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:10,515
Unlock the transmitter!

1185
01:34:11,515 --> 01:34:13,216
Transmitter unlocked.

1186
01:34:19,412 --> 01:34:23,225
Send in Mrs. Murphy please.
Right away sir.

1187
01:34:25,337 --> 01:34:27,037
Wake him up

1188
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:30,131
Alex!

1189
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:33,680
Alex, it's Doctor Norton.
You have to wake up!

1190
01:34:33,764 --> 01:34:35,537
Alex, can you hear me?

1191
01:34:36,654 --> 01:34:38,055
These men are here to kill us!

1192
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:40,841
They're here to kill
us for Christ sakes!

1193
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:49,015
Ms. Murphy, last night,
Alex had a psychotic break.

1194
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,702
He killed an unarmed colleague

1195
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:54,252
later suffered a seizure.

1196
01:34:55,104 --> 01:34:58,613
We did everything, everything, we could

1197
01:34:58,697 --> 01:35:00,460
but the doctors couldn't save him.

1198
01:35:00,979 --> 01:35:03,037
Very sorry Mrs Murphy.

1199
01:35:03,121 --> 01:35:05,867
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1200
01:35:06,515 --> 01:35:09,117
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

1201
01:35:09,518 --> 01:35:11,269
Mattox shut you down.

1202
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:15,372
I removed your transmitter so
that he wouldn't do it again.

1203
01:35:15,773 --> 01:35:17,975
Sellers can not afford to wake you up.

1204
01:35:18,774 --> 01:35:21,537
He sent these guys to pull the plug.

1205
01:35:21,618 --> 01:35:24,930
He wants you dead Alex. You understand?

1206
01:35:25,282 --> 01:35:28,720
Sorry, if there is anything we can
do for you and David, we'll do it.

1207
01:35:28,805 --> 01:35:30,487
I want nothing from you.

1208
01:35:31,889 --> 01:35:33,287
I Understand.

1209
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:36,091
You stay out of our lives.

1210
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:40,694
- You and your company.
- If that's what you think is best.

1211
01:35:41,697 --> 01:35:44,850
There's one more thing, I think it
will be to the benefit of everyone

1212
01:35:44,934 --> 01:35:48,255
especially David, if we
kept this matter private.

1213
01:35:48,337 --> 01:35:51,104
We don't want to damage Alex's legacy.

1214
01:35:54,006 --> 01:35:55,877
Alex... Alex

1215
01:35:55,961 --> 01:35:57,582
Alex I can fix this.

1216
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:00,782
You lied to me You lied to my wife.

1217
01:36:00,863 --> 01:36:02,395
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me?

1218
01:36:02,478 --> 01:36:03,323
You want me to trust you Doctor?

1219
01:36:03,404 --> 01:36:05,515
Alex I can go to the press!

1220
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,698
Alex, I can tell them the whole story!

1221
01:36:09,782 --> 01:36:11,274
Alex!

1222
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:13,774
Listen to me, please!

1223
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:17,328
Alex! Alex!

1224
01:36:29,939 --> 01:36:31,488
What the hell?

1225
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:42,850
Give all of our systems a green light.
For Christ sakes get Sellers on the phone.

1226
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:45,953
Roger that Damn, Damn, Damn...

1227
01:36:47,252 --> 01:36:48,956
Look at this city.

1228
01:36:50,658 --> 01:36:52,359
So beautiful.

1229
01:36:53,261 --> 01:36:56,162
It's become so peaceful.

1230
01:36:58,765 --> 01:37:03,317
I wish I had good news for Detroit.

1231
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:05,537
I have very sad news.

1232
01:37:05,622 --> 01:37:08,372
Despite our best efforts to save him.

1233
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,328
Alex Murphy passed away just hours ago.

1234
01:37:11,412 --> 01:37:13,676
- Alex Murphy...
- Mr. Sellers.

1235
01:37:14,176 --> 01:37:16,390
What is it? Mattox just called.

1236
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,634
We need you to come with us now.

1237
01:37:24,189 --> 01:37:25,930
Ma'am, I need you to
turn around and go the

1238
01:37:26,015 --> 01:37:27,560
other way please -What
are you talking about?

1239
01:37:27,644 --> 01:37:30,546
We've got a security situation here. I need
you to turn around and go the other way.

1240
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:33,738
Sir, there is a car outside...
That area is locked down, now go!

1241
01:37:33,823 --> 01:37:35,595
- What's happening?
- I said go!

1242
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:38,001
I want to talk to Mr. Sellers.

1243
01:37:41,002 --> 01:37:43,546
- Mr. Sellers.
- How close is the helicopter?

1244
01:37:43,631 --> 01:37:45,207
About 10 minutes sir.

1245
01:38:02,121 --> 01:38:03,497
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1246
01:38:03,581 --> 01:38:05,765
I need to speak with
with Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1247
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,319
It's an emergency.

1248
01:38:07,404 --> 01:38:11,457
Stand by. Mr. Sellers, apparently
there is a Clara Murphy in the lobby.

1249
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:12,810
- What?
- Raymond...

1250
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,880
If she sees him we are dead in the water.
What do you want to do?

1251
01:38:15,962 --> 01:38:18,287
Bring Ms. Murphy up here. Yes, sir.

1252
01:38:21,804 --> 01:38:25,194
Norton said that they may be
using drones for protection.

1253
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:27,395
So, what ever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

1254
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:29,386
They won't shoot if we're unarmed.

1255
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,099
Clear? Clear!

1256
01:38:47,462 --> 01:38:48,962
Hold it right there!

1257
01:38:50,265 --> 01:38:51,666
Don't move!

1258
01:38:53,768 --> 01:38:55,783
This is private property!

1259
01:38:55,868 --> 01:38:58,270
You are not authorized to be here!

1260
01:39:02,225 --> 01:39:04,332
I would put those guns
down now if I were you.

1261
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:06,279
Stand down, stand down.
Alright, okay..

1262
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,220
Head to the lower level!

1263
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:58,225
- Hold up! Hold up!
- Ram it!

1264
01:40:58,082 --> 01:40:59,710
Gun it!

1265
01:41:00,323 --> 01:41:02,180
Go, go, go!

1266
01:41:18,497 --> 01:41:19,908
Alex, run!

1267
01:41:20,984 --> 01:41:23,390
Omnicorp security! Drop your weapons!

1268
01:41:23,474 --> 01:41:25,024
Drop your weapons.

1269
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:28,703
Keep your hands on your head
and no one will be harmed.

1270
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:43,966
What's going on?

1271
01:41:44,046 --> 01:41:46,198
Mrs Murphy I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1272
01:41:46,527 --> 01:41:49,462
The organic part of your
husband, Alex, is dead.

1273
01:41:49,545 --> 01:41:51,720
The robotic part of
him is malfunctioning.

1274
01:41:51,804 --> 01:41:53,689
And he's shooting at
the building. So we gotta

1275
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,462
get you and your son
out of here right away.

1276
01:41:55,546 --> 01:41:56,920
I gotta take this call.

1277
01:41:58,095 --> 01:42:00,109
He just left the lobby.
He's headed our way.

1278
01:42:00,194 --> 01:42:01,573
Roger that Sir.

1279
01:42:02,087 --> 01:42:05,514
Don't shoot my robot, you just flank.
Got it.

1280
01:42:05,595 --> 01:42:07,095
Tin Man.

1281
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:10,872
Tin Man!

1282
01:42:11,519 --> 01:42:12,920
Tin Man!

1283
01:42:13,234 --> 01:42:14,636
There it is.

1284
01:42:15,243 --> 01:42:16,645
You look like crap.

1285
01:42:19,153 --> 01:42:21,573
What's the matter? Can't shoot?

1286
01:42:24,792 --> 01:42:27,131
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1287
01:42:27,216 --> 01:42:30,234
You're a robot. I am a Red asset.

1288
01:42:30,317 --> 01:42:31,720
I wrote that myself.

1289
01:42:31,805 --> 01:42:33,086
What do you think?

1290
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:35,729
Come on Tin Man just pull the trigger.

1291
01:42:35,854 --> 01:42:37,600
Pull it.

1292
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:40,845
You can run. Go on.

1293
01:42:40,926 --> 01:42:42,670
Run!

1294
01:42:42,752 --> 01:42:44,225
Run.

1295
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:45,680
There you go Run!

1296
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:47,911
Run! Run!

1297
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:54,109
Stings like a bitch, don't' it?

1298
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,439
Lucky, lucky, I didn't
have my gun set to kill.

1299
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:02,192
Listen, this isn't personal.

1300
01:43:03,435 --> 01:43:06,523
Well, Maybe a little.

1301
01:43:06,966 --> 01:43:08,935
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

1302
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:23,381
Helicopters approaching
Mr. Sellers boards first.

1303
01:43:23,671 --> 01:43:26,770
No, no. Mrs. Murphy. You and
your son can get on first.

1304
01:43:32,268 --> 01:43:35,613
Officer down, mechanical
room, Omnicorp Building.

1305
01:43:35,694 --> 01:43:37,645
Roger that, EMS on the way.

1306
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:42,305
You're going to be okay Jack. Non fatal.

1307
01:43:42,747 --> 01:43:44,779
Go, go!

1308
01:43:45,743 --> 01:43:48,291
Omni LZ - Helot-1
on approach to deck.

1309
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,502
What's that?

1310
01:43:57,287 --> 01:43:59,046
He's got a gun! What?

1311
01:43:59,127 --> 01:44:00,796
Pull up! Pull up!

1312
01:44:05,064 --> 01:44:07,779
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir, I don't know.

1313
01:44:13,295 --> 01:44:14,810
- Alex?
- Dad?

1314
01:44:18,822 --> 01:44:20,220
Clara, David...

1315
01:44:21,368 --> 01:44:23,376
Wait...

1316
01:44:24,189 --> 01:44:26,493
Get out of the way.
Alex put down the gun.

1317
01:44:26,578 --> 01:44:28,854
Clara, take David and
get out of the way now!

1318
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,014
Raymond Sellers, you're under arrest for
the attempted murder of a police officer.

1319
01:44:37,167 --> 01:44:39,908
You're here to cuff me? Alright.

1320
01:44:40,457 --> 01:44:42,073
Go ahead. Cuff me.

1321
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:46,127
You can't, you're not
programmed that way.

1322
01:44:46,211 --> 01:44:49,212
If you go against the program
the entire system shuts down.

1323
01:44:49,296 --> 01:44:51,595
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1324
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,960
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

1325
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,810
- I'm just from marketing.
- NOW!

1326
01:44:55,893 --> 01:44:57,457
Okay, Yep, yep yep yep...

1327
01:44:57,537 --> 01:44:59,872
Alex, we need work together.

1328
01:44:59,957 --> 01:45:03,407
Because I'm the one with the
technology to keep you alive.

1329
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:06,238
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

1330
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:12,511
Right.

1331
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,310
Weapon

1332
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:18,706
Alex, honestly, I mean you no harm.

1333
01:45:18,787 --> 01:45:21,270
If I wanted to I could have
killed you along time ago.

1334
01:45:21,354 --> 01:45:23,193
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1335
01:45:23,277 --> 01:45:25,060
Sellers, please Don't!

1336
01:45:25,144 --> 01:45:28,162
I mean if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family.

1337
01:45:28,853 --> 01:45:30,145
And I could just kill them too.

1338
01:45:30,229 --> 01:45:33,362
And really there's nothing you can
do about it because lets face it.

1339
01:45:34,354 --> 01:45:37,152
You're a robot.

1340
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:38,694
You understand that?

1341
01:45:43,171 --> 01:45:45,171
Alex.

1342
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,626
Dad!

1343
01:45:59,018 --> 01:46:01,018
Hey,

1344
01:46:03,698 --> 01:46:06,113
Everything's gonna be alright.

1345
01:46:06,404 --> 01:46:08,238
Everything's gonna be alright.

1346
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,600
How you feeling, Alex?

1347
01:47:02,122 --> 01:47:03,564
I'm ready.

1348
01:47:41,377 --> 01:47:42,845
He's ready.

1349
01:48:16,644 --> 01:48:21,109
There's still no word from
Omnicorp parent company OCP.

1350
01:48:21,724 --> 01:48:25,412
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy.

1351
01:48:25,649 --> 01:48:28,417
Rumors continue to swirly
about his condition.

1352
01:48:28,546 --> 01:48:32,849
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by a cell phone.

1353
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:35,809
That shows the people
of Detroit may have Alex

1354
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:38,895
Murphy back on the street
sooner then they think.

1355
01:48:41,055 --> 01:48:44,412
The real tragedy here
is that our President

1356
01:48:44,497 --> 01:48:47,787
chose to uphold the Dreyfuss act.

1357
01:48:48,783 --> 01:48:53,511
I have no doubt that he was
manipulated by bias media.

1358
01:48:53,595 --> 01:48:57,716
And by whistle blower Dennett Norton.

1359
01:48:57,801 --> 01:49:01,608
I acknowledged we know
less then we thought.

1360
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,680
But I do believe my
research program is sound.

1361
01:49:06,854 --> 01:49:09,270
What I did with it.

1362
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:11,060
Was wrong.

1363
01:49:11,145 --> 01:49:13,916
The fact that this mother F ♪

1364
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,634
is not serving time in
some federal penitentiary

1365
01:49:17,716 --> 01:49:20,765
is a huge hot heaping pile of horse sh ♪

1366
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:31,618
I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous.

1367
01:49:31,703 --> 01:49:35,082
And these machines violate
your civil liberties.

1368
01:49:35,167 --> 01:49:39,287
Some of you even believe that
the use of these drones overseas

1369
01:49:39,368 --> 01:49:44,326
makes us the same kind
of bullying imperialist

1370
01:49:44,587 --> 01:49:46,993
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

1371
01:49:47,604 --> 01:49:52,792
To you I say: Stop whining!

1372
01:49:54,738 --> 01:49:59,854
America is now, and always will be

1373
01:49:59,935 --> 01:50:04,372
the greatest country on
the face of the earth!

1374
01:50:08,407 --> 01:50:10,444
I'm Pat Novak.

1375
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,622
Good night.
