1
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,336
- ( heavy breathing )

2
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,444
Oh. Oh.

3
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,722
( keys jangle )

4
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,122
( shriek )

5
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,758
( shouting )

6
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,711
- ( shriek )

7
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,449
- This way!

8
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,020
- ( shriek )

9
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,583
( sirens )

10
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,555
- Five. - Oh, great.

11
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,756
- You got an arrow right in your chest,

12
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,757
and you're out 10 rounds. - Oh, no.

13
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,025
- Don't worry about it, Mike.

14
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,293
I got resurrection. I'll bring you back.

15
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,828
- I'm already one of the undead, Greg.

16
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,730
I can still throw death spells, huh, Steve?

17
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,031
- I'm just trying to help you out, man.

18
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,099
Don't be so cranky.

19
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,901
- How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?

20
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,203
Where's our pizza, man? Get it? Huh?

21
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,638
- Well, I'm ready now to play.

22
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,206
- You know you're a thief.

23
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,108
- I'm ready to play now, you guys.

24
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,309
- We're in the middle, Elliott.

25
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,578
Can't just join any universe in the middle.

26
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,280
- I got him! I got him!

27
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,915
Hey, what am I asking him for now?

28
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,018
- Papa Oom Mow Mow. - Okay. Papa Oom Mow Mow.

29
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,020
Yeah. - Mike?

30
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,189
- I know. It's not for us. It's for his mother.

31
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,259
- Mike?

32
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,627
- Papa Oom Mow Mow.

33
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,061
- You have to ask Steve. He's gamemaster.

34
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,696
He has absolute power.

35
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,100
- Steve. - Thanks a lot. Bye.

36
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,835
- Go wait for the pizza first.

37
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,803
- Then I'm in? - Yeah, you're in.

38
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,838
Figure out your strategy,

39
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,674
'cause you playing after Greg.

40
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,844
- With plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

41
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,046
- Everything but the little fishies.

42
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,982
( dog barks )

43
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,380
( clanging )

44
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,416
- Harvey?

45
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,018
Harvey, is that you, boy?

46
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,887
- Oh, this is great time. I destroyed the dungeon.

47
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,988
- Is this the one I asked for?

48
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,356
- Yeah, that's the one you asked for.

49
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,359
( overlapping voices )

50
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,995
- Stop it. - All right.

51
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,005
- Harvey?

52
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,689
( clanging )

53
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,914
- All's you can get is those 40-year-olds.

54
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,316
- So how do you win this game anyway?

55
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,717
- There's no winning.

56
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,419
It's like life. You don't win at life.

57
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,054
- Money helps. - Yeah, but--

58
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,056
- Mom! Mom! There's something out--

59
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:57,990
- Where's the pizza?

60
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,792
- Mom, Mom, there's something out there!

61
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,926
It's in the toolshed!

62
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,161
- Calm down. Calm down.

63
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,196
- It threw the ball at me.

64
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,065
- Quiet!

65
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,035
Nobody go out there.

66
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,837
( all laugh )

67
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,106
- Stop. Now you guys stay right here.

68
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,176
- You stay here, Mom. We'll check it out.

69
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,378
- And put those knives back!

70
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,180
- Come on, Mom.

71
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,315
- Okay, Elliott.

72
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,121
Hold it. Wait a minute. Come on.

73
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,957
- You little creep.

74
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,926
- What exactly did you see? - It's dark out here.

75
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,328
- ( hums Twilight Zone theme )

76
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,764
( all laugh )

77
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,199
- It's scary.

78
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,805
- There's nothing in here.

79
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,239
- The gate's open.

80
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,008
- Look at these.

81
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,116
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

82
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,852
- Okay, party's over. Everybody back inside.

83
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,421
Hurry up. Quick, hurry up.

84
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,356
Tyler, give me that knife.

85
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,395
- Oh, great. Nice one, Elliott.

86
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,796
- It was an accident.

87
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,264
- A pizza. - Yeah, accident.

88
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,533
- Who said you guys could order a pizza, huh?

89
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,535
- Uh, him. - Huh?

90
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,938
- In the house. - You geek, man.

91
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,273
- But, Mom, it was real. I swear.

92
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,842
- Douche bag, Elliott.

93
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,111
- No douche bag talk in my house.

94
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,318
( heavy breathing )

95
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,334
( dog whimpers )

96
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,869
( whistles )

97
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,977
- Elliott, you're crazy.

98
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,335
- ( grunts )

99
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,025
( heavy breathing )

100
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,132
( shrieks )

101
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,602
- Aah!

102
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,039
( screaming and shrieking )

103
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,535
( whistles )

104
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,973
- Hello?

105
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,244
( whistles )

106
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,320
Hello?

107
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,596
( keys jangle )

108
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,629
( heavy breathing )

109
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,273
- What are you going as for Halloween?

110
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,142
- I'm not going to stupid Halloween.

111
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,277
- Why don't you go as a goblin?

112
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,212
- Shut up.

113
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,814
- It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

114
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,417
- Well, it was real. I swear.

115
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,688
- What are you going as, Gert?

116
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,124
- I'm going as a cowgirl.

117
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,127
- So what else is new?

118
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,695
- Maybe it was an iguana.

119
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,430
- It was no iguana.

120
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,433
- Maybe a... you know how they say

121
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,668
there are alligators in the sewers?

122
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,670
- Alligators in the sewers.

123
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,139
- All we're trying to say

124
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,574
is maybe you just probably imagined it.

125
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,176
- I couldn't have imagined it.

126
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,545
- Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid or something.

127
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,846
- A deformed kid.

128
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,549
- Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

129
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,718
- It was nothing like that, penis breath.

130
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,787
- Elliott. ( laughs )

131
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,422
Sit down.

132
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,224
( clears throat )

133
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,227
- Dad would believe me.

134
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,600
- Maybe you ought to call your father

135
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,868
and tell him about it.

136
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,405
- I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

137
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,718
- Where's Mexico?

138
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,390
- Excuse me.

139
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,664
- I'm gonna kill you.

140
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,634
- If you ever see it again, whatever it is,

141
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,702
don't touch it.

142
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,736
Just call me

143
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,206
and we'll have somebody come and take it away.

144
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,508
- Like the dog catcher?

145
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,210
- But they'll give it a lobotomy

146
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,480
or do experiments on it or something.

147
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,282
- It's your turn to do the dishes, fellas.

148
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,650
- I set and cleared.

149
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,918
- I set and cleared.

150
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,186
- I did breakfast.

151
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,422
- I did breakfast.

152
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,459
- What's the matter, Mom?

153
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,294
- ( sighs )

154
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,197
He hates Mexico.

155
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,534
- Damn it. Why don't you grow up?

156
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,704
Think how other people feel for a change.

157
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,492
- ( whines )

158
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,614
- Mom. Mom. Michael.

159
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,355
Michael. Mom.

160
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,527
- ( grunts )

161
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,355
( coos )

162
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,445
( coos )

163
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,657
( crash )

164
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,797
- Wow.

165
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,552
- ( coos )

166
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,994
- ( chuckles )

167
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,799
( keys jangle )

168
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,074
- Okay, you're hot.

169
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,776
I'll be back.

170
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,147
- Mary, can I back the car out?

171
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,650
- Not one foot past the driveway.

172
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,741
( clunk )

173
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,342
You were outside last night

174
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,978
waiting for that thing to come back, weren't you?

175
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,982
You gonna live if I go to work?

176
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,021
Okay.

177
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,189
No TV.

178
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,733
Come on.

179
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,735
- Mommy, look what Michael did.

180
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,136
This and that and--

181
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:18,970
- I see it, Gert.

182
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,206
and when I catch him, I'll catch him.

183
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,113
- Come on.

184
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,914
It's all right.

185
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,149
Come on.

186
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,258
Come on.

187
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,194
Come on. Come on.

188
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,097
- ( heavy breathing )

189
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,341
- Do you talk?

190
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,944
You know, talk?

191
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,347
Me human.

192
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,049
Boy.

193
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,450
Elliott.

194
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,387
Elliott.

195
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,856
Elliott.

196
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,804
Coke, see? We drink it.

197
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:30,408
It's a drink. You know, food.

198
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,110
These are toys.

199
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,011
These are little men.

200
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:39,784
This is Guido and then this is Hammerhead.

201
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,920
See? This is Walrus Man,

202
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,889
and then this is Snaggletooth.

203
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:49,894
And this is Lando Calrissian, see?

204
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,864
And this is Boba Fett.

205
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,532
And look, they can even have wars.

206
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,134
Look at this.

207
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,771
( imitates gunshots )

208
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,841
And look. Fish.

209
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,044
The fish eat the fish food

210
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,546
and the shark eats the fish,

211
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,382
but nobody eats the shark.

212
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:17,188
See? This is Pez. Candy.

213
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,957
See? You eat it.

214
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,026
You put the candy in here.

215
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,896
Then when you lift up the head, the candy comes out

216
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,397
and you can eat it.

217
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,365
You want some?

218
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,338
This is a peanut. You eat it.

219
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,842
But you can't eat this one, 'cause this is fake.

220
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,178
This is money, see?

221
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,349
We put the money in the peanut, you see?

222
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,217
Bank. See?

223
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,555
Then this is a car.

224
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,358
This is what we get around in.

225
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,294
See? Car.

226
00:29:59,097 --> 00:29:59,864
Hey!

227
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,333
Hey, wait a second.

228
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,270
No. You don't eat 'em.

229
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,105
Are you hungry?

230
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,308
I'm hungry.

231
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,113
Stay.

232
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:23,655
Stay. I'll be right here, okay?

233
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,024
I'll be right here.

234
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,158
Harv!

235
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,393
- ( shrieks )

236
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,328
( barks ) - No bite! No bite!

237
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,199
Come on, Harvey.

238
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,974
- I like this.

239
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,883
This.

240
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,953
This.

241
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,289
Aah! - ( shrieks )

242
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,370
- ( sighs )

243
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,615
Are you okay?

244
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,118
- ( whimpers )

245
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,554
- Too much excitement, huh?

246
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,923
Want a Coke?

- How you feeling, faker?

259
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,990
- I'm feeling fine.

260
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,625
Look, I got something really important to tell you--

261
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,094
- You know, Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids yesterday,

262
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,462
but he pulled the plug.

263
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,531
- Remember the goblin?

264
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,266
- You're so lame, Elliott.

265
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,535
- Come on, Michael. He came back.

266
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,171
- He came back?

267
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:24,208
He came back? Oh, my God!

268
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,110
- One thing.

269
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,513
I have absolute power.

270
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,348
Say it. Say it.

271
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,784
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

272
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,087
- No. Look.

273
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,691
Okay, now swear it.

274
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,293
The most excellent promise you can make.

275
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,130
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

276
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,166
- Elliott, don't get so heavy. I swear.

277
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,069
- Okay, stand over there.

278
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,638
And you better take off your shoulder pads.

279
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,040
- What? - You might scare him.

280
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,643
And close your eyes.

281
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,244
- Don't push it, Elliott.

282
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,047
- I'm not coming out there until your eyes are closed.

283
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,516
- Okay, they're closed.

284
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,787
Mom's gonna kill you. Ugh...

285
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,491
- Okay, swear it one more time.

286
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,792
I have absolute--

287
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,295
- You have absolute power. Yes.

288
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,101
- ( grunt )

289
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,576
- Elliott, look what I made for you.

290
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,811
- ( groans )

291
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,780
- Aah!

292
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:40,318
- ( shriek ) - Stop!

293
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,652
Stop!

294
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,754
- ( shriek )

295
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,489
- Aah!

296
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,192
- Aah!

297
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,761
- Kids, I'm home.

298
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,095
Guys?

299
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,463
- In the closet! Fast!

300
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,831
- ( grunt )

301
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,633
- Aah!

302
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,135
- ( shriek )

303
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,569
- Anybody home?

304
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,872
Hi, honey. How you feel--

305
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,208
What happened in here?

306
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,444
- Oh, you mean, my room?

307
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,581
- This is no room.

308
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,183
This is an accident.

309
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,852
- I was, um, reorganizing.

310
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,454
- I can see that.

311
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,723
Put those shelves back on the wall, Elliott.

312
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,824
- ( muffled scream )

313
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,259
- Let's get the toys off the floor.

314
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,262
Make your bed, since you are not using it.

315
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,330
Well, you're feeling better, I see.

316
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:30,468
Guys, keep an eye on Gertie for me while I take a shower.

317
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,870
- Absolutely.

318
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,706
Bye, Mom.

319
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,376
( sighs )

320
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,483
- ( groan )

321
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,818
- Elliott?

322
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,920
- I'm keeping him.

323
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,922
- ( coos )

324
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,225
- What is it?

325
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,761
- He won't hurt you, Gertie.

326
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,298
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

327
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,200
We're not gonna hurt you.

328
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,536
- Is he a boy or a girl?

329
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,171
- He's a boy.

330
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,810
- Was he wearing any clothes?

331
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,280
- No, but look.

332
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,516
You can't tell.

333
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,784
Not even Mom.

334
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,419
- Why not?

335
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:25,289
- 'Cause, uh, grownups can't see him.

336
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,593
Only little kids can see him.

337
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,261
- Give me a break.

338
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,831
- Well, do you know what's going to happen

339
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,566
if you do tell?

340
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,971
Do it, Mike. We have to.

341
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,773
- Oh, no! Please, no!

342
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,709
Don't do anything, please!

343
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,712
Gertie, help me. Help me.

344
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,881
- Promise?

345
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,249
- Yes.

346
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,317
- Do you promise?

347
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,358
- ( groans )

348
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,367
( keys jangle )

349
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,989
- What are you doing, Gert?

350
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,926
- I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

351
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,028
- Okay. Don't let him torture you.

352
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,264
- I won't, Mary.

353
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,782
- Come on. Come on, hurry up.

354
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,752
- Don't be pushy, pushy.

355
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,690
That's for you.

356
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,361
- Maybe he's some animal that wasn't supposed to live.

357
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,528
You know, like those rabbits we saw that time.

358
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,696
- Red, green, orange, red--

359
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,764
- Don't be lame.

360
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,933
- Could be a monkey or an orangutan or something.

361
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,534
- A bald monkey?

362
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,871
- Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.

363
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,540
You can make faces

364
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,478
and make them mean and happy

365
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,013
and make them get sharp teeth--

366
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,814
- We are here.

367
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,082
- And you can make 'em have their head cut off.

368
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,384
- We're here. - No, use this.

369
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,555
- Okay, we're here.

370
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,792
We are here. Where are you from?

371
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,395
- ( gurgles )

372
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,540
- I don't like his feet.

373
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,742
- They're only feet, you little twerp.

374
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,844
He's trying to tell us something.

375
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,991
Earth.

376
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,693
Home.

377
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,695
Home.

378
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,596
Home.

379
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,631
- ( grunts )

380
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,102
- What's he doing?

381
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,972
- What's happening?

382
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,409
( rumbling )

383
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,519
- Elliott.

384
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,456
- Oh, wow.

385
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,427
Aah!

386
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,071
- Elliott, what is it?

387
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,573
- I don't know. Something scary.

388
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:29,026
( keys jangle )

389
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,996
( voices )

390
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,529
- ( coos )

391
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,975
- Did you explain school to him?

392
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,211
- How do you explain school to higher intelligence?

393
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,278
- Maybe he's not that smart.

394
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,346
Maybe he's like a worker bee

395
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,081
who only knows how to push buttons or something.

396
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,649
- He's smart.

397
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,651
- Okay. I just hope we don't wake up on Mars or something

398
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,555
surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.

399
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,562
- Hey, Elliott.

400
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,631
- Hey, Elliott. Where's your goblin?

401
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,900
- Shut up. - Did he come back?

402
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,768
Well, did he?

403
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,272
- Yeah, he came back, but he's not a goblin.

404
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,707
He's a spaceman.

405
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,341
- Ooh!

406
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,710
- As in extraterrestrial.

407
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,612
- Where's he from, Uranus?

408
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,313
Get it? Your anus?

409
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,983
- He doesn't get it, Ty. - Get it? Your anus?

410
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,185
- He doesn't get it. - You're so immature.

411
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,853
- You're such a cintus supremus.

412
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,922
- Zero charisma. - Cintus supremus.

413
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,290
- Zero charisma. - Cintus supremus.

414
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:07,658
- Shut up, Greg.

415
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,360
- Cintus supremus. - Zero charisma.

416
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,629
- You wimp!

417
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,732
( shouting and laughing )

418
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,040
- Let's go.

419
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,812
Come on. Get in the car. We're gonna be late.

420
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,618
( scraping )

421
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,256
- ( sighs )

422
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,324
- Okay, boys and girls.

423
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:17,194
Today we will be doing the actual frog dissection

424
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,264
for which we've been preparing,

425
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:25,135
and you will find many similarities...

426
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,677
As you get into the dissection,

427
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,180
you will discover that the anatomy...

428
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,204
( growls )

429
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,414
- The scalpel is very sharp.

430
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,318
Use discretion when you are cutting.

431
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,886
There will be very little blood.

432
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:19,189
There may be a few body fluids.

433
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,036
- ( sniffs )

434
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,951
( sneezes )

435
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,791
- Blech!

436
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,103
( barks )

437
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,242
- As we get started with the dissection...

438
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,243
- ( belch )

439
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,045
- Eew.

440
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,117
- Remember that the things that you are writing down...

441
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,027
- ( belch )

442
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,863
- One thing that you should be looking for

443
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,133
during the dissection is to locate the heart

444
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,136
and notice that it is still beating.

445
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,406
- ( groans )

446
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,540
- I need to once more emphasize

447
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:48,112
the similarities of those things which we see in the...

448
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,053
Similarities to the human anatomy.

449
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,824
First of all, here's the heart, which is beating.

450
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,564
The intestines will be going through

451
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,934
their peristaltic action.

452
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:17,274
- Computer voice: S-W-V-U-A-F-P.

453
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,842
That is incorrect.

454
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:27,117
The correct spelling of nuisance is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.

455
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,092
- They're pulling us up.

456
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,467
- Now, class, these are the cotton balls

457
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,935
with the chloroform,

458
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,137
and as soon as I get them all in,

459
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,640
be sure and put the lid on right away.

460
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,975
That's it.

461
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,978
That will start them going to sleep.

462
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:04,121
They won't feel anything. They won't be hurt.

463
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,323
It'll take a little while.

464
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,860
If you don't want to watch them, you don't have to.

465
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,548
- Say hi.

466
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,517
Can you talk?

467
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,653
Can you say hi?

468
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,989
- ( groans )

469
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,264
( belches )

470
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,280
- Hello? Uncle Ralph.

471
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,016
It's Uncle Ralph long distance from California.

472
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,685
Ooh, I'll talk fast. This call is expensive.

473
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,220
- Oh, no, no, no.

474
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,189
If I call anytime on Saturday without an operator,

475
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,192
I can go for five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.

476
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,960
If I talk less, I pay less.

477
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,696
Let me talk to that little fella, huh?

478
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,531
- Say hello to your Uncle Ralph.

479
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,101
- Hello, Uncle Ralph.

480
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,453
- ( grunts )

481
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,189
- Save him.

482
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,164
Run for your life.

483
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,200
Down to the river. Down to the forest. Run!

484
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,703
I wanna save you.

485
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:02,105
Let's get out of here.

486
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,111
Get out. I gotta let him go.

487
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,421
You gotta save him.

488
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,146
- Let me handle this.

489
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,683
I can handle this. I can handle this.

490
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,086
I can get this.

491
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,593
- Aah!

492
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:35,499
( TV plays )

493
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,208
- Francis, what's wrong?

494
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,178
- I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't going to run tomorrow.

495
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,847
- Oh, no. Is it anything serious?

496
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,617
- Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.

497
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,089
- ( muttering )

498
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:08,265
- Here he is. - Here's who?

499
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,499
- The man from the moon.

500
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,468
But I think you killed him already.

501
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:15,138
- Honey, just as soon as I unload this stuff, okay?

502
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,112
- Med-bugs.

503
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,916
- I want you to meet somebody.

504
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,618
- This stuff has gone up so much in one week.

505
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,420
- I want you to meet somebody.

506
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,888
- Okay, honey. As soon as I get finished

507
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,124
putting all this stuff away, all right?

508
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,571
Stupid Ragu. I knew it wouldn't come out.

509
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,541
- B. - B is for basket.

510
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,478
( telephone rings ) - What's up with this mess?

511
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,546
( ring )

512
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,849
- Hello?

513
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,685
Yeah, this is she.

514
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,921
- Basket, bandit, ball.

515
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,858
Basket, bandit, ball.

516
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,593
- He was feeling a little ill yesterday.

517
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,828
- Bananas.

518
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,264
- Intoxicated?

519
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,935
( sniffs )

520
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,738
You sure you have the right Elliott?

521
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,408
- B. B. Biscuits.

522
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,210
- B.

523
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,281
B.

524
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,749
- But B is for boy with a baseball and bat.

525
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,418
- You said B.

526
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,554
- B.

527
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,423
- You said B. Good.

528
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,426
- B.

529
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,495
Good.

530
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,466
- Okay, I'll be right down. Thank you.

531
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,335
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

532
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,570
Will you be a good girl and--

533
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,239
- Mommy, he can talk.

534
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,440
- Of course he can talk.

535
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,808
I'll be right back in 10 minutes.

536
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,277
Stay there.

537
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,312
- Ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,580
Little Grover here

539
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:08,418
will demonstrate by chinning himself two times.

540
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,420
- Two times? - Two times. Okay--

541
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,855
- Can I start? - Okay, go ahead, Grover.

542
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,623
- Okay, here we go.

543
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,458
- Phone.

544
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,793
- Phone?

545
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,528
- Phone.

546
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,265
- Phone.

547
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:28,038
- You wanna call somebody?

548
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:32,275
- I am not paying for frogs.

549
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,711
- Be good. Be good.

550
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,646
Stay here. Stay.

551
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,717
And don't tell anybody. Nobody.

552
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,520
Be good. Be good.

553
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:54,030
- Oh, God.

554
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,498
- Elliott?

555
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,333
- What?

556
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,302
- Elliott. Elliott.

557
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,304
- I taught him how to talk.

558
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,306
Now he can talk now.

559
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,341
- Elliott.

560
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,443
- Look what he brought up here all by himself.

561
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,011
- Elliott, Elliott.

562
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,913
- What's he need this stuff for?

563
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:10,914
- Elliott.

564
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,717
- E.T. Can you say that?

565
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,820
Can you say E.T.? E.T.

566
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,755
- E.T.

567
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:19,990
- ( laughs )

568
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,393
- E.T., E.T., E.T. Be good.

569
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,495
- Be good. I taught him that, too.

570
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,430
- You should give him his dignity.

571
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,933
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

572
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:33,336
- Phone.

573
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,674
- Phone? He said phone?

574
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:38,975
He said phone?

575
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,011
- Can't you understand English?

576
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,346
He said phone.

577
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,485
- Home?

578
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,354
- You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

579
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:04,668
- E.T. phone home.

580
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,008
- E.T. phone home.

581
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:15,111
- E.T. phone home.

582
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,579
E.T. phone home.

583
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:19,349
- He wants to call somebody.

584
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,120
- ( chuckles )

585
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,822
Elliott, what's all this shit?

586
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,625
- E.T. phone home.

587
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,994
- Oh, my God, he's talking now.

588
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,830
- Home.

589
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,132
- E.T. phone home?

590
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:40,770
- E.T. phone home.

591
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,642
- And they'll come?

592
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,546
- Come home.

593
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,450
Home.

594
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,452
- Come on. I promise, Mom. - What book?

595
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,619
- Any one you want. Spiderman--

596
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,520
- Football.

597
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,489
- Fine. We'll just put a smile on our faces

598
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,490
and try to get through the evening.

599
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,658
That's all I want to do.

600
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,759
- Okay. Make some of your garlic bread.

601
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:03,760
That's all I'm asking.

602
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,829
- I can't ask Kathy to go trick or treating

603
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,697
in the same old sheet she wore last year.

604
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:12,168
- Now I wish I would have listened in science.

605
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,536
Think, Michael.

606
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,771
- I guess we could just grab anything

607
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,973
that looks like he can make a machine out of.

608
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,542
- What would make a radar?

609
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,545
- How the hell do I know? You're the genius here.

610
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,981
You have absolute power, remember?

611
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,951
"I found him. He belongs to me."

612
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,199
You know, Elliott,

613
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,702
he doesn't look too good anymore.

614
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,971
- Don't say that. We're fine.

615
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,507
- What's all this "we" stuff?

616
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,776
You say "we" all the time now.

617
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,944
Really, Elliott, I think he might be getting kind of sick.

618
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,079
- Look, he's fine, Michael.

619
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,048
- Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.

620
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,551
Grab that fuzz buster.

621
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,728
- Dad's shirt.

622
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,062
- Yeah.

623
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,701
- Remember when he used to take us out to the ball games

624
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,970
and take us to the movies?

625
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,206
We'd have popcorn fights.

626
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,041
- We'll do that again, Elliott.

627
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,477
- Sure.

628
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,879
( sniffs )

629
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:34,951
- ( sniffs )

630
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,753
Old Spice.

631
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,788
- Sea Breeze.

632
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,597
- "Peter says, The redskins were defeated?

633
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,533
"Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?

634
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,069
"I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her.

635
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,238
"He leaps first at his dagger,

636
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,740
"and then at his grindstone to sharpen it.

637
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,275
"But Tink alights near the shed

638
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,244
"and rings out a warning cry.

639
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,880
"Oh, that is just my medicine.

640
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:08,751
"She says, poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

641
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,620
"I promised Wendy I'd take it,

642
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,189
"and I will as soon as I have sharpened my dagger.

643
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,925
"Tink, who sees its red color

644
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,328
"and remembers the red in the pirate's eye,

645
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,163
"nobly swallows the draft

646
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,733
"as Peter's hand is reaching for it.

647
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,203
"Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine.

648
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,873
"She flutters strangely about the room,

649
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,275
answering him now in a very faint tinkle."

650
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,776
- Ouch. Ouch.

651
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,980
- "It was poison and you drank it to save my life?

652
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,883
Tink, dear Tink!"

653
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,784
- Ouch.

654
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,896
- "She says...

655
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,798
"She say she thinks she could get well again

656
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,201
if children believed in fairies."

657
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,670
Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe.

658
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,305
- I do, I do, I do.

659
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,741
- If you believe, clap your hands.

660
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,876
"Some clap, some don't. A few hiss.

661
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:10,580
And then perhaps a rush of Nanas to the nurseries..."

662
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:19,222
"But Tink is saved. Thank you.

663
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,392
"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

664
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,228
And now to rescue Wendy."

665
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,298
- Can you read it to me again?

666
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,100
- ( snoring )

667
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,635
- "Peter says...

668
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,791
- He's putting it together now.

669
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,726
I told you he was smart.

670
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:57,927
- I'm worried, Elliott.

671
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,729
He could blow up the whole house.

672
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,331
- He knows what he's doing.

673
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:02,865
- Listen to how he's breathing.

674
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,334
- ( labored breathing )

675
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,235
- It's going to work.

676
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,404
- What's he feeling now?

677
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,907
- He's feeling everything.

678
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,433
- Now, you're going as a ghost. You promised.

679
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,170
- I'm only pretending I'm going as a cowgirl.

680
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:44,874
- Okay. Now you know the plans by heart, don't you?

681
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,776
- Meet you at the lookout.

682
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,445
At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.

683
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,914
- Listen, buster, you won't get four blocks

684
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:53,750
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

685
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,051
- Please? - No, and that is final.

686
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,719
You are not going as a terrorist.

687
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:57,720
- But all the guys are.

688
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,956
- I'm not stupid, you know.

689
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,165
- Ready?

690
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,800
- Ready.

691
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,252
- No, wait, Mom. Don't look.

692
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,787
- Okay.

693
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,762
- Okay, Mom, you can look now.

694
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,498
- ( screams and laughs )

695
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,100
Oh, that's great.

696
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,903
- ( grunts )

697
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,337
- Yes.

698
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,808
( laughs )

699
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,046
- ( grunts ) Ooh.

700
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,184
Ouch...

701
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,852
- Stop that. No, don't.

702
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,821
- Ouch, ouch, ouch.

703
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,323
- It's a fake knife. It's fake.

704
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,958
- Ouch.

705
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,193
- Okay.

706
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,303
Oh, you look great.

707
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,138
- Thank you. - Thank you.

708
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,106
- Thank you.

709
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,909
( gasp )

710
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,284
- Be back one hour after sundown, no later.

711
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,389
- Oh.

712
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,924
- Bye.

713
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,828
- ( squeals ) - Gertie?

714
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,063
Come here. Come on.

715
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:46,556
- Home. Home. Home.

716
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:51,060
Home. Home. Home.

717
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:56,065
- Be back one hour after sunset, no later.

718
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,035
- I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

719
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,436
You gotta cover me.

720
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,941
- ( grunts )

721
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,243
- Well? Come on, help me.

722
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,011
- We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.

723
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,880
Just come back for sure.

724
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,442
- It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!

725
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:43,179
E.T.!

726
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:56,425
Not so high! Not so high!

727
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,490
( laughs )

728
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,632
Don't crash, please?

729
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,301
- ( grunts )

730
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,036
- Whoa!

731
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:42,331
( howling )

732
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,220
- I really can't believe you did this.

733
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,458
( muttering )

734
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,094
Your father's gonna hear about this one.

735
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,337
( sighs ) Mexico.

736
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,354
( keys jangle )

737
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,358
- ( sighs )

738
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,623
- E.T., it's working.

739
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,525
- ( grunts )

740
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,926
- It's working!

741
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,828
- Home.

742
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,831
- You did it.

743
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,800
It's working.

744
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,703
- Home?

745
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:04,673
- E.T., it's working!

746
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,367
( beeping )

747
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:50,653
- We have to go now, E.T.

748
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,656
We're so late already.

749
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,392
( coughs )

750
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,498
We have to go home now, E.T.

751
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,766
- ( grunts )

752
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,340
- You should give 'em some time.

753
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,778
- Ouch.

754
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,486
- You could be happy here.

755
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,989
I could take care of you.

756
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,991
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

757
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,660
We could grow up together, E.T.

758
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:40,769
- Home.

759
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,539
Home.

760
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,574
( moans )

761
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,847
Home.

762
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,749
- E.T.?

763
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,754
E.T.?

764
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,630
- How was he dressed when last seen?

765
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:20,169
- He was dressed as a hunchback.

766
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,871
- Hunchback.

767
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,173
Is there anything to indicate

768
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,641
that he might have run away?

769
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,644
Any family problems or recent arguments?

770
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,882
- Um, my husband and I just separated recently,

771
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:39,021
and it hasn't been easy on the children, but--

772
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:41,657
- My father's in Mexico.

773
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,531
- But run away?

774
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,034
Where would he have gone? ( crying )

775
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,002
- Elliott!

776
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,604
- Oh, Elliott!

777
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:59,575
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

778
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,912
Oh, my, you're so hot.

779
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,049
Run up and draw him a bath quick, Gert.

780
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,885
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

781
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,457
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

782
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,893
- Is he here?

783
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,097
You've got to find him, Mike.

784
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:24,099
- Where is he?

785
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:28,504
- In the forest in the bald spot.

786
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,873
You've got to find him.

787
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,958
- E.T.!

788
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,497
E.T.!

789
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,000
E.T.!

790
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,115
( thunder )

791
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,274
No!

792
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:15,110
- ( groans )

793
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,820
( keys jangle )

794
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:46,341
- Mom? Would you come with me?

795
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,243
- What is it?

796
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,245
- Mary, just come with me.

797
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,880
- Michael, what?

798
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,082
- Mom, remember the goblin?

799
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,784
- Michael, what are you talking about?

800
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,120
- Just swear the most excellent promise you can make.

801
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,755
- Michael.

802
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,829
That's terrific.

803
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,872
- Mom.

804
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:23,612
- We're sick.

805
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:28,016
I think we're dying.

806
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,321
- Michael...

807
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,989
- Mom, it's okay.

808
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,090
- ( groans )

809
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,892
- Go downstairs.

810
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:40,195
- He's not gonna hurt you, Mom.

811
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:41,296
- He's not gonna hurt you.

812
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,265
- Michael, get her downstairs.

813
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,133
- It's the man from the moon.

814
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,670
It's the man from the moon.

815
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,272
- ( groans )

816
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,140
- You don't know him.

817
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,009
You don't know him.

818
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:57,346
- ( cries )

819
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,716
- We can't leave him alone.

820
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,840
- Aah!

821
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,852
( train whistle blows )

822
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,857
- This is my home!

823
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,109
- ( shallow breathing )

824
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:10,118
( footsteps )

825
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,975
- Home.

826
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,277
Home.

827
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:02,037
( police radio )

828
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,177
( keys jangle )

829
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,289
- I don't know. - Does he sleep at night?

830
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:55,457
- I don't know.

831
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,925
What's the matter with Elliott?

832
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,995
- Have you noticed any surface swelling?

833
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:00,996
- No.

834
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,464
- Has it lost any hair?

835
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,199
- He never had any hair.

836
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,634
- Are the children all right?

837
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:09,070
- Did it ever build anything or write anything down?

838
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,539
- Uh, no.

839
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,140
- You say it has the ability

840
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:15,043
to manipulate its own environment?

841
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:18,013
- He's smart. He communicates through Elliott.

842
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,949
- Elliott thinks its thoughts?

843
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:25,420
- No. Elliott feels his feelings.

844
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,626
- We've identified the primary carrier.

845
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,094
It's definitely not recognizable.

846
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,363
- Testing shows no deficits on FNF

847
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,965
and HPS testing.

848
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,367
EEG analysis shows complete coherent and synchronization

849
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,503
of brainwave activity from both subjects.

850
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,638
- Isotonic.

851
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:47,008
Nitrates, 255 mili-equivalents.

852
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:53,949
- We have medi-starts available.

853
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,250
- Step five for helo.

854
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,351
- CVC line can help.

855
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,620
- I think we'd get more information with a Swan-Ganz.

856
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:00,255
- Fine, but let's do another thorax.

857
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:03,692
- Oxygen saturation is 82% on room air.

858
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,694
- You're scaring him.

859
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,396
You're scaring him!

860
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,633
- Good air entry, but decreased tidal volume on the boy.

861
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,102
Put him on .025 liters by nasal cannula

862
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,205
and draw a blood gas in 20 minutes.

863
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,374
- Get a hypothermia blanket and some--

864
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,410
- Leave him alone.

865
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,280
Leave him alone. I can take care of him.

866
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,982
- Get a Doppler scope in here.

867
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:28,350
and set me up for a two deep cardiac echo.

868
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,184
- I'm seeing diaphoretic.

869
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,552
We should consider all shock ideology.

870
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,420
- He's not profusing at all.

871
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:33,555
He needs anatropic support.

872
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,557
pH is down to 7.03.

873
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,726
He's got a metabolic acidosis.

874
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,694
It could be sepsis.

875
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:42,230
- We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

876
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:45,433
- He needs broad specular coverage.

877
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,409
- Elliott?

878
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,014
I've been to the forest.

879
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,349
- He shouldn't talk now.

880
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:05,020
- Well, he has to talk now, Major.

881
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:11,459
Elliott, that machine, what does it do?

882
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:15,330
- The communicator?

883
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:20,001
Is it still working?

884
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:25,440
- It's doing something. What?

885
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,642
- I really shouldn't tell.

886
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,712
He came to me.

887
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,214
He came to me.

888
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:37,285
- Elliott, he came to me, too.

889
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:42,490
I've been wishing for this since I was 10 years old.

890
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,492
I don't want him to die.

891
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:48,396
What can we do that we're not already doing?

892
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:52,500
- He needs to go home.

893
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:57,639
He's calling his people.

894
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:01,409
I don't know where they are.

895
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,812
He needs to go home.

896
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,714
- Elliott, I don't think

897
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:11,186
that he was left here intentionally,

898
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:15,490
but his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

899
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,226
It's a miracle.

900
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:21,629
And you did the best that anybody could do.

901
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,303
I'm glad he met you first.

902
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,412
- He's got DNA.

903
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,147
- Incredible.

904
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,548
- He's got DNA.

905
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:41,816
- He doesn't have four nucleotides like we do.

906
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,151
He has six.

907
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,219
- I've got desynchronization

908
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,453
of the two brainwave activity.

909
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,191
- E.T.!

910
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,393
- The boy's condition is stabilizing.

911
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,361
His blood pressure's coming back up.

912
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:57,298
- E.T.?

913
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,801
- Elliott?

914
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,569
- He's speaking!

915
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:02,570
- He's talking!

916
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:07,575
- E.T., stay with me.

917
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,177
Please.

918
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,781
- Stay together.

919
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:16,785
- I'll be right here.

920
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,854
I'll be right here.

921
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:27,362
- Stay, Elliott.

922
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,733
Stay.

923
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,536
Stay.

924
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:40,542
Stay.

925
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,178
Stay.

926
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,279
- The creature's pressure is bottoming out.

927
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:45,847
His complexes are slow and widening.

928
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,316
- How's the boy?

929
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,652
- He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

930
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,754
- They're separating.

931
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,189
- Yes, definitely separating.

932
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:55,490
- Boy and creature are completely separated.

933
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:58,226
- What does that mean? - The boy's coming back.

934
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,594
We're losing E.T.

935
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:02,764
- E.T., answer me, please.

936
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,366
- Everything's going to be fine.

937
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,402
- Please. - Just relax.

938
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,304
- No!

939
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:17,438
- E.T., don't go!

940
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:18,573
( alarm sounds ) - No blood pressure!

941
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,475
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

942
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,312
We can't get a pulse or blood pressure on the creature.

943
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:25,313
- It doesn't look like he's breathing.

944
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:26,414
- We gotta get in there.

945
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:27,982
- You can't break a sterile field.

946
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,784
- Get back.

947
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,553
- Leave him alone!

948
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,888
- How's he doing? - You're killing him!

949
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,323
Leave him alone.

950
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,258
- Get him moving.

951
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,360
- Okay, let's get the boy out of here. Get him moving.

952
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,629
- Stop it! You're killing him!

953
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:43,498
You're killing him!

954
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,633
- Move the gurney over here. Let's go.

955
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:46,935
- You're killing him!

956
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:50,505
You're killing him! You're killing him!

957
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,539
He came to me.

958
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,341
- Let's ventilate him. Any pulses?

959
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,876
- No femoral pulse. - Any pulses?

960
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,744
- He came to me!

961
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,747
( overlapping voices )

962
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,425
- Let's try some bretylium.

963
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,660
May we have some bretylium, please?

964
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,463
- Getting a pulse?

965
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,599
- Compressed air. Compressed air is fine.

966
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:22,837
- He's not ventilating!

967
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:27,375
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

968
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,843
- Quiet! Quiet!

969
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,617
- Everybody stand clear.

970
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,451
- Clear!

971
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,887
- We're losing him.

972
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:42,657
- Quiet!

973
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:43,925
- It's still defib.

974
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,527
- Okay, let's go.

975
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:56,471
- Elliott?

976
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:57,839
- Mom!

977
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,872
- Would you people stand back?

978
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:37,945
- Something's happening.

979
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,914
- Ooh, they're gonna die.

980
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,382
- Shut up, Greg.

981
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,584
- Something is definitely happening.

982
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,852
- Anybody have any ideas?

983
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,854
- EEG's flat. EKG's flat.

984
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:49,390
- Okay, I'm gonna call it.

985
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,426
- I think he's dead.

986
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:52,860
- I don't know. - All right, I'm calling it.

987
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:53,895
What time do you have?

988
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,129
- 15:36.

989
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:59,867
- 15 hours, 36 minutes. Okay.

990
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:03,137
Let's pack him in ice.

991
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,706
Let's leave.

992
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,497
( keys jangle )

993
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:13,674
- Is he dead, Mama?

994
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,077
- I think so, sweetheart.

995
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:19,180
- Can we wish for him to come back?

996
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,249
- Yeah.

997
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:24,118
- I wish.

998
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:26,587
- I wish, too.

999
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,731
- Come on, Gert.

1000
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:39,534
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

1001
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:45,873
- Cardiac arrest was terminated at 15 hours and 36 minutes.

1002
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:49,143
He received intravenous lidocaine,

1003
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:51,512
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,

1004
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:54,582
2.7% sodium chloride solution.

1005
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,184
Catheters from the A-line

1006
01:30:56,217 --> 01:31:01,589
and the intravenous lines should be sent for culture.

1007
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:07,261
He was monitored with a EEG and EKG

1008
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,696
to be interpolated with--

1009
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,865
- They're gonna have to take him away now.

1010
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:15,803
- They're just gonna cut him all up.

1011
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:18,906
- Would you like to spend some time alone with him?

1012
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:34,722
- Hey, can we be alone here a minute, please?

1013
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,792
- Could we all step out for a minute, please?

1014
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,116
- Look at what they've done to you.

1015
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:39,053
I'm so sorry.

1016
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:48,362
You must be dead...

1017
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:53,634
'cause I don't know how to feel.

1018
01:32:56,404 --> 01:33:00,641
I can't feel anything anymore.

1019
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:05,613
You're going someplace else now.

1020
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:16,390
I'll believe in you all my life.

1021
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,626
Every day.

1022
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:26,934
E.T.,

1023
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,704
I love you.

1024
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:03,070
Oh, my God.

1025
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:11,712
- E.T. phone home.

1026
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,481
- ( laughs )

1027
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:15,349
- Home, home, home.

1028
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:17,051
Phone home.

1029
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:19,353
- Does this mean they're coming?

1030
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:21,322
- Yes.

1031
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:23,324
- Aah!

1032
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,427
- E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

1033
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,995
E.T. phone home.

1034
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,730
- Stay. Shut up.

1035
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:32,133
- Home. Phone home.

1036
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,267
- Quiet!

1037
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,235
- Phone home. Phone home.

1038
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:36,737
- Would you shut up.

1039
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:39,073
- Phone home. E.T. phone home.

1040
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,709
E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

1041
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:48,416
Elliott! Elliott!

1042
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,718
Elliott! Elliott!

1043
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,522
Elliott!

1044
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:58,959
- ( crying loudly )

1045
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:05,232
- Elliott, come with me.

1046
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:06,367
- No!

1047
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,469
- Elliott, why don't you come with me?

1048
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:11,172
- No, no.

1049
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,074
No! - It's all right.

1050
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,242
- No!

1051
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,745
( crying ) - It's all right.

1052
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,750
- Would you like the flowers? - (crying )

1053
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:28,222
- He's alive! He's alive!

1054
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:29,356
- All right!

1055
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,238
- Are they gone, Mama? - Who's gone, honey?

1056
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:45,940
- He'll be the same, honestly, eight days to two weeks.

1057
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:48,342
- The boys. - What boys?

1058
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:52,813
- I'm supposed to give you this note when they're gone.

1059
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:56,050
- Give it to me now, Gertie.

1060
01:36:03,457 --> 01:36:05,926
( sighs ) Oh, my God.

1061
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:15,836
- Give me a hand with this.

1062
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,545
- ( gasps )

1063
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:26,847
- Where's your mask? - It's back here.

1064
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:28,849
- Well, get it on. - I'm trying.

1065
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:37,558
( knock knock knock ) - Hey, who are you?

1066
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:39,560
- I'm driving.

1067
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:42,263
- Open the door, son.

1068
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:45,166
- There's a guy out here. What do I do?

1069
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,067
- Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go.

1070
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,471
Well, let's get out of here, Michael.

1071
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:53,974
- I've never driven forward before.

1072
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,050
Get the bikes.

1073
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,219
Meet us at the playground at the top of the hill.

1074
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,220
- Let's do it!

1075
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:23,037
- Here, take my hand.

1076
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:27,641
- We're all gonna die,

1077
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,910
and they're never gonna give me my license.

1078
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,481
- Where's the playground?

1079
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,550
- It's near the preschool.

1080
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:37,651
- Where's that?

1081
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,386
- I don't know streets.

1082
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,355
Mom always drives me.

1083
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:43,324
- Son of a bitch.

1084
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:10,551
- Where are you going?

1085
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:12,953
- To the spaceship. - Spaceship?

1086
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:16,457
- To the spaceship to the moon.

1087
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,959
- Quiet.

1088
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:21,195
- Oh, my God.

1089
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:34,368
- Okay, he's a man from outer space,

1090
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:37,071
and we're taking him to his spaceship.

1091
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:39,740
- Well, can't he just beam up?

1092
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:41,508
- This is reality, Greg.

1093
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,646
- Keep her back. - No!

1094
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:46,747
- Hold her back.

1095
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:49,583
- No guns. They're children.

1096
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:52,553
No, no, no.

1097
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:54,088
- Where are they?

1098
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:55,522
- There's nobody here.

1099
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:03,564
- ( grunts )

1100
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:05,065
- Where we going?

1101
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:06,567
- To the forest.

1102
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,403
