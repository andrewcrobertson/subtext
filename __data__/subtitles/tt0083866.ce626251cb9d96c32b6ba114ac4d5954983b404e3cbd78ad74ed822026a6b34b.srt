1
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,889
I think I see him!

2
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,152
This way!

3
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,739
- Five.
- Oh, great.

4
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,240
So you got an arrow
right in your chest.

5
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,776
- And you're out 10 melee rounds.
- Oh, no.

6
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,285
Don't worry about it,
Mike. I got resurrection.

7
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,831
I'm already one of the undead.
I can still throw death spells.

8
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,208
I'm just trying to help you out,
man. Don't be so cranky.

9
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,460
How about throwing a
spell over the pizza man?

10
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,838
Where's our pizza, man?

11
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,215
Well, I'm ready now to play.

12
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,342
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

13
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,762
We're in the middle, Elliott. You can't
just join any universe in the middle.

14
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,785
I got him! I got him!

15
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,641
What am I asking for?

16
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,438
- Yeah.
- Mike?

17
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,882
I know. It's not for us,
it's for his mother.

18
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,501
Mike?

19
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,279
- Papa-oom-mow-mow.
- You have to ask Steve. He's game master.

20
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,114
He has absolute power.

21
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,594
- Steve?
- Steve, can I play now?

22
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,286
Go wait for the pizza first.

23
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,038
- Then I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

24
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,609
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

25
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,003
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

26
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,447
Everything but the little fishies.

27
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,775
Harvey?

28
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,419
Harvey, is that you, boy?

29
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,676
Over here, you guys.

30
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,371
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

31
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,631
Harvey?

32
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,274
All's you can get is
those 40-year-olds.

33
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,942
How do you win this game anyway?

34
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,903
There's no winning. It's like
life. You don't win at life.

35
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,988
Money helps.

36
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,366
- Mom! Mom! There's something out...
- Where's the pizza?

37
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,870
Mom! Mom! There's something
out there! It's in the tool shed.

38
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,247
It threw the ball at me.

39
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,020
Quiet!

40
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,985
Nobody go out there.

41
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,382
Stop. Now, you guys
stay right here.

42
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,260
You stay here, Mom.
We'll check it out.

43
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,829
- And put those knives back!
- Come on, Mom!

44
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,249
It's okay, Elliott.

45
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,336
Let's go get the flashlight.

46
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,460
Hold it. Wait a minute.

47
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,609
Creeps. Creepy.

48
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,903
- What exactly did you see?
- It's dark out here.

49
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,598
In there.

50
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,809
It's scary.

51
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,621
Psst.

52
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,289
There's nothing in here.

53
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,082
The gate's open.

54
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,060
Look at these.

55
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,467
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

56
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,969
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

57
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,471
Get out. Hurry up.

58
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,431
Quick. Hurry up. Come on.

59
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,705
Tyler, give me that knife.

60
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,729
Oh, great. Nice one, Elliott.

61
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,147
It was an accident.

62
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,817
A pizza? Who said you
guys could order a pizza?

63
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,795
Him.

64
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,822
- In the house.
- You geek, man.

65
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,951
- But Mom, it was real. I swear.
- Douche bag.

66
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,600
No douche-bag
talk in my house.

67
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,667
Elliott, you're crazy.

68
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,298
Hello.

69
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,020
Hello?

70
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,716
What are you going
as for Halloween?

71
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm not going to stupid Halloween.

72
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,595
Why don't you go as a goblin?

73
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,888
Shut up.

74
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,015
It's not that we don't
believe you, honey.

75
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,710
Well, it was real. I swear.

76
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,797
What are you going as, Gert?

77
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,675
I'm going as a cowgirl.

78
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,090
So what else is new?

79
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,572
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

80
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,074
Maybe a...

81
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,158
A...

82
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,744
You know how they say there
are alligators in the sewers?

83
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,955
Alligators in the sewers.

84
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,250
All we're trying to say is, maybe
you just probably imagined it.

85
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,126
I couldn't have imagined it.

86
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,212
Maybe it was a pervert or a
deformed kid or something.

87
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,565
A deformed kid.

88
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,883
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

89
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,177
It was nothing like that,
penis breath!

90
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,304
Elliott!

91
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,077
Sit down.

92
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,457
Dad would believe me.

93
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,212
Maybe you ought to call your
father and tell him about it.

94
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,011
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

95
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,361
Where's Mexico?

96
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,616
Excuse me.

97
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,207
I'm going to kill you.

98
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,352
If you ever see it
again, whatever it is,

99
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,187
don't touch it. Just call me.

100
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,106
And we'll have somebody
come and take it away.

101
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,567
Like the dogcatcher?

102
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:35,639
They'll give it a lobotomy or do
experiments on it or something.

103
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,908
It's your turn to do
the dishes, fellas.

104
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,494
- I set and cleared.
- I set and cleared.

105
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,955
- I did breakfast.
- I did breakfast.

106
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,752
What's the matter, Mom?

107
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,532
He hates Mexico.

108
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,865
Damn it! Why don't you grow up? Think
how other people feel for a change.

109
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,461
Mom.

110
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,797
Mom. Mom!

111
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,524
Michael.

112
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,869
Michael. Mom.

113
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,873
Wow.

114
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,392
Okay, you're hot.

115
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,482
I'll be back.

116
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,673
Mary, can I back the car out?

117
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,901
Not one foot past the driveway.

118
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,721
You were outside last night waiting for
that thing to come back, weren't you?

119
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,717
Are you going to
live if I go to work?

120
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,690
Okay. No TV.

121
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,217
Come on.

122
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,386
Mommy, look what Michael did.

123
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,595
This and that...

124
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,325
I see them, Gert. And when
I catch him, I'll catch him.

125
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,089
Come on. Don't be afraid.

126
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,001
It's all right. Come on.

127
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,426
Come on.

128
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,846
Come on.

129
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,522
Come on.

130
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,857
Come on.

131
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,780
Do you talk?

132
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,369
You know, talk?

133
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,619
Me, human.

134
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,516
Boy.

135
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,209
Elliott.

136
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,479
Elliott.

137
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,633
Elliott.

138
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,538
Coke. See, we drink it.

139
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,814
It's a drink. You know, food?

140
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,629
These are toys.
These are little men.

141
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,006
This is Greedo.

142
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,176
And then, this is Hammerhead.

143
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,638
You see, this is Walrus Man.

144
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,867
And then this is Snaggletooth.

145
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,588
And this is Lando Calrissian. See?

146
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,148
And this is Boba Fett.

147
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,423
Look. They can even
have wars. Look at this.

148
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,346
And look. Fish.

149
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:09,894
The fish eat the fish food
and the shark eats the fish,

150
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,105
but nobody eats a shark.

151
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,339
See, this is Pez. Candy.

152
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,216
You see, you eat it.

153
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,427
You put the candy in here

154
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,431
and then when you lift up the head, the
candy comes out and you can eat it.

155
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,249
You want some?

156
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,688
This is a peanut.

157
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,022
You eat it.

158
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:39,298
But you can't eat this one
because this is fake.

159
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,113
This is money. You see?

160
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,782
We put the money in the peanut.

161
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,867
You see? Bank.

162
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,640
You see? And then,

163
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,081
this is a car.

164
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,650
This is what we get around in.

165
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,319
See? A car.

166
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,326
Hey! Hey! Wait a second.

167
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,530
No. You don't eat them.

168
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,702
Are you hungry?

169
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,793
I'm hungry.

170
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,335
Stay.

171
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,611
Stay. I'll be right here.

172
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,175
Okay? I'll be right here.

173
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,511
Harv!

174
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,138
He won't bite.

175
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,541
Come on, Harvey.

176
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,533
He'll like this.

177
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,288
This.

178
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,496
This.

179
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,742
Are you okay?

180
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,031
Too much excitement, huh?

181
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,120
Want a Coke?

182
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:42,775
<i>There are so many people to see</i>

183
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:47,738
<i>So many people you can check up
on and add to your collection</i>

184
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,157
<i>But they keep you hanging on</i>

185
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,160
Nothing but health shit.

186
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:58,267
<i>Add to your collection
But they keep you hanging on</i>

187
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,755
Mike, Mike, come in.

188
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,757
- How you feeling, faker?
- I'm feeling fine.

189
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,342
Look, I got something
really important...

190
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,679
Tyler said he got 69,000
on <i>Asteroids</i> yesterday.

191
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,033
- But he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

192
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,767
You're so lame, Elliott.

193
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,086
Come on, Michael. He came back.

194
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,566
He came back?

195
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,942
Oh, my God!

196
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,261
One thing.

197
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,591
I have absolute power.
Say it. Say it!

198
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,993
What have you got?
Is it the coyote?

199
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,688
No. Look...

200
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,125
Okay. Now, swear it.

201
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,669
The most excellent
promise you can make.

202
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,381
Swear as my only
brother on our lives.

203
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,341
Okay, don't get so heavy. I swear.

204
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,511
Okay. Stand over there.

205
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,326
And uh, you'd better take off...

206
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:55,836
- ...your shoulder pads.
- What?

207
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:59,481
You might scare him.
And close your eyes.

208
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,520
Don't push it, Elliott.

209
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,523
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

210
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,172
Okay. They're closed.

211
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,903
Mom is going to kill you.

212
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:15,075
Okay. Swear it one more time.

213
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,903
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power.

214
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,681
Yes.

215
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,112
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

216
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,544
Stop! Stop!

217
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,395
Stop!

218
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,903
Kids, I'm home!

219
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,071
Guys?

220
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,366
- In the closet, fast.
- Anybody up there, kids?

221
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,954
Anybody home?

222
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,623
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

223
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,101
What happened in here?

224
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,442
Oh, you mean my room.

225
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,782
This is no room.

226
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,801
This is an accident.

227
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,345
I was reorganizing.

228
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,930
I can see that.

229
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,307
Put those shelves back
on the wall, dear.

230
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,226
Let's get the toys off the floor.

231
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,604
Make your bed since
you are not using it.

232
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,982
Well, you're feeling better, I see.

233
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,652
Will you guys keep an eye on Gertie
for me while I take a shower?

234
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,320
Absolutely.

235
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,632
Bye, Mom.

236
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,568
Elliott...

237
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,530
I'm keeping him.

238
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,943
What is it?

239
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,075
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

240
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,286
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

241
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,951
We're not going to hurt you.

242
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,937
Is he a boy or a girl?

243
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,915
He's a boy.

244
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,612
Was he wearing any clothes?

245
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,465
No.

246
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:21,349
But, look, you can't tell.
Not even Mom.

247
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,703
Why not?

248
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,274
Because grownups can't see him.

249
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,543
Only little kids can see him.

250
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,170
Give me a break.

251
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,007
Well, do you know
what's going to happen

252
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,985
if you do tell?

253
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,305
Do it, Mike. We have to.

254
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,057
No, please!

255
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,559
No! I'll do anything, please!

256
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,562
Gertie, help me! No, please!

257
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,230
Give it!

258
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,174
- Promise?
- Yes.

259
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,927
Do you promise?

260
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,140
What are you doing, Gert?

261
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,244
I'm going to play
in Elliott's room.

262
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,479
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

263
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,148
I won't, Mary.

264
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,448
Hello?

265
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,551
Jerry! Jerry!

266
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,604
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

267
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,233
Don't be pushy, pushy.

268
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,529
A plant for you.

269
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,012
Maybe he's some animal that
wasn't supposed to live.

270
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,805
You know, like those
rabbits we saw that time.

271
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,515
- Don't be lame.
- Green, orange, red.

272
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,350
Could be a monkey
or an orangutan...

273
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,019
A bald monkey?

274
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,464
Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.

275
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,963
You could make faces.

276
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:03,071
And make them mean and happy
and make them get sharp teeth.

277
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,174
We are here.

278
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,410
- We're here.
- No, use this.

279
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,496
You could make all sorts of things.

280
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,270
Okay. We're here.

281
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,666
We are here.

282
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,985
Where are you from?

283
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,099
I don't like his feet.

284
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,393
They're only feet,
you little twerp.

285
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,338
He's trying to tell us something.

286
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,265
Earth.

287
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,140
Home.

288
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,978
Home.

289
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,939
Home.

290
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,846
What's he doing?

291
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,682
What's happening?

292
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,908
Elliott.

293
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,745
Oh, no.

294
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,405
Elliott, what is it?

295
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,974
I don't know. Something scary.

296
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,660
- Got a pulse?
- No, boss.

297
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,545
Hold it. We got it right here.

298
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,248
Follow him.

299
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,628
You think this house?

300
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,393
Did you explain school to him?

301
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,895
How do you explain school
to higher intelligence?

302
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,064
Maybe he's not that smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee

303
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,400
- who only knows how to push buttons.
- He's too smart.

304
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,069
Okay, I just hope we don't
wake up on Mars or something,

305
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,264
surrounded by millions
of little squashy guys.

306
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,247
Hi, Elliott.

307
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,666
- Hey, Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

308
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,195
- Did he come back?
- Well, did he?

309
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,590
Yeah, he came back. But he's
not a goblin. He's a spaceman.

310
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,094
As in extraterrestrial.

311
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,570
Where's he from? Uranus?

312
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,723
Get it? Your anus?

313
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,434
- He doesn't get it, Ty.
- Get it? Your anus?

314
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,602
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

315
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,271
And you're a sine supremus.

316
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,774
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

317
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,151
Shut up, Greg!

318
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,278
- Sine supremus.
- Zero charisma!

319
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,051
You wimp.

320
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,851
Let's go.

321
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,156
Come on. Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

322
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,678
Okay, boys and girls, today we will
be doing the actual frog dissection

323
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,681
for which we've been preparing.

324
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:26,833
And you will find
many similarities.

325
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:37,803
As you get into the dissection, you
will discover that the anatomy...

326
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:12,212
The scalpel is very sharp.

327
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,652
Use discretion when
you are cutting.

328
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:20,679
There will be very little blood.
There may be a few body fluids.

329
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,958
Ugh.

330
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,961
As we get started with
the dissection...

331
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,429
- Ew!
- ...remember that the...

332
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,444
things that you are writing down...

333
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,815
One thing that you should be
looking for during the dissection

334
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:40,091
is to locate the heart and
notice that it is still beating.

335
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,451
I'm going to once more
emphasize the similarities

336
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,601
of those things which
we see in the...

337
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,604
Similarities with human anatomy...

338
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,130
First of all, here's the heart...

339
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:11,794
The intestines will be going
through their peristaltic action.

340
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,022
<i>X-W-V-U.</i>

341
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,900
<i>A-F-P.</i>

342
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,946
<i>That is incorrect. The correct
spelling of nuisance is</i>

343
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:28,804
N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.

344
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,689
<i>They're pulling us up.</i>

345
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:46,803
Class, these are the cotton
balls with the chloroform.

346
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,808
And as soon as I get them all in, be
sure and put the lid on right away.

347
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,810
- Ew!
- That's it.

348
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,834
That will start them
going to sleep.

349
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,921
And they won't feel anything.
They won't be hurt.

350
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,967
It'll take a little while.

351
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,494
If you don't want to watch
them, you don't have to.

352
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,495
Say hi.

353
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,122
Can you talk?

354
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,249
Can you say hi?

355
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,088
<i>Hello.</i>

356
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,672
<i>Uncle Ralph!</i>

357
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,592
<i>It's Uncle Ralph, long
distance from California!</i>

358
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,345
<i>I'll talk fast. This call
must be expensive.</i>

359
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,681
<i>No, no, no, no. If I call anytime
on Saturday without an operator,</i>

360
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,434
<i>I can talk for five minutes
for 85 cents plus tax.</i>

361
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,062
<i>If I talk less, I pay less.</i>

362
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,855
<i>Let me talk to that little fella.</i>

363
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,066
<i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>

364
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,964
<i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>

365
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,105
Hmm.

366
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,532
Save him.

367
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,434
Run for your life! Back to the
river! Back to the forest!

368
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,937
Run! I want to save you!

369
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,540
Let's get out of here!

370
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,318
Get out!

371
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,637
I got to let him go!

372
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,768
You've got to save him!

373
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,023
Let me handle this!

374
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,735
Class. Let me handle this!
I can handle this.

375
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,588
Let me get this.

376
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,376
<i>Grandpa, what's wrong?</i>

377
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,629
<i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't
going to run tomorrow.</i>

378
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,298
<i>Oh, no. Is it anything serious?</i>

379
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,527
Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.

380
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,106
Here he is.

381
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,816
Here's who?

382
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,152
The man from the moon, but I
think you've killed him already.

383
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,427
Honey, just as soon
as I unload the stuff, okay?

384
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,014
Med-bugs.

385
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,625
I want you to meet somebody.

386
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,961
This stuff has gone up
so much in one week.

387
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,504
I want you to meet somebody.

388
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,735
Okay, honey, as soon as I finish
putting all this stuff away, all right?

389
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,279
Oh!

390
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,043
Stupid ragu. I knew it
wouldn't come out.

391
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,817
- "B."
- "B."

392
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,965
What's with this?

393
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,678
Hello.

394
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,535
Yeah, this is she.

395
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,911
"Basket."

396
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,038
"Bandit."

397
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,581
"Ball."

398
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,480
"Basket. Bandit. Ball."

399
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,544
"Bugs."

400
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,271
"Bananas?

401
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,069
Intoxicated?

402
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,097
You sure you have
the right Elliott?

403
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,371
"B. B."

404
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,286
- "Biscuits."
- B.

405
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,438
<i>But "B" is for boy...</i>

406
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,814
B.

407
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,292
<i>with a baseball and bat.</i>

408
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,262
You said "B."

409
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,013
B.

410
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,846
You said "B." Good.

411
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,519
B.

412
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,954
Good.

413
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,767
Okay, I'll be right down.
Thank you. Ooh...

414
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,253
Gertie, I have to
go pick up Elliott.

415
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,340
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

416
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,177
Of course he can talk. I'll be right
back in 10 minutes. Stay there.

417
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:06,224
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, little
Grover here will demonstrate</i>

418
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,435
<i>by chinning himself two times.</i>

419
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,978
<i>- Two times?
- Two times.</i>

420
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,231
<i>- Can I start?
- Okay. Go ahead.</i>

421
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,816
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

422
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,069
Phone.

423
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,717
Phone.

424
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,221
Phone.

425
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,934
You want to call somebody?

426
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,313
I am not paying for frogs.

427
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,399
Be good. Be good.

428
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,339
Stay here. Stay.

429
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,035
And don't tell anybody. Nobody.

430
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,037
Be good. Be good.

431
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,749
Move.

432
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,481
Oh, God!

433
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,442
- Elliott.
- What?

434
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,486
Elliott.

435
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,323
I taught him how to
talk now. He can talk now.

436
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,450
Elliott!

437
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,827
Look what he brought
up here all by himself.

438
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,870
Elliott.

439
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,329
What's he need this stuff for?

440
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,648
Elliott. Elliott.

441
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,709
E.T. Can you say that?

442
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,794
Can you say E.T.?

443
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,964
E.T.

444
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,301
E.T.  E.T.  E.T.

445
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,677
Be good.

446
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,971
"Be good." I taught him that, too.

447
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,848
You should give him his dignity.

448
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,952
This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever seen!

449
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,371
Phone.

450
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,023
Phone?

451
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,401
He said "phone"?

452
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:44,381
Can't you understand
English? He said "phone."

453
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,494
Home.

454
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,814
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

455
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,070
E.T.

456
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,903
Home, phone.

457
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,163
E.T. phone home.

458
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,189
E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

459
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,508
He wants to call somebody.

460
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:30,076
- What's all this shit?
- E.T. phone home.

461
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,475
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

462
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,810
Home.

463
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,333
E.T. phone home?

464
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:41,529
E.T. phone home.

465
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,092
And they'll come?

466
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,240
Come.

467
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,739
Home.

468
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,203
Home.

469
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,686
<i>- Come on. I promise, Mom.
- What book?</i>

470
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,230
<i>- Any one you want.</i>
- Spiderman...

471
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,440
<i>I'm fine. We'll just put
a smile on our face</i>

472
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,715
<i>and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.</i>

473
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,071
<i>We can't ask Cathy to
go trick-or-treating</i>

474
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,448
<i>in the same old sheet
she wore last year.</i>

475
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,619
<i>Now I wish I would've
listened in science.</i>

476
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,912
<i>Think, Michael.</i>

477
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,289
I guess we should just
grab anything that

478
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,791
looks like he could make
a machine out of.

479
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,127
What would make a radar?

480
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,796
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

481
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,549
You have absolute power, remember?

482
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,323
"I found him. He belongs to me."

483
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,588
You know, Elliott,

484
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:49,640
- he doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

485
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,099
What's all this "we" stuff?

486
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,127
<i>You say "we" all the time
now. Really, Elliott...</i>

487
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:57,163
<i>- ...I think he may be getting sick.
- Look, he's fine.</i>

488
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:01,189
<i>Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.</i>

489
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,144
<i>Grab that Fuzzbuster.</i>

490
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,450
Dad's shirt.

491
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,102
Remember when he used to
take us out to the ball games

492
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:24,128
and take us to the movies,
and we'd have popcorn fights?

493
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:28,299
<i>- We'll do that again, Elliott.
- Sure.</i>

494
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,329

He's putting it together now.

- I told you he was smart.
- I'm worried, Elliott.

527
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,305
He could blow up the whole house.

528
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,765
He knows what he's doing.

529
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,835
Listen to how he's breathing.

530
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,020
It's going to work.

531
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,168
What's he feeling now?

532
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,626
He's feeling everything.

533
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,884
Now, you're going as
a ghost. You promised.

534

I'm only pretending I'm
going as a cowgirl.

Okay. Now, you know the
plans by heart, don't you?

Meet you at the lookout.

01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:51,230
At the lookout. I'm not
stupid, you know.

538
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,274
Listen, buster. You
won't get four blocks

539
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,817
in this neighbourhood
dressed like that.

540
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,235
- Please.
- No, and that is final.

541
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,778
You are not going as a terrorist.

542
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,988
But all the guys are!

543
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,091
I'm not stupid, you know.

544
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,749
Ready?

545
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,647
Ready.

546
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,250
- Wait, Mom. Don't look.
- Okay.

547
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,966
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

548
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,785
Oh, that's great!

549
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,064
Stay here.

550
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,568
Oh...

551
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,426
Ouch.

552
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,637
Stop that! No! Don't!

553
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,305
Ouch. Ouch.

554
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,350
- No. It's a fake knife. It's a fake.
- Ouch. Ouch.

555
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,294
Okay.

556
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,425
All right.

557
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,588
You look great!

558
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,072
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

559
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,799
Thank you.

560
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,402
Be back one hour after
sundown. No later.

561
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,065
Ohhh!

562
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,405
Bye.

563
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,619
Gertie, come here. Come on.

564
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,475
Trick or treat?

565
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,983
Trick or treat?

566
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,864
Home. Home.

567
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:52,642
Home. Home. Home. Home. Home. Home.

568
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,934
Be back one hour after
sunset. No later.

569
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,419
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

570
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,022
You got to cover me.

571
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,552
Well, come on. Help me.

572
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,407
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

573
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,735
It's too bumpy. We'll
have to walk from here!

574
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,897
E.T.!

575
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,911
Not so high! Not so high!

576
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,274
Ha! Ha!

577
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,284
Don't crash, please.

578
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:05,420
I really can't believe
you did this.

579
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,130
Your father's going to
hear about this one.

580
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,431
Mexico.

581
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,850
E.T., it's working.

582
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,502
It's working!

583
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,275
Home.

584
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,150
You did it!

585
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,384
It's working!

586
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,487
Home.

587
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:06,201
E.T., it's working!

588
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,579
Check the door on the left.

589
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,753
We have to go now, E.T.

590
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,378
We're so late already.

591
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,949
We have to go home now, E.T.

592
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,649
You should give them some time.

593
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,271
Ouch.

594
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,179
You could be happy here.

595
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,306
I could take care of you.

596
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,559
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

597
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,208
We could grow up together, E.T.

598
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,756
Home.

599
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,548
Home.

600
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,424
Home.

601
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,215
Home.

602
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,216
E.T.?

603
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,838
E.T.?

604
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,352
How was he dressed when last seen?

605
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,855
He was dressed as a

606
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,441
hunchback.

607
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,860
Hunchback.

608
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,800
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

609
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:30,200
Any family problems
or recent arguments?

610
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,308
My husband and I just
separated recently

611
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:40,230
and it hasn't been easy
on the children, but...

612
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:43,050
My father's in Mexico.

613
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,220
But run away, I...

614
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,535
Where would he have gone?

615
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,953
Elliott.

616
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,306
Oh, Elliott!

617
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,068
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

618
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:05,235
Oh, my. You're so hot.

619
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,784
Run up and draw him
a bath. Quick, Gert.

620
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,783
Sorry I yelled at you.

621
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,517
Thanks very much
for all your trouble.

622
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,586
Is he here?

623
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,963
- You've got to find him, Mike.
- Where is he?

624
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,652
In the forest.

625
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,846
At the bald spot.

626
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,599
You've got to find him.

627
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,818
E.T.!

628
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,565
E.T.!

629
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,318
E.T.!

630
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,364
No!

631
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,189
Mom, would you come with me?

632
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,753
What is it?

633
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,838
Mary, just come with me.

634
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,798
Michael, what?

635
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:57,093
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- Michael, what are you talking about?

636
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,596
Just swear the most excellent
promise you can make.

637
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,574
Michael.

638
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,381
That's terrific.

639
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,973
Mom.

640
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,604
We're sick.

641
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,310
I think we're dying.

642
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,440
- Michael.
- Mom, it's okay.

643
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,343
Downstairs.

644
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,304
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

645
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,639
He's not gonna hurt you.

646
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,224
Michael, get her downstairs.

647
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,184
It's the man from the moon.

648
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,413
The man from the moon!

649
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,276
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

650
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,117
We can't leave him alone.

651
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,509
This is my home!

652
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:34,059
Home.

653
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,903
Home.

654
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:21,323
<i>The collagen unit, report to
the blue level immediately.</i>

655
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,708
- Does he sleep at night?
- I don't know. I don't know.

656
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,936
What's the matter with Elliott?

657
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,629
Have you noticed any
surface sweating?

658
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,380
No.

659
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,425
- Has it lost any hair?
- He never had any hair.

660
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,343
- Are the children all right?
- Yes.

661
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,805
Did it ever build anything
or write anything down?

662
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,973
Uh... No.

663
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:16,249
Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

664
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:20,044
He's smart. He communicates
through Elliott.

665
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,567
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

666
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,889
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

667
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,369
We've identified his primary carrier
protein by electrophoresis.

668
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,620
It's definitely not albumin.

669
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,915
Testing shows no deficit.
Some F&F. HTS test...

670
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,001
EEG analysis shows
complete coherence

671
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,754
and synchronization of brainwave
activity between both subjects.

672
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,088
Skin biopsy reveals
9 millimetres of...

673
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,381
<i>Read isotonic.</i>

674
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,092
<i>Nitrates. 255 million equivalent.</i>

675
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,595
Better do IV and oral contrast.

676
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,765
If there's no response, let's
move to hypertonic saline.

677
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,183
We have meta-starch available.

678
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,642
Cut five per kilo.

679
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,810
CVP line could help.

680
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,789
I think you get more
information with this one gain.

681
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:07,005
You have no right to do this.
You're scaring him.

682
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,113
You're scaring him!

683
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,323
Respiratory rate, 12.

684
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,825
Good air entry but decreased
tidal volume on the boy.

685
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:16,662
Put him on O2 five litres by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

686
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,790
Temperature's dropped from
20 to 17 degrees centigrade.

687
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,416
Get a hypothermia blanket...

688
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,065
Please leave him alone.

689
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,714
Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

690
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,342
Get a Doppler-scope in here and
set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

691
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,136
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

692
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,806
He's not refusing at all.
He needs inotropic support.

693
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,877
PH is down to 7.03. He's
got metabolic acidosis.

694
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,312
It could be sepsis.

695
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,106
We've drawn two sets
of blood cultures.

696
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:46,927
He needs broad-spectrum coverage.
How about amp, gen, flagyl?

697
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:56,095
Elliott.

698
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,606
I've been to the forest.

699
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,484
He shouldn't talk now.

700
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:06,275
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

701
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,903
Elliott, that machine,
what does it do?

702
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,073
The communicator?

703
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,102
Is it still working?

704
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,455
It's doing something.

705
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,215
What?

706
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,215
I really shouldn't tell.

707
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:34,637
He came to me.

708
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,933
Elliott, he came to me, too.

709
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:43,642
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

710
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,269
I don't want him to die.

711
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,736
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

712
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:53,493
He needs to go home.

713
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,323
He's calling his people

714
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,576
and I don't know where they are.

715
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,917
He needs to go home.

716
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:10,044
Elliott, I don't think that he
was left here intentionally.

717
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:16,058
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

718
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,677
It's a miracle.

719
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:23,189
And you did the best
that anybody could do.

720
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,736
I'm glad he met you first.

721
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,290
- He's got DNA.
- Incredible.

722
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,016
- He's got DNA.
- What?

723
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,435
He doesn't have four nucleotides
like we do. He has six.

724
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,146
I've got de-synchronization of
the two brainwave activities.

725
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,964
What are they?

726
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,567
E.T.!

727
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:55,172
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
His blood pressure's coming back up.

728
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,346
E.T.

729
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,264
Elliott.

730
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,371
- He's speaking.
- He's talking.

731
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:07,476
E.T., stay with me.

732
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,419
Please.

733
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,296
Stay.

734
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,149
Together.

735
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,740
I'll be right here.

736
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,412
I'll be right here.

737
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,327
Stay.

738
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:29,502
Elliott.

739
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,250
Stay.

740
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:36,130
Stay.

741
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,759
Stay.

742
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,703
Stay.

743
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:47,164
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow and widening.

744
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:49,500
How's the boy?

745
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,775
He's converting back to
normal sinus rhythm.

746
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,337
They're separating.

747
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,716
- Yes, definitely separating.
- Boy and creature are separating.

748
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,623
- What does that mean?
- The boy's coming back.

749
01:24:59,624 --> 01:25:00,678
We're losing E.T.

750
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:04,078
E.T., answer me, please.

751
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,914
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Please.

752
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,878
Just relax.

753
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,004
No!

754
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,839
E.T., don't go!

755
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,193
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

756
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,846
We can't get a pulse or blood
pressure on the creature.

757
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,324
It doesn't look like
he's breathing.

758
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:35,189
Leave him alone!
You're killing him!

759
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,857
Leave him alone!

760
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,859
Let's move it!

761
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,736
Get the boy out of
here. Get him away.

762
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:45,137
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

763
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,204
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

764
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,183
You're killing him! He came to me!

765
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,710
Any pulses? Any pulses?

766
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,984
- Okay, let's go.
- He came to me!

767
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,453
Minimal breath sounds.

768
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,536
Calm down. Calm down. Calm...

769
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:14,625
Let's try some bretylium. Can
we have some bretylium, please?

770
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:16,814
Getting a pulse?

771
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:19,588
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

772
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,627
Thank you.

773
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:22,862
All IV push.

774
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,715
He's not ventilating.

775
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,324
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

776
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,451
How about some more drugs?

777
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:29,577
Quiet.

778
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,851
Defibrillate him.

779
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:37,835
- Everybody, stand clear.
- Clear.

780
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,211
We're losing him.

781
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,029
One more time.

782
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,425
Quiet.

783
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,926
- It's still v-fib.
- Okay, let's go.

784
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,949
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

785
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,790
Quiet.

786
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,875
Elliott?

787
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,795
Mom.

788
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,035
Try calcium.

789
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,037
He needs some calcium in his body.

790
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,265
Let's continue CPR, please.

791
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:32,831
Would you people stand back?

792
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,956
Something's happening.

793
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,566
- Ooh, they're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

794
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,735
Something is definitely happening.

795
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,071
- Anybody have any ideas?
- EKG's flat.

796
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:50,221
- EKG's flat.
- Okay, I'm going to call it.

797
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,410
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

798
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,579
All right. I'm calling it.
What time do you have?

799
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,914
1536.

800
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,768
15 hours, 36 minutes.

801
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,861
Okay.

802
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,363
Let's pack him in ice.

803
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,862
Let's leave.

804
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,888
Is he dead, Mama?

805
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,766
I think so, sweetheart.

806
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,606
Can we wish for him to come back?

807
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,626
Yeah.

808
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:25,649
I wish.

809
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,106
I wish, too.

810
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:41,123
Come on, Gert. We'll wait for
Elliott in the front room.

811
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:47,650
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

812
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:53,364
He received intravenous lidocaine,
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,

813
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:57,868
2.7% sodium-chloride solution,
catheters from the "A" line.

814
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:02,331
And the intravenous line
should be sent for culture.

815
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:08,379
He was monitored with
an EEG and an EKG.

816
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,297
He was defibrillated...

817
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,633
They're going to have
to take him away now.

818
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,612
They're just gonna cut him all up.

819
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:21,250
Would you like to spend
some time alone with him?

820
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,510
Could we all step out
for a minute, please?

821
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,321
Look at what they've done to you.

822
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,658
I'm so sorry.

823
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,504
You must be dead

824
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:54,920
because I don't know how to feel.

825
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,842
I can't feel anything anymore.

826
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,431
You've gone someplace else now.

827
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:17,112
I'll believe in you all my life.

828
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,365
Every day.

829
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,499
E.T.,

830
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,209
I love you.

831
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:04,447
Oh, my God.

832
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:13,063
E.T. phone home.

833
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:16,733
Home. Phone home.

834
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:18,610
Phone home.

835
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,696
Does this mean they're coming?

836
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,719
Yes.

837
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,911
E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

838
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:29,371
Stay.

839
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,248
Shut up.

840
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,541
Phone.

841
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:33,917
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

842
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,752
Phone! Phone! Phone!

843
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,838
Would you shut up?

844
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,299
Phone home. E.T. phone home.

845
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,260
E.T. phone home. E.T. phone home.

846
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,887
E.T. phone home.

847
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:46,263
Phone home.

848
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,557
Phone home. Elliott.

849
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:51,957
Elliott. Elliott. Elliott.

850
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,590
Elliott?

851
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,726
- Elliott?
- No.

852
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:12,314
- Elliott, why don't you come with me?
- No. No.

853
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,564
- It's all right.
- No, no.

854
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,631
It'll be all right.

855
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:23,451
Would you like the flowers?

856
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:30,140
He's alive! He's alive!

857
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,281
Are they gone, Mama?

858
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,575
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

859
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,348
What boys?

860
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:54,270
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

861
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,985
Give it to me now, Gertie.

862
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:07,286
Oh, my God.

863
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,164
Give me a hand with this.

864
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,864
- Where's your mask?
- It's back here.

865
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,388
- Well, get it on!
- I'm trying!

866
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,189
Hey, who are you?

867
01:36:39,294 --> 01:36:41,521
I'm driving.

868
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,089
Open the door, son.

869
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:46,216
There's a guy out here.
What do I do?

870
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,990
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

871
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,388
Well, let's get out
of here, Michael!

872
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:54,808
I've never driven forward before!

873
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:06,069
Get the bikes. Meet us at the
playground at the top of the hill.

874
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,922
Let's do it!

875
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:12,844
Come on, Michael! Go, go, go!

876
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:31,261
We're all gonna die, and they're
never gonna give me my license.

877
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:37,809
- Where's the playground?
- It's near the preschool!

878
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,420
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets.

879
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:42,761
Mom always drives me.

880
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,900
Son of a bitch.

881
01:38:10,343 --> 01:38:13,637
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

882
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,682
- Spaceship?
- To the spaceship to the moon.

883
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,751
Quiet!

884
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,667
Oh, my God.

885
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:25,340
Stop the van!

886
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:30,884
Don't pull them off!

887
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,940
That did it!

888
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,664
Okay. He's a man from outer space
and we're taking him to his spaceship.

889
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,141
Well, can't he just beam up?

890
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,415
This is reality, Greg.

891
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,897
- Keep her back!
- No!

892
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:50,817
- Hold her back!
- No guns! They're children!

893
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,653
No! No! No!

894
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,405
- Where are they?
- No!

895
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,724
There's nobody here.

896
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,249
Where are we going?

897
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,168
To the forest!

898
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,819
Follow me!

899
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:47,224
We got them, at the
bottom of the hill.

900
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,516
This is Unit 302.

901
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:08,462
We've cut the kids off at the bottom
of the hill. Send backup units.

902
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:34,337
Let's split up.

903
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,939
Okay!

904
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,957
Hang on!

905
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:09,147
We made it! Oh, shit!

906
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:37,342
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

907
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:51,060
Tell me when it's over!

908
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,735
Ah.

909
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,343
Home.

910
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,412
Stop the car, Mama!

911
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:57,937
They're over there!
They're over there!

912
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:16,794
I just wanted to say goodbye.

913
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:20,338
He doesn't know goodbye.

914
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,839
Be good.

915
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,595
Yes.

916
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,437
Ah.

917
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:58,581
Thank you.

918
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,667
You're welcome.

919
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:29,407
Come.

920
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:35,492
Stay.

921
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:47,550
Ouch.

922
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,592
Ouch.

923
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:12,044
I'll be right here.

924
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:23,104
Bye.
