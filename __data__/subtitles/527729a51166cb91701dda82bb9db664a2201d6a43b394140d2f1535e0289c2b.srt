1
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,195
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

2
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,094
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

3
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:25,327
<i>Day shift starting
in T-minus 15 minutes.</i>

4
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:28,960
<i>Farmers to report
to mess hall immediately.</i>

5
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,661
<i>If you are experiencing
any symptoms,</i>

6
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,294
<i>such as fever, cough,</i>

7
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:34,361
<i>vomiting,
or difficulty breathing,</i>

8
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:37,049
<i>proceed to the medical bay
for examination.</i>

9
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:40,494
<i>The safety and well-being
of our colony</i>

10
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,385
<i>is Weyland-Yutani's
top priority.</i>

11
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,095
<i>Attention all workers...</i>

12
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,461
<i>Did you hear about
the claustrophobic astronaut?</i>

13
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:50,594
<i>He needed space.</i>

14
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,494
I'm begging you,
you got to stop.

15
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,494
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

16
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,060
Huge waist.

17
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,152
See that cornbread.

18
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,494
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm on this seafood diet.

19
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:06,418
I see food, I eat it.

20
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,361
That's so bad.

21
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,027
You always laughed at that one.

22
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,452
Yeah, when I was 12.

23
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,718
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

24
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,418
We owe him three months today.

25
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,186
He'll call again.

26
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,483
Well, maybe we won't be here
when he does.

27
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:38,385
Andy. Stay close to me.

28
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,428
<i>Wake up. Wake up now.</i>

29
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,061
<i>We're all Weyland-Yutani slaves.</i>

30
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:49,461
<i>The company pays us
with food and shelter</i>

31
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:52,594
<i>and takes our lives in exchange.</i>

32
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:54,718
<i>Don't believe their lies.</i>

33
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,594
<i>They own you!</i>

34
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,361
Andy, Andy. Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,685
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

36
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,661
- What did I do?
- It's a scam.

37
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,461
The ball is never under
the cup that you pick.

38
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:07,594
It's a trick.

39
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:10,261
But how am I
gonna get the money?

40
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,227
Money for what?

41
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:15,361
To pay for the horse
when we get to Yvaga.

42
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,294
You're gonna get a horse?

43
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,951
I wanna call it Raindy.

44
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:22,585
Do you get it?

45
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:25,095
- Raindy.
- No, I like it.

46
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,685
Yeah, it's good.

47
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,095
Okay, so you just
wait over there.

48
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,318
Okay, I might be a minute.

49
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,494
Stay out of trouble, all right?

50
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:38,461
<i>All employees will be seen.</i>

51
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:39,628
Good luck.

52
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:42,227
<i>Line up in an orderly fashion.</i>

53
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,594
<i>Next.</i>

54
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,561
<i>Full name
and occupation, please.</i>

55
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:49,095
<i>Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am.
Farming.</i>

56
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,327
It's about my travel papers.

57
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,052
<i>I met my quota, and I should
be free to go now.</i>

58
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,494
Right?

59
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,995
Go where?

60
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,628
<i>Yvaga.</i>

61
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:02,961
<i>It's an independent system,
but it's fully terraformed.</i>

62
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,028
<i>You can actually see
the sun out there.</i>

63
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,385
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

64
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,995
<i>Uh, they died three cycles ago.</i>

65
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,528
Lung disease, from the mines.

66
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:16,294
<i>It's just me and my brother now.</i>

67
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:17,494
<i>They sell us hope</i>

68
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:19,494
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

69
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:25,285
<i>They sell us hope to keep
us slaves. Wake up now.</i>

70
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,195
I'm sorry,
but you're not eligible

71
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,494
for contract release yet.

72
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,594
Due to a shortage of workers,

73
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,227
you're being
transferred to the mines.

74
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:44,162
<i>Wait, what?</i>

75
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,327
<i>No, no, no,
I reached the required hours.</i>

76
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:47,494
You have to let me go.

77
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:50,661
Unfortunately, quotas have
been raised to 24,000 hours,

78
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,327
so you'll be released
from contract

79
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,494
in another five to six years.

80
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,728
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful

81
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,361
for your ongoing service.

82
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,594
- Rain!
- Hey!

83
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:00,995
Hey, stop!

84
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,085
Get off him! You bastards!

85
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,661
I got you, I got you.

86
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:08,119
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

87
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:11,985
Okay.

88
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,528
You're okay.

89
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:17,261
I'm resetting you.

90
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,318
I got you.

91
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,227
It's okay.

92
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:23,618
I shouldn't have left you alone.

93
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,594
<i>They sell us hope</i>

94
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,728
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

95
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,019
<i>Wake up now. They own you.</i>

96
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,394
<i>Hi, Rain.</i>

97
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,061
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I know
I've been calling you all day,</i>

98
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,594
<i>but, look, something's come up,</i>

99
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,261
<i>and I think you should
know about it.</i>

100
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,952
<i>So, come by the trailers
and bring Andy.</i>

101
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,186
Hey.

102
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,361
Oh, for...

103
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,327
<i>Game over, man.</i>

104
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,261
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

105
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:26,985
I told you she'd show up.

106
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:28,952
You owe me five bucks.

107
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:31,218
<i>Andy!</i>

108
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,261
Why'd the blind miner
fall down the well?

109
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,585
Why?

110
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,764
'Cause he couldn't see
that well.

111
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,961
Please don't encourage him.

112
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,952
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

113
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,294
- Kay.
- Rain.

114
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,461
- Hi.
- Hi!

115
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,585
Hi.

116
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:58,428
I missed you.

117
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,351
And I know my brother
missed you, too.

118
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,019
I'm really glad you came.

119
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,494
I heard about your dad.

120
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:11,552
I'm really sorry.

121
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,361
Well, between the hailstorms

122
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:15,661
and the new diseases
every cycle...

123
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,461
Yeah, everybody's dying, right?

124
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,218
So, should we show her?

125
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:21,294
Show me what?

126
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:24,327
Okay, so, last night,

127
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,995
we're loading up
the last Tesotek,

128
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,461
we're about 200 miles
above the ground,

129
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,616
and then all of a sudden...

130
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,995
The hauler picks up this beacon.

131
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,128
So Navarro tracks it,
and it turns out

132
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,428
there's this big Wey-Yu ship

133
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,095
drifting right above our heads.

134
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,227
Drifting?

135
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,061
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

136
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:42,162
Some old relic. It's probably
damaged or obsolete.

137
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:43,461
Like that guy over there.

138
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,518
Bjorn.

139
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,227
Okay, just tell her.

140
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,028
Why are we all
sitting around here

141
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:51,561
waiting for travel permits
that the company

142
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,661
are never gonna give to us?

143
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:54,961
'Cause that hauler
has enough power in it

144
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:55,961
to get us to Yvaga.

145
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:59,061
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

146
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,261
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

147
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,594
Decommissioned ships still carry

148
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:04,061
tons of functional equipment.

149
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,494
And the hyperlink shows

150
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,385
that ship
still has a few pods left.

151
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:14,561
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

152
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,162
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

153
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,483
Before someone else does.

154
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:21,561
You guys are insane.

155
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:22,995
- Well, of course we are.
- No. No, we're not.

156
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,294
- This is...
- That's what I said.

157
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:25,518
Are you gonna help us?

158
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,685
Sorry, what do you need me for?

159
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,294
Andy.

160
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,162
- We need to use Andy.
- Andy?

161
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:36,361
Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:39,095
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

163
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,494
He can access
a terminal on the ship

164
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,195
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

165
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:43,528
It's the only way to get in.

166
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,729
Okay, but what if we get caught?

167
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,428
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

168
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,195
Right, Rain's not comin'.

169
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:53,227
Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

170
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:56,327
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

171
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,494
He's not your
brother though, is he?

172
00:12:57,518 --> 00:12:59,729
- Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
- It's true, though, isn't it?

173
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,261
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

174
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:02,961
that your dad
found in the trash.

175
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,920
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

176
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,528
Let's go.

177
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,494
- Rain?
- What?

178
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,594
- I didn't say anything.
- Rain, wait.

179
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,695
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

180
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,028
can be a dick sometimes,
all right?

181
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,618
But he is right about something.

182
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:16,662
You need to wake up.

183
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:17,729
Because this company,

184
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:18,829
they're not gonna
give us anything.

185
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:21,216
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

186
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,095
Rain, I just...

187
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,952
I don't want to end up
like our parents.

188
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,719
Do you?

189
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:40,294
Is it as easy as you're making
it sound, this plan of yours?

190
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:42,561
You won't even have to get out
of the <i>Corbelan.</i>

191
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,385
That much
I can promise you, okay?

192
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,052
Come on. What do you say?

193
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,952
Bjorn, hurry up, let's go.

194
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,985
All right, I'm starting
her up. Batteries on.

195
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,350
Lovely.

196
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:29,452
Could I get hydro, please?

197
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,586
Comm panel.

198
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:34,695
Ground spoilers.

199
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,019
They are armed.

200
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:38,162
First time in space, huh?

201
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,218
Yeah.

202
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:42,729
You too? Boop!

203
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,995
- Fuel pump.
- On.

204
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,061
Two space virgins
coming through.

205
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,528
Right, take a good look
outside the window

206
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,653
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

207
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,261
You good?

208
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:06,318
I'm good.

209
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,484
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

210
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,227
Are you sure
this is a good idea now?

211
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,351
Sure, Dad.

212
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,119
Here comes the crush.

213
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:57,553
That's how it's done, bitch.

214
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:55,019
Is that...

215
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,729
Yeah.

216
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,519
That is our sun.

217
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,462
They say Yvaga has
the most incredible sunsets.

218
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,052
I've seen them.

219
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:20,995
In my dreams.

220
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,052
I can't wait
to see them with you.

221
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,419
Yeah.

222
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,429
You know, I heard that
cryo-sleep just makes years

223
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,195
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

224
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:36,285
So when we wake up
in Yvaga tomorrow,

225
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:38,952
we'll wake up with a hangover.

226
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,285
There she is.

227
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,052
That's not a ship.

228
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:55,462
No.

229
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:57,395
<i>Fuck, that's big. What is that?</i>

230
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,529
<i>Decommissioned outpost?
I don't know.</i>

231
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,195
<i>Probably got dragged
into our orbit.</i>

232
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,261
Okay, Navarro,
let's get closer, please.

233
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,351
Okay. I'm gonna match its roll.

234
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:24,419
<i>Hazard proximity alert.</i>

235
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:26,729
What's wrong?

236
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:29,285
It's just the belt's a bit
closer than I thought.

237
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,218
How long?

238
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,362
It's 36 hours, give or take.

239
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:36,362
Till what?

240
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:39,429
Before the station crashes
against the rings.

241
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,495
Sorry, what?

242
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,961
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

243
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:45,195
36 hours.

244
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:46,719
We should be in and out
in 30 minutes.

245
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,195
Yeah?

246
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:50,328
Andy.

247
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:52,028
Yeah, tops.

248
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:54,285
Are you sure you wanna do this?

249
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:58,128
I have just one directive.

250
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:00,019
To do what's best for Rain.

251
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:02,952
Your dad wrote it.

252
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:04,486
Yeah.

253
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,362
That and too many dad jokes.

254
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:08,719
I'm happy...

255
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,985
to help.

256
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,453
Be careful out there.

257
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,352
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

258
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:39,028
Put that on.

259
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,562
Now,
why I gotta put this on for?

260
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,128
So you don't
freeze your balls off.

261
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:43,262
Mate, you gotta stop obsessing

262
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:44,695
about my balls, man.
It's unhealthy.

263
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,928
Keep talking
and I'll chop 'em off.

264
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,227
Aw, you really want
'em for yourself, don't you?

265
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,529
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

266
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:50,961
Oh, shut up a minute.

267
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:52,729
Gloves, here, take these.

268
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:55,295
Hey! No. Stop touching shit.

269
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,529
- Come over here.
- Bjorn, leave him alone,

270
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,562
for fuck's sake.

271
00:19:58,586 --> 00:19:59,961
Andy, take no notice.

272
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,028
All right, okay,
won't be my fault

273
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:02,119
when he breaks somethin'.

274
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:11,061
There's a synth hatch

275
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,328
right ahead. I'm gonna dock.

276
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:13,686
<i>Copy that.
Just bring us in slow.</i>

277
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,252
Oh, fuck me, it's cold in there.

278
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,262
What's that?

279
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,462
<i>It's a temp-scanner.</i>

280
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,152
<i>It's gonna lead us to the pods.</i>

281
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,462
Okay, compression
is good enough.

282
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,562
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

283
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,995
Andy...

284
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,395
<i>you're up.</i>

285
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,719
<i>It's your time to shine.</i>

286
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,562
<i>Yes! Andy!</i>

287
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:07,686
<i>Beautiful work.</i>

288
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,252
<i>Okay.</i>

289
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,798
<i>Congrats.
You're not a virgin anymore.</i>

290
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,085
<i>All right.</i>

291
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,019
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

292
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,395
<i>Fuck.</i>

293
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>Guys, it looks like
we're in zero-g.</i>

294
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,286
<i>Yeah, I can feel it
in my stomach.</i>

295
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:10,961
Wait, what's that?

296
00:22:10,985 --> 00:22:12,228
Gravity generators.

297
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:15,196
When offline, they still purge
themselves every few minutes.

298
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:17,153
<i>Prevents the place
from blowing up.</i>

299
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,252
<i>Oh, fuck me,
there goes my stomach again.</i>

300
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:25,486
<i>Okay, straight ahead.</i>

301
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,096
<i>According to the scanner,</i>

302
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,319
<i>the pods should be in here.</i>

303
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,362
<i>Jesus.</i>

304
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:36,595
<i>Andy, you good?</i>

305
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,719
Yeah.

306
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:46,719
<i>All right, great news.
I've got eyes on the pods.</i>

307
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,453
<i>Fuck!</i>

308
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:56,719
<i>Bjorn, you okay?</i>

309
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,429
<i>Fuck!</i>

310
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,384
<i>I think I fractured my asshole.</i>

311
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,619
<i>Fuckin' hell. Don't fuck
with this gravity purge, man.</i>

312
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,495
<i>Thank God, there's still</i>

313
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,719
<i>some power left in this relic.</i>

314
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,529
<i>Okay, watch out.
Gravity's coming back.</i>

315
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:48,053
<i>Fuckin' hell.</i>

316
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,529
All right, here we go.

317
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:57,719
Let's see what we got.

318
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:00,187
Okay.

319
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,529
- Shit.
- What's the problem?

320
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,129
Pods don't have enough fuel.

321
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,429
What do you mean?

322
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,228
<i>They're loaded up
for three years in stasis.</i>

323
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:13,295
Yeah, but it takes nine years

324
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,595
to get to Yvaga, mate.

325
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,295
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm aware of that.

326
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,695
Fuckin' hell.

327
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,228
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

328
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:20,362
- I knew it.
- Just relax.

329
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,462
Maybe you guys
should just come back.

330
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,765
<i>No, no, we're not givin' up now.</i>

331
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:25,996
Yvaga's the nearest system.

332
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,129
So what are we supposed
to do now? Huh?

333
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,262
- What are we gonna do?
- Shut up.

334
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:34,228
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

335
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:36,163
We should find more fuel there.

336
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:39,395
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

337
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,462
Come on, Andy.

338
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,419
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

339
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:03,653
Hold.

340
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,719
Yeah, 400 yards away,
dead ahead.

341
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:09,495
What's with the military shit?

342
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,595
What?

343
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:11,529
All that military shit.

344
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:14,429
- Well, it's effective.
- Is it?

345
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:15,562
- And cool.
- It's not very cool.

346
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,562
You just look like a twat.

347
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:19,062
- I'm sorry.
- All right, chill.

348
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,328
<i>Let's keep it movin'.</i>

349
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,395
<i>If you do that again,
I'll fuck you up.</i>

350
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:22,462
- Bjorn, back off!
<i>- You understand?</i>

351
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,529
<i>Just as long as he stays
out of my way.</i>

352
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,163
Why is he being
such a dick to him?

353
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:29,996
Because of what happened
to his mom.

354
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,529
- What do you mean?
- Last cycle,

355
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:33,262
there was a gas leak
in the mines,

356
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:35,395
so a synthetic made the call
to seal them

357
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,295
with Bjorn's mom
still trapped inside.

358
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,562
What?

359
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,295
Synthetics can't harm humans.

360
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,352
It sacrificed three miners
to save a dozen.

361
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:46,653
That, they can do.

362
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:53,386
That's terrible.

363
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,352
I got you, I got you.

364
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:43,986
Come on, come on, come on.

365
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,219
Easy, easy.

366
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,453
Good job.

367
00:27:58,252 --> 00:27:59,286
Kay!

368
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:01,729
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,629
Hey, hey, hey.

370
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,417
I'm right here.
I'm right here. You're okay.

371
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:07,684
I'm gonna go check on the pods.

372
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,419
No, no. Don't worry.

373
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,062
I'm not sick.

374
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:31,120
What's wrong, then?

375
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,153
Nothing is.

376
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:39,053
Oh, girl.

377
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,120
Who's the father?

378
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,553
Some asshole.

379
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:50,686
Just don't tell my brother,
okay?

380
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,495
He has enough things
to worry about.

381
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,962
No. I won't say anything.

382
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,686
I'm just happy this baby
will get to see the sun.

383
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,053
I think we're almost there.

384
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,062
Okay, Navarro.

385
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:30,462
<i>Airlock 5-B, that's our way out</i>

386
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,595
<i>once we find this cryo-fuel.</i>

387
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,562
On my way.

388
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:34,163
<i>Welcome to the.</i>

389
00:29:34,187 --> 00:29:35,529
Renaissance <i>Space Station,</i>

390
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:40,062
<i>the center of Weyland-Yutani
Research and Development.</i>

391
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:43,328
<i>The station
is divided into two halves,</i>

392
00:29:43,352 --> 00:29:45,187
<i>Romulus and Remus,</i>

393
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,295
<i>each dedicated
to our quest to improve</i>

394
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,386
<i>mankind's role in outer space.</i>

395
00:29:54,153 --> 00:29:57,228
This place gives me the creeps.

396
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:00,219
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

397
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,996
He's all right now.

398
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,462
Do you get it? He's all right.

399
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,286
Can you turn
yourself off, please?

400
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:08,996
You said you were nervous

401
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,996
and I was trying
to make sure you were...

402
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,295
Jesus! You know, I can't
wait to get in them pods

403
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,153
and never see you again,
you know that?

404
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:19,096
<i>You'll see me in Yvaga.</i>

405
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,495
<i>No, you're not going to Yvaga.</i>

406
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,654
<i>Bjorn, stop!</i>

407
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:23,462
<i>I'm not?</i>

408
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,595
Well done.

409
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:26,663
Oh, she didn't tell you?

410
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:29,553
Yeah, yeah, it's a
non-Weyland-Yutani system,

411
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,986
so no fake people allowed.

412
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:36,986
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

413
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:41,328
Andy, look.

414
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:42,630
<i>Rain could end up in prison</i>

415
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:43,596
<i>if she takes you with her.</i>

416
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,163
<i>And if you guys stay in Jackson,</i>

417
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:46,495
<i>it's just a matter of time</i>

418
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,620
<i>before you get decommissioned
again by the company.</i>

419
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,328
<i>You understand?</i>

420
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:53,319
<i>I need you on the ship
to guard the pods.</i>

421
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,352
But once we get there...

422
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,096
Decommish.

423
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,250
Lights out for good.

424
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,163
You done?

425
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:03,352
<i>Just tellin' the truth.</i>

426
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,395
<i>That's okay.</i>

427
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,654
<i>If it's what's best for Rain,
it's what's best for me.</i>

428
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,352
You're a good guy, Andy.

429
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,020
We're all gonna miss you.

430
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:27,753
So he didn't know?

431
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:32,153
I just did not
have the heart to tell him.

432
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:35,319
You shouldn't feel bad.

433
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,062
Shit.

434
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:40,163
You're not gonna throw

435
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,086
your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

436
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,720
He doesn't care.
It doesn't matter to him.

437
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,086
Okay? He's not...

438
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:52,720
you know, real.

439
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,386
The signal's
coming from in here.

440
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:30,530
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

441
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:32,563
Yeah.

442
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:34,563
<i>Doesn't look
decommissioned to me.</i>

443
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,029
No, it doesn't.

444
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:38,262
But it's definitely deserted.

445
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:41,196
Hey, Andy, look at this.

446
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:43,319
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

447
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,685
if I just amp up the juices.

448
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,630
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

449
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:51,630
All right, enough.

450
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,953
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

451
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:58,129
It's a joke. I was joking.

452
00:32:58,153 --> 00:32:59,187
What the fuck?

453
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:00,587
Watch out.

454
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:12,319
<i>Shit.</i>

455
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:18,384
It's only a synthetic.

456
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:22,295
Fuck.

457
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,430
I thought it was a real person
there for a second.

458
00:33:24,454 --> 00:33:26,096
<i>What happened in there?</i>

459
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,986
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

460
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,062
The fuel must be in that room.

461
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,764
Let's grab it
and get the fuck out of here.

462
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,120
All right. Andy?

463
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:54,720
Bjorn, take the torch please.

464
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:02,029
I don't think
there's any pods in here.

465
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,396
Nah, just cooling equipment.

466
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,187
Uses the same type of fuel,
though.

467
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,454
Yes.

468
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,630
<i>Forty-five Ks.</i>

469
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:18,630
<i>It's more than enough fuel
to get us to Yvaga.</i>

470
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:21,086
Right. Bjorn, give me
a hand with this, please.

471
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,396
Bjorn, pull it out
on three, all right?

472
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,596
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

473
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,020
One, two...

474
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,228
three.

475
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:38,496
Fuck!

476
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,720
- Fuck.
- My fingers.

477
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:42,587
I can't feel my fingers.

478
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,363
<i>It really hurts.
Just froze my hands off.</i>

479
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:54,129
- What's happening?
<i>- Fuck.</i>

480
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:56,430
Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

481
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:58,020
Andy, the door.

482
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,996
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

483
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,096
What does that mean?

484
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,838
Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

485
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,596
So you're trying to tell me that

486
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,062
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

487
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,129
but can't open
a random fucking door

488
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,363
to a random room?

489
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,353
Well, obviously,
that's no random room.

490
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,520
Come on!

491
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,252
Come on!

492
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:39,445
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

493
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:44,596
If Andy can't open those doors,

494
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,420
I doubt we'll have better luck.

495
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:49,996
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic

496
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,151
and we're just trespassing.

497
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:54,020
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

498
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:55,587
Not yet.

499
00:35:58,387 --> 00:35:59,654
I think it's in here.

500
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,420
Bjorn!

501
00:36:06,252 --> 00:36:07,287
Tyler!

502
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:12,953
They're in there.

503
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:18,663
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:19,663
If this module is still working,

505
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:22,730
I can try to transfer
its credentials to Andy.

506
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:24,720
A higher clearance
should open that door.

507
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,053
Shit. It's stuck.

508
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,487
It's so hot in here, man.

509
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:32,320
Whoa.

510
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,062
Sick.

511
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,530
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

512
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,587
Yeah, okay, Mom.

513
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,530
Help me! Help!

514
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:44,663
Oh, no! What do I do?

515
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:46,287
The module. Take it out!

516
00:37:51,754 --> 00:37:53,086
You okay?

517
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:55,663
That was fucked up.

518
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,296
Here.

519
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,420
Let me see.

520
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,062
Yes, okay.

521
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:03,229
All right.

522
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:05,229
- Got it.
- Hey.

523
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:06,287
Rain.

524
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,287
This is from that synthetic.

525
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,287
Try putting it on Andy's module.

526
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:17,520
I'm so sorry.

527
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:19,953
Let's just get outta here.

528
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:22,520
Andy?

529
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,454
All right, let's see.

530
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:30,720
Okay.

531
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:36,996
Fuck.

532
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,096
Rain, did I do something
wrong? He's just frozen up.

533
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,463
He's just rebooting.

534
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,320
It's gonna take
a couple of minutes.

535
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,238
Here, let me get you
something for those fingers.

536
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,287
The fuck was that?

537
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:21,020
All right, stay there a second.

538
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:26,121
Tyler?

539
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,188
Hey, what are you guys doing?

540
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,130
Bjorn?

541
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,463
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

542
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:45,530
I'm not playing around.

543
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:46,496
There's something in the water.

544
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,996
What do you mean? What is it?

545
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,897
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

546
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:50,439
There's something
in the fuckin' water.

547
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,053
Bjorn!

548
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:00,496
Fuck!

549
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,554
What the fuck was that?

550
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,188
Andy!

551
00:40:10,387 --> 00:40:11,420
Bjorn!

552
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:19,630
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

553
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:20,752
Bjorn!

554
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:27,054
- Tyler!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

555
00:40:29,287 --> 00:40:30,596
Come on!

556
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,663
- Come on! Help me!
- No, stop. Stop. Don't...

557
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:34,430
- No! Navarro!
- Those things will get out.

558
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:36,363
If they come in here...
If they come in...

559
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:37,520
- If they come...
- No!

560
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:42,587
Fuck. Fuck.

561
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:10,687
Andy! Let's go!

562
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,097
Go! Bjorn!

563
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:15,154
Andy, the door!

564
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:17,263
- Bjorn!
- Come on, come on.

565
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:18,326
Come on, come on, come on!

566
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:22,030
Get out of there!

567
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:23,097
Come on, come on, come on!

568
00:41:23,121 --> 00:41:24,696
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Go, go, go!

569
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,154
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

570
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,730
Go! Go!

571
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:34,085
- Bjorn, come on!
- Go! Go!

572
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,654
Andy, the door!

573
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:50,696
Stay still. Stay still.

574
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,485
I know! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

575
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,097
It's choking her.

576
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,663
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

577
00:41:57,687 --> 00:41:58,726
- It's choking her!
- Shit.

578
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,030
Stop! Bjorn!

579
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:02,596
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

580
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,030
- Stop!
- What's it doin'?

581
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,263
Is it fuckin' killin' her?

582
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:07,454
I do not believe that's
what the creature is doing.

583
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:09,021
No.

584
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:10,420
Andy?

585
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:13,997
Based on the rhythmic
dilatation of those bladders,

586
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:16,363
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns,

587
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:19,530
I'd surmise it's feeding her
oxygen to keep her alive.

588
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:21,420
For what purpose, I do not know.

589
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:24,654
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

590
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:29,663
I'm an ND-255
Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

591
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:32,087
Originally built for mining
and safety tasks.

592
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,296
You guys call me Andy.

593
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,554
It's that module.

594
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,420
Yes.

595
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:42,530
That new module didn't
just upgrade my credentials.

596
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:44,263
It substantially updated my AI,

597
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:47,087
and it's mending my motor
systems as we speak.

598
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:50,229
A most overdue upgrade,
I must say.

599
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:51,329
Shit. I'mma fucking
fry this thing.

600
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:52,430
- Okay, wait.
- Don't!

601
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:54,063
- Why not?
- That amount of current

602
00:42:54,087 --> 00:42:55,430
will violently
contract its tail flexors

603
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:56,630
and will break her neck.

604
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,130
So what, you got a better idea?

605
00:42:58,154 --> 00:42:59,396
What should we
fucking do then, huh?

606
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,263
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey.

607
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,121
Andy, do you know
how to help her?

608
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,229
I'm afraid my knowledge database

609
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:06,696
has not really changed.

610
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,229
I do not know
what this creature is

611
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,687
or how to remove it safely.

612
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:14,720
But there's someone
in this room who might.

613
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,530
I need to secure Z-01 compound.

614
00:43:47,554 --> 00:43:49,530
Mission's priority. All other
priorities rescinded.

615
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:51,530
Must complete the mission.

616
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:53,030
I'm sorry...

617
00:43:53,054 --> 00:43:54,563
but your mission has failed.

618
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,654
What? No, I...

619
00:44:02,188 --> 00:44:04,287
Can you tell us
what we can do to help her?

620
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,720
You don't help her. You run.

621
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:10,563
Get out, however you got in.

622
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:12,296
No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.

623
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,463
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin'
her, okay? You understand?

624
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,229
Then have mercy
and end her life now.

625
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:20,054
If not, you all die.

626
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,663
So what the fuck is he sayin'?

627
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:25,197
What's it doing to her?

628
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,363
The parasitoid is implanting

629
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,130
the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.

630
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:29,396
I beg your pardon?

631
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,229
A seed that will amalgamate
with her DNA

632
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,563
and rapidly grow out of her.

633
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,154
What's gonna grow out of her?

634
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:49,554
XX121 Xenomorph.

635
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,530
One of our towing ships

636
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:55,197
first made contact with this
specimen two decades ago.

637
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,229
Of the seven crew members

638
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:58,596
aboard the <i>USS Nostromo,</i>
only one survived,

639
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,463
blowing the creature
out of the airlock.

640
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:04,363
We've been searching
for it ever since.

641
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:07,696
170 days ago,
our search came to an end

642
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,987
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board...

643
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:12,197
presumed dead.

644
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,396
But of course,

645
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,563
lack of oxygen and food is
of no true consequence to this

646
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:19,229
perfect organism.

647
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:21,287
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

648
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,463
Clearly.

649
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,963
It wreaked havoc
over this station,

650
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:30,563
until what was left of our
security forces shot it dead.

651
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:33,287
Only to trigger its swan song.

652
00:45:34,287 --> 00:45:35,396
Acid for blood?

653
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,296
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

654
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,164
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

655
00:45:39,188 --> 00:45:40,430
Hey, shut up!

656
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,229
Nobody cares about your
fucking ship anymore.

657
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:44,097
Okay, okay. Okay.

658
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,263
What if we use the cryo-fuel

659
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:49,030
to freeze the root of the tail?

660
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:51,954
Maybe if it's frozen,
it won't choke her.

661
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,253
That could work.

662
00:46:23,188 --> 00:46:24,520
All right, get it off!
Get it off!

663
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:48,251
It's gone. It's off
of you. It's off of you.

664
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,430
It's off. It's off. It's off.

665
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:53,197
You're okay. You're okay.

666
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,520
I wouldn't be so sure.

667
00:47:00,087 --> 00:47:01,197
What are the odds?

668
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,596
60 to 40 against your friend.

669
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,659
What are the odds on what?

670
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,420
That the creature's
finished its job already.

671
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,188
What is he talking about?

672
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:15,496
Listen to me.

673
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,229
Humans go through
too many emotional stages

674
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,363
before accepting the cold,

675
00:47:20,387 --> 00:47:22,664
yet rational - sometimes
hardest - path.

676
00:47:22,688 --> 00:47:24,597
You must help them.

677
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:25,753
You must help them.

678
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:32,054
Andy?

679
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:34,130
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry

680
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:35,597
but we can't let her back
on the ship.

681
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,530
- Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
- What're you doing?

682
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,731
- You must understand.
- You see?

683
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,731
That's what I mean
by "funny ideas"!

684
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,130
What're you talking
about? No, he's...

685
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:43,631
- No! No!
- You fuckin' bitch!

686
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,130
Hey! Andy! Andy!

687
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,263
We're gonna go.

688
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:47,496
Hey, hey, hey! I'm right here.

689
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,154
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

690
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:52,396
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

691
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,263
- I'm here.
- Bjorn! No.

692
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,430
Bjorn, we're not leaving
without them!

693
00:47:55,454 --> 00:47:56,619
- I'm here.
- Bjorn!

694
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,363
- Where are they?
- You need to listen.

695
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:01,463
We have to start the ship, okay?

696
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:02,631
- Just go and start the ship.
- Where's Rain? How...

697
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,564
Forgive me.

698
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:07,130
I've been nothing
but a burden to you.

699
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:10,296
Today, I can finally help.

700
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,621
And you won't see me
as a child anymore.

701
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,655
What?

702
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:17,552
Andy!

703
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:28,220
- Hey!
- Bjorn!

704
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:52,954
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

705
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:55,030
Navarro, undock!

706
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:56,220
<i>Undock the ship!</i>

707
00:48:58,987 --> 00:49:01,396
<i>Undocking initiated.</i>

708
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,085
<i>Please clear the airlock.</i>

709
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,164
What the fuck is he doing?

710
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,430
They can't
just leave without us.

711
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,320
He thinks Andy's
trying to kill Navarro.

712
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:23,054
What?

713
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:25,420
Wait, is he?

714
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:30,454
I don't know.

715
00:49:33,755 --> 00:49:36,052
Andy? Andy?

716
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:38,454
Andy, open the door.

717
00:49:44,353 --> 00:49:47,087
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

718
00:49:48,087 --> 00:49:49,063
Bjorn?

719
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,296
<i>Bjorn, what are you doing?</i>

720
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,296
<i>You can't just leave us here.</i>

721
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,531
<i>You gotta come back and get us.</i>

722
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:55,287
Sorry, I can't do that until
she turns that psychopath off.

723
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:58,697
What's going on?

724
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:00,054
Andy, uh...

725
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,396
- Andy, he's glitchy.
- What?

726
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,363
I just need to get away

727
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:07,066
from this airlock right now.
I just need...

728
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:10,263
Navarro?

729
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,229
Are you all right?

730
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:13,553
What's wrong? What do you need?

731
00:50:20,188 --> 00:50:21,220
Navarro?

732
00:50:30,121 --> 00:50:31,363
Oh, God.

733
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:33,087
Oh, my God, what is that?

734
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,229
Navarro, please.
Navarro! Navarro!

735
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:39,586
Hey, hey, hey.

736
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:42,721
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

737
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:49,631
Someone talk to me!

738
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,021
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro,
what's going on?

739
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:03,488
Help!

740
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:05,721
- Help!
- Kay!

741
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:09,588
What's happening?
What's happening?

742
00:51:12,087 --> 00:51:14,054
Please don't let me die.

743
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:18,085
Someone help!

744
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,421
Bjorn?

745
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:06,063
Kay?

746
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,963
We have to go get them.

747
00:53:07,987 --> 00:53:13,021
<i>T-minus-47
minutes to impact event.</i>

748
00:53:14,488 --> 00:53:15,597
Doesn't make any sense.

749
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,497
No, I thought you said
we had hours.

750
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:19,264
The explosion pushed
the station's axis off

751
00:53:19,288 --> 00:53:21,030
by a few degrees,

752
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:23,397
just enough to hit the
asteroid belt a lot sooner.

753
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:24,655
Where did they crash?

754
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:26,497
Romulus Hangar Bay,

755
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:27,664
on the other side
of the station.

756
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:29,087
- Okay.
- Let's go.

757
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:42,588
<i>T-minus-45
minutes to impact event.</i>

758
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:50,021
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

759
00:53:56,421 --> 00:53:57,987
There's still hope.

760
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:07,631
We need to find a way

761
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:09,221
to cross to the Romulus module.

762
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:18,997
No, no, no.

763
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:20,788
They must've spread
from the lab.

764
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:26,165
I don't see another way.

765
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:27,288
Andy, can...

766
00:54:31,189 --> 00:54:32,963
I heard your voice in my head.

767
00:54:32,987 --> 00:54:34,397
Calling.

768
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:37,564
Artificial person.

769
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:39,431
Your model was once the backbone

770
00:54:39,455 --> 00:54:41,198
of our colonization efforts,

771
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,165
and it's an honor to be
in your presence.

772
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:45,154
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

773
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,264
I'm Science Officer Rook,

774
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:51,264
and I humbly request
your services now.

775
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,097
I'm afraid I have
just one directive.

776
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:57,154
To do what's best for...

777
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,330
Your upgrade came
with a new directive.

778
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,721
It overrides the old one.

779
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:04,488
I see.

780
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:07,354
What's required of me...

781
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:09,198
Sir?

782
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:10,555
To finish our mission.

783
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:20,121
- Andy!
- Andy!

784
00:55:21,189 --> 00:55:22,297
Andy.

785
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,097
My apologies.

786
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,297
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

787
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:27,354
Follow me.

788
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:30,597
What? Our situation?
How do you...

789
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:32,621
Andy! Andy!

790
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,963
The parasitoids have no eyes.

791
00:55:42,987 --> 00:55:44,597
They track you by sound,

792
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,497
but primarily,
by heat signature.

793
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:47,621
What?

794
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:49,431
Your body temperature.

795
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:50,597
Right.

796
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:52,431
If we raise the temperature
in the room

797
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:54,030
to match our bodies,

798
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:56,198
would that make us
invisible to them?

799
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,688
If we're quiet enough?

800
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,189
Just one way to find out.

801
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:08,655
Hey.

802
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:12,987
This is all my fault.

803
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:17,189
Yeah, it is.

804
00:56:19,388 --> 00:56:21,655
Yours, mine,
and everyone else's.

805
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:26,421
We all decided
to do this together.

806
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,354
We'll get to them.

807
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:40,254
<i>T-minus
40 minutes to impact event.</i>

808
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:12,564
The hallway's temperature

809
00:57:12,588 --> 00:57:14,198
is now equal to your bodies,

810
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:16,297
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

811
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:20,064
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature

812
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,464
and you'll be exposed.

813
00:57:21,488 --> 00:57:23,397
Sweat, goosebumps.

814
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:25,631
That's your skin trying to
cool your body down.

815
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,254
So watch out for those.

816
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:31,088
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

817
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,664
Come on. Come on!

818
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:32,189
Come on! Come on!

819
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:42,998
Okay. Okay.

820
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:45,055
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

821
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,131
Fuck!

822
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,321
Stay back, stay back, please.

823
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:06,321
Fuck!

824
01:01:09,655 --> 01:01:11,486
No! Fuck!

825
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:47,521
<i>Tyler.</i>

826
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,254
<i>Come on.</i>

827
01:01:57,555 --> 01:01:58,588
Kay...

828
01:02:00,756 --> 01:02:02,431
Oh, my God, Tyler...

829
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:04,631
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

830
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,064
<i>Please, Tyler, help me.</i>

831
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:09,155
<i>Everyone's dead.
I can't open this door.</i>

832
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:10,521
Please.

833
01:02:16,354 --> 01:02:18,165
The lever with the red button,

834
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:19,555
there's a key to the left.

835
01:02:21,455 --> 01:02:22,564
<i>Help.</i>

836
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:23,964
I can't find it.

837
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:25,706
There's not a key.
There isn't a key, Tyler.

838
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:29,531
<i>It'll be
there. It has to be there.</i>

839
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:31,254
A key. Okay, okay.

840
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:44,088
Uh...

841
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:52,455
I have the key. I have the key.

842
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:58,653
Oh, my God.

843
01:03:19,722 --> 01:03:20,955
Run.

844
01:03:22,254 --> 01:03:23,654
Go! Go!

845
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:49,230
Wait!

846
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:50,288
Wait!

847
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:52,722
Come on!

848
01:04:01,455 --> 01:04:03,464
You almost closed
the door on him.

849
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:06,497
Yes, but I didn't.

850
01:04:06,521 --> 01:04:08,064
I calculated
the timing perfectly

851
01:04:08,088 --> 01:04:09,488
with more success
than last time.

852
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:11,622
Won't you agree?

853
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:14,464
We're getting close.

854
01:04:14,488 --> 01:04:17,031
Let's move.

855
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:22,221
<i>T-minus
30 minutes to impact event.</i>

856
01:06:48,722 --> 01:06:50,955
<i>Access denied.</i>

857
01:06:56,489 --> 01:06:58,354
Kay...

858
01:06:59,656 --> 01:07:00,998
We're here. We're here.
It's all right,

859
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:02,131
it's all right, it's all right.

860
01:07:02,155 --> 01:07:03,189
Andy, open the door.

861
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:04,689
It's all right.

862
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,432
We're gonna get you out.

863
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:08,698
Tyler, open the door.

864
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:10,321
Open the door. Come on.

865
01:07:11,988 --> 01:07:13,230
Oh, my God.

866
01:07:13,254 --> 01:07:14,465
Look at me. Kay,
Kay, Kay. Look at me.

867
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,364
- Andy, open the door.
- Kay, look at me. Look at me.

868
01:07:15,388 --> 01:07:17,131
It's all right.
I'm gonna get you out.

869
01:07:17,155 --> 01:07:18,632
Andy, open the door.
Stop fucking around.

870
01:07:18,656 --> 01:07:19,665
- What are you doing?
- Don't look

871
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:22,465
- over there. Andy.
- Tyler, what's wrong?

872
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:24,532
Hey, I need you to open
that door right now, okay?

873
01:07:24,556 --> 01:07:27,532
That's what the creature's
waiting for us to do.

874
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:30,198
Open it, please.

875
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:31,198
Andy. Andy, open the door.

876
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:32,598
Listen to me.
Listen to me. She's pregnant.

877
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:35,565
Just, please.
Guys, please. Come on.

878
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:37,498
She's gonna have a baby. Okay?

879
01:07:37,522 --> 01:07:39,465
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- It takes that door

880
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,998
two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

881
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:43,465
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

882
01:07:43,489 --> 01:07:44,598
Come on,
what are you doing? Please...

883
01:07:44,622 --> 01:07:47,264
That's plenty of time for the
creature to get in here.

884
01:07:47,288 --> 01:07:50,031
Please, please,
please open the door.

885
01:07:50,055 --> 01:07:52,264
- Why won't you help me?
- Listen, listen.

886
01:07:52,288 --> 01:07:53,498
- Come on, help me, please.
- You have to run right now.

887
01:07:53,522 --> 01:07:54,698
- Please, please.
- Run. Run.

888
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:56,031
You're one of us, man.
You're one of us!

889
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:57,131
Kay, it's the only way.

890
01:07:57,155 --> 01:07:58,131
- Open the fucking door. Andy!
- You have to

891
01:07:58,155 --> 01:07:59,064
- fucking run. All right?
- Andy, please!

892
01:07:59,088 --> 01:07:59,931
- It's the only way.
- Andy!

893
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,230
- You have to run!
- Please!

894
01:08:02,254 --> 01:08:04,330
Open the fucking...

895
01:08:04,354 --> 01:08:07,288
Kay! Kay!

896
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:09,998
No, no, no.

897
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:11,055
Kay!

898
01:08:22,155 --> 01:08:23,221
I'll open it.

899
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:25,465
She's all right. She's moving.

900
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:27,254
No. It's all right.

901
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:37,031
Andy, open the door, please.

902
01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:39,522
Andy, I need to go and get her.

903
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:42,365
I'm truly sorry.

904
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,165
There was nothing I could
have done to save her.

905
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:46,732
You could have opened
the fucking door!

906
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,556
We'd all be dead if I had.

907
01:08:50,722 --> 01:08:52,230
We need to move
before the creature

908
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:53,398
finds its way into this room.

909
01:08:53,422 --> 01:08:54,489
Andy...

910
01:08:56,622 --> 01:08:58,988
what's your prime directive?

911
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:02,288
I'm afraid
I have a new directive.

912
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:05,520
To do what's best
for the company.

913
01:09:07,622 --> 01:09:10,532
I need to remove that module.

914
01:09:10,556 --> 01:09:13,155
I'm afraid that's not in the
best interest of the company.

915
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,288
We need to move.

916
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:23,155
Now.

917
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:34,622
How could you do that?

918
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:37,022
What?

919
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:39,322
Leave someone behind?

920
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:45,221
Where are we going?

921
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:50,498
To finish a task Rook
has entrusted upon me.

922
01:09:50,522 --> 01:09:52,498
When completed,
he'll clear the <i>Corbelan</i>

923
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,331
for departure and open
the docking bay doors.

924
01:09:55,355 --> 01:09:57,665
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

925
01:09:57,689 --> 01:09:59,665
And I'll return to Jackson.

926
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:00,955
And stay in Jackson.

927
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:07,689
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

928
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:20,022
We're here.

929
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:47,265
<i>Romulus Beta Lab.</i>

930
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:52,189
<i>All personnel require
A-1 security clearance.</i>

931
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:55,598
What is that?

932
01:10:55,622 --> 01:10:58,964
Probably some fucked up
bio-weapon, I'm sure.

933
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,322
<i>Actually, quite the opposite.</i>

934
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:04,131
<i>Andy, tell them.</i>

935
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:05,964
<i>Tell them what I told you.</i>

936
01:11:05,988 --> 01:11:07,498
Our colonies are dying.

937
01:11:07,522 --> 01:11:10,689
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

938
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:12,665
Toxic mine fumes.

939
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:15,998
It's all one unforeseen
tragedy after the other.

940
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:19,398
<i>Mankind was never truly suited
for space colonization.</i>

941
01:11:19,422 --> 01:11:21,556
<i>They're simply too fragile.</i>

942
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,422
<i>They're too weak.</i>

943
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:28,465
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

944
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:30,265
"The perfect organism."

945
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:32,222
That's how we should
refer to human beings.

946
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:37,166
<i>So, I set this wrong right.</i>

947
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,289
<i>I took its gift for humanity.</i>

948
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,398
Inside the parasitoids
I bio engineered

949
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:47,031
from the Xenomorph's DNA,

950
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:49,289
I discovered a unique
non-Newtonian fluid.

951
01:11:50,156 --> 01:11:52,298
<i>Life.</i>

952
01:11:52,322 --> 01:11:55,964
<i>In its most primal,
unadulterated form.</i>

953
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:57,632
<i>This microorganism
can be the most</i>

954
01:11:57,656 --> 01:12:00,598
<i>destructive pathogen
ever observed.</i>

955
01:12:00,622 --> 01:12:03,598
<i>But acetylated
and synthesized in our lab,</i>

956
01:12:03,622 --> 01:12:05,231
<i>I've turned it into the miracle</i>

957
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:07,456
<i>Mr. Weyland died searching for.</i>

958
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:10,055
Prometheus fire.

959
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:14,022
The divine gift to humanity.

960
01:12:15,722 --> 01:12:18,532
<i>Z-01 contains
the genome responsible</i>

961
01:12:18,556 --> 01:12:20,498
<i>for the Xeno's ability
to accelerate</i>

962
01:12:20,522 --> 01:12:23,199
<i>and slow down
its metabolism at will.</i>

963
01:12:23,222 --> 01:12:26,465
<i>Its symbiotic capableness
easily rewrites</i>

964
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:28,322
<i>the host's DNA
through its blood.</i>

965
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:36,132
<i>This is a much needed and well
overdue upgrade for humanity.</i>

966
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:39,632
<i>We simply cannot wait
for evolution anymore.</i>

967
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,432
Yeah, can we
get out of here now?

968
01:12:42,456 --> 01:12:44,166
My mission is to take
this back to the colony

969
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,355
for further development.

970
01:12:46,289 --> 01:12:47,689
Rook is tracking the compound.

971
01:12:48,622 --> 01:12:50,031
When detected inside our ship,

972
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:51,166
he'll open the docking bay doors

973
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:53,255
and set the hauler on
autopilot back to the colony.

974
01:12:54,556 --> 01:12:55,589
Wait.

975
01:12:58,355 --> 01:12:59,422
Do you see it?

976
01:13:04,123 --> 01:13:05,698
There.

977
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:07,355
The fucking thing's huntin' us.

978
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:11,465
Right. New plan.

979
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:12,848
Can you manage yourself
with a gun?

980
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,322
Yes, I fucking can.

981
01:13:22,456 --> 01:13:24,998
Right, this is an
F44AA pulse rifle.

982
01:13:25,022 --> 01:13:26,964
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

983
01:13:26,988 --> 01:13:28,331
It's what the
Colonial Marines used.

984
01:13:28,355 --> 01:13:30,199
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

985
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:31,741
So, right,
you put that under your arm.

986
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:36,556
That's it.
Right, this hand here.

987
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:41,532
All right. Aim it towards Andy.

988
01:13:41,556 --> 01:13:42,722
Pull the trigger halfway.

989
01:13:44,022 --> 01:13:45,222
Don't worry, the safety's on.

990
01:13:50,022 --> 01:13:51,298
See?

991
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:53,065
Aiming assistance.

992
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:54,298
If that thing comes towards you,

993
01:13:54,322 --> 01:13:57,132
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

994
01:13:57,156 --> 01:13:59,023
- Where'd you learn all this?
- Uh...

995
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:02,432
Games and magazines.

996
01:14:02,456 --> 01:14:04,698
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

997
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:06,432
450 rounds.

998
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:08,255
And you mustn't fire
a single one.

999
01:14:09,689 --> 01:14:12,255
Acid for blood. Remember?

1000
01:14:13,322 --> 01:14:15,298
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

1001
01:14:15,322 --> 01:14:17,132
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

1002
01:14:17,156 --> 01:14:18,498
You shoot that creature

1003
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:21,056
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

1004
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:22,398
And we all die.

1005
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:24,231
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

1006
01:14:24,255 --> 01:14:26,231
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

1007
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:28,522
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

1008
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,432
Maybe.

1009
01:14:30,456 --> 01:14:31,622
Big maybe.

1010
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:34,522
I found us a way
through the conveyor belt.

1011
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:36,322
This way.

1012
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:41,089
Andy.

1013
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:44,023
Are you there?

1014
01:15:16,056 --> 01:15:21,089
<i>T-minus
20 minutes to impact event.</i>

1015
01:15:33,023 --> 01:15:35,032
There's a lift
at the end of this corridor.

1016
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:36,722
It will take us
directly to our ship.

1017
01:15:49,656 --> 01:15:51,398
There's more of those things.

1018
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,398
Yeah, that's not good.

1019
01:15:53,422 --> 01:15:55,722
They seem to have been
here for quite some time.

1020
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:04,289
Andy?

1021
01:16:23,689 --> 01:16:25,556
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:32,222
Busy little creatures.

1023
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:47,166
I think we better go back
and find another way.

1024
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,656
That might be a good idea.

1025
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:52,999
Andy,
see if you can open this gate.

1026
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:54,489
Stop.

1027
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:57,255
What?

1028
01:17:10,056 --> 01:17:11,298
Kay!

1029
01:17:11,322 --> 01:17:13,099
Hey!

1030
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:14,156
Tyler!

1031
01:17:15,289 --> 01:17:16,398
Tyler!

1032
01:17:16,422 --> 01:17:17,456
Kay!

1033
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,289
Kay!

1034
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,389
Kay!

1035
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:41,456
Kay!

1036
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:43,489
I got her, I got her.

1037
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:48,732
It's all right. We got you.

1038
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:50,089
She's alive.

1039
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:00,331
Okay, we got you, we got you.

1040
01:18:00,355 --> 01:18:02,099
Hold on.

1041
01:18:02,123 --> 01:18:03,320
Okay.

1042
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:07,999
We're here, we're here.

1043
01:18:08,023 --> 01:18:09,532
Tyler, she's losing
a lot of blood.

1044
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:11,589
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

1045
01:18:12,656 --> 01:18:14,032
How do you know?

1046
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:16,598
There's no dead
parasitoid by her feet.

1047
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:18,589
Andy, this is on you.
So you do something.

1048
01:18:19,456 --> 01:18:21,056
Please! Andy!

1049
01:18:26,056 --> 01:18:29,298
25% of the human genome
is shared with rats.

1050
01:18:29,322 --> 01:18:30,722
And it worked on the rat.

1051
01:18:35,522 --> 01:18:36,556
Come on, Kay.

1052
01:18:40,023 --> 01:18:41,231
Don't.

1053
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:42,389
What choice do I have?

1054
01:18:43,322 --> 01:18:44,565
We take her back to the hauler

1055
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,465
and we put her
in the cryo-pod. Okay?

1056
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:48,099
That will keep her alive
long enough to

1057
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:49,965
get her proper treatment
back at the colony.

1058
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:51,532
I don't trust this.

1059
01:18:51,556 --> 01:18:52,999
Andy, will she make it?

1060
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:54,322
If we hurry.

1061
01:19:13,656 --> 01:19:14,689
Go! Go!

1062
01:19:21,622 --> 01:19:22,965
I see it. I see it.

1063
01:19:22,989 --> 01:19:24,231
This is it, this is it.

1064
01:19:24,255 --> 01:19:26,199
I got her. I got her. I got her.

1065
01:19:26,222 --> 01:19:28,032
You're okay. You're okay.

1066
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:29,723
We're so close. We're so close.

1067
01:19:32,456 --> 01:19:34,166
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

1068
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,532
Hey, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

1069
01:19:36,556 --> 01:19:37,666
You see, you're so close.

1070
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,255
You just gotta hang in there.

1071
01:19:43,422 --> 01:19:44,688
Watch out!

1072
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:51,265
Tyler?

1073
01:19:51,289 --> 01:19:52,723
Tyler!

1074
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:24,655
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

1075
01:20:31,522 --> 01:20:33,021
Andy!

1076
01:20:40,522 --> 01:20:42,255
No! Tyler!

1077
01:21:52,023 --> 01:21:55,265
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

1078
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:57,265
This goes straight to our ship.

1079
01:21:57,289 --> 01:22:00,533
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

1080
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:03,190
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

1081
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,987
Can you do that?

1082
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,065
Yes?

1083
01:22:10,089 --> 01:22:11,389
What about you?

1084
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:14,123
I'll find a way back.

1085
01:24:09,056 --> 01:24:10,355
Let me take it out.

1086
01:24:11,355 --> 01:24:13,289
And I'll fix you in return.

1087
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:19,690
Listen to me.

1088
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,466
You'll die in here

1089
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:23,965
and that's not
in the best interest

1090
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:26,222
of the company or mine.

1091
01:24:58,457 --> 01:25:02,423
Come on. Andy, please.

1092
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:10,298
<i>T-minus
10 minutes to impact event.</i>

1093
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:11,356
Rain?

1094
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:17,056
Andy.

1095
01:25:18,657 --> 01:25:21,523
- I'm so, so sorry.
- No, no.

1096
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:25,089
No, I'm sorry.

1097
01:25:44,457 --> 01:25:46,255
It won't hold them off for long.

1098
01:26:12,757 --> 01:26:14,666
Come on.

1099
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,199
<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

1100
01:26:16,222 --> 01:26:18,457
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1101
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,032
Open the door.

1102
01:26:22,056 --> 01:26:24,231
<i>I'm afraid
I must deny your petition.</i>

1103
01:26:24,255 --> 01:26:26,699
<i>I just can't risk
compromising the compound.</i>

1104
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:29,231
<i>But know that I'm grateful
for the invaluable help</i>

1105
01:26:29,255 --> 01:26:30,694
<i>you two have provided
to the company.</i>

1106
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:34,290
Son of a bitch!

1107
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,633
Andy, open it.

1108
01:26:41,657 --> 01:26:42,690
- Here.
- Open.

1109
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:44,666
It's not working.

1110
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,188
God damn it!

1111
01:26:52,356 --> 01:26:54,999
<i>I can't lie about your chances,</i>

1112
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:56,490
<i>but you have my sympathies.</i>

1113
01:27:16,223 --> 01:27:17,666
<i>Press it,</i>

1114
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,223
<i>so I can take control of your
ship and fly you out of here.</i>

1115
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:24,399
Who are you?

1116
01:27:24,423 --> 01:27:25,557
<i>A friend.</i>

1117
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,433
<i>Your companions died
so you could live.</i>

1118
01:27:30,457 --> 01:27:32,299
<i>Press the button...</i>

1119
01:27:32,323 --> 01:27:34,156
<i>and let me
honor their sacrifice.</i>

1120
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:45,989
Andy, can you tell me
one of your jokes?

1121
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:50,154
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1122
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:55,299
- 'Cause they taste funny.
- They taste funny.

1123
01:27:55,323 --> 01:27:57,290
I don't understand
cloning at all.

1124
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,557
That makes two of us.

1125
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:03,999
I read a great book
about zero gravity.

1126
01:28:04,023 --> 01:28:06,141
- I just couldn't put it down.
- Couldn't put it down.

1127
01:28:09,089 --> 01:28:10,123
Rain?

1128
01:28:10,657 --> 01:28:11,690
Rain?

1129
01:28:12,657 --> 01:28:14,566
Rain, what are you doing?

1130
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,123
I'm turning off
the gravity generator.

1131
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:22,167
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

1132

<i>four, three,</i>

1134
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,191
<i>two, one.</i>

1135
01:28:35,157 --> 01:28:36,590
Rain, are you sure about this?

1136
01:28:37,623 --> 01:28:39,388
Only one way to find out.

1137
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:47,023
It works.

1138
01:29:05,557 --> 01:29:07,657
Rain! You're at 40%.

1139
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:20,221
20%.

1140
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:33,490
Rain!

1141
01:29:44,056 --> 01:29:45,457
Oh, fuck.

1142
01:29:53,657 --> 01:29:55,191
Stay behind me.

1143
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,723
Andy, be careful.

1144
01:30:27,423 --> 01:30:29,023
Rain!

1145
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:47,057
Andy, you okay?

1146
01:30:53,223 --> 01:30:55,057
We need to get to the elevator.

1147
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,555
The elevator won't work
without gravity.

1148
01:31:28,457 --> 01:31:29,490
Ready?

1149
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:41,423
Rain!

1150
01:31:53,057 --> 01:31:54,557
Fuck.

1151
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,256
No.

1152
01:32:21,423 --> 01:32:22,657
It's a gravity purge!

1153
01:32:33,323 --> 01:32:34,599
Andy!

1154
01:32:34,623 --> 01:32:35,657
Come on.

1155
01:33:57,223 --> 01:33:58,288
Andy!

1156
01:34:29,157 --> 01:34:30,288
Get away from her.

1157
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:38,223
You bitch.

What took you so long?

1166
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:23,990
Let's get you outta here.

1167
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:27,223
<i>I'm glad to see you two made it.</i>

1168
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,691
I got you. Watch your head.

1169
01:36:28,657 --> 01:36:31,124
- Thank you.
- You're gonna be just fine.

1170
01:36:32,024 --> 01:36:33,124
Both of you.

1171
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:44,700
<i>The company couldn't be prouder</i>

<i>When received in six months,</i>

1175
01:36:50,323 --> 01:36:51,734
<i>they'll travel to Jackson's Star</i>

1176
01:36:51,758 --> 01:36:54,037
<i>to retrieve the compound from
you for further development.</i>

1177

<i>What are you doing?</i>

1178
01:37:02,623 --> 01:37:04,191
Change of plans.

1179
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:08,667
<i>Andy, stop her.</i>

1180
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:10,191
<i>Reconnect us now.</i>

1181
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:14,966
<i>No, no, no.
You two cannot do this.</i>

1182
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,167
<i>The compound must be delivered
to the company.</i>

1183
01:37:17,191 --> 01:37:19,466
<i>I'm afraid

1184
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,533
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

1185
01:37:21,557 --> 01:37:24,133
Now you better listen to me
here, now, you two.

1186
01:37:24,157 --> 01:37:27,157
You are insignificant in the
great scheme of things. You...

1187
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:35,024
No.

1188
01:37:50,256 --> 01:37:53,057
This will keep your systems
online until we get to Yvaga.

1189
01:37:55,057 --> 01:37:57,167
- But I thought that...
- I don't care.

1190

You're coming with me.
All right?

1191
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,090
If that's what's best for Rain.

1192
01:38:04,691 --> 01:38:06,724
Andy, I have
a new directive for you.

1193
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:10,323
Do what's best for us.

1194
01:38:13,758 --> 01:38:14,990
Done.

1195
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:17,290
