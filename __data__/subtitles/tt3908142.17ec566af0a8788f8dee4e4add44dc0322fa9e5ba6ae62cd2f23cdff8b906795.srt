1
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:26,256
(oscillating music)

2
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:38,977
(eerie music)

3
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,446
(moving to slow jazzy music)

4
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:50,590
- [Voiceover] I'm starting a new
life.

5
00:00:50,614 --> 00:00:52,658
(mooing)

6
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:58,914
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,750
And almost no one knows me.

8
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,741
(gagging)

9
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:37,786
(whining music)

10
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:40,204
Poor Jerry.

11
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,712
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

12
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,301
They say I'm cured now.

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,181
But I still have intrusive
thoughts.

14
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,234
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

15
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,280
People are abused all over the
world

16
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,322
every day

17
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,075
much worse than me

18
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,579
and they do fine.

19
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,590
(police siren blaring)

20
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,078
(door slamming)

21
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,377
- Your tail light's out, Miss.

22
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:11,380
- Oh, thank you for letting me
know.

23
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,967
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

24
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:20,138
- I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

25
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:23,266
- Thank you, Officer.

26
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,353
- You drive safely.

27
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,364
(engine starting up)

28
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,953
(eerie music)

29
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,839
- [Voiceover] When Jerry left me,
I devoured everything

30
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,092
I could about how to get your
man back.

31
00:03:57,676 --> 00:04:01,555
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

32
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:09,187
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

33
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,483
You have to be very tricky.

34
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:39,342
(door slamming)

35
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:55,609
(door slamming)

36
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,322
- Elaine?

37
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:01,490
Hi, I'm Trish.

38
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,325
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet
you.

39
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,243
- Oh, you're so pretty.

40
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,287
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

41
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,872
I'm married and everything.

42
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,333
- No, I didn't think anything.

43
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:14,586
- Well, let me help you with
your bags.

44
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,171
Is this all you've got?

45
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,172
- For now.

46
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:19,341
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

47
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:20,550
- So you're an artist?

48
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:21,592
- Yes, I am.

49
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:23,762
- I'm an interior decorator.

50
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:24,846
- Oh, really?

51
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:26,138
- Yes.

52
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,482
That's how I met Barbara.

53
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,734
I decorated this apartment.

54
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,028
It was lucky I still had the
keys.

55
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,949
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

56
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,088
How do you know Barbara?

57
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,340
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

58
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:01,424
- Oh, really?

59
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,809
Well, I hope you like the
apartment.

60
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,770
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

61
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,815
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth Tarot deck

62
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:19,150
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

63
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,402
for me to hang.

64
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,446
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

65
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,328
Well, this is it.

66
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,501
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

67
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,545
It's just beautiful.

68
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:39,587
- Really?

69
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,172
Oh, I'm so glad.

70
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,592
I thought I may have overdone
it.

71
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,177
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

72
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:47,929
- You must be exhausted.

73
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:49,556
I'm sure you want to lie down.

74
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,933
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

75
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,019
Do you know of a place around
here?

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,604
- There's the Victorian Tea
Room.

77
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,231
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

78
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,900
- Oh, how fantastic.

79
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:01,943
Where can I freshen up?

80
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,737
- The bedroom is through there.

81
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,739
- I'll only be a moment.

82
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,496
(harp music)

83
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,086
(light chatting)

84
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:40,607
- What a lovely room.

85
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:42,400
- Yes, isn't it?

86
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,110
I love Victoriana.

87
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:47,280
- Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

88
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:50,033
- Do you have fairy
princess fantasies, Elaine?

89
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,075
- Of course.

90
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,203
We may be grown women, but
underneath

91
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:57,374
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

92
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:59,793
by a prince on a white horse.

93
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,087
- Yes, I suppose so.

94
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,255
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

95
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,974
- I don't think I've found
my Prince Charming yet,

96
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,267
but I think I found the formula.

97
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,745
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

98
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,898
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

99
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:28,446
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

100
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:33,576
Then Jerry would have never left
me.

101
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:34,744
- Who's Jerry?

102
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,538
- My ex-husband.

103
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,668
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

104
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,840
But then I was reborn as a
witch.

105
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,720
Barbara and Gahan brought me
back to life.

106
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:55,890
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

107
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,977
Men are like children.

108
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,604
They're very easy to please

109
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:05,316
as long as we give them what
they want.

110
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,317
♫ Tra la la la

111
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:09,654
♫ Tra la la la la di da

112
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,828
♫ I dreamed of a fairy
lady in a strange land

113
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:24,544
♫ She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men

114
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,052
♫ She wore a gown

115
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:36,139
♫ Of pink and purple roses

116
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:43,146
♫ It was so tra la la and so la
di da ♫

117
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,774
- Where were we?

118
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:50,028
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

119
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,946
Well, what do men want?

120
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:56,451
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

121
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,245
and to make them feel like a man

122
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,431
and to give them total freedom

123
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:03,083
in whatever they wanna do or be.

124
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,794
- But what about what we want?

125
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:07,420
How are we going to be equals
with men

126
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:10,965
if we keep catering to all of
their needs?

127
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:15,345
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

128
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:19,516
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

129
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:24,145
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

130
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:28,316
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

131
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:31,486
I'll admit, I used sex to get
this,

132
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,073
but I'm not proud of it.

133
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:38,118
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

134
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,370
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

135
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,621
I'd be a wreck.

136
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,206
- Poor Richard.

137
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:48,294
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

138
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,715
You have to give a man his
fantasy.

139
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:55,552
- (laughing) His fantasy?

140
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:57,137
- Yes, his fantasy.

141
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,475
But what I'm really interested
in

142
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:03,517
is love.

143
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:08,731
You might say I'm addicted to
love.

144
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:13,027
I wonder if all women feel that
way?

145
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,573
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

146
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,449
A husband isn't a prince,
Elaine,

147
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,827
and life isn't a fairy tale.

148
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,871
We have to face that fact.

149
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:23,912
- Why?

150
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,724
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

151
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:27,834
if you pleased your husband
more.

152
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,587
- (laughing) I don't
need to please Richard.

153
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,714
Richard loves me for myself.

154
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:33,755
- Of course.

155
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:36,926
Perhaps you did find your Prince
Charming.

156
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,261
- Perhaps I did.

157
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,520
(eerie harp strumming)

158
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:52,524
- Guess who.

159
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,112
- Richard, what are you doing
here?

160
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:56,946
(laughing)

161
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:58,615
This tea room is for ladies
only.

162
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,909
- Oh, I went to visit you at
work

163
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,160
and Julie said you were here.

164
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,746
I thought we could have lunch
together.

165
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:07,957
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

166
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,876
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

167
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,837
Elaine, this is my husband,
Richard.

168
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,673
- I've heard so much about you,
Richard.

169
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,301
- Nothing too horrible, I hope
(chuckles).

170
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:19,594
- On the contrary.

171
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:22,847
(eerie harp strumming)

172
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:29,312
(eerie violin music)

173
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,441
(moving to light orchestral
music)

174
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:43,386
(scraping)

175
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,359
- Goddess, please,

176
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,572
send me a beautiful, sweet man

177
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,576
to love me as I love him.

178
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:55,958
To love me, love me,

179
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,130
love me,

180
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:04,966
love me,

181
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:07,636
love me,

182
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,805
love me,

183
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,015
love me,

184
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:13,434
(light piano music)

185
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:14,476
love me.

186
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,290
Hi, are you Wendy?

187
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,210
- Yes, what can I do for you?

188
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,294
- I'm Elaine.

189
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,296
We spoke on the phone.

190
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:45,133
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

191
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,551
- Elaine, right.

192
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,302
Thanks for coming by.

193
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,012
Mind if I have a look?

194
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:51,054
- Please do.

195
00:15:58,563 --> 00:15:59,939
- These are nice.

196
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:04,943
Really nice.

197
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:09,699
I think these will do well in
the store.

198
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,284
- Then you'll take them?

199
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:15,037
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

200
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,502
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

201
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:22,544
Sound good?

202
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,172
- Yes, fantastic.

203
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:25,965
Thank you, Wendy.

204
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,216
- Sure, Elaine.

205
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:28,885
Bright blessings.

206
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:42,607
(cat calling)

207
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:11,385
- [Voiceover] People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

208
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:15,515
I tell them it's because I
want to have magical powers.

209
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,600
But it's not like it sounds.

210
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:21,771
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

211
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,191
(pigeons cooing)

212
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,364
(wings flapping)

213
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,033
(ominous music)

214
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,877
(gonging)

215
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:58,473
- Hi.

216
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,475
- Hi.

217
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,147
- (sighs) It's a beautiful day.

218
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:06,232
- Yes, it is.

219
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,027
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

220
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,862
- Oh, you like nature?

221
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
- Very much.

222
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,909
You seem like a nature type too.

223
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:20,830
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

224
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,164
- That's right.

225
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,624
How'd you know?

226
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,167
- I can just tell.

227
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,878
Nature is where your heart is.

228
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,882
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

229
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:36,053
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

230
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,849
- I'm talented that way.

231
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,811
- Well, you're right about the
city.

232
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,689
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods

233
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:48,691
about an hour from here.

234
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,278
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

235
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,904
just think and read.

236
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,658
- Do you take your wife up
there?

237
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,411
- (chuckles) No.

238
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,079
I'm not married.

239
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:04,975
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

240
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,334
once in a while.

241
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,086
- (laughing) I do.

242
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:10,921
I do, once in a while.

243
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,924
- You wanna take a girl up there
now?

244
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,260
- (giggles)

245
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,597
What do you mean?

246
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,059
- Well, I'm new in town

247
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,646
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

248
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,981
I'll make you a nice dinner.

249
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:33,694
- (laughing) Yes, okay, sure.

250
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:36,572
Uh, my car is right over there.

251
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:38,657
- Okay.

252
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,950
Let's go.

253
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,666
(birds chirping)

254
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,978
(car engine starting)

255
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:13,776
(tires screeching)

256
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:28,708
- (sighing)

257
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,961
You know what I'd like to do
right now?

258
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:40,136
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

259
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,054
just like we were kids.

260
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,350
- [Elaine] Wait, wait.

261
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,772
You want some?

262
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:54,775
- What is it?

263
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:57,069
- Something I made.

264
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,284
(clanging)

265
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,452
- Mm.

266
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:09,707
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

267
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,250
- Finish it.

268
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,717
(gulping)

269
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,431
- Oh (sighs).

270
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,605
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

271
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:35,565
Not here.

272
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,318
Let's go inside.

273
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:51,624
This is beautiful.

274
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,631
I'll start the dinner.

275
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:07,681
(light piano music with
vocalising)

276
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:23,072

277
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:34,750
(chime ringing)

278
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:42,215
- Wow.

279
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:50,933
This looks delicious.

280
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:54,936
- To nature.

281
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,815
(clinking)

282
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:16,584
- This is really nice, isn't it?

283
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,128
I like to come up here a lot

284
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,755
at the end of the semester to
unwind.

285
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,132
- Are you a teacher?

286
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:25,843
- Yeah, I teach at the
university.

287
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,845
- Oh, what do you teach?

288
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:30,514
- English and French literature

289
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:33,267
with a focus on the 18th
century.

290
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,437
- So, you must be quite a
libertine.

291
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,605
- A libertine?

292
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,399
Why would you say that?

293
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,775
- Oh, you know.

294
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:45,321
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.

295
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:46,697
Not to mention Casanova.

296
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:50,326
- (chuckles) Well, there
were a lot of books written

297
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,994
in the 18th century.

298
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,579
- Well, is it true?

299
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,706
Are you a libertine?

300
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:57,999
- Yes I am.

301
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,044
I love women.

302
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,546
Does that bother you?

303
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,048
- On the contrary.

304
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,426
- (Laughing)

305
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:09,969
Oh, hmm,

306
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:14,016
I feel strange, dizzy.

307
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:22,524
What was in that drink you gave
me?

308
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,445
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

309
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,865
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

310
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:32,201
(laughs)

311
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:33,242
Oh, baby.

312
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,329
You are really wild.

313

(ominous harp strumming)

314
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:44,880
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

315
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:45,965
- Not at all.

316
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:49,134

324

Dark and quiet that you show the
world.

325
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,804
Who do you give that to?

326
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,139
The rainbow?

327
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,476

No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

No games, no agendas.

366
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,273
You just seem to take life as it
is.

367
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,735
- Is there any other way to take
life?

368
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:01,488
- Well, the women I've been
with,

369
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,926
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

370
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,411
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

371
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:11,456
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

372
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:12,498
It's crazy.

373
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,459
- I know, baby.

374
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:16,752
I know.

375
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:22,592
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

376
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:27,097
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

377
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:31,476
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

378
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:34,062
they're never bright enough.

379
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:38,692
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

380
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:41,528
- That seems like quite a
problem.

381
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:45,157
- It is (crying).

382
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,577
I feel my whole life as a loner,

383
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,538
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

384
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,500
But now I'm not so sure.

385
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Oh, Elaine,

386
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,883
I have never felt real
love like this before.

387
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:07,721
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

388
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:10,307
- Oh (crying).

389
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,392
Elaine, I'm scared.

390
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:19,024
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

391
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,610
I can't take it, I can't take
it.

392
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:24,154
Oh (grunting).

393
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:30,035
Elaine (heavy breathing), I'm
sick.

394
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:31,786
I'm sick.

395
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,207
- Hey, it's all right.

396
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,877
I've got you.

397
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,628
I love you.

398
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,172
(grunting)

399
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:44,841
And I'll always be here for you.

400
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,804
Try to get some sleep.

401
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:53,266
(heavy breathing)

402
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,981
- [Voiceover] Elaine.

403
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:05,445
Elaine, where are you?

404
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,949
Elaine, where are you?

405
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:15,247
- [Voiceover] What a pussy.

406
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,081
(crying)

407
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:17,123
What a baby.

408
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,459
I thought I'd found a real man,

409
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,420
but he's just like a little
girl.

410
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,171
- [Voiceover] Elaine!

411
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,483
- [Voiceover] No one was ever
there for me

412
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:27,676
when I was crying my heart out.

413
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:29,177
(crying)

414
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:31,263
No one ever comforted me.

415
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,930
No one.

416
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:01,293
(paper ripping)

417
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:11,928
(sizzling)

418
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:15,307
(pounding)

419
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,189
(scraping)

420
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:36,369
(door clacking open)

421
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:48,840
- Good morning, Wayne.

422
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:50,800
- Hi, Elaine.

423
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,934
- Here, drink this.

424
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:05,857
(cup clattering)

425
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:12,906
- I had such horrible dreams
last night.

426
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,951
- What did you dream about,
baby.

427
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,620
- I dreamt that I was calling
your name

428
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:20,539
and you didn't answer.

429
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,709
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

430
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,757
Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't
you?

431
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:34,386
- Of course, I love you.

432
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:38,557
- (crying) Oh God, oh God,
Elaine.

433
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,397
- Are you hungry?

434
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,484
- I don't know what I am.

435
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,320
- Well, try to get some sleep.

436
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:54,572
- Elaine.

437
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,826
Don't leave me.

438
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:00,078
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

439
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,663
I'll be right here.

440
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:30,066
Wayne, wake up.

441
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:31,609
It's late.

442
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,112
Wayne.

443
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:37,866
Wayne, baby, wake up.

444
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:40,618
Wake up.

445
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,870
Wayne.

446
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:46,416
(gasping)

447
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,918
(eerie music)

448
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:54,507
(crying)

449
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:12,525
(birds chirping) (gentle
rhythmic music)

450
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,074
- [Voiceover] Tampons aren't
gross.

451
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:04,494
Women bleed and that's a
beautiful thing.

452
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:09,708
Do you know that most men have
never even seen a used tampon?

453
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:18,842
Part of me can be with Wayne
now.

454
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:21,593
Always.

455
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,641
I don't really mind death.

456
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,810
I've buried people before.

457
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,813
People I really cared about.

458
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,566
(dramatic music)

459
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:40,613
In the end we're all just
compost anyway.

460
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,117
Everything regenerates.

461
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:50,206
I'd like to come back as a cat.

462
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:54,586
I've been so depressed since my
cat died.

463
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:59,007
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

464
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,093
He was my best friend.

465
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,189
(gonging)

466
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:17,984
(ominous music)

467
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:23,490
- I give the rainbow to you.

468
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:27,534
Right now.

469
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:32,665
(dramatic music)

470
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,839
(car engine starting)

471
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:38,690
(harpsichord music)

472
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:06,050
(door bell ringing)

473
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:09,178
Just a minute.

474
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:17,895
Oh hi Trish.

475
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:19,438
Come on in.

476
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:20,732
- Hey, Elaine.

477
00:40:21,149 --> 00:40:22,317
You look gorgeous.

478
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,027
I love what you've done with
your hair.

479
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:25,068
- Thank you.

480
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,196
What's up, honey?

481
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,549
- Well, I haven't been able to
reach you,

482
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:29,532
so I thought I'd come over

483
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:31,659
to see if everything was all
right.

484
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:32,701
- I'm fine.

485
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:34,202
Really.

486
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,248
Can I offer you something?

487
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,834
I just made some tea and cake.

488
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:41,669
- Just tea, thank you.

489
00:40:42,295 --> 00:40:45,256
(harpsichord music)

490
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,808
- Cream and sugar?

491
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,977
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

492
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:03,816
(slow harpsichord music)

493
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:16,621
So, what have you been so busy
with?

494
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:17,789
A man, I hope.

495
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,832
- Yes, it was a man.

496
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,211
But, it didn't work out.

497
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,754
- I'm Sorry.

498
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:28,341
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

499
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:32,887
I thought that he was the one.

500
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:34,889
- Well, maybe next time.

501
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:38,893
- Are you sure you won't have
some cake?

502
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:40,561
- Oh, no, thank you.

503
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:45,316
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

504
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:46,358
- Good bye?

505
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:49,362
Why, where are you going?

506
00:41:49,404 --> 00:41:53,366
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

507
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:55,952
- Is Richard going with you?

508
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:57,662
- No, it's just a business trip.

509
00:41:57,704 --> 00:42:01,749
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

510
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:15,304
(jazzy music)

511
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,517
(cheering and whistling)

512
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,357
(applauding)

513
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:38,828
- Sam, give me two whiskeys on
the rocks.

514
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,371
- Sure thing, Jane.

515
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:43,666
Did you see the papers today?

516
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,708
- No, why?

517
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:47,712
- They found a body in the Eel
River.

518
00:42:47,754 --> 00:42:48,754
- A murder?

519
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,339
- Maybe.

520
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:51,340
(provocative music)

521
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:54,677
They found a symbol carved in
his chest.

522
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:57,262
Here.

523
00:42:59,265 --> 00:43:02,226
- (gasps) It's a pentagram.

524
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:04,395
- It's them witches again.

525
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:08,024
- That's what I was thinking
too, Lyle.

526
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:13,196
- So yeah, Barbara, that's
everything.

527
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:17,200
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

528
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:19,368
They couldn't prove anything.

529
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,330
They actually thought that I
killed him.

530
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,915
Can you believe it?

531
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:29,087
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

532
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:30,338
after you left.

533
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,675
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

534
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,677
- Well, it was perfect timing.

535
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,055
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to
greet you.

536
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:40,264
That's all right.

537
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:42,100
Trish has been lovely.

538
00:43:42,725 --> 00:43:45,144
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

539
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:47,480
But I had this experience last
weekend

540
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:49,482
that really shook me up.

541
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,319
- Why, what happened?

542
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:56,405
- Well, I met this great-looking
guy.

543
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,783
And I used love magic on him.

544
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:01,369
Then he got really weird on me.

545
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:06,165
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

546
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,460
Then he got really

547
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:11,837
sick.

548
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:15,091
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

549
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:17,969
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

550
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,179
It was probably just too much
for him.

551
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:24,100
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

552
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:26,519
- I guess that's what it was.

553
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:28,604
But, I don't know.

554
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:31,899
- Honey, you have to be more
careful.

555
00:44:31,941 --> 00:44:33,377
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

556
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:35,778
in the first place, you know.

557
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:39,657
- Merry Meet, Elaine.

558
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,785
- Bright blessings Gahan.

559
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,217
(jazzy trumpet music)

560
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:04,557
- I heard you discussing love
spells.

561
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,475
You do have to be careful,
Elaine.

562
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:10,313
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

563
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:13,858
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

564
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,152
What's it been now, a year?

565
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:20,031
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

566
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:22,366
Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,

567
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,996
for the blessings that we share.

568
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:29,248
- [All] Blessed be, Hurrahya!

569
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,211
- Go home, witches.

570
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:35,837
Go home.

571
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:38,216
- Just ignore them.

572
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,926
They're always giving us
trouble.

573
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,678
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

574
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,972
- Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

575
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:47,433
But it's not bad for a small
town.

576
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:49,227
Not all of them embrace our
methods

577
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:51,103
of practicing witchcraft.

578
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:54,941
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

579
00:45:54,982 --> 00:45:58,277
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

580
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:02,531
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

581
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:06,077
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

582
00:46:06,118 --> 00:46:08,996
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

583
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:11,165
And it was fun.

584
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:12,792
(applauding)

585
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:15,336
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

586
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:17,838
(jazzy music)

587
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,260
- What have you been teaching?

588
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:25,596
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on sigil magic

589
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:29,141
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

590
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:31,477
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

591
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,313
energy grounding,
Earth-based spirituality,

592
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:36,148
pagan arts and crafts,

593
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,319
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

594
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:44,240
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

595
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:47,702
- Oh, are you still teaching
that?

596
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,914
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

597
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:55,918
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

598
00:46:56,627 --> 00:47:00,756
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

599
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,092
- Are you still dancing?

600
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:05,011
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on Amateur Night.

601
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:06,345
You should come.

602
00:47:08,848 --> 00:47:09,849
- [Both] Hi, Barbara.

603
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,890
Hi, Gahan.

604
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:12,393
Sorry we're late.

605
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,522
- Hello lovely ladies, please
have a seat.

606
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:21,819
Elaine, this is Star and her
sister Moon.

607
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:23,863
They're our students for
tonight.

608
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:26,365
Girls, this is our dear friend
Elaine.

609
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,407
- Hi.

610
00:47:27,616 --> 00:47:28,616
- [Both] Hi.

611
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,329
- I was just pointing out that
dancing

612
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,248
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

613
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,791
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

614
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,294
so you could learn about that.

615
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:43,466
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

616
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:47,678
These men would do anything for
her.

617
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,682
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

618
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:53,934
Then let us begin.

619
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:58,647
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

620
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,692
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

621
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:03,527
lies in her sexuality.

622
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:08,491
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

623
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:13,162
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

624
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:17,666
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

625
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:22,713
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

626
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:25,549
with the fear of female
sexuality.

627
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:28,761
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

628
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:32,056
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

629
00:48:32,098 --> 00:48:35,393
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

630
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:39,563
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

631
00:48:40,022 --> 00:48:42,566
never asking us what we wanted.

632
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:46,070
- They teach us that a
normative human being

633
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:48,906
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

634
00:48:49,198 --> 00:48:52,868
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

635
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,703
that need to be cured.

636
00:48:55,746 --> 00:48:59,333
And we believe that men
and women are different

637
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:03,421
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

638
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:06,424
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

639
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,217
our primal power as goddesses.

640
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:09,844
(applauding)

641
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:12,096
We need to teach men how to love
us

642
00:49:12,138 --> 00:49:14,890
using ways they can understand.

643
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:17,017
So goddesses, use perfume,

644
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,271
wear high heels and makeup,

645
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:24,567
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

646
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:28,654
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

647
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:31,615
Be a mother and a lover.

648
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:36,912
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

649
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:43,002
- Use sex magic to destroy his
fear of you

650
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:46,589
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

651
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,301
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

652
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:52,845
with all of your inner beauty.

653
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,264
Then, when his heart is open to
love,

654
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:58,267
you may do with him what you
will.

655
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:00,853
(lively music)

656
00:50:13,324 --> 00:50:16,035
(tinkling music)

657
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:21,916
- [Voiceover] I love you,
Elaine.

658
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:24,293
You know that, don't you?

659
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,380
I love you very much.

660
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:34,303
But you need to be more careful.

661
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:40,017
Dinner was late three times this
week.

662
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,270
And that house is a total
pigsty.

663
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:47,525
Do you know that I found an old
hot dog

664
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:49,818
under the bed this morning?

665
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,071
(laughing)

666
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,407
And why don't you ever brush
your hair?

667
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:59,578
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

668
00:51:00,746 --> 00:51:03,707
I'm embarrassed to have people
over.

669
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,377
I've been really patient up
until now,

670
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:09,213
but you need to step up your
game.

671
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,635
- [Voiceover] I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

672
00:51:14,677 --> 00:51:17,388
(laughing) What?

673
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:20,057
You're not crazy?

674
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,102
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

675
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:23,936
Which is it?

676
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:26,480
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

677
00:51:26,522 --> 00:51:28,732
And you could lose a few pounds.

678
00:51:28,774 --> 00:51:31,235
You're looking a little fatty.

679
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,196
(heavy breathing)

680
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:38,367
- [Voiceover] Oh my God, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

681
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,036
You have such a hot body now.

682
00:51:42,162 --> 00:51:45,332
Do you like it when I touch you
like this?

683
00:51:45,374 --> 00:51:46,417
Or like this?

684
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:49,128
(moaning)

685
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:51,422
I wanna make you come.

686
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:55,718
(moaning and heavy breathing)

687
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,928
- [Voiceover] Don't be
frightened, Elaine.

688
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,847
I would never hurt you.

689
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:02,433
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

690
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:07,104
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

691
00:52:07,146 --> 00:52:10,274
(ominous organ music)

692
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:48,312
- Hast thou the courage to make
the essay?

693
00:52:48,354 --> 00:52:52,483
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

694
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:00,366
(bell chiming)

695
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:08,248
(dramatic organ music)

696
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:14,380
- Assist me to erect the ancient
altar

697
00:53:14,755 --> 00:53:17,716
at which in days past all
worshiped.

698
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:23,180
For in the old times, a woman
was the altar.

699
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,643
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

700
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:30,979
of the circle, the origin of all
things.

701
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,902
Therefore, should we adore it.

702
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:41,865
(clanking)

703
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:44,034
(gasping)

704
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:50,582
(heavy breathing)

705
00:54:07,516 --> 00:54:09,643
- Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

706
00:54:09,685 --> 00:54:11,770
Congratulations on your
promotion.

707
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:13,188
- Thanks, Connie.

708
00:54:13,856 --> 00:54:15,482
Is there any coffee.

709
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,151
- Yeah, I just made some.

710
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:20,070
I made it just the way you like
it.

711
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,323
- Is there anything you don't do
well?

712
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:27,077
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

713
00:54:32,374 --> 00:54:34,126
- How's the coffee, Steve?

714
00:54:34,168 --> 00:54:35,544
- Uh, too strong.

715
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,424
- Well, I like it strong.

716
00:54:41,008 --> 00:54:44,261
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

717
00:54:44,303 --> 00:54:47,681
- Why, have you been keeping
late nights?

718
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:48,723
- Maybe so.

719
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,563
- But, now that you've been
promoted,

720
00:54:54,605 --> 00:54:57,608
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

721
00:54:57,649 --> 00:54:59,109
- Me, you kidding?

722
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:09,286
- Sergeant Meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

723
00:55:09,578 --> 00:55:11,038
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

724
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,209
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

725
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:16,960
- Yes, of course.

726
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,505
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

727
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,177
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

728
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:28,555
- Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

729
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:32,351
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

730
00:55:32,392 --> 00:55:35,354
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

731
00:55:35,938 --> 00:55:39,817
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

732
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:42,820
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

733
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:44,238
- Wayne used to spend weekends

734
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,074
up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

735
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:50,702
He used to take dates there.

736
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:53,205
(eerie music)

737
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,315
(eerie piano music)

738
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:25,571
- (Gasping) Oh, Jesus.

739
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:42,379
♫ La ♫

740
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:48,302
- Hey Griff, look.

741
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:50,721
- Good lord.

742
00:56:50,762 --> 00:56:54,057
♫ La ♫

743
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:01,481
- What the hell is this?

744
00:57:01,523 --> 00:57:03,442
♫ La ♫

745
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:04,693
- I don't know.

746
00:57:07,112 --> 00:57:09,156
(crying)

747
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:14,119
We're going to have to dig,
Steve.

748
00:57:14,161 --> 00:57:15,161
- I know.

749
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:21,293
♫ La ♫

750
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:23,313
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

751
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:25,380
(crying)

752
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:35,933
♫ La ♫

753
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:38,143
(eerie music)

754
00:57:38,185 --> 00:57:40,479
(shoveling)

755
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:51,072
- Mmm, mmm,

756
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:58,789
this cake is absolutely
fantastic.

757
00:57:59,247 --> 00:58:00,832
And what a great dinner.

758
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:01,874
- Thank you.

759
00:58:02,542 --> 00:58:03,835
I enjoy cooking.

760
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:07,965
Hope you don't mind my calling
you.

761
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,968
Sometimes it's so hard to be
alone.

762
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,052
- Not at all.

763
00:58:13,595 --> 00:58:17,724
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trish is out of town.

764
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:26,900
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

765
00:58:26,942 --> 00:58:29,111
- 10 years this September.

766
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:30,152
- 10 years!

767
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,657
It's really amazing.

768
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:39,830
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

769
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:49,214
- What about your husband?

770
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:51,842
- My husband never loved me.

771
00:58:51,883 --> 00:58:54,928
He couldn't wait to get away
from me.

772
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:56,762
- I'm sorry.

773
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:10,485
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

774
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:12,361
- Poor baby.

775
00:59:13,822 --> 00:59:15,115
Poor, poor baby.

776
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:48,231
So, tell me, what turns you on?

777
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:53,945
- (laughing) What turns me on?

778
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:57,449
Wow, no one's ever asked me that
before.

779
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:58,533
Let me think.

780
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:03,622
You know what really turns me
on?

781
01:00:03,914 --> 01:00:04,914
Flying.

782
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:06,624
- Flying?

783
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:08,794
- Yeah, flying a plane.

784
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,755
You don't know what kinda high
it is.

785
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:14,716
You're soarin' up there above
everything.

786
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:16,426
You're in control.

787
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:18,095
- Oh, how fantastic.

788
01:00:19,471 --> 01:00:20,680
- It really is.

789
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:25,894
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

790
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:30,065
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

791
01:00:34,736 --> 01:00:36,321
I feel like my life is slipping
away

792
01:00:36,363 --> 01:00:38,782
and there's so many things I
haven't done.

793
01:00:38,824 --> 01:00:39,824
- Like what?

794
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:41,660
- I've never had any sordid love
affairs

795
01:00:41,701 --> 01:00:43,995
or gotten into any mischief.

796
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:47,666
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

797
01:00:47,707 --> 01:00:50,919
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

798
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,561
and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those

799
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:56,716
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

800
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:01,930
Or those Westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

801
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:05,475
and then go visit the local
prostitutes.

802
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:07,519
It's sounds stupid, I know.

803
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:08,895
- No, it doesn't.

804
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:12,399
It's very sweet.

805
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:15,442
- Really?

806
01:01:17,445 --> 01:01:19,322
Trish doesn't think so.

807
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:23,201
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

808
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:26,872
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

809
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:29,416
I understand you perfectly.

810
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,501
- You do?

811
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:33,669
- Of course.

812
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:38,466
You wanna have a sordid love
affair.

813
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:42,095
You wanna get into some
mischief.

814
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:58,153
(mysterious music)

815
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:22,260
(moving to dramatic music)

816
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,891
(laughing)

817
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:30,769
(gong music)

818
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,731
(laughing)

819
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,651
(provocative music)

820
01:02:37,692 --> 01:02:38,692
- Uh.

821
01:02:56,503 --> 01:02:57,503
- Ho!

822
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:08,473
(horn music)

823
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,309
(laughing)

824
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:21,820
(screaming)

825
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:24,364
(laughing)

826
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,990
Who are you?

827
01:03:26,908 --> 01:03:28,952
What are you doing to me?

828
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,204
- I'm the love witch.

829
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:36,167
I'm your ultimate fantasy
(laughing).

830
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:37,627
- That's right.

831
01:03:37,669 --> 01:03:39,796
(grunting)

832
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:40,630
That's right.

833
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:42,882
(giggling)

834
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:50,015
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

835
01:03:50,056 --> 01:03:51,056
- Who?

836
01:03:51,224 --> 01:03:52,517
- Professor King.

837
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,270
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

838
01:03:55,312 --> 01:03:56,104
He might be able to help me

839
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:57,939
identify some of the items we
found.

840
01:03:57,981 --> 01:03:59,190
- It's great.

841
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:00,900
Did you get the lab report?

842
01:04:00,942 --> 01:04:04,571
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like
heart failure.

843
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:07,824
But the toxicology report
showed traces of Jimson weed

844
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:11,995
also known as Devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

845
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,247
- It's unbelievable.

846
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,207
You want me to come with you?

847
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:18,918
- No, this will only take a few
minutes.

848
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,546
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

849
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:22,881
- Mustard, mayo?

850
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:25,175
- Yeah and cole slaw.

851
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,593
Thanks.

852
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:27,634
- Done.

853
01:04:28,845 --> 01:04:31,306
(eerie music)

854
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,731
- Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

855
01:04:39,773 --> 01:04:42,233
- Glad to meet you, Professor.

856
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:47,947
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

857
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:52,118
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

858
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,703
- Interesting, yes.

859
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:57,082
(sniffing) Just as I thought.

860
01:04:57,123 --> 01:05:00,001
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

861
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:01,211
- A witch bottle?

862
01:05:01,252 --> 01:05:02,396
- Yes, witches used to make them

863
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,048
for protection against curses.

864
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:08,551
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

865
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:10,428
along with herbs and something
sharp

866
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:14,641
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

867
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,702
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearths

868
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:18,353
of very old houses.

869
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:21,064
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

870
01:05:21,106 --> 01:05:22,106
was a witch?

871
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:24,109
- It's very likely.

872
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,403
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

873
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,822
has taken root again in cities.

874
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:30,824
There have several rituals per
year.

875
01:05:30,865 --> 01:05:35,078
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

876
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,915
Other rituals celebrate
Summer Solstice, Litha,

877
01:05:38,957 --> 01:05:42,752
or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

878
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:48,800
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

879
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:51,636
in a mockery of Christian
rituals.

880
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:56,808
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices
a child.

881
01:05:58,184 --> 01:05:59,686
- Does this stuff really go on
today?

882
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:00,854
- Yes, indeed.

883
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:04,774
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

884
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:07,777
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

885
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:11,156
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

886
01:06:11,197 --> 01:06:13,491
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

887
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:15,618
but they've been unsuccessful.

888
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,787
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

889
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:20,248
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

890
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,418
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

891
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,628
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

892
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,130
of both black and white witches

893
01:06:27,172 --> 01:06:29,716
who practice the ancient rites.

894
01:07:00,705 --> 01:07:04,834
- I invoke and call upon
thee, Mighty Mother of us all.

895
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:10,673
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

896
01:07:12,217 --> 01:07:13,343
and priestess.

897
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,889
- Of the Mother Darksome and
Divine

898
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:20,475
here I charge you in this sign.

899
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:26,648
- Listen to the words of the
Great Mother.

900
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,858
(owl hooting)

901
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,320
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

902
01:07:32,362 --> 01:07:35,073
Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
Isis,

903
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:39,994
and by many other names.

904
01:07:40,912 --> 01:07:43,623
(owl hooting) (crickets
chirping)

905
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:46,042
- Whenever ye have need of
anything,

906
01:07:46,084 --> 01:07:50,213
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

907
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:53,508
who am Queen of all witches.

908
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:58,221
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

909
01:07:58,263 --> 01:07:59,263
all sorcery.

910
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,894
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

911
01:08:04,936 --> 01:08:08,815
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

912
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:12,986
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

913
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:20,743
(chanting in a foreign language)
Bagabi lacha bachabe.

914
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:26,207
Lamac cahi achababe.

915
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:30,461
Hurrahya! Hurrahya!

916
01:08:35,717 --> 01:08:36,717
- Arise.

917
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:40,471
(crickets chirping)

918
01:08:40,513 --> 01:08:44,559
(chanting in a foreign language)
Eko, Eko, Azarak

919
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:46,894
Eko, Eko, Zomelak

920
01:08:47,645 --> 01:08:49,606
Eko, Eko, Cernunnos

921
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:52,275
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

922
01:08:53,318 --> 01:08:55,778
(jazzy music)

923
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:20,309
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

924
01:09:20,345 --> 01:09:21,804
What's the matter?

925
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:27,185
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

926
01:09:27,518 --> 01:09:29,604
- Well, have a drink and relax.

927
01:09:29,646 --> 01:09:33,107
Nothing's that dire, at least
not for you.

928
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:37,487
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

929
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,365
- What victims?

930
01:09:40,406 --> 01:09:44,118
- There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

931
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,162
- Please, don't touch me.

932
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:53,503
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

933
01:09:53,544 --> 01:09:54,921
- Merry meet, Elaine.

934
01:09:54,962 --> 01:09:56,130
How's it going?

935
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,132
- I'm back in the dating pool
again.

936
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,467
- What happened?

937
01:10:00,301 --> 01:10:02,488
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

938
01:10:02,512 --> 01:10:03,805
the married man.

939
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,890
- No, I broke it off.

940
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:09,602
He just became really obsessive,
morose,

941
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:13,356
and his aura became really
murky.

942
01:10:14,315 --> 01:10:17,527
He didn't even wanna make love
anymore.

943
01:10:17,568 --> 01:10:21,698
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

944
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,075
There was no polarity.

945
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:26,619
But, I should have known.

946
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:27,787
He's a Pisces.

947
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:00,235
- Richard?

948
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:04,633
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

949
01:11:04,657 --> 01:11:06,033
when I'm working.

950
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:08,286
What do you want?

951
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:11,515
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

952
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,291
and I'm taking a pill.

953
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:33,686
Are you coming to bed?

954
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:34,978
- No.

955
01:11:40,902 --> 01:11:43,196
I have some more work to do.

956
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:49,243
- All right, see you tomorrow,
then.

957
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:57,168
(crying)

958
01:12:17,688 --> 01:12:20,316
(ominous music)

959
01:12:35,206 --> 01:12:37,041
(crying)

960
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:40,378
♫ La ♫

961
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,674
(crying)

962
01:12:48,386 --> 01:12:51,681
♫ La ♫

963
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,693
♫ La la la la ♫

964
01:13:23,754 --> 01:13:26,340
- Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

965
01:13:26,382 --> 01:13:28,384
I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

966
01:13:28,426 --> 01:13:29,426
- Okay.

967
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:42,106
- Does this look familiar to
you?

968
01:13:45,234 --> 01:13:46,986
- It's a witch bottle.

969
01:13:48,195 --> 01:13:50,281
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

970
01:13:50,323 --> 01:13:51,699
- No, no I don't.

971
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:57,830
- Ever seen any of these in here
before?

972
01:13:57,872 --> 01:13:59,957
- Yeah, we have some witch
bottles.

973
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,459
I'll show you one.

974
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:09,674
Here's one.

975
01:14:13,471 --> 01:14:15,264
- How common are these bottles?

976
01:14:15,306 --> 01:14:16,658
- I've never seen 'em in here
before until

977
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:19,560
a girl started supplying 'em to
us.

978
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:22,396
- Who is this girl?

979
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:26,651
- Her name is Elaine, Elaine
Parks.

980
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:30,863
(bubbling, clinking)

981
01:14:37,495 --> 01:14:40,706
(light rhythmic music)

982
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:46,963
(knocking)

983
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:54,844
- Who is it?

984
01:14:56,514 --> 01:14:59,642
- Sergeant Meadows, Police
Department.

985
01:15:04,855 --> 01:15:07,042
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

986
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:10,111
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

987
01:15:10,152 --> 01:15:11,195
- About what?

988
01:15:11,946 --> 01:15:14,407
- Well, it's a potential
homicide case.

989
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:16,158
Just a routine check.

990
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,662
I thought you might be able to
help us.

991
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:21,121
- Of course.

992
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,251
Please come in, Sergeant.

993
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:34,927
So you say there was a homicide.

994
01:15:35,344 --> 01:15:36,387
How horrible.

995
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,015
Who was killed?

996
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:41,267
- A man named Wayne Peters.

997
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:43,561
Did you know Wayne Peters?

998
01:15:43,602 --> 01:15:44,602
- No.

999
01:15:47,273 --> 01:15:49,275
- Here's a picture of him.

1000
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:50,818
Ever seen him before?

1001
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:51,860
- No.

1002
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,447
I guess I can't help you,
Sergeant.

1003
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:55,322
Good bye.

1004
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:56,824
- Ms. Parks, wait.

1005
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:07,376
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

1006
01:16:07,752 --> 01:16:09,587
- It's a Magic Bottle.

1007
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:11,005
I made it myself.

1008
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:15,134
- Have you ever seen one
containing urine?

1009
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:16,176
- Urine?

1010
01:16:17,386 --> 01:16:18,386
No.

1011
01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:33,152
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

1012
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:36,781
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

1013
01:16:36,822 --> 01:16:39,075
(fizzing)

1014
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:42,745
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, Sergeant?

1015
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,628
- Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

1016
01:16:51,003 --> 01:16:52,003
- Yes, I am.

1017
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:54,673
Is there a law against that?

1018
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:58,511
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

1019
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,805
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

1020
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:02,723
capable of murder even?

1021
01:17:03,516 --> 01:17:06,310
- No, I wasn't trying to
imply...

1022
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:09,522
- Sergeant Meadows, do
you know what it's like

1023
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:10,940
to really suffer?

1024
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,483
(sad music)

1025
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:13,943
You have to fight and fight

1026
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:17,071
until you're too exhausted to go
on.

1027
01:17:17,113 --> 01:17:20,074
Witchcraft is my religion,
Sergeant.

1028
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:24,870
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

1029
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:26,038
saved my life.

1030
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,668
(bubbling)

1031
01:17:35,005 --> 01:17:37,258
(sad music)

1032
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:44,390
- Ms. Parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

1033
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:48,144
I didn't realize.

1034
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:54,692
- That's all right, Sergeant
Meadows.

1035
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:59,029
(harp strumming)

1036
01:18:00,156 --> 01:18:02,116
- You can call me Griff.

1037
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,450
- Griff?

1038
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:07,580
(lightly romantic music)

1039
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:09,915
I know I've seen you before.

1040
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,627
I just don't know where.

1041
01:18:14,753 --> 01:18:16,964
- I have that same feeling.

1042
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:18,673
- I know.

1043
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:25,222
You're the man in the cards.

1044
01:18:26,599 --> 01:18:27,808
You're my fate.

1045
01:18:29,143 --> 01:18:31,937
- What do you mean, I'm your
fate?

1046
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:35,024
- I did a Celtic Cross reading.

1047
01:18:35,065 --> 01:18:38,444
For my future card I got Knight
of Wands.

1048
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:44,783
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

1049
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:48,329
I would soon meet the man
that I'm going to marry.

1050
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:52,166
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

1051
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:54,418
Do you like animals, Griff?

1052
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,046
- Why yes, I love animals.

1053
01:18:57,963 --> 01:19:00,007
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

1054
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:01,634
I'm very fond of.

1055
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:04,303
You know, tomorrow is my day off

1056
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:07,973
and it's supposed to be quite
nice out.

1057
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:12,019
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

1058
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:14,355
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

1059
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:21,195
(gentle orchestral music)

1060
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:43,925
Whoa.

1061
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:12,329
- Oh Patchouli, you're such a
sweetheart.

1062
01:20:23,007 --> 01:20:24,300
- How's my girl?

1063
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:26,510
- Am I your girl?

1064
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,721
- For today you are.

1065
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,449
You're my girl and there's
nobody around

1066
01:20:31,473 --> 01:20:33,183
to tell me otherwise.

1067
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:36,102
- Except me.

1068
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:39,023
- And what's that supposed to
mean?

1069
01:20:39,064 --> 01:20:42,276
- (chuckling) Nothing.

1070
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:45,070
Kiss me.

1071
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:49,450
(flute music)

1072
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:57,333
- What's that sound?

1073
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,084
- I don't know.

1074
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,502
Let's go see.

1075
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:03,255
(horse snorting)

1076
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:12,181
(laughing)

1077
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:11,949
(applauding)

1078
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:18,497
(Medieval string and wind music)

1079
01:22:23,961 --> 01:22:27,464
- Now is the time of the Summer
Solstice.

1080
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:30,592
The strength of the Oak King is
waning.

1081
01:22:30,634 --> 01:22:33,762
And the Holly King stands
ready to challenge him

1082
01:22:33,804 --> 01:22:36,515
for the hand of the Green
Maiden.

1083
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:40,352
- Let the battle begin.

1084
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:47,359
- Your season is over old man.

1085
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:48,193
(clattering)

1086
01:22:48,235 --> 01:22:49,235
- Oh never.

1087
01:22:51,655 --> 01:22:53,866
(grunting)

1088
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:57,744
- [Voiceover] I will have her.

1089
01:22:57,786 --> 01:22:58,847
- [Voiceover] Never have her.

1090
01:22:58,871 --> 01:22:59,663
(laughing)

1091
01:22:59,705 --> 01:23:00,497
- Never.

1092
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:02,875
(yelling)

1093
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:04,918
(applauding)

1094
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,463
- Holly King, I name you the
victor.

1095
01:23:07,504 --> 01:23:09,506
The Green Maiden is yours.

1096
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:10,548
- M'lady.

1097
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:12,050
(laughing)

1098
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:13,092
Come on.

1099
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:20,516
- Elaine.

1100
01:23:21,477 --> 01:23:22,853
- You know these people?

1101
01:23:22,895 --> 01:23:24,646
- Well yes, in a way.

1102
01:23:24,688 --> 01:23:26,899
- All hail, fair Lord and Lady.

1103
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,901
Welcome to our little gathering.

1104
01:23:28,942 --> 01:23:29,942
- All hail.

1105
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:32,714
- We are the good people
of the Renaissance

1106
01:23:32,738 --> 01:23:36,867
and Medieval players and we
are celebrating the Midsummer.

1107
01:23:36,909 --> 01:23:38,368
Won't you join us?

1108
01:23:38,744 --> 01:23:40,954
- To be sure, fair consorts.

1109
01:23:48,587 --> 01:23:50,339
- They are charming, are they
not?

1110
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,174
- Yes, quite charming.

1111
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:55,135
- I see two people in love.

1112
01:23:55,177 --> 01:23:57,387
This calls for a wedding.

1113
01:23:57,429 --> 01:23:58,388
- A wedding?

1114
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,641
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you
will.

1115
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:02,809
To honor the gods of love.

1116
01:24:03,435 --> 01:24:06,563
(cheering and applauding)

1117
01:24:06,605 --> 01:24:09,066
(flute music)

1118
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:14,363
♫ Love is a magical thing

1119
01:24:14,863 --> 01:24:18,992
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

1120
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:23,580
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

1121
01:24:23,622 --> 01:24:27,751
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

1122
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:34,383
♫ Love is a magical thing

1123
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:38,971
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

1124
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:43,225
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

1125
01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:47,229
♫ But pretending is also real

1126
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,485
♫ There's a lady in a castle

1127
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:56,822
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

1128
01:24:56,863 --> 01:25:00,701
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

1129
01:25:00,742 --> 01:25:03,912
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

1130
01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:06,790
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

1131
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:10,419
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

1132
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,714
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

1133
01:25:13,755 --> 01:25:17,301
♫ Just to have you near me

1134
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:22,431
♫ Love is a magical thing

1135
01:25:23,473 --> 01:25:27,603
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

1136
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:32,107
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

1137
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:36,278
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫

1138
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:46,330
(applauding)

1139
01:25:47,623 --> 01:25:49,833
(giggling)

1140
01:26:00,594 --> 01:26:02,012
(laughing)

1141
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:04,431
(flute and string music)

1142
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:05,265
(giggling)

1143
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:06,307
- Okay.

1144
01:26:11,605 --> 01:26:13,815
(giggling)

1145
01:26:15,984 --> 01:26:18,195
(laughing)

1146
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:35,045
(romantic Medieval music)

1147
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:29,683
- Now, ye are wed.

1148
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:32,978
(applauding)

1149
01:27:33,019 --> 01:27:36,982
(flute, horn, and string music)

1150
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:41,153
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

1151
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:14,853
- [Voiceover] I'm not in love.

1152
01:28:14,895 --> 01:28:16,730
It's not that I don't have
sentiment,

1153
01:28:16,772 --> 01:28:18,648
it's just that love is soft.

1154
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,734
You need guts in this business.

1155
01:28:20,776 --> 01:28:23,045
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

1156
01:28:23,069 --> 01:28:24,696
and got soft inside.

1157
01:28:25,322 --> 01:28:26,990
I want an heir some day

1158
01:28:27,032 --> 01:28:28,617
and then I would need to have a
wife,

1159
01:28:28,658 --> 01:28:30,827
but love is something else.

1160
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:33,663
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

1161
01:28:33,705 --> 01:28:36,249
It's like he's not even a man
anymore.

1162
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,502
I never wanna get like that.

1163
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:42,297
- [Voiceover] When you really
love him,

1164
01:28:42,339 --> 01:28:46,009
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

1165
01:28:46,802 --> 01:28:48,929
You love all the little quirks
about him.

1166
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,348
The way he slurps his cereal.

1167
01:28:52,349 --> 01:28:54,684
The way his mouth is a little
crooked.

1168
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:58,814
Those details about him
become your whole life.

1169
01:28:58,855 --> 01:29:02,400
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

1170
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:06,446
and you realize that you
have more love to give

1171
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:09,366
than you ever thought was
possible.

1172
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:12,494
'Cause the more you know him,

1173
01:29:13,745 --> 01:29:15,539
the more you love him.

1174
01:29:16,915 --> 01:29:18,518
- [Voiceover] The more
you get to know a woman,

1175
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:21,127
the less you can feel about her.

1176
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:23,713
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

1177
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:27,050
who fulfills all you're wildest
fantasies.

1178
01:29:27,092 --> 01:29:30,095
Then she starts to reveal little
flaws

1179
01:29:30,136 --> 01:29:34,015
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

1180
01:29:34,057 --> 01:29:37,602
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

1181
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:41,481
No woman could ever fulfill it.

1182
01:29:41,523 --> 01:29:44,651
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

1183
01:29:44,693 --> 01:29:48,655
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

1184
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:51,700
drowning in estrogen.

1185
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:54,995
The most awful feeling.

1186
01:30:03,295 --> 01:30:05,463
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

1187
01:30:05,505 --> 01:30:07,799
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

1188
01:30:09,759 --> 01:30:11,052
Some other time.

1189
01:30:17,267 --> 01:30:18,411
- Hey Griff, I got more
information

1190
01:30:18,435 --> 01:30:20,020
on that Elaine Parks girl.

1191
01:30:20,061 --> 01:30:22,314
- You leave it on my desk.

1192
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:23,565
- Don't you wanna hear it?

1193
01:30:23,607 --> 01:30:26,985
- Steve, Captain wants
us to lay off the case.

1194
01:30:27,027 --> 01:30:28,403
- Are you serious?

1195
01:30:28,445 --> 01:30:32,073
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1196
01:30:32,115 --> 01:30:34,492
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1197
01:30:34,534 --> 01:30:36,328
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

1198
01:30:36,369 --> 01:30:38,163
- Even if they murder?

1199
01:30:39,456 --> 01:30:40,850
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

1200
01:30:40,874 --> 01:30:42,417
was a heart attack.

1201
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:44,210
I think so too.

1202
01:30:48,006 --> 01:30:50,508
- Has everyone gone crazy around
here?

1203
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:53,678
Let me at least tell you what I
found.

1204
01:30:58,642 --> 01:31:01,394
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1205
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:03,396
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1206
01:31:03,438 --> 01:31:05,148
Two years later they were
divorced

1207
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:06,733
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1208
01:31:06,775 --> 01:31:08,902
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1209
01:31:08,944 --> 01:31:12,364
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1210
01:31:19,788 --> 01:31:21,998
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1211
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,668
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1212
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:28,838
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1213
01:31:29,631 --> 01:31:33,218
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1214
01:31:33,259 --> 01:31:34,803
The police questioned Elaine

1215
01:31:34,844 --> 01:31:37,597
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1216
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:40,392
- Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1217
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:42,352
what happened there is
none of our business.

1218
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:44,062
- Are you serious?

1219
01:31:44,104 --> 01:31:46,523
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1220
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:48,608
and you better watch her.

1221
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:51,277
- You mean because she's a
witch?

1222
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:53,154
That doesn't mean anything.

1223
01:31:53,196 --> 01:31:57,200
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1224
01:31:57,242 --> 01:31:58,636
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters

1225
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,370
got the Devil's weed?

1226
01:32:01,287 --> 01:32:03,665
- I questioned Ms. Curtis about
that.

1227
01:32:03,707 --> 01:32:06,626
There was Devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1228
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:09,337
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1229
01:32:09,379 --> 01:32:11,464
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1230
01:32:11,506 --> 01:32:12,841
We have a possible murder here

1231
01:32:12,882 --> 01:32:15,510
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1232
01:32:15,552 --> 01:32:17,887
- I told you, we're laying off
her.

1233
01:32:17,929 --> 01:32:20,640
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1234
01:32:20,682 --> 01:32:22,058
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1235
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,435
Get the hell off my back.

1236
01:32:23,476 --> 01:32:25,687
(punching)

1237
01:32:28,815 --> 01:32:32,527
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1238
01:32:35,697 --> 01:32:38,324
(ominous music)

1239
01:33:05,268 --> 01:33:07,479
(water running)

1240
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,520
- Richard.

1241
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:12,066
Richard!

1242
01:33:12,776 --> 01:33:13,568
(knocking)

1243
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:14,610
Richard!

1244
01:33:15,028 --> 01:33:16,028
Richard!

1245
01:33:16,613 --> 01:33:19,365
(water trickling)

1246
01:33:29,459 --> 01:33:30,585
(gasping)

1247
01:33:30,627 --> 01:33:33,505
(ominous organ music)

1248
01:33:33,546 --> 01:33:35,840
(screaming)

1249
01:33:40,136 --> 01:33:41,930
(ominous organ music)

1250
01:33:41,971 --> 01:33:43,973
(crying)

1251
01:33:45,892 --> 01:33:48,853
(gentle harp music)

1252
01:34:03,243 --> 01:34:05,286
- Thank you for meeting me,
Elaine.

1253
01:34:05,328 --> 01:34:08,206
It's not good for me to be alone
too much.

1254
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:09,791
I know you're busy.

1255
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:10,833
- Of course.

1256
01:34:11,417 --> 01:34:12,794
I wanted to come.

1257
01:34:15,046 --> 01:34:18,758
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1258
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,010
- You can't blame yourself.

1259
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:24,013
You were a good wife to Richard.

1260
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,933
- I tried to be.

1261
01:34:29,144 --> 01:34:31,604
I tried so hard to please him,

1262
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:34,941
but I should have tried harder.

1263
01:34:34,983 --> 01:34:39,112
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1264
01:34:41,739 --> 01:34:43,449
Maybe you were right.

1265
01:34:44,033 --> 01:34:47,328
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1266
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:52,876
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1267
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:55,336
Maybe I was being naive,

1268
01:34:55,879 --> 01:34:59,174
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1269
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:02,427
But now, now I wish...

1270
01:35:07,182 --> 01:35:10,310
- You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1271
01:35:10,643 --> 01:35:12,187
You have to let go.

1272
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:16,858
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1273
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:20,361
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1274
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:23,364
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1275
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:27,118
I hated him so much for that.

1276
01:35:28,077 --> 01:35:30,288
I wanted to kill them both.

1277
01:35:30,997 --> 01:35:35,126
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1278
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,172
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1279
01:35:39,756 --> 01:35:43,885
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1280
01:35:45,428 --> 01:35:46,428
- Hey,

1281
01:35:47,388 --> 01:35:48,388
hey.

1282
01:35:50,642 --> 01:35:52,101
- Enough about me.

1283
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:55,897
What's going on with you?

1284
01:35:55,939 --> 01:35:57,649
- Trish, I'm in love.

1285
01:36:01,277 --> 01:36:02,277
- Who is he?

1286
01:36:02,612 --> 01:36:05,740
- He's a detective and he's
everything

1287
01:36:06,032 --> 01:36:07,951
a woman could ever want.

1288
01:36:09,077 --> 01:36:12,455
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1289
01:36:15,124 --> 01:36:17,585
I just know that he's the one.

1290
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,797
He even gave me this ring.

1291
01:36:21,089 --> 01:36:23,049
I call it my magic ring.

1292
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:25,051
It's not an engagement ring

1293
01:36:25,093 --> 01:36:29,222
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1294
01:36:44,946 --> 01:36:45,905
- When we first came here

1295
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:49,409
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1296
01:36:51,703 --> 01:36:53,329
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1297
01:36:53,371 --> 01:36:54,747
It's too painful.

1298
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:00,128
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1299
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:03,589
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1300
01:37:03,631 --> 01:37:05,341
The first day we met,

1301
01:37:06,676 --> 01:37:09,512
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1302
01:37:09,554 --> 01:37:11,431
and you were all alone.

1303
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:14,100
Now it's the reverse.

1304
01:37:15,935 --> 01:37:17,895
Life is funny, isn't it?

1305
01:37:20,606 --> 01:37:23,359
- Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta
go.

1306
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:26,279
Would you like to walk out with
me?

1307
01:37:26,571 --> 01:37:30,033
- No, I'd like to stay and
finish my tea.

1308
01:37:30,074 --> 01:37:31,074
- All right.

1309
01:37:34,078 --> 01:37:35,371
Take care, love.

1310
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:38,541
(light harp music)

1311
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:48,551
(sighing)

1312
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:09,530
(beeping)

1313
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,580
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1314
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:20,083
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1315
01:38:20,124 --> 01:38:23,544
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1316
01:38:23,586 --> 01:38:25,213
See you in a minute.

1317
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:27,632
(beeping)

1318
01:39:10,383 --> 01:39:13,094
(tinkling music)

1319
01:39:46,335 --> 01:39:48,004
♫ La

1320
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:53,342
♫ la la la la la

1321
01:39:59,724 --> 01:40:03,853
♫ La la la la la ♫

1322
01:40:38,429 --> 01:40:41,224
(chimes tinkling)

1323
01:41:12,713 --> 01:41:15,341
(ominous music)

1324
01:42:48,184 --> 01:42:51,562
(dramatic pulsing music)

1325
01:43:45,282 --> 01:43:47,576
(screaming)

1326
01:43:48,744 --> 01:43:49,744
- You bitch.

1327
01:43:50,371 --> 01:43:51,580
(slapping)

1328
01:43:51,622 --> 01:43:53,416
You killed my husband.

1329
01:43:57,461 --> 01:43:59,088
Bitch, skank, whore.

1330
01:44:02,675 --> 01:44:04,719
(crying)

1331
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:15,521
You'll burn for this.

1332
01:44:25,865 --> 01:44:27,658
- Crash, crash, crash.

1333
01:44:29,285 --> 01:44:33,414
Die, die, die.

1334
01:44:33,956 --> 01:44:37,334
(chanting in a foreign language)
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1335
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,213
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1336
01:44:41,255 --> 01:44:44,925
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

1337
01:44:44,967 --> 01:44:49,013
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1338
01:44:49,054 --> 01:44:53,017
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1339
01:44:55,978 --> 01:44:57,730
(bell ringing)

1340
01:45:03,652 --> 01:45:06,280
(ominous music)

1341
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:19,877
(bubbling)

1342
01:45:21,879 --> 01:45:24,256
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1343
01:45:25,382 --> 01:45:27,510
with a heady lovers' brew.

1344
01:45:28,302 --> 01:45:31,013
Even should they strive to flee

1345
01:45:31,055 --> 01:45:33,599
they'll cling for all eternity.

1346
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:46,444
- Scotch.

1347
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:48,948
(applauding)

1348
01:45:49,323 --> 01:45:51,951
(ominous music)

1349
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,172
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1350
01:46:06,215 --> 01:46:09,635
(cheering and applauding)

1351
01:46:12,012 --> 01:46:13,973
Who are those new girls?

1352
01:46:14,431 --> 01:46:16,600
They can't dance at all.

1353
01:46:16,642 --> 01:46:18,102
And they're weird.

1354
01:46:23,148 --> 01:46:27,278
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1355
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:29,405
- They're friends of the
witches.

1356
01:46:29,446 --> 01:46:31,657
I seen them come in together
before.

1357
01:46:31,699 --> 01:46:33,325
- Yeah, the witches.

1358
01:46:34,785 --> 01:46:36,328
They're everywhere.

1359
01:46:37,329 --> 01:46:38,497
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1360
01:46:38,539 --> 01:46:40,666
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1361
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:42,293
- Did you read about the teacher

1362
01:46:42,334 --> 01:46:44,837
buried in the back yard of his
cabin?

1363
01:46:44,879 --> 01:46:47,131
They said it was done by the
witches.

1364
01:46:47,172 --> 01:46:48,632
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1365
01:46:48,674 --> 01:46:51,802
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1366
01:46:51,844 --> 01:46:54,096
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1367
01:46:54,138 --> 01:46:55,138
Creepy.

1368
01:46:56,849 --> 01:47:00,269
(applauding and cheering)

1369
01:47:10,613 --> 01:47:12,948
(jazzy music)

1370
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:14,533
- Sit down, Elaine.

1371
01:47:22,124 --> 01:47:25,336
Elaine, the DNA came back from
the lab.

1372
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:30,466
It connects you with Wayne
Peters.

1373
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:33,093
(jazzy music)

1374
01:47:33,135 --> 01:47:35,763
Patricia Manning came by the
station.

1375
01:47:35,804 --> 01:47:37,514
With some things of yours.

1376
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:40,601
Including this.

1377
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:46,273
She said you drove her husband
to suicide.

1378
01:47:49,735 --> 01:47:51,612
- So, I was a bad girl.

1379
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:54,531
Are you going to punish me?

1380
01:47:56,325 --> 01:47:59,453
- What sort of person are you,
Elaine?

1381
01:47:59,495 --> 01:48:03,123
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1382
01:48:03,624 --> 01:48:05,668
- Why are you so negative?

1383
01:48:05,709 --> 01:48:07,419
I didn't kill anyone.

1384
01:48:08,128 --> 01:48:10,339
Wayne died of heart failure

1385
01:48:10,839 --> 01:48:13,968
after a beautiful night of
lovemaking.

1386
01:48:14,551 --> 01:48:18,514
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1387
01:48:18,555 --> 01:48:21,225
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1388
01:48:21,266 --> 01:48:23,602
that they were experiencing with
me.

1389
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:26,230
- Are you saying these men died
of love?

1390
01:48:26,271 --> 01:48:27,398
That's insane.

1391
01:48:28,107 --> 01:48:31,276
What about the spells and the
drugs?

1392
01:48:31,318 --> 01:48:33,821
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1393
01:48:33,862 --> 01:48:37,783
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1394
01:48:37,825 --> 01:48:40,828
It can only work with
what's already there.

1395
01:48:40,869 --> 01:48:44,498
I just use sex magic to create
love magic.

1396
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:48,127
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1397
01:48:48,168 --> 01:48:51,255
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1398
01:48:51,296 --> 01:48:52,296
- Love?

1399
01:48:53,507 --> 01:48:55,801
What do you know about love?

1400
01:48:56,176 --> 01:49:00,305
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1401
01:49:01,223 --> 01:49:02,223
or worse.

1402
01:49:03,017 --> 01:49:04,601
- Don't diagnose me.

1403
01:49:05,519 --> 01:49:08,897
Maybe you're a narcissist who
can't love.

1404
01:49:10,107 --> 01:49:11,734
You think that I'm sick

1405
01:49:11,775 --> 01:49:14,945
because you've never loved like
I have.

1406
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:18,282
Well, I would do anything for
love.

1407
01:49:20,367 --> 01:49:24,079
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1408
01:49:25,164 --> 01:49:28,250
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1409
01:49:28,292 --> 01:49:30,169
it's not enough for you.

1410
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:32,254
You're like a bottomless hole.

1411
01:49:32,296 --> 01:49:36,425
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford Wife thing

1412
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,554
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1413
01:49:40,596 --> 01:49:44,683
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1414
01:49:47,352 --> 01:49:48,729
I don't love you.

1415
01:49:55,194 --> 01:49:56,987
- How can you stand there and
boast

1416
01:49:57,029 --> 01:49:59,239
about being immune to love?

1417
01:49:59,865 --> 01:50:03,994
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1418
01:50:04,578 --> 01:50:07,956
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1419
01:50:07,998 --> 01:50:10,918
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1420
01:50:10,959 --> 01:50:14,588
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1421
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:19,718
If you would just love us for
ourselves,

1422
01:50:22,429 --> 01:50:23,555
but you won't.

1423
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,227
My ex-husband was just like you.

1424
01:50:29,144 --> 01:50:33,273
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1425
01:50:33,732 --> 01:50:37,277
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1426
01:50:38,278 --> 01:50:41,406
except when men wanted to use my
body.

1427
01:50:42,991 --> 01:50:45,869
So, I decided to find my own
power.

1428
01:50:46,745 --> 01:50:50,207
And I found that power through
witchcraft.

1429
01:50:51,416 --> 01:50:54,044
That means that I take
what I need from men

1430
01:50:54,086 --> 01:50:56,463
and not the other way around.

1431
01:50:59,383 --> 01:51:01,009
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1432
01:51:03,637 --> 01:51:05,597
It won't work this time.

1433
01:51:06,849 --> 01:51:09,560
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1434
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:10,601
- What for?

1435
01:51:12,146 --> 01:51:15,440
Marrying a lover according to my
religion?

1436
01:51:15,482 --> 01:51:17,359
Seducing a married man?

1437
01:51:18,443 --> 01:51:20,362
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned

1438
01:51:20,404 --> 01:51:23,448
for a thing like that, but not
today.

1439
01:51:26,785 --> 01:51:28,162
- No, not burned,

1440
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:35,169
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1441
01:51:36,086 --> 01:51:38,046
and we'll find out more.

1442
01:51:39,506 --> 01:51:43,302
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1443
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:47,848
- Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live.

1444
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:50,100
(grunting)

1445
01:51:50,934 --> 01:51:52,436
(screaming)

1446
01:51:52,477 --> 01:51:54,897
- Burn the witch.

1447
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,106
- [All] Burn the witch.

1448
01:51:56,148 --> 01:51:58,275
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1449
01:51:58,317 --> 01:52:05,073
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1450
01:52:05,157 --> 01:52:11,705
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1451
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:16,460
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1452
01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:21,757
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1453
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:27,679
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1454
01:52:27,763 --> 01:52:34,061
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1455
01:52:34,144 --> 01:52:36,355
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1456
01:52:36,396 --> 01:52:39,650
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1457
01:52:39,691 --> 01:52:42,653
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1458
01:52:42,694 --> 01:52:46,573
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1459
01:52:47,658 --> 01:52:48,492
- Burn!

1460
01:52:48,533 --> 01:52:49,326
- Burn her.

1461
01:52:49,368 --> 01:52:50,160
- Burn.

1462
01:52:50,202 --> 01:52:51,202
Burn.

1463
01:53:16,687 --> 01:53:17,687
- Poor baby.

1464
01:53:18,772 --> 01:53:20,065
Poor, poor baby.

1465
01:53:26,113 --> 01:53:29,074
Don't worry, everything will be
okay

1466
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:33,578
because I love you so much.

1467

1471
01:54:26,381 --> 01:54:29,092

I've never loved anyone but you.

1484
01:56:30,589 --> 01:56:32,215
I want to marry you.
