1
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:03,150
[Sally] Customers.

2
00:00:03,223 --> 00:00:06,681
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,125
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

4
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:11,027
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

5
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:13,657
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,260
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

7
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,999
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

8
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:24,476
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

9
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:27,206
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,249
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

11
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:32,580
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

12
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:33,676
How can we help you?

13
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:37,814
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:41,122
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

15
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,628
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

16
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:46,530
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

17
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:49,659
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

18
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:53,797
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

19
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:55,568
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

20
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,839
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

21
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:02,245
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

22
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,647
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

23
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:07,050
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,283
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

25
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:14,087
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,618
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

27
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:21,633
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

28
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:22,861
No we just topped off.

29
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:26,804
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

30
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,341
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

31
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,742
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

32
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:35,975
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

33
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:38,347
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

34
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:39,749
Maybe ghost flames!

35
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,379
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

36
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:46,357
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

37
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:49,452
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

38
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,019
Ow!

39
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:54,294
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

40
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:56,627
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

41
00:01:56,703 --> 00:02:00,195
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

42
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:03,867
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

43
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,207
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

44
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:09,373
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

45
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,610
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

46
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,346
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,887
No, not really. But listen.

48
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:19,584
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

49
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,184
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

50
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:26,096
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

51
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,330
- [Locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:33,270
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

53
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:36,502
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

54
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:38,669
I'm becoming one of them!

55
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:40,474
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

56
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,674
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

57
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,512
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

58
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:47,451
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,250
- That's good.
...after a Piston Cup update.

60
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:54,225
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

61
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:57,752
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

62
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:00,994
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

63
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,833
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

64
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:06,371
[Electronic music]

65
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,202
[Laughing]

66
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:10,071
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

67
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:16,137
Ha-ha!

68
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:20,975
Yeah!

69
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,348
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

70
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:32,527
[Girls chattering and giggling]

71
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,931
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

72
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:37,232
[Gasping] Oh!

73
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:38,668
Let me get this straight.

74
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,673
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

75
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,472
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

76
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:46,637
I got a road to finish.

77
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:50,347
[Grunting and revving]

78
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,891
- He's done!
- Done?

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,326
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

80
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:08,598
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

81
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:11,535
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

82
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:15,801
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

83
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:17,968
Oh!

84
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:22,008
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

85
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:25,706
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

86
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,310
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

87
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,680
Red.

88
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,625
Who do you think you are?

89
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:38,994
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

90
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:42,501
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

91
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:45,036
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

92
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,733
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

93
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,298
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

94
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:54,608
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

95
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:58,481
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

96
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,917
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

97
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:03,683
If I win, you do the road my way.

98
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,280
Doc, what're you doin'?

99
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,489
I don't mean to be rude here,

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,291
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

101
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,889
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

102
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:18,631
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

103
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,898
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

104
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:27,470
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

105
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:30,482
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

106
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,075
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

107
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:38,283
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

108
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:40,121
and no lollygaggin'.

109
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:41,751
Speed. I'm speed.

110
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,388
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

111
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,488
[Luigi laughs]

112
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:50,432
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

113
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:53,028
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

114
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,973
The race is only one lap, guys.

115
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,533
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

116
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,445
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

117
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,618
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,711
Gentlemen...

119
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:13,189
...start your engines!

120
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,989
[Engine sputters]

121
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,898
[Revving furiously]

122
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:22,332
- IHijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

123
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:25,496
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

124
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:27,169
Luigi?

125
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,437
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

126
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,740
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

127
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:38,512
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

128
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:40,944
[Giggling]

129
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,455
[Cheering]

130
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:48,324
Huh?

131
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:51,486
Doc... the flag means go.

132
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:54,897
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

133
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,697
Doc, what are you doing, man?

134
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,331
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

135
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:04,535
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

136
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,374
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

137
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:10,515
You got your tow cable?

138
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,778
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

139
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,150
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

140
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,891
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

141
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,694
No, no, no, no, no!

142
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,234
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

143
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,268
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

144
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,772
[Revving]

145
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:42,438
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

146
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,881
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

147
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,044
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

148
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,317
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

149
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:55,958
[Gasps] Ah!

150
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:59,665
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

151
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,860
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

152
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:07,906
I can make a little turn on dirt.

153
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:09,407
You think?

154
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:13,935
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

155
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,481
Hey, ese!
You need a new paint job, man!

156
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:19,518
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

157
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,951
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

158
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:26,481
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

159
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,151
Nah, not me, Flo.

160
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:30,695
I'm on one of them there special diets.

161
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:35,359
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

162
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:38,199
"You race like you fix roads."

163
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:43,038
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!

164
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:55,718
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

165
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:59,417
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

166
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,186
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

167
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:05,992
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

168
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:09,091
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

169
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:15,437
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

170
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,545
Wow.

171
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,584
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

172
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:36,856
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

173
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,954
Yes! Uh, amazing!

174
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:43,061
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

175
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:47,333
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

176
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,966
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

177
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:54,172
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

178
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,442
[Italian] E bellissima! It's beautiful!

179
00:09:56,515 --> 00:10:00,246
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

180
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,484
Boy, I tell you what.

181
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:05,388
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

182
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,119
Doc, look at this!

183
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,127
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

184
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:13,688
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

185
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,735
Guido, look at Luigi!

186
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,065
This is fantastico!

187
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:22,596
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

188
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:26,975
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

189
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,343
That crazy old devil woman.

190
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:34,217
[Sighs] Oh!

191
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,118
She's right!

192
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,746
- Ah!
- Guido!

193
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:41,589
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

194
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:46,662
Well, now... where the heck is he?

195
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,735
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

196
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:59,175
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

197
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:01,611
and asked me if he could
come down here.

198
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:04,081
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

199
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,983
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

200
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,978
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

201
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:16,150
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

202
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,627
I'll keep an eye on him.

203
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:21,599
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

204
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,067
[Engine revving]

205
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,433
[Screaming]

206
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:35,240
[Spitting]

207
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,449
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

208
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:41,247
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

209
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,653
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

210
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:48,216
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

211
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:51,354
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

212
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,524
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

213
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,261
I'll put it simple.

214
00:11:56,335 --> 00:12:00,499
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

215
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:06,978
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

216
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,843
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

217
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:12,509
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

218
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:18,722
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

219
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,790
[Groans]

220
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,299
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

221
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:31,559
Hmm...

222
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:32,695
Whoa!

223
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:36,507
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

224
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:40,935
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

225
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,882
[Screaming] Ow!

226
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:50,584
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

227
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:53,750
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

228
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:57,227
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

229
00:12:57,296 --> 00:13:01,232
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

230
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:11,668
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

231
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:16,113
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

232
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:18,640
[Grunts, passes gas]

233
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:20,708
Oh, Lord.

234
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,413
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

235
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,649
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

236
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:28,022
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

237
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,926
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

238
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,464
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

239
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,228
[Groaning] Oh...

240
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,964
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

241
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,598
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

242
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:44,939
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

243
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,308
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

244
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,404
You make-a such a nice new road.

245
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:52,144
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

246
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:53,810
Even though you not a Ferrari.

247
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:57,982
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

248
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:01,925
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

249
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:05,521
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

250
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:09,159
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

251
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:12,693
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

252
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:14,432
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

253
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:16,634
Ramone, Ramone!

254
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,802
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

255
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:21,870
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

256
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:25,576
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

257
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:30,350
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

258
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:33,289
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

259
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,621
[Exhales deeply]

260
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:35,853
Ah!

261
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:38,055
Stop! Let me...

262
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:42,298
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

263
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,393
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

264
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,803
Stop, stop! That's cold!

265
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,364
Help! Please! Stop!

266
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:53,809
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

267
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:56,309
What was that for?

268
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:58,509
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

269
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,074
If you do, you gotta be clean.

270
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,677
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

271
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,484
What, I? I don't get it.

272
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:07,151
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

273
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:10,457
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

274
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,159
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

275
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:19,102
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

276
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:21,571
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

277
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,905
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

278
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:28,174
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

279
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:31,705
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

280
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:35,914
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

281
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:39,355
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

282
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:43,089
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

283
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,531
Cone number one, if you want.

284
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,999
Oh...

285
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,867
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

286
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,034
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

287
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,271
[Both chuckle]

288
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,946
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

289
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:06,644
Gonna... Yeah.

290
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,984
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

291
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,549
Good-lookin' girl.

292
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:18,927
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

293
00:16:18,998 --> 00:16:22,490
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

294
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:26,070
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

295
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:30,268
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

296
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:34,506
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

297
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,141
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

298
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:40,515
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

299
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,349
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

300
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:45,413
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

301
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:47,823
I can handle anything.

302
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:52,728
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

303
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:56,525
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

304
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:59,036
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

305
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:03,097
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

306
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,006
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

307
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:07,979
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

308
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,480
Wait, Mater!

309
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,615
OK, here's what you do.

310
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:16,086
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

311
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,646
And they do the rest. Watch this.

312
00:17:25,698 --> 00:17:27,529
- [Honking loudly]
- Oh!

313
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,798
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

314
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:36,671
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

315
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:39,643
[Laughing loudly]

316
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:42,840
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

317
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:46,715
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

318
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,379
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

319
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:54,951
- [Honking]
- Oh!

320
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:58,622
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

321
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:01,598
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

322
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:05,660
[Laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

323
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:07,501
Oh, your turn, bud.

324
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,973
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

325
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,272
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

326
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:13,333
[Clucking]

327
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:16,813
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

328
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,099
That's Frank.

329
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,195

Well, we better get you

350
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:41,968
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

351
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,943
Yeah, you probably right.

- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

362
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:10,202
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

363
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:15,176
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

364
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:18,374
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

373
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:54,952
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

374
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,490
Just need to know where I've been.

375
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:02,692
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?

376
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,760
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.

377
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,070
[Chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

378
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:13,669
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

379
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:18,912
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

380
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,318
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

381
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,415
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

382
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:28,053
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,

No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.

385
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,329
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

386
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,769
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?

387
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:44,007
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.

388
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:49,047
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

389
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,716
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

390

I made a good choice!

Something about a helicopter ride.

- Did you mean that?
- What?

418
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:24,089
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?

497
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,184
[Flo] Mm-hm!

498
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:44,716
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?

499
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,229
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!

500
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,234
That's so too much!

501
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,738
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?

502
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:56,798
I don't know.

503
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,672
Whoa! Yes.

504
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,557
- [Sputtering]
- [Laughing]

505
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,130
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!

506
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:25,868
- Bleah!
- [Chuckling]

507
00:30:27,378 --> 00:30:29,403
- [Grunts]
- [Laughs]

508
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,708
[Sputtering]

509
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,509
[Laughing]

510
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:31,875
[Chuckles] Oh!

511
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:33,214
[Spitting]

512
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:55,873
[Lightning] Wow. What is this place?

513
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,945
Wheel Well.

514
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:01,279
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.

515
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,653
This place?

516
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,717
[Horns beeping]

517
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,322
[Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.

518
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,731
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.

519
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:21,632
You know, I don't get you.

520
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,940
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?

521
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:27,208
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...

522
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:31,446
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...

523
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:35,082
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?

524
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:38,559
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.

525
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,957
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.

526
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:43,795
And you know what?

527
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:47,496
It never felt... happy.

528
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,234
Yeah. I mean... really?

529
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:54,040
Yeah. So I left California.

530
00:32:54,113 --> 00:32:57,412
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.

531
00:32:58,151 --> 00:33:00,949
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

532
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,013
Well, they all did. And I never left.

533
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:06,988
Yeah. You know, I understand.

534
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:09,894
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.

535
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:13,695
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?

536
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,128
[Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.

537
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,871
- Oh.
- Yep.

538
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:25,510
- Corvette?
- No.

539
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:33,820
I fell in love with this.

540
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,570
Whoa. Look at that.

541
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,777
Look, they're drivin' right by.

542
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:55,042
They don't even know
what they're missing!

543
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,382
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.

544
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,186
Oh, yeah?

545
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:05,159
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.

546
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,285
Really?

547
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:10,060
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,

548
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:13,001
cars came across the country
a whole different way.

549
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,603
How do you mean?

550
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:19,074
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.

551
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:23,342
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.

552
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:26,842
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?

553
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:31,553
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.

554
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:34,185
They drove on it to have a great time.

555
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:36,388
[~ James Taylor: Our Town]

556
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,600
Well, what happened?

557
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,128
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.

558
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:43,901
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!

559
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:46,775
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.

560
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:50,510
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.

561
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:54,248
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

562
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:56,153
I had a great time.

563
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:58,955
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.

564
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,756
You're welcome.

565
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,402
Hey, listen, listen!

566
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,569
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

567
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:15,737
[Chuckling] Wha... what?

568
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,044
[Rumbling]

569
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:21,780
[Mooing]

570
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,124
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

571
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:40,772
- [Honking loudly]
- [Mooing]

572
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:45,611
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!

573
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,276
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.

574
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,651
- [Sheriff] Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

575
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:54,748
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?

576
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:57,325
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!

577
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:59,363
There's one goin' this way.

578
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:02,527
I got it.
