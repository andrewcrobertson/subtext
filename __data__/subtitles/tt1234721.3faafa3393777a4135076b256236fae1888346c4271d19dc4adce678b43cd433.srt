00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:10,471
will become completely safe?

00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,220
How do I know that?

00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,003
We will not appreciate the situation in the street machine

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,090
Forget about the machine they want...

It's time to wake him up

25
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,202
make it more tactical

26
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,203
