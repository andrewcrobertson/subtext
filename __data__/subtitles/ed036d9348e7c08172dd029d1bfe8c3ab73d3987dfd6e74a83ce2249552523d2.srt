[Inhaling and exhaling deeply]

2
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,730
[Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:46,172
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,800
[Cars whizzing past]

5
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:50,607
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,239
I eat losers for breakfast.

7
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,283
[Car accelerating]

8
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,784
Breakfast.

9
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,945
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:02,718
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

11
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,349
[Cars whizzing]

12
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,656
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

13
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,321
I am lightning!

14
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:09,386
[Pounding on door]

15
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:11,763
[Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

16
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,324
[~ Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]

17
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:16,565
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

18
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,107
[engine revving]

19
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:36,589
[Engine revs]

[Crowd cheers]

21
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:55,935
Ka-chow!

[All cheer]

26
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,116
Get your antenna balls here!

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,861
Go, Lightnin'!

28
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:57,929
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. [whistles]

29

[Air wrench whirring]

30
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,444
Uh! [screams]

31

[Engine revs]

32
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:26,765
- [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [Crowd cheers]

33
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:30,464
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,531
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

35
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,634
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.

36
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,306
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

37
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:40,439
Right, Darrell.

38
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:43,144
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

39
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:45,311
heading into the final race
of the season.

40
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:50,154
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

41
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,920
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

42
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:54,394
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

43
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:57,057
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

44
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,327
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

45
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:02,768
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

46
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:05,363
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

47
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,602
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

48
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:10,440
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

49
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:14,573
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

50
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,278
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

51
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:19,980
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

52
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,545
But everyone knows him now.

53
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:25,684
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

54
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,354
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

55
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,297
Three cars, one champion!

56
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,301
[Breaks screeching]

57
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,969
No you don't.

58
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,674
- [Chuckling]
- Hey!

59
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,680
- [Tires squealing]
- [Crowd booing]

60
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,558
What a ride!

61
00:04:58,627 --> 00:04:59,889
[Chuckling]

62
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,157
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

63
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,799
[Female] I love you, Lightning!

64
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,532
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [Screaming]

65
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,540
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

66
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,839
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

67
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:16,900
[Crowd gasps]

68
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,579
[Screaming]

69
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:27,712
[Giggling]

70

- [Grunts]
- [Gasps]

71
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:34,458
[Both screaming]

72
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,600
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,502
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:44,800
Not in one piece, that is.

75
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,476
[Exhaling]

76
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:01,116
Yeah!

77
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,158
Lightning! Oh!

78
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,528
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,064
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:12,259
Yeah! Ka-chow!

81
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:15,599
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

82
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:18,640
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

83
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,937
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

84
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,772
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:25,837
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

86
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,644
[Air wrench whirring]

87
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:33,054
[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:35,055
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,181
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:39,386
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,224
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:44,857
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:47,231
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:49,532
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:53,006
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,475
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

97
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,272
[Crowd cheers]

98
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,458
Come on, come on, come on!

99
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,932
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,704
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?

101
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,903
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,215
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,716
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:38,480
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:42,216
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

106
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,829
[Cars whizzing]

107
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:54,564
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:07:54,636 --> 00:07:57,503
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,870
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

110
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,137
[Crowd cheers and whistles]

111
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,440
[Screaming]

112
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,578
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [Tire blows]

113
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,641
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:13,449
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

115
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:16,082
- You fool!
- [Grunts]

116
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,927
[Male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

117
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,485
Go, go, go!

118
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,604
- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]

119
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:32,401
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

120
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:35,705
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

121
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:37,642
Come on. [grunting]

122
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,744
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

123
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:45,344
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

124
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:47,719
[Gasping]

125
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,451
[Growling]

126
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,687
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

127
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:59,830
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

128
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:02,699
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

129
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,136
Lightning!

130
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:07,431
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

131
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,967
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

132
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:13,071
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

133
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,346
[Tape jittering]

134
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,418
[Slow motion drone]

135
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,785
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

136
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:29,057
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

137
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:29,197
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

138
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:31,665
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

139
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:34,201
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

140
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,258
Tell me about it!

141
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:37,999
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

142
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:41,509
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

143
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:45,478
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

144
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,481
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

145
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:49,676
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

146
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,912
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

147
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,420
What? Oh, yeah, right.

148
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,547
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

149
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:58,252
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

150
00:09:58,326 --> 00:10:00,021
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

151
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,790
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

152
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,854
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

153
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:07,527
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

154
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:11,663
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

155
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,435
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

156
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:17,274
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

157
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:18,334
[Crowd laughs]

158
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:21,314
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

159
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,044
Oh, whatever.

160
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,143
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

161
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,519
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

162
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,820
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

163
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,417
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

164
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:36,157
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

165
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:40,793
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

166
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,700
In your dreams, Thunder.

167
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,865
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

168
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,774
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

169
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:50,641
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

170
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:53,146
- Who knew about the thunder thing?

172

That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

Thank you, King.

179
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,832
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

180
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,269
It's the least I could do.

181

Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

that must be really embarrassing.

215

But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

216

have determined that a tiebreaker race

California gets Dinoco all to himself.

- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

227

Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

228

- What?

Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

like Rust-eze.

Wow! Look at that shine!

235

He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

This is not good for my image.

They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

243

Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

- You're my hero!

we had a banner year!

We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

261
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,808
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

262
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,877
because the track is always lit.

263
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:30,152
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

to see anything bad happen to him.

must be found at all costs!

Where is McQueen?

[Groaning] Oh, boy.

423
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,742

- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

433
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:39,434
Uh...

No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

435
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:44,007
What?

as fast as possible. Where am I?

Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

443
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,741
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

444
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:13,541
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

445
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,844
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

446
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,440
- Cool!
- Mater!

447
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:20,385
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

448
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:21,944
To not to.

449
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:26,459
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

450
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,620
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

451
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:31,563
[Chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!

452
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:32,821
Ah!

453
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,597

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,197
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

How long is this gonna take?

458
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:48,377
I gotta get to California, pronto.

459
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:49,609
Where's your lawyer?

460
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,948
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

461
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,151
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

462
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:00,216

468
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:17,102
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

469
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:19,077
I want his hood on a platter!

470
00:30:19,146 --> 00:30:21,808
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

471
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:25,648
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

472
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:29,382
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

473
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:30,980
I'm...

474
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,894
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

475
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:38,329
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

476
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:40,057
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

477
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,398
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

478
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,936
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

479
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:48,965
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

480
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:51,511
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

481
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:54,012
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

482
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:56,015
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

483
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,246
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

484
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,881
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

485
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,917
- What the? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

486
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:08,052
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

487
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:11,722
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

488
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,460
- [Revving]
- Agh! Ow!

489
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,934
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

490
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,028
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

491
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:21,871
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

492
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:24,536
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

493
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:28,308
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

494
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:30,383
Ka-ching!

495
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:31,543
Ah!

496
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:33,619
I'll keep that in mind.

497
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:36,187
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

498
00:31:36,557 --> 00:31:38,855
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

499
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,582
You know her?

500
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:43,630
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

501
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:44,686
What?

502
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:48,861
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

503
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:52,770
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

504
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,501
What do you want, Sally?

505
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:57,942
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

506
00:31:58,011 --> 00:32:01,174
No. I know his type. Racecar.

507
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,307
That's the last thing this town needs.

508
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:07,878
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

509
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:11,891
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

510
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,392
Here she goes again.

511
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,156
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

512
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,859
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

513
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:23,733
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

514
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:26,796
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

515
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:28,034
Ignore him.

516
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:31,475
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

517
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:33,877
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

518
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:36,745
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

519
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,307
And if no one can get to you?

520
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:42,719
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

521
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,623
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

522
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:49,093
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

523
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:52,690
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

524
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:56,258
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

525
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:59,464
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

526
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,100
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

527
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:05,009
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

528
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:08,309
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

529
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:10,612
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

530
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:12,709
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

531
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:13,775
Oh, he can do it.

532
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:16,652
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

533
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:18,190
[All] Fix the road!

534
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:21,819
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

535
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,157
[All cheer]

536
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,427
[Honking] Order in the court!

537
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,965
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

538
00:33:30,037 --> 00:33:32,028
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

539
00:33:32,105 --> 00:33:33,436
[VW van] Nice ruling.

540
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:37,666
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

541
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:41,612
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

542
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,510
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

543
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:46,212
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

544
00:33:46,286 --> 00:33:48,948
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

545
00:33:49,022 --> 00:33:50,717
[Gurgling]

546
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:55,117
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

547
00:33:55,195 --> 00:33:58,255
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

548
00:33:58,332 --> 00:34:01,062
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

549
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,466
What? This place is crazy!

550
00:34:03,537 --> 00:34:05,698
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

551
00:34:05,772 --> 00:34:08,764
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

552
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:09,831
What?

553
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,471
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

554
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,139
You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:17,877
You start there where the road begins.

556
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:21,244
You finish down there
where the road ends.

557
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,487
[Mater] Holy shoot!

558
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:28,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

559
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:32,056
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

560
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,292
Five days?

561
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:36,302
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

562
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,339
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

563
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,897
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

564
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:46,104
[Grunting]

565
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,615
[Tires squealing, engine revving]

566
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:52,213
[Lightning] Freedom!

567
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:01,051
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

568
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:05,127
...and then...
then took the boot off.

569
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,000
Whoo-hoo!

570
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:13,729
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

571
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:17,675
California, here I come! Yeah!

572
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,038
Oh, feel that wind.

573
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:24,074
Yes!

574
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:25,175
[Sputtering]

575
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:27,277
No. No, no, no.

576
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,886
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

577
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:31,948
How can I be outta gas?

578
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:35,984
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

579
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:38,395
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you?

580
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:40,797
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

581
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:43,768
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

582
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:54,579
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

583
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:55,740
Hey, Sheriff.

584
00:35:55,816 --> 00:35:58,080
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

585
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,642
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

586
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,586
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

587
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:05,489
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

588
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,392
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

589
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,192
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

590
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:14,165
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

591
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:17,601
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

592
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:19,901
That's why we made him the judge.

593
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:24,237
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

594
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:25,676
Now, I'm not one to brag

595
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:29,045
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

596
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:30,540
Oh!

597
00:36:30,617 --> 00:36:33,450
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

598
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,317
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

599
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:37,653
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

600
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:42,423
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

601
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:44,828
That won't be necessary.

602
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:49,198
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

603
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,897
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

604
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,330
Where's he goin'?

605
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:58,845
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

606
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:00,436
I shouldn't put up with this.

607
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:03,381
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

608
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,476
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

609
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:09,950
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

610
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:12,651
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

611
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:16,719
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

612
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:19,095
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

613
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,259
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

614
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,325
I must scream it to the world!

615
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:27,635
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

616
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,199
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

617
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:33,246
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

618
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:36,949
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

619
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:44,382
Is that what I think it is?
