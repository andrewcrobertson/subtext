1
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,081
Beautiful.

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,625
Focus more on the arm whip
than wrist snap, okay?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,587
It'll give you more velocity.

4
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,175
I had a long talk
with Mom this morning.

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,595
She said your bad dreams
are getting worse.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,265
She also said

7
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,184
there was something
you needed to tell me.

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,771
Remember... Remember that day

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,440
you let me ride my bike
to practice?

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,609
You rode through
the storm drain, didn't you?

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,860
By the old mine.

12
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,779
Why? Did something happen?

13
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,531
No. Nothing happened, Dad.

14
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,950
I just freaked myself out a bit.
That's all.

15
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,039
Is that why you
started carrying around
Bunny Bear again?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,962
Before you say no,

17
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,464
Mom thinks
one way of tackling this

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,549
is for you to let go
of some of the things

19
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,676
you needed
when you were little.

20
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,721
I agree.

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,016
But we also agree
that when that happens,

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,434
it's entirely up to you.

23
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,771
Let me toss the gear
in the shed,

24
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,980
and then we can
go grab some pizza.

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,525
Dad?

26
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,117
Dad?

27
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,661
Dad, are you in there?

28
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,915
Dad?

29
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,190
Dad?

30
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,441
Dad, what's happening?

31
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,234
Dad!

32
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,653
Run!

33
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
No!

34
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,176
♪ Deep in the green wood
Animals play ♪

35
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,428

36

00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,815
♪ Hop, hop, hop like a bunny ♪

40
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,525
Five more minutes. Okay, dude?

41
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,819
I thought we said
no more Bunny Hop.

42
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,864
It's better than
Little Baby Bum.

43
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,284
Hey.

44
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,328
Hey, babe. You look awful.

45
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,413
You look like a waffle.

46
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,336
Yeah, well,
I didn't sleep for shit.

47
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,838
I thought you said you were
gonna stop working so late.

48
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,673
It wasn't that.

49
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,008
There were deer or something

50
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,927
-in the backyard again.
-Hmm.

51
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,720
What time is it?

52
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,723
10:17.

53
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,642
Why?

54
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,102
Oh, I don't know.

55
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,561
My sister?

56
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,313
Liam and the girls?

57
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,898
11:00 a.m. brunch?

58
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,818
Family brunch.

59
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay. I am going to shower.

60
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,156
Come on.

61
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,829
You're a zombie.
You're a zombie.

62
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm gonna... Come.
I'll get you!

63
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,165
You're gonna
give him nightmares.

64
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,792
You're a zombie!
Please, he loves it.

65
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,001
Don't you, ti cheri?

66
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,212
Yes, let Auntie eat you!

67
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,674
Was there a blackout
last night?

68
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,718
Uh, no,
not that I know of. Why?

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,513
Clocks are all out of whack,
and the fridge is defrosted.

70
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,348
Oh!

71
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,726
Oh, wow.

72
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,437
Yeah, the place
looks amazing, Karina.

73
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,563
Thank you, Arlene.

74
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,481
Yeah, it's getting there.

75
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,691
Yeah, it's great.

76
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
It's so not getting there.

77
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,196
Mmm.

78
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,865
It was probably just a possum.

79
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,702
I caught one under my grill
the other night.

80
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,163
Almost shat myself.

81
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,622
It sounded like
a person to me.

82
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,083
Then it was kids
drinking forties

83
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,209
in the woods like
we used to do.

84
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,379
It sounded like one person.

85
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,965
Got a gun in the house?

86
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,634
Are you nuts?

87
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,595
All Dad ever needed
was his Henry Aaron.

88
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,806
Different era, my friend.

89
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,562
Hey, check this out.

90
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,944
Finally got the mechanics
working perfect.

91
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,705
My loan agent might be willing
to give me an extension.

92
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,375
But only if I cut
production costs by half.

93
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
I, uh...

94
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,634
You know, I thought we agreed
you were gonna let that go.

95
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,385
That you were gonna
get those loans paid off.

96
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,064
Whatever you say, boss.

97
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,900
So how's Pat doing with
the move back to New Jersey?

98
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,443
Stressed.

99
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,195
-Mmm.
-Barely sleeping.

100
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,155
It killed him
to come back here

101
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,448
and take the job with Liam,

102
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,534
but the reality
is he couldn't find anyone

103
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,285
to fund his designs.

104
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,704
Our medical benefits
are about to expire.

105
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,289
If his mom
hadn't moved to Arizona,

106
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,041
we would be
at the YMCA right now.

107
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,459
Ahh!

108
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,461
Hey, honey.

109
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,047
Please, please don't play
Fute so loud. Okay?

110
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,228
Screw this.

111
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
Hey, listen.

112
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,875
It's fine with me if you guys
are partying out here.

113
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,718
But don't blame me
if I bash someone's face in

114
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,011
'cause you don't
wanna get caught.

115
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,944
Shit.

116
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,780
Oh, my God.

117
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,819
Listen, Patty.

118
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,991
I know you're still down
about how things played out,

119
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,326
but you should be proud
that you had the balls
to go for it.

120
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,746
Be careful what you wish for.

121
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,416
Remember when I took over
the yard after Dad died?

122
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,669
Had nightmares
every goddamn night

123
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,922
about them
repossessing our car

124
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,299
or foreclosing on the house.

125
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,344
Those are my good dreams,
Liam.

126
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,560
Ever since we moved back home,

127
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,104
I've been having
these white-knucklers about
Jake getting snatched.

128
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
We're in the backyard.

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,402
Or maybe it's a park
or a playground.

130
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,613
I just get this bad feeling,
you know?

131
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,824
You know
who I blame for that shit?

132
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,084
Yeah, I could really
use him right now.

133
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,003
Yeah.

134
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
You and me both, brother.

135
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,593
Meet me over
at the kiln in 20.

136
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,512
Yeah.

137
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,312
Can you
please stop doing that
for three seconds?

138
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,607
This is Irish Walnut.

139
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,150
If I leave it for too long,
it'll get chalky.

140
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,735
I don't care
if it's Scottish scrotum.

141
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,153
We're on a mission here.

142
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,448
Dad always says
to never come down here.

143
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,742
"Dad always said
never to come down here."

144
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,744
You're just scared of what
might be inside there.

145
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,083
Liam, have you ever thought...

146
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,751
What if the things
they say are true?

147
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,212
Don't be a moron.

148
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,631
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

149
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,716
Bingo!

150
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,185
Okay, we saw it.
Can we go home now?

151
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,396
I dare you to go over there.

152
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,232
I double dare you.

153
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,525
Or I'll tell everybody
what a pussy you were.

154
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,569
I triple dare you to do it.

155
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,945
I already did it,
like, 10 times.

156
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,988
Then you shouldn't
be afraid to do it again.

157
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,114
Should you?

158
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,339
I wanna go home.

159
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,300
Yeah.

160
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,427
Yeah, me too.

161
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,138
Holy crap.

162
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,601
-That's a wild plum tree.
-Who cares?

163
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,020
Grandpa said
it's the softest wood
in the entire world.

164
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,146
Patty.

165
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,400
Pat.

166
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,403
Pat!

167
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,114
Get away from there, Patty.

168
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,365
Help me
pull this tree down first.

169
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,867
No frickin' way.

170
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm not leaving
until I get a piece!

171
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,578
If you don't let go right now,

172
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,871
I'm totally telling Dad
we came here.

173
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,123
-Dude. You're the pussy.
-Screw you.

174
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,583
I'm leaving
if you don't get away...

175
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
Sweet.

176
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,799
You're too close.

177
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,301
Seriously, Patty.

178
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,733
Almost got it.

179
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,310
-Are you holding on?
-Yes, I am.

180
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,895
Okay, good.

181
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,772
How many more times
you wanna do it?

182
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,898
One thousand.

183
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,942
-I gotta stop, okay?
-Again.

184
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,777
No. I know you want
to go again, baby,

185
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,903
but I have to work, okay?

186
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,571
Stop.

187
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,074
All right. I know.

188
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,826
Come on, then.
Let's go over here.

189
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,036
So maybe we can go when Daddy
gets back from work, okay?

190
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,204
Okay.

191
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,800
Jakie.

192
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,640
Jakie, stop.

193
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,310
I said stop!

194
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,648
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,569
Mommy just needs
some quiet for a bit. Okay?

196
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,029
Can you do that for me,
please?

197
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,531
Okay.

198
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,616
Thank you.

199
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,400
Jake?

200
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,196
Jake?

201
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,906
Jakie, where are you?

202
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,159
Jake?

203
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,371
Jakie?

204
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,249
If you don't come out
in three seconds,

205
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,709
no dessert tonight, okay?

206
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,298
Jakie?

207
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,801
Jakie?

208
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,261
Jakie!

209
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,596
Jake?

210
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,431
Jakie! Where are you?

211
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,368
I'll take the one.
That's the one.

212
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,954
Jakie! Come to Mommy, okay?

213
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,475
Hello. We're here.

214
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,605
Ooh! Look at this!

215
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,691
Jakie! Come out!

216
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,696
Jakie!

217
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,906
Jakie!

218
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,032
Jakie!

219
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,994
Jakie?

220
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,454
Jakie? Jakie!

221
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,373
Jakie! Jakie!

222
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,666
Jake.

223
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,251
Oh, my God.

224
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,920
Don't you ever run away
from me like that again, okay?

225
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,380
Let's go home. Okay, baby?

226
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,464
Okay?

227
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,267
Let's go home, baby, okay?

228
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,894
We go home.

229
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,925
Hey, buddy.

230
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,348
How's your day been?

231
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,558
-Good, good.
-"Good, good," good?

232
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,023
Okay. All right.

233
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
-That's enough Fute now, okay?
-Slow down, buddy.

234
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,278
Jakie!

235
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,199
Oh, poor Daddy.

236
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,580
Oh, my God.

237
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,790
Put him down.

238
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,213
♪ Ding, ding, dong ♪

239
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,507
♪ Ding, ding, dong ♪

240
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,146
Wanna watch that show

241
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,773
your sister
was telling us about?

242
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,941
It's too heavy.

243
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,110
Anything on the queue?

244
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,903
Mm-hmm.

245
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,739
250 movies
we'll never actually watch.

246
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,749
What's wrong?

247
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
I almost lost him today.

248
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,227
Lost him how?

249
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,937
I... I was trying to work,

250
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,481
and he was just playing
the stupid recorder

251
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,067
and I just lost it. I snapped.

252
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,696
I took my eye off him
for one second,

253
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,281
and he wandered
into the woods...

254
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,117
and I... I panicked, and all
I could think about was...

255
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
Are we gonna be okay?

256
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,543
Again.

257
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,633
Again, again.

258
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,597
Hey, who you
talking to, buddy?

259
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,931
Dolly.

260
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,975
To Dolly?

261
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,643
Dolly.

262
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,564
Dolly.

263
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,492
Is there a moth in here?

264
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,785
Mmm-mmm. Just Dolly.

265
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,371
Come on. Lie down, kiddo.

266
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,624
Let's get you tucked in.

267
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,504
Where did you go?
Where'd you go?

268
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,968
Okay, buddy, go into the light.

269
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,095
There's peace and tranquility
in the light.

270
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,682
All are welcome.

271
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,810
All are welcome.

272
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,901
All are not welcome.

273
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,231
Pat?

274
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,819
Pat?

275
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,655
I'm here.

276
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,243
What are you doing?

277
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,371
I think there's somebody
out there.

278
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,458
Oh. What?

279
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,338
Don't bother.

280
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,547
The power's out again.

281
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,133
Just come here and listen.

282
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,385
You're freaking me out, Pat.

283
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,095
Just...

284
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,141
Just listen.

285
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,225
What am I listening for?

286
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,312
This weird zipping sound.

287
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,939
I couldn't, for the life of me,
place it until just now.

288
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,068
Like a rucksack or duffel bag.

289
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,778
Somebody's opening
and closing it

290
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,196
just to mess with my head.

291
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,239
Come on, Pat. Seriously?

292
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,036
As soon as I figure out
where this asshole is hiding,

293
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,621
I'm gonna kick his goddamn...

294
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,747
Oh, shit, Jake.

295
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,291
Hello. Hi. Yeah.

296
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,376
Yeah, someone's breaking
into our house.

297
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,543
Jake?

298
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,920
Yeah,
it's 109 Walter Ave.

299
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,171
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Daddy's here, all right?

300
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,881
-Yes. Yeah, please hurry.
-I got you.

301
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,342
Thank you. Please.

302
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,430
Go ahead, take him.

303
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,558
Where're you going?

304
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,976
-I'm going downstairs.
-Pat, no.

305
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,521
Just stay inside, okay?

306
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,647
Close the door.

307
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,047
You wanna
mess with me, man?

308
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,216
Yeah, I'm right here.

309
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,886
I'm right here!

310
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,414
Pat.

311
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,832
I said stay upstairs!

312
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,211
What the hell is going on?

313
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,923
Are you okay?

314
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,300
Are you okay, babe?

315
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,844
Come on. Go for it.

316
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,984
Hey.

317
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,569
Hey.

318
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,154
I'd say welcome home, Pat,

319
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,949
but somebody obviously
beat me to the punch.

320
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,285
-You must be Karina. Hey.
-Hi.

321
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,121
As far as the perp
gettin' inside...

322
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,582
there's not a lot to go on.

323
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,460
Well, I know for a fact
the doors were locked.

324
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,962
You guys have a hide-a-key?

325
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,713
Oh, yeah.

326
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,090
Yes. Yeah, we do.

327
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,099
Right here.

328
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,725
Ah. Okay.

329
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,019
Most likely scenario is,

330
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,189
somebody saw the length
of the grass in your yard,

331
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,732
thought you might be
outta town

332
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,818
and decided to make
an impulse buy.

333
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,029
So, why didn't
they steal anything?

334
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,865
You're positive
nothing's missing?

335
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,159
Yeah, not as far
as we can tell.

336
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,579
Do me a favor.
Go through the house again.

337
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,123
Make a list of anything
that's not where it should be.

338
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,166
No matter
how small or insignificant.

339
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,794
Yeah. I'll start
in the kitchen.

340
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,838
Yeah, it felt more like
he was trying to scare us.

341
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,882
Yeah, he did a good job too.

342
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,011
Hey, Chief, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

343
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,430
Pat...

344
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,639
Can you come upstairs?

345
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,976
Sure.

346
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,771
A lot of these break-ins
where it looks like

347
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,024
there was an ulterior motive
to robbery,

348
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,484
turns out somebody
is sendin' a message.

349
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,198
You sure
you didn't know this guy?

350
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,825
Well, I mean,
I never got a look at him.

351
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,623
You let me know
if you remember anything else.

352
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,666
Okay?

353
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,376
Okay.

354
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,005
What do we got, Rawls?

355
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
Well,
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

356
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,675
Don't suppose
you made these?

357
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,220
Yeah.

358
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,182
Uh, yeah,
all the time when I was a kid.

359
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,310
There're boxes of 'em
in the garage.

360
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,729
You know, it seems to me like
someone was squatting here
like this, and, you know,

361
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,148
tossing them. Like so.

362
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,608
Maybe drawin'
your son's attention?

363
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,360
Look...

364
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,362
Tell 'em I sent you.

365
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,322
They'll rig your whole house
for a song.

366
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,408
And mow your lawn,
for chrissake.

367
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,976
Jakie.

368
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,755
Holy shit.

369
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,263
Daddy, look at this.

370
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,806
Very cool, buddy.

371
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,767
Hey, so, pile on the right
goes back on the shelves.

372
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,812
Everything on the left,
we can bag and toss outside.

373
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,480
This asshole
really did rob us,

374
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,606
he needs a new line of work.

375
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,734
Where the hell
did you find this?

376
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,114
Uh, I've never seen that
before in my life.

377
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,949
So, what's it doing in
the bottom of the wastebasket

378
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,159
in my office?

379
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
No idea.

380
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,288
It's, uh...

381
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,040
It's one of the first things
I ever carved.

382
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,210
Lost it years ago.

383
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:11,132
Speaking of things
carved out of wood...

384
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,969
Can you...

385
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,429
ditch this for me somewhere?

386
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,431
What for?

387
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,391
It's literally
his favorite thing in the world.

388
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,393
Yeah, and you need to find him
a new favorite thing, my love.

389
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,895
A quieter thing,

390
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,813
'cause if he blows this shit
in my ear one more time,

391
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,648
you are never
getting laid again.

392
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,775
Okay.

393
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:29,984
I'll hide it out here

394
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,736
until he drives you nuts
asking for it.

395
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,946
Thank you.

396
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,782
Uh, garbage goes
out front tonight.

397
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,085
The score is now
two-zero in favor of Texas.

398
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,294
Fute.

399
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,171
-Anderson is trying...
-Later, Jakie.

400
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,340
-You can play Fute later.
-Fute.

401
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,758
Fute.

402
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,135
Fute!

403
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,180
Okay. Okay, fine, I'll get it.

404
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,349
But you better play quietly,
or Mommy'll kill me.

405
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,018
Hey, what do you say
when I say,

406
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,186
"if you're okay in the tub?"

407
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,105
Fute.

408
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,273
No, no. What do you say?

409
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,483
"Okay."

410
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,235
Okay. All right.

411
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,612
Mommy and Auntie Anna
are across the hall
if you need 'em.

412
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,364
I'm going downstairs
for a sec.

413
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,282
Okay.

414
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,661
Sis, I'm, like, juggling
four different campaigns.

415
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,454
You know, you promised me rose

416
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,248
-and Real Housewives.
-Are you okay?

417
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,415
Okay!

418
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,301
Is that Dolly?

419
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,345
You okay up there?

420
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,721
Okay!

421
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,272
Huh.

422
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,065
Dolly!

423
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,991
You okay, Jake?

424
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,038
Jake?

425
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,959
Jake?

426
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,382
What are you
supposed to say, Jake?

427
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,636
Daddy asked you
a question, Jakie.

428
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,599
Okay.

429
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,225
Did you
turn the lights off?

430
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,351
Nope.

431
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,436
Who are you playing with?

432
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,440
Oh. There he is.

433
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,649
Dolly.

434
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,276
Where'd I put it?

435
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,652
Who are you
playing with?

436
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,820
Dolly.

437
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,304
The hell are you?

438
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,396
Have you been
able to stop thinking
about what happened?

439
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,316
No.

440
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,111
Have you?

441
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,364
No.

442
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,696
Patrick.

443
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,199
Patrick.

444
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,243
Need to ask you a question.

445
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,495
Harvey says he spotted you

446
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,997
playing by the old
service steps.

447
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,873
Yeah, because...

448
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,209
I was just looking
for softer wood to carve
than all this stupid oak.

449
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,009
All right.
Let's you and me take a walk.

450
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,094
Come on.

451
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,902
You gotta be shitting me.

452
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,668
Your Promethian

453
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,587
Home Security System
is activated.

454
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,563
The alarm system
will reset in 30 seconds.

455
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,998
Jesus.

456
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,737
Oh, my God.

457
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,991
Screw you.

458
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,013
Come on,
you gotta be shitting me.

459
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,671
Karina!

460
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,516
Karina, wake up!

461
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,977
Pat!

462
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,229
Pat! What's going on?

463
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,439
Did you see him?

464
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,523
-Did you see him?
-See who?

465
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,567
What?

466
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,152
-Just go back inside, okay?
-No, but what...

467
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,653
Just go back inside.
Lock the door.

468
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,196
-Pat, what... No! Pat!
-Just stay here.

469
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,285
Where are you?

470
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,662
Are you in here?

471
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,165
Where are you?

472
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,712
Come on.

473
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,923
Come on.

474
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,717
It's me.

475
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,222
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

476
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,183
And nobody's here.

477
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,768
I swear I saw something...

478
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,978
Alarm.

479
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,104
One sec.

480
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,442
No fingerprints

481
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,027
or any of the doors
or windows,

482
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,029
and none of the molds
in the backyard

483
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,114
came up a match.

484
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:23,494
Power company did confirm
13 separate interruptions,

485
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,913
but insist the problem
is not on their end.

486
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,039
Meaning what?

487
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,711
You haven't had a new face
show up, have you?

488
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,630
Different guy
checkin' the gas meter,

489
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,508
-or fixin' a cable?
-No.

490
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,967
And nothing missing
from the house?

491
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,226
Uh, Jake has this...

492
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,063
musical instrument, um...

493
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,440
a recorder
that he loves to play,

494
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,362
which I might have
thrown out by mistake.

495
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,907
But even if I did,
it would still be

496
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,951
in one of the garbage cans,
which it's not.

497
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,790
And I...

498
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,337
I could have sworn
I heard it being played.

499
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,215
You know, last night.

500
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,242
Hey.

501
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,119
Thought I said,
"Take some time off."

502
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,373
I need to show you something.

503
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,175
So, what?

504
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,219
There's a thousand more
like it back at the house.

505
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,637
That's the only owl
I ever made.

506
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,642
Do you remember
where I lost it?

507
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,108
Don't tell me
you went back there?

508
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,529
No.

509
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,741
I found it in a trash bin
at home yesterday.

510
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,368
How is that possible?

511
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,536
It's not.

512
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,290
Look what else
I found in Mom's garage.

513
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,555
What are you saying, Patty?

514
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,100
You explain it. I...

515
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,271
Mom always had a knack
for finding lost stuff.

516
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,106
You know she did.

517
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,776
Keep digging
through that house

518
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,195
and I guarantee you'll find
all kinds'a crazy shit.

519
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,910
Maybe, in the meantime,

520
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,414
I think you should
give that shrink a call.

521
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,749
What was her name?

522
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,627
Mary?

523
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,338
Barbara.

524
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,758
Yeah, something's
been bubbling up in you
for a long time now,

525
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,635
and she always seemed to help
back in the day.

526
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,827
Yeah, let your
brother have a go, all right?

527
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,246
Not too high.

528
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,915
Are you serious?

529
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,004
Gotta go.

530
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,422
Push it back.
Push it back.

531
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,883
Push it back.

532
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,847
-Present.
-Jeez.

533
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,724
-Jakie, you scared me.
-Present.

534
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
It's from Dolly.

535
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,935
What is this?

536
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,812
It's a present.

537
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,023
Okay?

538
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,649
Okay.

539
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,167
What the hell?

540
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,183
Shit. Jakie.

541
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,309
Jakie, come out of there!

542
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,102
Jakie!

543
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,399
Jakie.

544
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,695
Get away from him!

545
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,656
Get the hell away from my son!

546
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,865
Jakie!

547
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,533
Jakie!

548
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,371
Jakie. Come here.

549
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,122
Come here. Jakie.

550
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,958
Jakie!

551
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,909
What's happening
to you both is very normal.

552
00:49:55,951 --> 00:50:00,747
To have your home invaded
is a traumatic experience,

553
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,875
one that brings up
all kinds of issues.

554
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,085
Such as?

555
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,129
Such as,

556
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,507
"How will I ever let my son
out of my sight again?"

557
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,926
Or...

558
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,179
"Did I fulfill my obligation
as a husband

559
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,308
"and a father, and a man,

560
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,185
"to protect
my wife and child?"

561
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,189
Karina, Pat's description.

562
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,234
It's quite evocative
of a persistent phobia

563
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,319
your husband
struggled with as a child.

564
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,406
Which, of course,

565
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,784
is how Pat and I
came to know each other.

566
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,790
What phobia was that?

567
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,000
Patrick.

568
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,085
Patrick.

569
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,963
Let's you and me take a walk.

570
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,090
Come on.

571
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,970
You know, long before
we built this yard,

572
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,681
this whole forest

573
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,683
was basically
one big copper mine.

574
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,104
Kicked out half the product
for the entire state,

575
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,232
before they finally
dug the sucker dry.

576
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,945
This was how you got down
to the main entry shaft...

577
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,616
...back when it was owned
by the mining company.

578
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,993
Who owns it now?

579
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,120
Us?

580
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,671
Now it belongs to Bagman.

581
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,219
-Who's Bagman?
-Shh!

582
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,849
You never know
who might be listenin'.

583
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,851
I told your brother this story
last summer,

584
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,270
just like your granddad did me
when I was your age

585
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,397
and his granddad's
granddad before that.

586
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,733
And all of them
swore it was true.

587
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,945
Just like
I'm swearing to you now.

588
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,948
They say...

589
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,867
he wanders
the world each night,

590
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,869
searching for children

591
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,913
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

592
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,958
-Not just any children...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,960
Let me guess.

594
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,920
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen
to their parents or...

595
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,880
Wrong, Patty.

596
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,591
It's the good kids he wants.

597
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,011
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

598
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,890
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

599
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,601
he won't rest
until he has them

600
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,312
slung over his bony shoulder.

601
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,773
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

602
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,863
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

603
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,239
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

604
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,532
And scared you better be!

605
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,950
Wander too close,
he'll drag you in

606
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,493
and make pencils
out of your fingers,

607
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,203
and gobble
the rest of you down!

608
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,999
Are you with me, boy?

609
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,795
Good.

610
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,463
Bagman?

611
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,158
You drew these?

612
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,078
Yep.

613
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,218
That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

614
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,929
Pat's was so intense,

615
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,431
I felt it was crucial
to give him

616
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,850
as much context as possible

617
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,478
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

618
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:02,530
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

619
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,617
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

620
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,454
Curiously, his methodology,

621
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,165
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

622
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,669
are remarkably consistent.

623
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,129
He has the power to paralyze

624
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,966
and incapacitate
parents and adults

625
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,468
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

626
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,888
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

627
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,976
It sustains him, nourishes him.

628
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:35,397
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

629
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,650
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

630
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,195
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

631
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,698
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

632
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,116
On the contrary.

633
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:50,161
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

634
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,831
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

635
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:56,418
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

636
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,962
you're projecting
the supernatural

637
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,880
onto something...

638
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,842
all too painfully real.

639
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,262
And until you deal
with the real stuff

640
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,680
bubbling up for you,

641
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,932
the anger,

642
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:15,020
the feelings of vulnerability,
and violation,

643
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,272
your panic attacks
and nightmares

644
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,940
will only get worse.

645
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,817
Okay, so,

646
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,236
what do you suggest we do?

647
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,950
I see her.

648
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,745
I'm the zombie.

649
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,247
-Whoa! Hey, guys.
-Okay.

650
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,874
So, he goes down 7:30
at the latest.

651
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,876
-We read two stories...
-Two stories, yeah.

652
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,210
...and then we sing
Frere Jacques when
he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

653
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,046
Guys, check your phone.

654
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,214
I just texted you
the confirmation number
for a room at the Hyatt.

655
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,799
Two blocks from here,
three from the restaurant.

656
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,301
Already paid for.

657
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,011
Dinner's one thing,
but there's no chance in hell

658
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,846
we're sleeping
in a different place
than Jakie right now.

659
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,806
Who said anything
about sleeping?

660
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,933
Who said sleeping?

661
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,353
Will you just get her
out of here, Pat?

662
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,979
Who said...

663
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,273
Jakie,
listen to Auntie Anna, okay?

664
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,483
Call any time!

665
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,860
We can be back,
five minutes tops, okay?

666
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,570
Gonna play zombie.

667
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,161
I'm not sure
I'm up for this.

668
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,748
Yeah, me neither.

669
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,922
Worst case, we get dinner to go
and eat on Anna's couch.

670
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,966
Yep.

671
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,177
Let's at least try to make it
as far as dessert,

672
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,470
so she can put Jakie down.

673
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,353
So, what's the verdict?

674
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,358
Is your husband nuts?

675
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,405
Completely fricking crackers.

676
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,705
So, what actually happened
with you and Liam at the mine?

677
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,586
Well, I thought I felt someone
cut off a lock of my hair.

678
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,381
I, uh...

679
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,134
I lost my shit

680
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,845
and then
we ran home screaming.

681
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,805
A lock of your hair?

682
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,599
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

683
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,601
one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

684
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,687
That's how it starts.

685
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,647
What the hell for?

686
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,359
So he always knows
where to find you.

687
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,611
No matter where
you try to run or hide.

688
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,368
Your father was something else.

689
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,538
I think in his own way
he was just trying
to protect me.

690
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,373
A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

691
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,713
All I remember
was Mom was furious

692
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,548
'cause every night
I was convinced

693
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,883
he was tapping on my window.

694
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,844
And then one night,

695
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,430
the old man came in
and he said,

696
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,102
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing
as Bagman."

697
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,356
But I'm afraid
I can't do that.

698
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,737
What I can do...

699
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,074
is tell you a secret
he don't want you to know.

700
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,329
Truth is,

701
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,790
no matter how big, or fast,
or sneaky he is,

702
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,334
he has weaknesses as well.

703
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,796
Escape his grasp long enough,
he'll rot away.

704
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,760
And he cannot lay a single,
skinny finger on you.

705
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,845
Not as long...

706
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,723
as you have this.

707
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,730
You see,
every kid's got something

708
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,483
that means more to them
than anything else
in the world.

709
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,611
Something they love so much,

710
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,907
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

711
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,201
And believe you me,

712
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,328
a child's love...

713
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,831
can be a magical thing.

714
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,125
It can turn even
the humblest object...

715
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,045
into a totem...

716
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,256
of great power.

717
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,595
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

718
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,806
and he cannot touch you.

719
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,145
But lose it,

720
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,565
or even worse,
throw it away...

721
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,159
So, you keep ahold of it.

722
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,579
No matter what.

723
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,712
And now you're concerned...

724
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,755
that Fute has gone missing.

725
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,926
If the one thing that can
supposedly protect Jake...

726
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,637
from you-know-who...

727
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,140
is the thing
that he loves the most?

728
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,226
Honestly?

729
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,150
Well, what I wanna
do right now is go back home

730
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,568
and dig through the trash again.

731
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,155
But if we go down
that thought track,

732
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,198
I'm not sure we'll make it
to the other side, so...

733
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,165
Did Barbara help
when you were eight?

734
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,251
Wouldn't have made it
to nine without her.

735
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,212
So, we have to trust her now.

736
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,734
No,
I do not miss you at all.

737
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,611
-What?
-Mmm-mmm.

738
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,238
I have a real hot date tonight.

739
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,366
-Oh, yeah?
-Three feet tall,

740
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:04,035
talks gibberish
and craps his own pants.

741
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,287
It is so, so sexy.

742
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,705
Stop it.

743
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,416
Okay, babe, um...

744
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,668
We'll see you tomorrow.

745
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:12,752
Yeah.

746
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,796
Yeah.

747
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:19,467
And why don't you
make me something sweet?

748
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,803
Something sweet?
What do you mean?

749
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,389
I don't know what you mean.

750
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,849
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

751
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,229
Okay. Okay, babe.

752
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,397
Yeah. Bye.

753
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,270
Hey.

754
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,813
-Angelo.
-Yeah?

755
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,816
Is there something weird
happening on this floor?

756
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,943
Uh, what do you mean, "weird"?

757
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,278
I don't know.

758
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,739
I'm hearing a voice
on a baby monitor.

759
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,949
Everything's clear
on my security cams.

760
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,034
You want me to come up?

761
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,452
No, no. Um...

762
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,621
I'm sure it's nothing.

763
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,664
Okay. Take it easy.

764
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:14,957
Yeah.

765
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,179
Angelo, has there been
a power surge?

766
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,016
Angelo, are you there?

767
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,855
Come on.

768
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,108
Shit.

769
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,317
I don't know
what you want from me.

770
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,611
But the cops are on their way!

771
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,326
Did I mention I have a gun?

772
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,917
Don't play with me,
motherfucker!

773
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,477
Sarah!

774
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,314
Sarah, call the police!

775
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,111
Stay back.

776
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,154
Karina.

777
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,533
Anna? Anna, are you okay?

778
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,784
Are you okay?

779
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,286
What happened?

780
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,746
Where's Jakie?

781
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,125
We got him. He's okay.

782
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,210
Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

783
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,129
There you go.

784
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,007
It's okay. Thank you.

785
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:54,010
We've got nothing
on the CCTV camera.

786
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,387
It was knocked out
when the power went down.

787
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,181
Thank God for the doorman.

788
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,477
Once the camera
on Anna's floor went dark,

789
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,895
he headed straight up.

790
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,274
He must have
scared the guy off.

791
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,109
-Did Angelo get a look at him?
-No.

792
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,653
But, Pat,

793
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,655
apparently
there are similarities

794
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,615
to a case from four years ago.

795
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,328
A girl named
Emily Greenberg went missing.

796
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,415
Her dad suffered
similar symptoms to Anna's,

797
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:29,045
temporary paralysis
and loss of speech.

798
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:33,007
And these strange abrasions
on his face.

799
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,383
He said he couldn't move.

800
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,385
He had to lie there

801
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,887
and watch this lunatic
stuff his daughter

802
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,639
into a duffel bag
and run off with her.

803
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,690
Look, we're gonna
get you somewhere safe.

804
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,817
I'll post officers outside

805
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,360
who'll keep watch
around the clock.

806
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,739
Don't worry, Pat.

807
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,616
We're gonna catch
this sick bastard.

808
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,500
Thanks.

809
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,626
No problem.

810
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,295
This way. Right here.

811
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,880
Come on.

812
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,048
Watch your step, okay?

813
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,565
They're trying to figure out
what paralyzed Anna,

814
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,234
and the doctors
don't have a frickin' clue.

815
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,278
Who cares,
as long as Anna's okay.

816
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:38,906
She's far from okay.

817
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,825
All right, she refused to stay
in the hospital.

818
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,869
She wouldn't even let us
turn the lights off upstairs.

819
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,079
Karina had to give her
a sedative

820
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,747
and get in bed with her,
you know?

821
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,291
Well, she can stay here
as long as she needs to.

822
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,337
Thank you.

823
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,630
Please.

824
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,091
We'd be insulted
if you went anywhere else.

825
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,719
Come here.

826
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,772
I'm sorry.

827
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,692
For what?

828
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:17,570
Protecting my son?

829
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,161
Get some sleep.

830
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,620
I'm not going anywhere.

831
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,519
'Bout time.

832
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,900
What are you doing awake?

833
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,726
We'll get through this.

834
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,395
I promise.

835
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,831
I can't believe
this is happening.

836
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,335
What do we do
if he really does exist...

837
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,257
and we have lost the one thing
in the whole world...

838
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,593
that could keep our son safe?

839
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,140
I'll make him a new one.

840
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:14,103
No, that won't be the same.

841
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,525
Hey, get some sleep, honey.

842
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,318
All right?

843
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,192
Jake!

844
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,527
-Pat?
-Jake!

845
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,955
Daddy. Daddy, help me.
Help me.

846
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,081
Jake.

847
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,458
Jake!

848
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,626
He's got the boy!

849
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,009
Pat? Pat?

850
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,475
Help!

851
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,394
Help!

852
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,688
Somebody stop him!

853
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,054
Stop right there!

854
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,598
Daddy, help me.

855
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,213
Daddy! Help me!

856
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,506
Jake!

857
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,780
Jake!

858
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:15,909
Daddy!

859
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,288
Help.

860
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,041
Daddy! Help me!

861
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,754
Daddy, help me.

862
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,392
Jake?

863
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,519
Jake?

864
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,980
Jake? Are you in here?

865
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,815
Jake?

866
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,279
Jake?

867
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,179
God, please. God.

868
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,556
No, no, no.

869
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,503
What the heck?

870
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,693
Daddy.

871
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,072
Daddy.

872
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,949
Daddy.

873
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,331
Daddy, help me!

874
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,095
Mommy!

875
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,429
Jakie?

876
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:07,516
Oh, my God, Jake.

877
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,893
Oh, my gosh. Jake!

878
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:10,977
Karina!

879
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,026
Karina, what's happening?

880
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,820
It's not Jake that he came for.

881
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,158
Show yourself,
you sick bastard!

882
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,454
Show yourself!

883
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:38,565
First,
he steals a lock of your hair,

884
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,734
so he always knows
where to find you.

885
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:45,405
And then he taunts you
and feeds off your fear.

886
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,825
It's the good kids he wants.

887
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,870
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

888
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,539
And once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

889
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,458
he won't rest
until he has them

890
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,585
slung over his bony shoulder,

891
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,421
screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

892
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,426
Why come
for me now, huh?

893
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,054
After all this time?

894
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,397
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

895
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,983
and he cannot touch you.

896
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,487
But lose it,

897
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:28,198
or even worse,
throw it away...

898
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,891
The cold hard truth of it,
Patty,

899
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,893
is that there are monsters
in this world.

900
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,396
There is evil.

901
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:02,858
And bad things
do happen to good people.

902
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,695
Even little children.

903
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,482
The only thing that
gives me comfort at night...

904
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,905
is a belief that there's
something good out there,

905
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,073
much more powerful
than all the bad stuff.

906
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,869
Something that loves
and watches over us.

907
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,038
No matter what.

908
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,143
And you really believe that?

909
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,106
I'm lookin' at the proof.

910
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:47,731
Come on! It's me you want!

911
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,649
Come on.

912
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:25,435
Yeah, this way.

913
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,853
Down here! On me! Keep going.

914
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:29,981
I don't know who's on foot.

915
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,816
Down by the yard,
keep a guard here.

916
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,443
What is it? What is it?

917
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,278
This is as far as she goes.

918
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,698
Pat must have
taken a different route.

919
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:43,953
Yo, boss, we got something.

920
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,040
It's got blood on it.

921
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,333
Let's fan out!

922
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:49,918
What is that?

923
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:51,294
That's Jake's flute.

924
01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,511
Pat. Pat!

925
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:00,720
Pat!

926
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:03,640
Pat!

927
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,600
Pat!

928
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:08,144
Pat!

929
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,270
You need
to step away from...

930
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,730
Pat! Can you hear me?

931
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,191
Pat!

932
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:16,361
Pat!

933
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,613
Pat!

934
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,573
Pat!

935
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,180
Mom said we could stay
as long as we need to.

936
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,849
I just can't be
in this house anymore.

937
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:46,975
Not without Pat.

938
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:50,145
There's still hope, 'Rina.

939
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:52,063
I mean, they haven't
even found anything yet.

940
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,149
They're not going to.

941
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,861
And it's not over yet, either.

942
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,156
What do you mean?

943
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,368
He's gonna come back for Jake.
I can just feel it.

944
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:10,123
What are you gonna do?

945
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,336
Whatever it takes.

946
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,592
Okay. Come here.

947
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,563
Just call me
when you get there. Okay?

948
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,106
Yep. Yep.

949
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:36,941
Yep.

950
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:41,112
Yeah.

951
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,146
Hey, so I got some
good news for you, pal.

952
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:17,649
Look what Daddy found.

953
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,400
Fute.

954
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,283
You know, he gave everything
to get that back for you.

955
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,040
And, um... And Daddy...

956
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:35,959
He also told me a secret

957
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,377
that he really,
really wants you to know.

958
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,590
Okay, so how much
do you love Fute, Jakie?

959
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,552
Yeah. So a child's love
is a magical thing.

960
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,682
Keep it close to your heart.

961
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,602
And it will always
protect you.

962
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,897
-Okay?
-Okay.

963
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,482
Okay.

964
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,859
Always.

965
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,569
Always.
