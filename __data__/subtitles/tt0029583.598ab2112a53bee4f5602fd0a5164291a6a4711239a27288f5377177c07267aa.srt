1
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,987
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,533
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,411
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,622
Speak!

5
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,167
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,297
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,175
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,345
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,933
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,145
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,525
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:17,573
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,702
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,746
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,833
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,377
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,380
Snow White!

18
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,584
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,461
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,257
We are standing by a wishing well

21
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,386
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,097
That's all you have to do

23
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,267
And if you hear it echoing

24
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,771
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,609
-I'm wishing
-I'm wishing

26
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,445
For the one I love

27
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,907
-To find me
-To find me

28
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,618
-Today
-Today

29
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,288
-I'm hoping
-I'm hoping

30
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,458
And I'm dreaming of

31
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,837
-The nice things
-The nice things

32
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,798
-He'll say
-He'll say

33
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,606
-I'm wishing
-I'm wishing

34
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,484
For the one I love

35
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,988
-To find me
-To find me

36
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,825
-Today
-Today

37
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,494
-Oh!
-Hello.

38
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,663
-Oh.
-Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,833
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,460
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,173
Now that I've found you

42
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:43,552
Hear what I have to say

43
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,055
One song

44
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,726
I have but one song

45
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:56,190
One song only for you

46
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:04,323
One heart tenderly beating

47
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,243
Ever entreating

48
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,748
Constant and true

49
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,335
One love

50
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,214
That has possessed me

51
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,717
One love

52
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,388
Thrilling me through

53
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,892
One song

54
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,271
My heart keeps singing

55
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,900
Of one love

56
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:45,906
Only for you

57
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,923
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,260
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,846
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,098
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,977
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,437
you will kill her!

63
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,065
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,650
Silence!

65
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,946
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,533
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,703
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,497
you do not fail,

69
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,794
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,307
One song, I have but one song

71
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,032
Hello there.

72
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,992
What's the matter?

73
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,786
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,456
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,466
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,093
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,179
That's better.

79
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,724
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,561
There they are!

81
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,315
Can you fly?

82
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,194
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,329
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:02,417
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,294
I don't understand!

86
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,005
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,424
-But, but who?
-The Queen.

88
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,509
-The Queen?
-Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,011
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,098
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,060
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,273
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,267
Oh!

94
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,439
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,234
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,823
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,368
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,121
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,833
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,421
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,842
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,833
With a smile and a song

103
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,337
Life is just like a bright, sunny day

104
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,757
Your cares fade away

105
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,511
And your heart is young

106
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,767
With a smile and a song

107
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,354
All the world seems to waken anew

108
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,607
Rejoicing with you

109
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,944
As the song is sung

110
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,823
There's no use in grumbling

111
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,285
When raindrops come tumbling

112
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,915
Remember you're the one

113
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:15,921
Who can fill the world with sunshine

114
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,633
When you smile and you sing

115
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,471
Everything is in tune and it's spring

116
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,975
And life flows along

117
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:33,146
With a smile and a song

118
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,737
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,198
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,118
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,414
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,293
I can't sleep in the ground like you

123
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,254
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,925
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,596
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,140
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,392
You do?

128
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,562
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,567
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,112
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,962
I like it here.

132
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,685
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,406
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,452
Hello?

135
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,580
May I come in?

136
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,688
Oh!

137
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,194
What a cute little chair!

138
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,240
Why, there's seven little chairs!

139
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,868
Must be seven little children.

140
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,497
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

141
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,504
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

142
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,843
And a shoe!

143
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,601
And just look at that fireplace.

144
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,561
It's covered with dust.

145
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,363
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

146
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,324
My, my, my!

147
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,617
What a pile of dirty dishes!

148
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,373
And just look at that broom!

149
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,962
Why, they've never swept this room.

150
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,298
You'd think their mother would...

151
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,009
Maybe they have no mother.

152
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,929
Then they're orphans.

153
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,390
That's too bad.

154
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,226
I know!

155
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,854
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

156
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,314
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

157
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,990
Now, you wash the dishes.

158
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,367
You tidy up the room.

159
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,328
You clean the fireplace.

160
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,414
And I will use the broom.

161
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,798
Just whistle while you work

162
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,930
And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place

163
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,266
So hum a merry tune

164
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:26,273
It won't take long when there's a song
to help you set the pace

165
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,609
And as you sweep the room

166
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,819
Imagine that the broom

167
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:36,116
Is someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're dancing to the tune

168
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,078
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

169
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,623
When hearts are high the time will fly

170
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,958
So whistle while you work

171
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,303
Not under the rug.

172
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,560
So whistle while you work

173
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,546
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

174
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,798
In our mine the whole day through

175
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:42,511
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

176
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,763
It ain't no trick to get rich quick

177
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,057
If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick

178
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,476
-In a mine
-In a mine

179
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,812
-In a mine
-In a mine

180
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:56,608
-Where a million diamonds
-Shine

181
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,777
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

182
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,113
From early morn 'til night

183
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:05,826
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
up everything in sight

184
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,328
We dig up diamonds by the score

185
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,581
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more

186
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,875
Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for

187
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,210
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

188
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,034
Heigh-ho

189
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,662
Heigh-ho

190
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,290
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

191
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,792
Heigh-ho

192
00:22:55,876 --> 00:23:00,214
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

193
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,302
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

194
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:10,098
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

195
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,394
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

196
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:26,532
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

197
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,911
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho, hum

198
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:35,791
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

199
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,254
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

200
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:44,591
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

201
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,596
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

202
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,226
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

203
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:03,068
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho...

204
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,665
Let's see what's upstairs.

205
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,482
Oh, what adorable little beds!

206
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,779
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

207
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,824
Doc, Happy,

208
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,576
Sneezy, Dopey...

209
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,454
What funny names for children!

210
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,249
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

211
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,253
I'm a little sleepy myself.

212
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:37,329
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

213
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,501
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

214
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,631
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

215
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,219
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

216
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:57,015
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

217
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,988
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Heigh-ho

218
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,659
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

219
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,330
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

220
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:24,835
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

221
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,006
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh...

222
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,340
Look!

223
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,220
Our house! The lit's light...
The light's lit.

224
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,686
Jiminy Crickets!

225
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,355
-The door is open.
-The chimney's smoking.

226
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,899
-Something's in there.
-Maybe a ghost.

227
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,567
-Or a goblin.
-A demon.

228
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,027
Or a dragon.

229
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,614
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

230
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,117
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

231
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,912
-Gosh!
-That's a bad sign.

232
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,039
-What'll we do?
-Let's sneak up on it.

233
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,875
Yes. We'll squeak up... Sneak up.

234
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,377
Come on, hen... Men. Follow me.

235
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,679
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

236
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,139
Hook and granny... Crooked fan...

237
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,933
Search everywhere.

238
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,997
Quiet.

239
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:32,337
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

240
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,468
Chair's been dusted!

241
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,346
Our window's been washed.

242
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,224
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

243
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:47,519
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

244
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,397
There's dirty work afoot.

245
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,525
Sink's empty.

246
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,528
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

247
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,240
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

248
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,328
My cup's been washed.

249
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,663
Sugar's gone.

250
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,876
Something's cooking.

251
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,545
Smells good!

252
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,840
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

253
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,096
See? It's witches' brew.

254
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,518
Look what's happened
to our stable... Table.

255
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,062
Flowers!

256
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:33,023
-Huh?
-Look, goldenrod.

257
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,735
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

258
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,864
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.

259
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:49,456
Thanks!

260
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:57,756
Hey!

261
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:07,432
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

262
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,269
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

263
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:13,814
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

264
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,650
It's coming.

265
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:20,737
-Don't let him.
-Stop him.

266
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:21,947
Oh!

267
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,908
-No, tie it tight.
-Don't let go.

268
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,326
-Hold him tight.
-I'll tie it.

269
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,911
Make a hard knot.

270
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,080
There, that will hold him.

271
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,125
Thanks!

272
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,420
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

273
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,970
-What's that?
-That's it.

274
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:48,807
-Sounded close.
-It's in this room right now.

275
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,666
-It's up there.
-Yeah. In the bedroom.

276
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:20,005
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

277
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,216
Up. Down.

278
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,194
Here, take it.

279
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,197
Don't be nervous.

280
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,883
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

281
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,094
Yes! Right behind ya.

282
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,804
Here it comes!

283
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,441
-It's after us.
-Don't let it out.

284
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,109
Hold it shut.

285
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,331
-Here it comes.
-Now's our chance.

286
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:18,582
Get it now!

287
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:19,917
-Quick!
-Give it to it!

288
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,002
Don't let it get away!

289
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,091
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

290
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,010
-Did you see it?
-How big is it?

291
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,638
-Was it a dragon?
-Has it got horns?

292
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,932
-Was it breathing fire?
-Was it droolin'?

293
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,850
What was it doin'?

294
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:44,358
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

295
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,443
-Let's attack.
-While it's sleeping.

296
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:47,528
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

297
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,988
-Hurry, men. It's now or never!
-Off with its head.

298
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,615
-Break its bones.
-Chop it to pieces.

299
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,450
We'll kill it dead.

300
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,312
-Jiminy Crickets!
-Gosh!

301
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,147
-Gee!
-What a monster!

302
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,815
It covers three beds.

303
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,527
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

304
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,487
Which end do we kill?

305
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,392
Well, eh, ah...

306
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:04,897
-What is it?
-Why, it... It's a girl!

307
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,734
She's mighty purdy.

308
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,405
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

309
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,909
Angel, hah! She's a female!

310
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:20,871
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

311
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,082
What are wicked wiles?

312
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,543
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

313
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,088
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

314
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:33,217
Let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

315
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,801
-Look out.
-She's movin'.

316
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,970
-She's wakin' up.
-What'll we do?

317
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,430
Hide.

318
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,436
Oh, dear.

319
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,607
I wonder if the children are...

320
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:52,611
Oh!

321
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,954
Why, why, you're little men!

322
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,253
How do you do?

323
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,469
-I said, how do you do?
-How do you do what?

324
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,848
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

325
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,601
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

326
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,604
I know, you're Doc.

327
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:31,483
Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.

328
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:35,487
And you're, you're Bashful.

329
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,991
Oh, gosh!

330
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:43,871
And you, you're Sleepy.

331
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,956
How'd you guess?

332
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,002
And you?

333
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,214
And you're Sneezy.

334
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:02,681
-Yes, and you must be...
-Happy, ma'am. That's me.

335
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,642
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

336
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:09,354
-You mean he can't talk?
-He don't know. He never tried.

337
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,815
Oh, that's too bad.

338
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,487
Oh!

339
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,656
You must be Grumpy.

340
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,409
Oh, yes! Yes!

341
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,871
Hah! We know who we are.

342
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,208
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

343
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,085
Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

344
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,339
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

345
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,008
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

346
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,843
-Snow White?
-The Princess?

347
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,053
Yes.

348
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:45,599
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Princess.

349
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,185
We're, we're honored.
Yes, we're, we're...

350
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,271
-Mad as hornets!
-Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

351
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:55,108
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

352
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,402
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

353
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:00,197
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

354
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,076
-Who's... Gutter...
-Shut up and tell her to get out!

355
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,703
Please don't send me away!

356
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,872
-If you do, she'll kill me.
-Kill you?

357
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,082
-Who will?
-Yes, who?

358
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,209
-My stepmother, the Queen.
-The Queen?

359
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,794
-She's wicked!
-She's bad!

360
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,964
-She's mighty mean!
-She's an old witch!

361
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,632
I'm warnin' ya.

362
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,551
If the Queen finds her here,

363
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:24,096
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

364
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,765
But she doesn't know where I am!

365
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,726
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

366
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,437
She's full of black magic.

367
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,607
She can even make herself invisible.

368
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,445
Might be in this room right now.

369
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,286
Oh, she'll never find me here.

370
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,914
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

371
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:53,625
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

372
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,918
Cook?

373
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,588
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?

374
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,257
-Apple dumplings!
-Eh, yes!

375
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,925
Crapple dumpkins.

376
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,178
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

377
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,431
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!

378
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,121
Soup!

379
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,623
Hooray!

380
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,308
Just a minute.

381
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:56,396
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

382
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:59,316
Wash? Wash?

383
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,986
-Wash? Wash? Wash?
-Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

384
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:08,659
-Why wash?
-What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

385
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,744
'Tain't New Year's.

386
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:13,997
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

387
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,666
Perhaps we...

388
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:20,879
-Yes! Perhaps we have.
-But when?

389
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,424
When? When. You said whe...

390
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:29,429
Why, last week. Why, recently!

391
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,684
Yes, recently!

392
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,187
Oh, recently!

393
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,524
Let me see your hands.

394
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,032
Let me see your hands!

395
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:57,749
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

396
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,755
Come on, let's see them.

397
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,968
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

398
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:09,887
And you?

399
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,559
Worse than I thought!

400
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,231
How shocking!

401
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,320
Goodness me, this will never do.

402
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:32,409
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

403
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,948
Well, aren't you going to wash?

404
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,786
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

405
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,632
Did you hurt yourself?

406
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,646
Hah, women!

407
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,483
Courage, men, courage.

408
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,653
Don't be nervous.

409
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,200
Gosh, it's wet!

410
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,871
It's cold, too!

411
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,665
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

412
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:04,501
Well, it'll please the Princess.

413
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,004
I'll take a chance for her!

414
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,380
Me, too!

415
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,758
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

416
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,012
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

417
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:17,264
and they'll walk all over ya!

418
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:20,851
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

419
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:24,104
-How hard do ya scrub?
-Will our whiskers shrink?

420
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,522
Do ya get in the tub?

421
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:28,108
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

422
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:31,361
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

423
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:34,281
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace

424
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:37,201
Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place

425
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:40,954
Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face and go...

426
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,877
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff

427
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,379
Work up a lather
And when you got enough

428
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,550
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...

429
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:58,472
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub

430
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,391
You sputter and splash
all over the tub

431
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:04,311
You may be cold
and wet when you're done

432
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,272
But you gotta admit
it's good and clean fun

433
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:10,234
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick

434
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,737
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick

435
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,407
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

436
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,675
Hah! Next thing ya know

437
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,928
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

438
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:42,474
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom."

439
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:12,296
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

440
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,384
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

441
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,834
Get him!

442
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,087
Hey, let go of me!

443
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,840
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

444
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,009
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

445
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:01,929
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

446
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:04,515
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

447
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:09,394
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

448
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:15,859
Get the soap!

449
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:28,539
-Hey, steady, men.
-We'll get him there. We'll get him.

450
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,715
Never say die. Never say die.

451
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,300
You don't...

452
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,283
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied

453
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:06,910
That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried

454
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:11,081
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...

455
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,265
Ain't he sweet?

456
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,101
Smells like a petunia.

457
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,604
He sure is cute!

458
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,940
You'll pay dearly for this!

459
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:38,775
Supper!

460
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,946
-Supper!
-Food. Hooray!

461
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:47,951
Hah!

462
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,471
Magic Mirror on the wall,

463
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,849
who now is the fairest one of all?

464
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,811
Over the seven jeweled hills

465
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,481
beyond the seventh fall,

466
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:19,983
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

467
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:24,821
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

468
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,993
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

469
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,663
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

470
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:36,166
Behold her heart.

471
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,711
Snow White still lives,

472
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:41,922
the fairest in the land.

473
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:46,760
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

474
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,388
The heart of a pig!

475
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,015
Then I've been tricked!

476
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,457
The heart of a pig!

477
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,085
The blundering fool!

478
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:23,881
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

479
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,884
in a disguise so complete

480
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:30,429
no one will ever suspect.

481
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:37,644
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

482
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:42,107
change my queenly raiment
to a peddlerâ€™s cloak.

483
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,904
Mummy dust to make me old.

484
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,408
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

485
00:49:55,412 --> 00:50:00,167
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

486
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:11,595
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

487
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,768
A blast of wind

488
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,355
to fan my hate!

489
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,108
A thunderbolt

490
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:29,154
to mix it well.

491
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,199
Now,

492
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,286
begin thy magic spell.

493
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:00,978
Look!

494
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:03,313
My hands!

495
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,654
My voice!

496
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:13,907
My voice.

497
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:21,039
A perfect disguise.

498
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,045
And now...

499
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:31,049
A special sort of death

500
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:33,677
for one so fair.

501
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:36,388
What shall it be?

502
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,602
A poisoned apple!

503
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,438
Sleeping Death.

504
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,751
I'd like to dance and tap my feet

505
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,753
But they won't keep in rhythm

506
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:53,924
You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em

507
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:57,928
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

508
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,640
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

509
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,279
I...

510
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,537
Oh, gosh!

511
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:32,296
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb

512
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:36,508
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him

513
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:40,512
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

514
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:44,391
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

515
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:57,506
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

516
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,591
Watch... Watch...

517
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,012
Thanks.

518
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,561
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

519
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,521
Hey! Hey!

520
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,114
Hooray!

521
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,947
That was fun!

522
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,782
Now you do something.

523
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:48,492
Well, what shall I do?

524
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:52,120
-Tell us a story.
-Yes, tell us a story.

525
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:55,165
-A true story.
-A love story.

526
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:59,294
Well, once there was a princess.

527
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,964
Was the princess you?

528
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,133
-And she fell in love.
-Was it hard to do?

529
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:07,427
Oh, it was very easy.

530
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,764
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

531
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,975
The only one for me.

532
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:15,644
Was he strong and handsome?

533
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,479
Was he big and tall?

534
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:21,316
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

535
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,443
Did he say he loved ya?

536
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,571
Did he steal a kiss?

537
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:28,824
He was so romantic

538
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:33,829
I could not resist

539
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:49,052
Some day my prince will come

540
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:54,892
Some day we'll meet again

541
00:57:55,642 --> 00:58:01,607
And away to his castle we'll go

542
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:05,986
To be happy forever

543
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:08,197
I know

544
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:11,491
Hah! Mush!

545
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,539
Some day when spring is here

546
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:23,712
We'll find our love anew

547
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:29,384
And the birds will sing

548
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:35,224
And wedding bells will ring

549
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:42,105
Some day when my dreams

550
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:46,193
Come true

551
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,791
Oh, my goodness!

552
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:02,793
It's past bedtime.

553
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,878
Go right upstairs to bed.

554
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,466
Wait! Hold on there, men!

555
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,597
The Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

556
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,224
But where will you sleep?

557
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:22,104
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in...in...

558
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,355
In a pig's eye!

559
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:26,608
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...

560
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:29,403
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

561
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:32,573
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

562
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,576
Now don't you worry about us.

563
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:40,706
-We'll be all right, ma'am.
-Go right on up now, my dear.

564
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,000
Well, if you insist.

565
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:46,587
Good night.

566
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,505
Good night, Princess.

567
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,510
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

568
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,847
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

569
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:59,975
Well, pleasant dreams.

570
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:02,978
Pleasant dreams.

571
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:09,193
Let go!

572
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,111
-I saw it first!
-Now, men, don't get excited.

573
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,530
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

574
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,949
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

575
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:33,800
Bless the seven little men
who have been so kind to me.

576
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:38,347
And... And may my dreams come true.

577
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,057
Amen.

578
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,520
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

579
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,356
Hah! Women!

580
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,697
A fine kettle of fish!

581
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,471
Dip the apple in the brew.

582
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:46,934
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

583
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,656
Look! On the skin!

584
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,826
The symbol of what lies within.

585
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:10,165
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

586
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,001
To make her hunger for a bite.

587
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,881
Have a bite?

588
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:23,136
It's not for you.

589
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:25,514
It's for Snow White.

590
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,268
When she breaks the tender peel

591
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,104
to taste the apple in my hand,

592
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,899
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

593
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:39,862
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

594
01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:44,074
But wait!

595
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:48,036
There may be an antidote.

596
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,247
Nothing must be overlooked.

597
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,043
Oh, here it is!

598
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:07,890
"Love's First Kiss."

599
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:11,727
No fear of that.

600
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:14,688
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

601
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,275
She'll be buried alive!

602
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,372
Buried alive!

603
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:45,427
Thirsty?

604
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,596
Have a drink!

605
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:49,825
Now, don't forget, my dear.

606
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:52,578
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

607
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,705
full of witchcraft.

608
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,999
So beware of strangers.

609
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,169
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

610
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:04,339
See you tonight.

611
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:09,178
Yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

612
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,350
Be awful careful

613
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,188
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

614
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:23,400
-Good-bye.
-Oh, gosh!

615
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,404
Hah! Disgustin'!

616
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:31,158
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...

617
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:32,784
To wa...

618
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,578
Watch out.

619
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,331
Thanks.

620
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,862
Well... All right.

621
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,784
But that's the last... Wha...

622
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,371
Oh, go on. Run along.

623
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,210
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

624
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:26,839
Heigh-ho

625
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,049
Good-bye! Good-bye!

626
01:07:30,634 --> 01:07:34,972
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

627
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:38,308
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

628
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:19,933
Good-bye, Grumpy!

629
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:33,906
The little men will be away

630
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:36,533
and she'll be all alone

631
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:40,537
with a harmless old peddler woman.

632
01:08:42,872 --> 01:08:46,084
A harmless old peddler woman!

633
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:00,974
Some day my prince will come

634
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:06,729
Some day we'll meet again

635
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:11,652
And away to his castle we'll go

636
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:16,823
To be happy forever I know

637
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:24,413
Some day when spring is here

638
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:29,336
We'll find our love anew

639
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:34,006
And the birds will sing

640
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:39,095
And wedding bells will ring

641
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:43,600
Some day when my dreams

642
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,854
Come true

643
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:57,030
All alone, my pet?

644
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:00,659
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

645
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,371
The, the little men are not here?

646
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,457
No, they're not, but...

647
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:12,671
Making pies?

648
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,632
Yes, gooseberry pies.

649
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:17,968
It's apple pies

650
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:21,305
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

651
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:26,727
Pies made from apples like these.

652
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:31,815
-Oh, they do look delicious.
-Yes!

653
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:35,360
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

654
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,742
Like to try one?

655
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:47,247
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

656
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,591
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

657
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:00,552
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

658
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:04,264
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

659
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,061
There, there. I'm sorry.

660
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,064
Oh! My heart!

661
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,108
Oh, my... My poor heart.

662
01:11:16,026 --> 01:11:19,029
Take me into the house and let me rest.

663
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:22,282
A drink of water, please.

664
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:54,273
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

665
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:58,610
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

666
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,948
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

667
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,339
Hey, look!

668
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,598
-Stop that!
-Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

669
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,516
Go on! Get outta here!

670
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:36,690
What ails these crazy birds?

671
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:38,942
They've gone plumb daffy.

672
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:40,861
Yeah, they've...

673
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:50,787
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

674
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:53,999
I'll share a secret with you.

675
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,668
This is no ordinary apple.

676
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:59,379
It's a magic wishing apple.

677
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:02,216
A wishing apple?

678
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:03,675
Yes!

679
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:08,722
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

680
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:11,808
-Really?
-Yes, girlie.

681
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,978
Now, make a wish

682
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,397
and take a bite.

683
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,150
-Go on, get!
-These pesky critters won't stop.

684
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:21,902
-'Tain't natural.
-There's something wrong.

685
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:24,863
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

686
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:28,742
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

687
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:30,536
-The Queen!
-Snow White!

688
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:33,038
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

689
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,582
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

690
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,167
-She'll kill her!
-What'll we do?

691
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,419
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

692
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:42,756
Come on! Giddap!

693
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:54,685
Wait for me! Wait for...

694
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:13,120
There must be something
your little heart desires.

695
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,540
Perhaps there's someone you love.

696
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:19,209
Well, there is someone.

697
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:21,628
I thought so. I thought so!

698
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,550
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

699
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:29,469
Now, take the apple, dearie,

700
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,138
and make a wish.

701
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,059
I wish... I wish...

702
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:38,437
That's it, go on! Go on.

703
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,162
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

704
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:59,583
where we will live happily ever after.

705
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,586
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

706
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,259
Don't let the wish grow cold!

707
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:14,014
Oh, I feel strange.

708
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:19,102
-Her breath will still.
-Oh. Oh.

709
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:23,482
-Her blood congeal.
-Oh.

710
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:37,829
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

711
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:48,006
Hurry, hurry.

712
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,472
There she goes!

713
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:16,869
After her!

714
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:49,067
I'm trapped! What will I do?

715
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,321
The meddling little fools!

716
01:16:57,201 --> 01:17:01,163
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.

717
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:05,000
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!

718
01:17:06,418 --> 01:17:08,086
Look out!

719
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:19,676
-One song
-One song

720
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:24,223
I have but one song

721
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:26,892
-One song
-One song

722
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:31,730
-Only for you
-For you

723
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:34,858
One heart

724
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,529
Tenderly beating

725
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:42,407
Ever entreating

726
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:48,372
-Constant and true
-So true

727
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:51,834
-One love
-One love

728
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,921
That has possessed me

729
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:59,508
-One love
-One love

730
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:04,888
-Thrilling me through
-So true

731
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:08,100
-One song
-One song

732
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:12,729
-My heart keeps singing
-Keeps singing

733
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:18,110
-Of one love
-One love

734
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:24,616
Only for you...

735
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:56,732
And away to his castle you'll go

736
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:02,821
To be happy forever we know

737
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:42,653
Good-bye.

738
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:47,783
Good-bye, Grumpy.

739
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:50,035
Good-bye.

740
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,044
Oh, Dopey.

741
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,675
Good-bye!

742
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:26,154
Some day when spring is here

743
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:31,910
We'll find our love anew

744
01:22:32,035 --> 01:22:36,206
And the birds will sing

745
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:40,919
And wedding bells will ring

746
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:45,215
Some day when my dreams

747
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:48,552
Come true!
