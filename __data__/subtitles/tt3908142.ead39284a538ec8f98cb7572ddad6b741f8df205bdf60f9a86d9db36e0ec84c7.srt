1
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,090
- I'm starting a new life.

2
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:38,414
Up here where it's quiet and
clean among the redwoods.

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,250
And almost no one knows me.

4
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:19,704
Poor Jerry.

5
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,212
I had a nervous breakdown
after he left me.

6
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,801
They say I'm cured now.

7
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,681
But I still have intrusive
thoughts.

8
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,734
My therapist told me that
I'm not unusual at all.

9
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,780
People are abused all over the
world

10
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:53,822
every day

11
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,575
much worse than me

12
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,079
and they do fine.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,877
- Your tail light's out, Miss.

14
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,880
- Oh, thank you for letting me
know.

15
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,467
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

16
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,638
- I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

17
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,766
- Thank you, Officer.

18
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,853
- You drive safely.

19
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,339
- When Jerry left me,
I devoured everything

20
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,592
I could about how to get your
man back.

21
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:41,055
According to the experts,
men are very fragile.

22
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:48,687
They can get crushed down if
you assert yourself in any way.

23
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,983
You have to be very tricky.

24
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,822
- Elaine?

25
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:40,990
Hi, I'm Trish.

26
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,825
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet
you.

27
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,743
- Oh, you're so pretty.

28
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,787
Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.

29
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,372
I'm married and everything.

30
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,833
- No, I didn't think anything.

31
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,086
- Well, let me help you with
your bags.

32
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,671
Is this all you've got?

33
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:56,672
- For now.

34
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,841
My art supplies are
being shipped over later.

35
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,050
- So you're an artist?

36
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,092
- Yes, I am.

37
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,262
- I'm an interior decorator.

38
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,346
- Oh, really?

39
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,638
- Yes.

40
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,982
That's how I met Barbara.

41
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,234
I decorated this apartment.

42
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,528
It was lucky I still had the
keys.

43
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,449
Barbara didn't exactly
know when she'd be back.

44
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,588
How do you know Barbara?

45
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,840
- We used to dance
together in San Francisco.

46
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,924
- Oh, really?

47
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,309
Well, I hope you like the
apartment.

48
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,270
It's a bit garish but
Barbara wanted it that way.

49
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,315
She had me take all of the
colors from the Thoth Tarot deck

50
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,650
and she and her students did
a bunch of occult paintings

51
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,902
for me to hang.

52
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,946
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

53
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,828
Well, this is it.

54
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,001
- Oh, Trish, I love it.

55
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,045
It's just beautiful.

56
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,087
- Really?

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,672
Oh, I'm so glad.

58
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,092
I thought I may have overdone
it.

59
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,677
- Oh no, it's exactly my taste.

60
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,429
- You must be exhausted.

61
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,056
I'm sure you want to lie down.

62
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,433
- Actually, I was thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

63
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,519
Do you know of a place around
here?

64
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,104
- There's the Victorian Tea
Room.

65
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,731
We could go together, if
you don't mind the company.

66
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,400
- Oh, how fantastic.

67
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,443
Where can I freshen up?

68
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,237
- The bedroom is through there.

69
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,239
- I'll only be a moment.

70
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,107
- What a lovely room.

71
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,900
- Yes, isn't it?

72
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,610
I love Victoriana.

73
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,780
- Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

74
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,533
- Do you have fairy
princess fantasies, Elaine?

75
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,575
- Of course.

76
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,703
We may be grown women, but
underneath

77
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,874
we're just little girls
dreaming about being carried off

78
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,293
by a prince on a white horse.

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,587
- Yes, I suppose so.

80
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,755
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

81
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,474
- I don't think I've found
my Prince Charming yet,

82
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,767
but I think I found the formula.

83
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,245
You know, I've been
studying parapsychology

84
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,398
and I understand men so
much better than I used to.

85
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,946
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

86
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,076
Then Jerry would have never left
me.

87
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,244
- Who's Jerry?

88
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,038
- My ex-husband.

89
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,168
The day he left me was
the day that I died.

90
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,340
But then I was reborn as a
witch.

91
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,220
Barbara and Gahan brought me
back to life.

92
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,390
They taught me everything I
know about magic and about men.

93
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,477
Men are like children.

94
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,104
They're very easy to please

95
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,816
as long as we give them what
they want.

96
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,817
♫ Tra la la la

97
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,154
♫ Tra la la la la di da

98
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,328
♫ I dreamed of a fairy
lady in a strange land

99
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:04,044
♫ She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men

100
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,552
♫ She wore a gown

101
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,639
♫ Of pink and purple roses

102
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,646
♫ It was so tra la la and so la
di da ♫

103
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,274
- Where were we?

104
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,528
Oh, men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

105
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,446
Well, what do men want?

106
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,951
- Just a pretty woman to
love and to take care of them

107
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,745
and to make them feel like a man

108
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,931
and to give them total freedom

109
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,583
in whatever they wanna do or be.

110
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,294
- But what about what we want?

111
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,920
How are we going to be equals
with men

112
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:50,465
if we keep catering to all of
their needs?

113
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,845
- I think that if you want
love, you have to give love.

114
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:59,016
Giving men sex is a way of
unlocking their love potential.

115
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,645
- You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

116
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,816
Your whole self-worth is
wrapped up in pleasing a man.

117
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,986
I'll admit, I used sex to get
this,

118
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,573
but I'm not proud of it.

119
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,618
A whole world doesn't
revolve around a man's needs.

120
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,870
If I gave Richard sex
every time he wanted it,

121
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,121
I'd be a wreck.

122
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,706
- Poor Richard.

123
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,794
He loves you and he wants
you and you torture him.

124
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,215
You have to give a man his
fantasy.

125
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,052
- His fantasy?

126
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,637
- Yes, his fantasy.

127
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,975
But what I'm really interested
in

128
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,017
is love.

129
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,231
You might say I'm addicted to
love.

130
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,527
I wonder if all women feel that
way?

131
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,073
- Well, it depends on
what you mean by love.

132
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,949
A husband isn't a prince,
Elaine,

133
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,327
and life isn't a fairy tale.

134
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,371
We have to face that fact.

135
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,412
- Why?

136
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,224
Maybe life could be a fairy tale

137
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,334
if you pleased your husband
more.

138
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,087
- I don't
need to please Richard.

139
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,214
Richard loves me for myself.

140
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,255
- Of course.

141
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,426
Perhaps you did find your Prince
Charming.

142
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,761
- Perhaps I did.

143
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,024
- Guess who.

144
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,612
- Richard, what are you doing
here?

145
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,115
This tea room is for ladies
only.

146
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,409
- Oh, I went to visit you at
work

147
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,660
and Julie said you were here.

148
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,246
I thought we could have lunch
together.

149
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,457
- Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

150
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,376
Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.

151
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,337
Elaine, this is my husband,
Richard.

152
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,173
- I've heard so much about you,
Richard.

153
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,801
- Nothing too horrible, I hope.

154
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,094
- On the contrary.

155
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,859
- Goddess, please,

156
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,072
send me a beautiful, sweet man

157
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,076
to love me as I love him.

158
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,458
To love me, love me,

159
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,630
love me,

160
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,466
love me,

161
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,136
love me,

162
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,305
love me,

163
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,515
love me,

164
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,976
love me.

165
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,790
Hi, are you Wendy?

166
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,710
- Yes, what can I do for you?

167
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,794
- I'm Elaine.

168
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,796
We spoke on the phone.

169
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,633
I make natural soaps
and candles and things.

170
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,051
- Elaine, right.

171
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,802
Thanks for coming by.

172
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,512
Mind if I have a look?

173
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,554
- Please do.

174
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,439
- These are nice.

175
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,443
Really nice.

176
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,199
I think these will do well in
the store.

177
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,784
- Then you'll take them?

178
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,537
- Let's start with these
and see how they do.

179
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,002
If these sell in the next
week or two, I'll order more.

180
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,044
Sound good?

181
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,672
- Yes, fantastic.

182
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,465
Thank you, Wendy.

183
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,716
- Sure, Elaine.

184
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,385
Bright blessings.

185
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,885
- People always
ask me why I'm a witch.

186
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:55,015
I tell them it's because I
want to have magical powers.

187
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,100
But it's not like it sounds.

188
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:01,271
All it is is using your
will to get what you want.

189
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,973
- Hi.

190
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:39,975
- Hi.

191
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,647
- It's a beautiful day.

192
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,732
- Yes, it is.

193
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,527
I love to be out in
nature on days like this.

194
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,362
- Oh, you like nature?

195
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
- Very much.

196
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,409
You seem like a nature type too.

197
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,330
I'll bet you like to
spend time in the woods.

198
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,664
- That's right.

199
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,124
How'd you know?

200
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,667
- I can just tell.

201
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,378
Nature is where your heart is.

202
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,382
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

203
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,553
- Whuh, that is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

204
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,349
- I'm talented that way.

205
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,311
- Well, you're right about the
city.

206
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,189
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods

207
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,191
about an hour from here.

208
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,778
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know,

209
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,404
just think and read.

210
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,158
- Do you take your wife up
there?

211
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,911
- No.

212
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,579
I'm not married.

213
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,475
- Well, you might at
least take a girl up there

214
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,834
once in a while.

215
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,586
- I do.

216
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,421
I do, once in a while.

217
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,424
- You wanna take a girl up there
now?

218
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,097
What do you mean?

219
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,559
- Well, I'm new in town

220
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,146
and I haven't seen much
of the nature around here.

221
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,481
I'll make you a nice dinner.

222
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,194
- Yes, okay, sure.

223
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,072
Uh, my car is right over there.

224
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,157
- Okay.

225
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,450
Let's go.

226
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,461
You know what I'd like to do
right now?

227
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,636
I'd like to make love
right here in the car

228
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,554
just like we were kids.

229
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,850
- Wait, wait.

230
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,272
You want some?

231
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,275
- What is it?

232
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,569
- Something I made.

233
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:44,952
- Mm.

234
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,207
Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,
that is, that is strong.

235
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750
- Finish it.

236
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,931
- Oh.

237
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,105
- No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

238
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,065
Not here.

239
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,818
Let's go inside.

240
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,124
This is beautiful.

241
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,131
I'll start the dinner.

242
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,715
- Wow.

243
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,433
This looks delicious.

244
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,436
- To nature.

245
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,084
- This is really nice, isn't it?

246
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,628
I like to come up here a lot

247
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,255
at the end of the semester to
unwind.

248
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,632
- Are you a teacher?

249
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,343
- Yeah, I teach at the
university.

250
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,345
- Oh, what do you teach?

251
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,014
- English and French literature

252
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,767
with a focus on the 18th
century.

253
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,937
- So, you must be quite a
libertine.

254
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,105
- A libertine?

255
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,899
Why would you say that?

256
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,275
- Oh, you know.

257
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,821
All of the dangerous
liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.

258
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,197
Not to mention Casanova.

259
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,826
- Well, there
were a lot of books written

260
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,494
in the 18th century.

261
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,079
- Well, is it true?

262
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,206
Are you a libertine?

263
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,499
- Yes I am.

264
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,544
I love women.

265
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,046
Does that bother you?

266
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,548
- On the contrary.

267
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,469
Oh, hmm,

268
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,516
I feel strange, dizzy.

269
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,024
What was in that drink you gave
me?

270
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,945
- Organic berries, vodka,
hallucinogenic herbs.

271
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,365
- Hallucinogenic herbs?

272
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,742
Oh, baby.

273
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,829
You are really wild.

274
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:24,380
- Would you mind if I made
myself more comfortable?

275
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,465
- Not at all.

276
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:48,613
♫ La ♫

277
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,657
- What the hell?

278
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,117
Your coat.

279
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,912
It's so bright.

280
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,248
♫ La ♫

281
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,002
- I always line my clothing.

282
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,463
- You have two selves.

283
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,092
Dark and quiet that you show the
world.

284
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,304
Who do you give that to?

285
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:15,639
The rainbow?

286
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,976
- I give the rainbow to you.

287
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,561
Right now.

288
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,901
♫ La ♫

289
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:42,291
♫ La la la ♫

290
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,048
- Oh.

291
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:54,011
- Oh.

292
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,268
♫ La la ♫

293
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,813
- Huh!

294
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,439
Oh God.

295
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,358
Oh, Elaine.

296
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,403
Look at you.

297
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,490
- You can make love to me now.

298
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,664
♫ La la la la ♫

299
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,688
- Aw, okay.

300
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,104
- What is it, Wayne?

301
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,148
What is it, baby?

302
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,485
- Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.

303
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,366
- It's all right, you're with
me, shhh.

304
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,245
- Elaine.

305
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:13,753
No woman has ever given
herself like that to me before.

306
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,589
- Life has been tough, huh?

307
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,340
- Yeah, in a way.

308
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,682
You're not like any other woman
I've met.

309
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,434
No games, no agendas.

310
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,773
You just seem to take life as it
is.

311
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,235
- Is there any other way to take
life?

312
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,988
- Well, the women I've been
with,

313
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,426
they all want you to make
a bunch of promises to 'em

314
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,911
as soon as you sleep with 'em.

315
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,956
But, how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know?

316
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:51,998
It's crazy.

317
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,959
- I know, baby.

318
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,252
I know.

319
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:02,092
- I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

320
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:06,597
But it's just 'cause no
one was ever quite right.

321
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,976
All the women that I'm
attracted to physically

322
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,562
they're never bright enough.

323
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:18,192
And all the bright ones are
homely and don't arouse me.

324
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,028
- That seems like quite a
problem.

325
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,657
- It is.

326
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,077
I feel my whole life as a loner,

327
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,038
thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

328
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,000
But now I'm not so sure.

329
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Oh, Elaine,

330
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,383
I have never felt real
love like this before.

331
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:47,221
- You're just having a
lot of emotions right now.

332
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,807
- Oh.

333
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,892
Elaine, I'm scared.

334
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,524
I'm not used to feeling
things so strongly.

335
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,110
I can't take it, I can't take
it.

336
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,654
Oh.

337
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:09,535
Elaine, I'm
sick.

338
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm sick.

339
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,707
- Hey, it's all right.

340
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,377
I've got you.

341
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,128
I love you.

342
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,341
And I'll always be here for you.

343
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,304
Try to get some sleep.

344
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,481
- Elaine.

345
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,945
Elaine, where are you?

346
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,449
Elaine, where are you?

347
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,747
- What a pussy.

348
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,623
What a baby.

349
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,959
I thought I'd found a real man,

350
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,920
but he's just like a little
girl.

351
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,671
- Elaine!

352
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,983
- No one was ever
there for me

353
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,176
when I was crying my heart out.

354
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,763
No one ever comforted me.

355
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,430
No one.

356
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,340
- Good morning, Wayne.

357
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,300
- Hi, Elaine.

358
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,434
- Here, drink this.

359
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,406
- I had such horrible dreams
last night.

360
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,451
- What did you dream about,
baby.

361
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,120
- I dreamt that I was calling
your name

362
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,039
and you didn't answer.

363
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,209
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

364
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,257
Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't
you?

365
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,886
- Of course, I love you.

366
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:18,057
- Oh God, oh God,
Elaine.

367
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,897
- Are you hungry?

368
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,984
- I don't know what I am.

369
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,820
- Well, try to get some sleep.

370
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,072
- Elaine.

371
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,326
Don't leave me.

372
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,578
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

373
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,163
I'll be right here.

374
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,566
Wayne, wake up.

375
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,109
It's late.

376
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,612
Wayne.

377
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,366
Wayne, baby, wake up.

378
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,118
Wake up.

379
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,370
Wayne.

380
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,574
- Tampons aren't gross.

381
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:43,994
Women bleed and that's a
beautiful thing.

382
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:49,208
Do you know that most men have
never even seen a used tampon?

383
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,342
Part of me can be with Wayne
now.

384
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,093
Always.

385
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,141
I don't really mind death.

386
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,310
I've buried people before.

387
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,313
People I really cared about.

388
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,113
In the end we're all just
compost anyway.

389
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,617
Everything regenerates.

390
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,706
I'd like to come back as a cat.

391
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,086
I've been so depressed since my
cat died.

392
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:38,507
His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.

393
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,593
He was my best friend.

394
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,990
- I give the rainbow to you.

395
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,034
Right now.

396
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,678
Just a minute.

397
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:57,395
Oh hi Trish.

398
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:58,938
Come on in.

399
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,232
- Hey, Elaine.

400
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,817
You look gorgeous.

401
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,527
I love what you've done with
your hair.

402
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,568
- Thank you.

403
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,696
What's up, honey?

404
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,049
- Well, I haven't been able to
reach you,

405
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,032
so I thought I'd come over

406
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,159
to see if everything was all
right.

407
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,201
- I'm fine.

408
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:13,702
Really.

409
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,748
Can I offer you something?

410
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,334
I just made some tea and cake.

411
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,169
- Just tea, thank you.

412
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,308
- Cream and sugar?

413
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,477
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

414
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,121
So, what have you been so busy
with?

415
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,289
A man, I hope.

416
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,332
- Yes, it was a man.

417
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,711
But, it didn't work out.

418
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,254
- I'm Sorry.

419
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,841
- Yes, it's a shame
and I really liked him.

420
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,387
I thought that he was the one.

421
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,389
- Well, maybe next time.

422
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,393
- Are you sure you won't have
some cake?

423
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,061
- Oh, no, thank you.

424
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,816
I just came over to check up
on you and to say good bye.

425
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,858
- Good bye?

426
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,862
Why, where are you going?

427
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,866
- Oh, just to Dallas for
a furniture convention.

428
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,452
- Is Richard going with you?

429
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,162
- No, it's just a business trip.

430
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:41,249
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

431
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,328
- Sam, give me two whiskeys on
the rocks.

432
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,871
- Sure thing, Jane.

433
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,166
Did you see the papers today?

434
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,208
- No, why?

435
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,212
- They found a body in the Eel
River.

436
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,254
- A murder?

437
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
- Maybe.

438
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,177
They found a symbol carved in
his chest.

439
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,762
Here.

440
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,726
- It's a pentagram.

441
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,895
- It's them witches again.

442
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,524
- That's what I was thinking
too, Lyle.

443
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,696
- So yeah, Barbara, that's
everything.

444
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:56,700
After Jerry died, the cops
wouldn't stop harassing me.

445
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,868
They couldn't prove anything.

446
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,830
They actually thought that I
killed him.

447
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,415
Can you believe it?

448
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,587
Anyways, San Francisco got
to be a really bad trip

449
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,838
after you left.

450
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,175
That's when I remembered you
had that extra apartment.

451
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,177
- Well, it was perfect timing.

452
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,555
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to
greet you.

453
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:19,764
That's all right.

454
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,600
Trish has been lovely.

455
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,644
And I've been getting
a lot of artwork done.

456
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,980
But I had this experience last
weekend

457
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,982
that really shook me up.

458
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,819
- Why, what happened?

459
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,905
- Well, I met this great-looking
guy.

460
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,283
And I used love magic on him.

461
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,869
Then he got really weird on me.

462
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,665
All these emotions started
flowing out of him.

463
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,960
Then he got really

464
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,337
sick.

465
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,591
- Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

466
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:57,469
That's why they don't
like heavy conversations.

467
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,679
It was probably just too much
for him.

468
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,600
All the love and the great
sex that you were giving him.

469
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,019
- I guess that's what it was.

470
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,104
But, I don't know.

471
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,399
- Honey, you have to be more
careful.

472
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,877
Maybe you shouldn't be
messing with love spells

473
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,278
in the first place, you know.

474
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,157
- Merry Meet, Elaine.

475
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,285
- Bright blessings Gahan.

476
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,057
- I heard you discussing love
spells.

477
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,975
You do have to be careful,
Elaine.

478
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,813
Love spells never work the
way you think they will.

479
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:53,358
But on a lighter note, it's
wonderful to see you, Elaine.

480
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,652
What's it been now, a year?

481
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:59,531
We must celebrate this
reunion of dear friends.

482
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,866
Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,

483
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,496
for the blessings that we share.

484
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,748
- Blessed be, Hurrahya!

485
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,711
- Go home, witches.

486
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,337
Go home.

487
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,716
- Just ignore them.

488
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,426
They're always giving us
trouble.

489
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,178
- I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

490
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,472
- Well, it's certainly not San
Francisco.

491
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,933
But it's not bad for a small
town.

492
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,727
Not all of them embrace our
methods

493
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,603
of practicing witchcraft.

494
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,441
But, I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

495
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,777
Back in the day, we all made
love freely

496
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,031
and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic

497
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,577
about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or a Thelemite

498
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,496
or a Druid or a Wiccan or
whatever.

499
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,665
And it was fun.

500
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,836
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

501
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:01,760
- What have you been teaching?

502
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:05,096
- Let's see, I've got a
new class on sigil magic

503
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:08,641
and Barbara's got a new
class on organite alchemy.

504
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:10,977
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples,

505
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,813
energy grounding,
Earth-based spirituality,

506
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,648
pagan arts and crafts,

507
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:19,819
candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism,

508
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:23,740
herbs and spices, and
sex magic, of course.

509
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,202
- Oh, are you still teaching
that?

510
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:31,414
- Yes, in fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight

511
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:35,418
for a seminar about the
power of sexual dancing.

512
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:40,256
Dancing is such a powerful
thing for women and girls.

513
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,592
- Are you still dancing?

514
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,511
- Yeah, some of us dance
here on Amateur Night.

515
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,845
You should come.

516
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:49,349
- Hi, Barbara.

517
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,390
Hi, Gahan.

518
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:51,893
Sorry we're late.

519
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,022
- Hello lovely ladies, please
have a seat.

520
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:01,319
Elaine, this is Star and her
sister Moon.

521
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,363
They're our students for
tonight.

522
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,865
Girls, this is our dear friend
Elaine.

523
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:06,907
- Hi.

524
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,116
- Hi.

525
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,829
- I was just pointing out that
dancing

526
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,748
is a powerful thing for women
and girls.

527
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,291
We asked you to meet us here
tonight

528
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,794
so you could learn about that.

529
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,966
Do you see how powerful that
girl is?

530
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,178
These men would do anything for
her.

531
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,182
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

532
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,434
Then let us begin.

533
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:38,147
All witches need to figure
out where their power lies.

534
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,192
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power

535
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,027
lies in her sexuality.

536
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,991
We don't view this power as
Satanic or anti-feminist,

537
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:52,662
but as a celebration of
woman as a natural creature.

538
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:57,166
An earthly body, a spiritual
essence, and a womb.

539
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,213
- The whole history of
witchcraft is interwoven

540
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:05,049
with the fear of female
sexuality.

541
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,261
They burned us at the
stake because they feared

542
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,556
the erotic feelings we elicited
in them.

543
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:14,893
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage

544
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:19,063
and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls

545
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,066
never asking us what we wanted.

546
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,570
- They teach us that a
normative human being

547
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:28,406
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic
male

548
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:32,368
and that women's emotions
and intuitions are illnesses

549
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,203
that need to be cured.

550
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,833
And we believe that men
and women are different

551
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,921
and that true equality
lies in that difference.

552
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,924
- We strive for male/female
polarity and to regain

553
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,717
our primal power as goddesses.

554
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,596
We need to teach men how to love
us

555
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,390
using ways they can understand.

556
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,517
So goddesses, use perfume,

557
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,771
wear high heels and makeup,

558
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:04,067
learn to dress your
hair in attractive ways,

559
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:08,154
display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

560
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,115
Be a mother and a lover.

561
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:16,412
Stand your ground, but always
let the man feel like a man.

562
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:22,502
- Use sex magic to destroy his
fear of you

563
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:26,089
and to open his heart to
the floodgates of love.

564
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,801
Only then will he begin to
see you as a human being

565
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,345
with all of your inner beauty.

566
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,764
Then, when his heart is open to
love,

567
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,767
you may do with him what you
will.

568
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,416
- I love you, Elaine.

569
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,793
You know that, don't you?

570
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,880
I love you very much.

571
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,803
But you need to be more careful.

572
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,517
Dinner was late three times this
week.

573
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,770
And that house is a total
pigsty.

574
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:27,025
Do you know that I found an old
hot dog

575
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,318
under the bed this morning?

576
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,907
And why don't you ever brush
your hair?

577
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:39,078
You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.

578
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,207
I'm embarrassed to have people
over.

579
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,877
I've been really patient up
until now,

580
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,713
but you need to step up your
game.

581
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,135
- I have a
crazy bitch for a daughter.

582
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:56,888
What?

583
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,557
You're not crazy?

584
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,602
Well, if you're not
crazy then you're stupid.

585
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,436
Which is it?

586
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,980
Are you crazy or are you stupid?

587
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,232
And you could lose a few pounds.

588
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,735
You're looking a little fatty.

589
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:17,867
- Oh my God, Elaine,
you've lost so much weight.

590
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,536
You have such a hot body now.

591
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,832
Do you like it when I touch you
like this?

592
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:25,917
Or like this?

593
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,922
I wanna make you come.

594
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,428
- Don't be frightened, Elaine.

595
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,347
I would never hurt you.

596
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,933
I'm not the big, bad wolf.

597
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,604
You need to have perfect
love and perfect trust.

598
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,812
- Hast thou the courage to make
the essay?

599
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:31,983
- I have two words, perfect
love and perfect trust.

600
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,880
- Assist me to erect the ancient
altar

601
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,216
at which in days past all
worshiped.

602
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:02,680
For in the old times, a woman
was the altar.

603
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,143
And the sacred place was
the point within the center

604
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:10,479
of the circle, the origin of all
things.

605
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,402
Therefore, should we adore it.

606
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,143
- Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

607
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:51,270
Congratulations on your
promotion.

608
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,688
- Thanks, Connie.

609
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,982
Is there any coffee.

610
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,651
- Yeah, I just made some.

611
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:59,570
I made it just the way you like
it.

612
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,823
- Is there anything you don't do
well?

613
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,577
- Why don't you try me
sometime and find out?

614
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,626
- How's the coffee, Steve?

615
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,044
- Uh, too strong.

616
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,924
- Well, I like it strong.

617
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,761
Man's gotta stay awake
on the job after all.

618
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,181
- Why, have you been keeping
late nights?

619
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,223
- Maybe so.

620
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,063
- But, now that you've been
promoted,

621
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,108
maybe you ought to start
thinking about settling down.

622
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,609
- Me, you kidding?

623
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:48,786
- Sergeant Meadows, a
lady's here to see you.

624
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,538
- I'm Shelly Curtis.

625
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:54,709
I phoned about Wayne Peters,
the teacher who disappeared.

626
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:56,460
- Yes, of course.

627
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,005
Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

628
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,677
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

629
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,055
- Yes, no one's seen him for two
weeks.

630
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,851
I went by his house and
the mail's piled up.

631
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,854
We had lunch the day he
disappeared.

632
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:19,317
I saw him drive away with a
strange woman near the plaza.

633
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,320
- Do you have any idea where
he might have gone with her?

634
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,738
- Wayne used to spend weekends

635
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,574
up in a cabin he had in the
woods.

636
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,202
He used to take dates there.

637
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,071
- Oh, Jesus.

638
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,879
♫ La ♫

639
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,802
- Hey Griff, look.

640
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,221
- Good lord.

641
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,557
♫ La ♫

642
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:40,981
- What the hell is this?

643
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,942
♫ La ♫

644
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,193
- I don't know.

645
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,619
We're going to have to dig,
Steve.

646
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:54,661
- I know.

647
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:00,793
♫ La ♫

648
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,173
I think you should go
back to the house, Shelly.

649
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,433
♫ La ♫

650
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,572
- Mmm, mmm,

651
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,289
this cake is absolutely
fantastic.

652
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,332
And what a great dinner.

653
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,374
- Thank you.

654
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,335
I enjoy cooking.

655
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,465
Hope you don't mind my calling
you.

656
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,468
Sometimes it's so hard to be
alone.

657
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,552
- Not at all.

658
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:57,224
I get a little lonely, too,
when Trish is out of town.

659
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,400
- How long have you
and Trish been married?

660
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,611
- 10 years this September.

661
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,652
- 10 years!

662
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,157
It's really amazing.

663
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:19,330
No one has ever loved me the
way you love Trish, no one.

664
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,714
- What about your husband?

665
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,342
- My husband never loved me.

666
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,428
He couldn't wait to get away
from me.

667
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,262
- I'm sorry.

668
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,985
Sometimes I think Trish would
like to get away from me, too.

669
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,861
- Poor baby.

670
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:54,615
Poor, poor baby.

671
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,731
So, tell me, what turns you on?

672
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:33,445
- What turns me on?

673
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:36,949
Wow, no one's ever asked me that
before.

674
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,033
Let me think.

675
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:43,122
You know what really turns me
on?

676
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,414
Flying.

677
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,124
- Flying?

678
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,294
- Yeah, flying a plane.

679
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,255
You don't know what kinda high
it is.

680
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:54,216
You're soarin' up there above
everything.

681
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,926
You're in control.

682
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,595
- Oh, how fantastic.

683
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,180
- It really is.

684
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:05,394
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

685
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:09,565
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

686
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,821
I feel like my life is slipping
away

687
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,282
and there's so many things I
haven't done.

688
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,324
- Like what?

689
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,160
- I've never had any sordid love
affairs

690
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,495
or gotten into any mischief.

691
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,166
I used to watch those
old Steve McQueen movies,

692
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,419
you know, the ones where
they'd rob a bank or something,

693
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,061
and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those

694
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:36,216
crazy kinda gangsters with a
sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

695
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:41,430
Or those Westerns, when
they'd shoot up a town

696
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,975
and then go visit the local
prostitutes.

697
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,019
It's sounds stupid, I know.

698
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,395
- No, it doesn't.

699
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:51,899
It's very sweet.

700
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,942
- Really?

701
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,822
Trish doesn't think so.

702
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:02,701
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

703
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:06,372
- That's because she
doesn't understand you.

704
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,916
I understand you perfectly.

705
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,001
- You do?

706
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,169
- Of course.

707
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,966
You wanna have a sordid love
affair.

708
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,595
You wanna get into some
mischief.

709
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,192
- Uh.

710
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,003
- Ho!

711
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,490
Who are you?

712
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,452
What are you doing to me?

713
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,704
- I'm the love witch.

714
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,667
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

715
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,127
- That's right.

716
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,338
That's right.

717
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,515
- Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

718
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,556
- Who?

719
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,017
- Professor King.

720
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:34,770
He specializes in black
magic and witchcraft.

721
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:35,604
He might be able to help me

722
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,439
identify some of the items we
found.

723
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,690
- It's great.

724
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,400
Did you get the lab report?

725
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:44,071
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like
heart failure.

726
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:47,324
But the toxicology report
showed traces of Jimson weed

727
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:51,495
also known as Devil's weed, a
highly toxic hallucinogenic.

728
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,747
- It's unbelievable.

729
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,707
You want me to come with you?

730
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,418
- No, this will only take a few
minutes.

731
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,046
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

732
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,381
- Mustard, mayo?

733
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,675
- Yeah and cole slaw.

734
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,093
Thanks.

735
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,134
- Done.

736
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:19,231
- Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry
to have kept you waiting.

737
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,733
- Glad to meet you, Professor.

738
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,447
Professor, this is the
bottle we found in a grave

739
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:31,618
of Wayne Peters, the one
you read about in the paper.

740
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,203
- Interesting, yes.

741
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,582
Just as I thought.

742
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,501
The contents indicate
that it's a witch bottle.

743
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:40,711
- A witch bottle?

744
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:41,896
- Yes, witches used to make them

745
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,548
for protection against curses.

746
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:48,051
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair

747
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,928
along with herbs and something
sharp

748
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:54,141
like pins or broken glass
to scare away evil spirits.

749
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,202
Witch bottles have often been
found buried in the hearths

750
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,853
of very old houses.

751
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:00,564
- Would it be safe to assume
that the person who made this

752
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:01,606
was a witch?

753
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,609
- It's very likely.

754
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,903
Witchcraft, long dormant
in civilized places,

755
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,322
has taken root again in cities.

756
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,324
There have several rituals per
year.

757
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:14,578
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

758
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:18,415
Other rituals celebrate
Summer Solstice, Litha,

759
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:22,252
or the Winter Solstice,
which they call Imbolg.

760
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,300
Here the members of a coven
kiss the devil's behind

761
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:31,136
in a mockery of Christian
rituals.

762
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:36,308
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices
a child.

763
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,186
- Does this stuff really go on
today?

764
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,354
- Yes, indeed.

765
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:44,274
Those who practice human
sacrifice are the black witches

766
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:47,277
who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers

767
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:50,656
and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

768
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,991
Law has been trying to root
out these cults for decades

769
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:55,118
but they've been unsuccessful.

770
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,287
Then there are the
white witches or Wiccans

771
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,748
who commune in nature
in the healing spirit

772
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,918
and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

773
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,128
Every city and rural
village today has pockets

774
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,630
of both black and white witches

775
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:09,216
who practice the ancient rites.

776
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:44,334
- I invoke and call upon
thee, Mighty Mother of us all.

777
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:50,173
I invoke thee to descend upon
the body of this thy servant

778
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:52,843
and priestess.

779
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,389
- Of the Mother Darksome and
Divine

780
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,975
here I charge you in this sign.

781
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:06,148
- Listen to the words of the
Great Mother.

782
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,820
She, who of old, who
was also called Artemis,

783
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:14,573
Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,
Isis,

784
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,494
and by many other names.

785
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:25,542
- Whenever ye have need of
anything,

786
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:29,713
then ye shall assemble in some
secret place and adore me,

787
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,008
who am Queen of all witches.

788
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:37,721
There shall ye assemble,
ye who are fain to learn

789
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:38,763
all sorcery.

790
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,394
Behold all acts of love and
pleasure are my rituals.

791
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:48,315
Behold I have been with
thee from the beginning

792
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:52,486
and I am that which is
attained at the end of desire.

793
01:07:56,198 --> 01:08:00,243
Bagabi lacha bachabe.

794
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:05,707
Lamac cahi achababe.

795
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,961
Hurrahya! Hurrahya!

796
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,217
- Arise.

797
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:24,059
Eko, Eko, Azarak

798
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,394
Eko, Eko, Zomelak

799
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,106
Eko, Eko, Cernunnos

800
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,775
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

801
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,809
- You're looking a little
tense tonight, love.

802
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,304
What's the matter?

803
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:06,685
- Oh nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

804
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,104
- Well, have a drink and relax.

805
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,607
Nothing's that dire, at least
not for you.

806
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,987
It's an entirely different
story for your victims.

807
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,865
- What victims?

808
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,618
- There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

809
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,662
- Please, don't touch me.

810
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,003
- Bright blessings, Barbara.

811
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,421
- Merry meet, Elaine.

812
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:35,630
How's it going?

813
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:37,632
- I'm back in the dating pool
again.

814
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,967
- What happened?

815
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,988
I thought you were crazy about
that new guy you were seeing,

816
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,305
the married man.

817
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,390
- No, I broke it off.

818
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:49,102
He just became really obsessive,
morose,

819
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:52,856
and his aura became really
murky.

820
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:57,027
He didn't even wanna make love
anymore.

821
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:01,198
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

822
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,575
There was no polarity.

823
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,119
But, I should have known.

824
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:07,287
He's a Pisces.

825
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:39,735
- Richard?

826
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,133
- I thought I told you
never to interrupt me

827
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,533
when I'm working.

828
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,786
What do you want?

829
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,015
- I just wanted to let you
know that I'm going to bed

830
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,791
and I'm taking a pill.

831
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:13,186
Are you coming to bed?

832
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:14,478
- No.

833
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:22,696
I have some more work to do.

834
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,743
- All right, see you tomorrow,
then.

835
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,878
♫ La ♫

836
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:31,181
♫ La ♫

837
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:43,193
♫ La la la la ♫

838
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,840
- Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

839
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,884
I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

840
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:08,926
- Okay.

841
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,606
- Does this look familiar to
you?

842
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,486
- It's a witch bottle.

843
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,781
- Do you have any idea
who could have made it?

844
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:31,199
- No, no I don't.

845
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,330
- Ever seen any of these in here
before?

846
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,457
- Yeah, we have some witch
bottles.

847
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,959
I'll show you one.

848
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,174
Here's one.

849
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:54,764
- How common are these bottles?

850
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,158
- I've never seen 'em in here
before until

851
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,060
a girl started supplying 'em to
us.

852
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,896
- Who is this girl?

853
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:06,151
- Her name is Elaine, Elaine
Parks.

854
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:34,344
- Who is it?

855
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:39,142
- Sergeant Meadows, Police
Department.

856
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,542
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case

857
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:49,611
and I just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

858
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,695
- About what?

859
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:53,907
- Well, it's a potential
homicide case.

860
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,658
Just a routine check.

861
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:59,162
I thought you might be able to
help us.

862
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:00,621
- Of course.

863
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,751
Please come in, Sergeant.

864
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,427
So you say there was a homicide.

865
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:15,887
How horrible.

866
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,515
Who was killed?

867
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,767
- A man named Wayne Peters.

868
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,061
Did you know Wayne Peters?

869
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,102
- No.

870
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:28,775
- Here's a picture of him.

871
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,318
Ever seen him before?

872
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
- No.

873
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,947
I guess I can't help you,
Sergeant.

874
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:34,822
Good bye.

875
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,324
- Ms. Parks, wait.

876
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:46,876
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

877
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:49,087
- It's a Magic Bottle.

878
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,505
I made it myself.

879
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,634
- Have you ever seen one
containing urine?

880
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:55,676
- Urine?

881
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,886
No.

882
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:12,652
- We found this bottle containing
urine and a used tampon

883
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,281
on the grave of Wayne Peters.

884
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,245
- Will you excuse me
for a moment, Sergeant?

885
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,128
- Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

886
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:31,503
- Yes, I am.

887
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,173
Is there a law against that?

888
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:38,011
- I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

889
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:40,305
- Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil,

890
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,223
capable of murder even?

891
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,810
- No, I wasn't trying to
imply...

892
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:49,022
- Sergeant Meadows, do
you know what it's like

893
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,440
to really suffer?

894
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:53,443
You have to fight and fight

895
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,571
until you're too exhausted to go
on.

896
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,574
Witchcraft is my religion,
Sergeant.

897
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:04,370
And this religion, which is
older than your Christianity,

898
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:05,538
saved my life.

899
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,890
- Ms. Parks, I'm sorry
if I've offended you.

900
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:27,644
I didn't realize.

901
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,192
- That's all right, Sergeant
Meadows.

902
01:17:39,656 --> 01:17:41,616
- You can call me Griff.

903
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:43,950
- Griff?

904
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,415
I know I've seen you before.

905
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,127
I just don't know where.

906
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,464
- I have that same feeling.

907
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,173
- I know.

908
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,722
You're the man in the cards.

909
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:07,308
You're my fate.

910
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,437
- What do you mean, I'm your
fate?

911
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:14,524
- I did a Celtic Cross reading.

912
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,944
For my future card I got Knight
of Wands.

913
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:24,283
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading,

914
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:27,829
I would soon meet the man
that I'm going to marry.

915
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:31,666
But, the man that I marry
has to love animals.

916
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,918
Do you like animals, Griff?

917
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,546
- Why yes, I love animals.

918
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,507
In fact, a friend of
mine has a couple horses

919
01:18:39,549 --> 01:18:41,134
I'm very fond of.

920
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,803
You know, tomorrow is my day off

921
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:47,473
and it's supposed to be quite
nice out.

922
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:51,519
Maybe I'll get away from
the city and do some riding.

923
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,855
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

924
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,425
Whoa.

925
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:51,829
- Oh Patchouli, you're such a
sweetheart.

926
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:03,800
- How's my girl?

927
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,010
- Am I your girl?

928
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:08,221
- For today you are.

929
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:10,949
You're my girl and there's
nobody around

930
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,683
to tell me otherwise.

931
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:15,602
- Except me.

932
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,523
- And what's that supposed to
mean?

933
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:21,776
- Nothing.

934
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,570
Kiss me.

935
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,833
- What's that sound?

936
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,584
- I don't know.

937
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,210
Let's go see.

938
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:06,964
- Now is the time of the Summer
Solstice.

939
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:10,092
The strength of the Oak King is
waning.

940
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:13,262
And the Holly King stands
ready to challenge him

941
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:16,015
for the hand of the Green
Maiden.

942
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,852
- Let the battle begin.

943
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:26,859
- Your season is over old man.

944
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:28,735
- Oh never.

945
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,244
- I will have her.

946
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,347
- Never have her.

947
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:40,205
- Never.

948
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,963
- Holly King, I name you the
victor.

949
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,006
The Green Maiden is yours.

950
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:50,048
- M'lady.

951
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:52,592
Come on.

952
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,016
- Elaine.

953
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,353
- You know these people?

954
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:04,146
- Well yes, in a way.

955
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:06,399
- All hail, fair Lord and Lady.

956
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,401
Welcome to our little gathering.

957
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:09,442
- All hail.

958
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,214
- We are the good people
of the Renaissance

959
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:16,367
and Medieval players and we
are celebrating the Midsummer.

960
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,868
Won't you join us?

961
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,454
- To be sure, fair consorts.

962
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:29,839
- They are charming, are they
not?

963
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,674
- Yes, quite charming.

964
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,635
- I see two people in love.

965
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:36,887
This calls for a wedding.

966
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:37,888
- A wedding?

967
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,141
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you
will.

968
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,309
To honor the gods of love.

969
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:53,863
♫ Love is a magical thing

970
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:58,492
♫ Love will make you feel
like a Queen or a King

971
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:03,080
♫ Unicorns, rainbows, lucky
charms

972
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:07,251
♫ Await you in your true love's
arms

973
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:13,883
♫ Love is a magical thing

974
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:18,471
♫ Mystical, physical, alchemical

975
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:22,725
♫ We're pretending to be in love
today

976
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:26,729
♫ But pretending is also real

977
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,985
♫ There's a lady in a castle

978
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:36,322
♫ She's sad and so forlorn

979
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:40,201
♫ When her troubadour
returns and kisses her

980
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,412
♫ She's all smiles and laughter

981
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:46,290
♫ Lady, you're so beautiful

982
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:49,919
♫ Come lie with me and be my
love

983
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,214
♫ I'd slay any dragon, endure
any danger

984
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,801
♫ Just to have you near me

985
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:01,931
♫ Love is a magical thing

986
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:07,103
♫ Lucky lovers mate in the
spring

987
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:11,607
♫ We sip from goblets full of
joy

988
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:15,778
♫ But when love dies all
life it does destroy ♫

989
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:45,807
- Okay.

990
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,183
- Now, ye are wed.

991
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:20,653
- I'm so happy for you,
Elaine, he's adorable.

992
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,353
- I'm not in love.

993
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,230
It's not that I don't have
sentiment,

994
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:58,148
it's just that love is soft.

995
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,234
You need guts in this business.

996
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:02,545
I've seen guys get shot to
death because they fell in love

997
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,196
and got soft inside.

998
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:06,490
I want an heir some day

999
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,117
and then I would need to have a
wife,

1000
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:10,327
but love is something else.

1001
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,163
A man can get destroyed
by things like that.

1002
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,749
It's like he's not even a man
anymore.

1003
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,002
I never wanna get like that.

1004
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,797
- When you really love him,

1005
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:25,509
it's like fireworks and
nothing else matters.

1006
01:28:26,302 --> 01:28:28,429
You love all the little quirks
about him.

1007
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,848
The way he slurps his cereal.

1008
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:34,184
The way his mouth is a little
crooked.

1009
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:38,314
Those details about him
become your whole life.

1010
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:41,900
Something inside you
opens up like a flower

1011
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,946
and you realize that you
have more love to give

1012
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,866
than you ever thought was
possible.

1013
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,994
'Cause the more you know him,

1014
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,039
the more you love him.

1015
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:58,018
- The more
you get to know a woman,

1016
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:00,627
the less you can feel about her.

1017
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,213
At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery

1018
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:06,550
who fulfills all you're wildest
fantasies.

1019
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:09,595
Then she starts to reveal little
flaws

1020
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:13,515
and after a while, just
gets pretty hard to care.

1021
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:17,102
Feminine ideal only
exists in a man's mind.

1022
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,981
No woman could ever fulfill it.

1023
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:24,151
And sometimes, when she
tries to love you more,

1024
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:28,155
give you more, you feel
like you're suffocating,

1025
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,200
drowning in estrogen.

1026
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:34,495
The most awful feeling.

1027
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,963
- Dinner tonight, Griff?

1028
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,299
- Um, can't tonight, Connie.

1029
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,552
Some other time.

1030
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:57,911
- Hey Griff, I got more
information

1031
01:29:57,935 --> 01:29:59,520
on that Elaine Parks girl.

1032
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:01,814
- You leave it on my desk.

1033
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,065
- Don't you wanna hear it?

1034
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:06,485
- Steve, Captain wants
us to lay off the case.

1035
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:07,903
- Are you serious?

1036
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:11,573
- He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

1037
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,992
He says they've lived
in this town a long time

1038
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,828
and he doesn't like to mess with
them.

1039
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,663
- Even if they murder?

1040
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,350
- He says he's satisfied
that Wayne's death

1041
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:21,917
was a heart attack.

1042
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:23,710
I think so too.

1043
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,008
- Has everyone gone crazy around
here?

1044
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,178
Let me at least tell you what I
found.

1045
01:30:38,142 --> 01:30:40,894
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store

1046
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,896
in Berkeley with her husband,
Jerry.

1047
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,648
Two years later they were
divorced

1048
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,233
and Elaine moved to San
Francisco

1049
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,402
to start dancing at a burlesque
club

1050
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:51,864
where she got involved with a
witch coven.

1051
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:01,498
The coven broke up
after police questioning

1052
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:04,168
when some of it's members
died mysteriously.

1053
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:08,338
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose

1054
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:12,718
shortly before he was planning
to remarry.

1055
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,303
The police questioned Elaine

1056
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:17,097
but they couldn't find enough to
hold her.

1057
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:19,892
- Well, if the San Francisco
Police couldn't find anything,

1058
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,852
what happened there is
none of our business.

1059
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:23,562
- Are you serious?

1060
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:26,023
- I'd say this woman is
a dangerous character

1061
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,108
and you better watch her.

1062
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,777
- You mean because she's a
witch?

1063
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,654
That doesn't mean anything.

1064
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:36,700
- No, her husband died of a
drug he'd never taken before.

1065
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:38,136
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters

1066
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,870
got the Devil's weed?

1067
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:43,165
- I questioned Ms. Curtis about
that.

1068
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,126
There was Devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

1069
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,837
Apparently, he experimented
often with drugs.

1070
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,964
- Come on Griff, can't
you connect the dots?

1071
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,341
We have a possible murder here

1072
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:55,010
and Elaine is our only suspect.

1073
01:31:55,052 --> 01:31:57,387
- I told you, we're laying off
her.

1074
01:31:57,429 --> 01:32:00,140
- Because of orders or because
you're in love with her?

1075
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:01,558
- Who says I'm in love with her?

1076
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,935
Get the hell off my back.

1077
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:12,027
- You're out of line,
Griff, way out of line.

1078
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,020
- Richard.

1079
01:32:50,566 --> 01:32:51,566
Richard!

1080
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,110
Richard!

1081
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,528
Richard!

1082
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:44,786
- Thank you for meeting me,
Elaine.

1083
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:47,706
It's not good for me to be alone
too much.

1084
01:33:47,748 --> 01:33:49,291
I know you're busy.

1085
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,333
- Of course.

1086
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,294
I wanted to come.

1087
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:58,258
- I can't help but blaming
myself for what happened.

1088
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,510
- You can't blame yourself.

1089
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:03,513
You were a good wife to Richard.

1090
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,433
- I tried to be.

1091
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:11,104
I tried so hard to please him,

1092
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,441
but I should have tried harder.

1093
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:18,612
He wanted a certain type of
woman, someone I could never be.

1094
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,949
Maybe you were right.

1095
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:26,828
Maybe you should give a man his
fantasy.

1096
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:32,376
I thought that was so
awful when you said that.

1097
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,836
Maybe I was being naive,

1098
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:38,674
but I really thought he loved me
for me.

1099
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:41,927
But now, now I wish...

1100
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,810
- You have to stop torturing
yourself.

1101
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:51,687
You have to let go.

1102
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:56,358
Remember how he changed
after my Dallas trip?

1103
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,861
I think that's when he
started having that affair.

1104
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:02,864
Whoever she was she drove him
crazy.

1105
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:06,618
I hated him so much for that.

1106
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:09,788
I wanted to kill them both.

1107
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:14,626
If I ever found out who she
was, I would rip her to pieces.

1108
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,672
But now I see I should have
helped him.

1109
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:23,385
I didn't know that he was
going to take his own life.

1110
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,928
- Hey,

1111
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:27,888
hey.

1112
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,601
- Enough about me.

1113
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,397
What's going on with you?

1114
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:37,149
- Trish, I'm in love.

1115
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:41,777
- Who is he?

1116
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:45,240
- He's a detective and he's
everything

1117
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:47,451
a woman could ever want.

1118
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:51,955
He's strong and handsome, smart
and kind.

1119
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,085
I just know that he's the one.

1120
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:00,297
He even gave me this ring.

1121
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:02,549
I call it my magic ring.

1122
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:04,551
It's not an engagement ring

1123
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:08,722
but I just know that he's
gonna pop the question soon.

1124
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:25,405
- When we first came here

1125
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:28,909
I showed you my engagement ring,
remember?

1126
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:32,829
I can barely stand to look at it
anymore.

1127
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:34,247
It's too painful.

1128
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,628
I'm sure he's going to ask you
soon.

1129
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:43,089
You're going to make a beautiful
bride.

1130
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,841
The first day we met,

1131
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:49,012
you were envious of me because I
had a man

1132
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:50,931
and you were all alone.

1133
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,600
Now it's the reverse.

1134
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,395
Life is funny, isn't it?

1135
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:02,859
- Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta
go.

1136
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,779
Would you like to walk out with
me?

1137
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:09,533
- No, I'd like to stay and
finish my tea.

1138
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:10,574
- All right.

1139
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:14,871
Take care, love.

1140
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,080
- Hi Elaine, it's me.

1141
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,583
Yeah, you left your ring here.

1142
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:03,044
You're probably driving but
I'll drop it by on my way home.

1143
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,713
See you in a minute.

1144
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:27,504
♫ La

1145
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:32,842
♫ la la la la la

1146
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:43,353
♫ La la la la la ♫

1147
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:29,244
- You bitch.

1148
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,916
You killed my husband.

1149
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:38,588
Bitch, skank, whore.

1150
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:55,021
You'll burn for this.

1151
01:44:05,365 --> 01:44:07,158
- Crash, crash, crash.

1152
01:44:08,785 --> 01:44:12,914
Die, die, die.

1153
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:16,834
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1154
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:20,713
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1155
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:24,425
Eko, Eko, Aradia!

1156
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:28,513
Eko, Eko, Azarak!

1157
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:32,517
Eko, Eko, Zomelak!

1158
01:45:01,379 --> 01:45:03,756
- Oh Habondia, bind these two

1159
01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:07,010
with a heady lovers' brew.

1160
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:10,513
Even should they strive to flee

1161
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:13,099
they'll cling for all eternity.

1162
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:25,944
- Scotch.

1163
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,672
- Bottle o' beer, Sam.

1164
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,473
Who are those new girls?

1165
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,100
They can't dance at all.

1166
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:57,602
And they're weird.

1167
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:06,778
- I don't know, but the
customers really like 'em.

1168
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,905
- They're friends of the
witches.

1169
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:11,157
I seen them come in together
before.

1170
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:12,825
- Yeah, the witches.

1171
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:15,828
They're everywhere.

1172
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:17,997
- One gin and tonic, Sam.

1173
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:20,166
- Gin and tonic coming up.

1174
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,793
- Did you read about the teacher

1175
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:24,337
buried in the back yard of his
cabin?

1176
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:26,631
They said it was done by the
witches.

1177
01:46:26,672 --> 01:46:28,132
- Oh yeah, I read about that.

1178
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:31,302
They found all kinds of
witchcraft things on the grave.

1179
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:33,596
- Yeah, I heard about that, too.

1180
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:34,638
Creepy.

1181
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:54,033
- Sit down, Elaine.

1182
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:04,836
Elaine, the DNA came back from
the lab.

1183
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,966
It connects you with Wayne
Peters.

1184
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:15,263
Patricia Manning came by the
station.

1185
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:17,014
With some things of yours.

1186
01:47:18,891 --> 01:47:20,101
Including this.

1187
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:25,773
She said you drove her husband
to suicide.

1188
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:31,112
- So, I was a bad girl.

1189
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:34,031
Are you going to punish me?

1190
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:38,953
- What sort of person are you,
Elaine?

1191
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:42,623
What sort of sick mind
would do such things?

1192
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:45,168
- Why are you so negative?

1193
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,919
I didn't kill anyone.

1194
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,839
Wayne died of heart failure

1195
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:53,468
after a beautiful night of
lovemaking.

1196
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:58,014
And Richard died because
he loved me too much.

1197
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,725
These men weren't used to
the deep feelings of love

1198
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:03,102
that they were experiencing with
me.

1199
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:05,730
- Are you saying these men died
of love?

1200
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:06,898
That's insane.

1201
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:10,776
What about the spells and the
drugs?

1202
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:13,321
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

1203
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:17,283
- Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

1204
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:20,328
It can only work with
what's already there.

1205
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:23,998
I just use sex magic to create
love magic.

1206
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:27,627
I didn't know how strong
the spells would be.

1207
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:30,755
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

1208
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:31,796
- Love?

1209
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:35,301
What do you know about love?

1210
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:39,805
What you call love is a
borderline personality disorder

1211
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:41,723
or worse.

1212
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:44,101
- Don't diagnose me.

1213
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:48,397
Maybe you're a narcissist who
can't love.

1214
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:51,234
You think that I'm sick

1215
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:54,445
because you've never loved like
I have.

1216
01:48:54,904 --> 01:48:57,782
Well, I would do anything for
love.

1217
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:03,579
- That's right, you'll
never get enough love.

1218
01:49:04,664 --> 01:49:07,750
Even when a man loves
you so much it kills him,

1219
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:09,669
it's not enough for you.

1220
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:11,754
You're like a bottomless hole.

1221
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:15,925
You doll yourself up and
do the Stepford Wife thing

1222
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:20,054
thinking every man is
going to fall at your feet.

1223
01:49:20,096 --> 01:49:24,183
But your creepy little sexy
act doesn't work with me.

1224
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,229
I don't love you.

1225
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,487
- How can you stand there and
boast

1226
01:49:36,529 --> 01:49:38,739
about being immune to love?

1227
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:43,494
Why does the genuine love of
a woman scare you so much?

1228
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:47,456
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

1229
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:50,418
I know a lot of women who
feel the way that I do.

1230
01:49:50,459 --> 01:49:54,088
Only men make us work
so hard for your love.

1231
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:59,218
If you would just love us for
ourselves,

1232
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:03,055
but you won't.

1233
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,727
My ex-husband was just like you.

1234
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:12,773
He used to punish me by
withholding his love from me.

1235
01:50:13,232 --> 01:50:16,777
All my life I've been
tossed in the garbage

1236
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:20,906
except when men wanted to use my
body.

1237
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:25,369
So, I decided to find my own
power.

1238
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:29,707
And I found that power through
witchcraft.

1239
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:33,544
That means that I take
what I need from men

1240
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:35,963
and not the other way around.

1241
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:40,509
- I'm sorry, Elaine.

1242
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:45,097
It won't work this time.

1243
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:49,060
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to arrest you.

1244
01:50:49,101 --> 01:50:50,101
- What for?

1245
01:50:51,646 --> 01:50:54,940
Marrying a lover according to my
religion?

1246
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,859
Seducing a married man?

1247
01:50:57,943 --> 01:50:59,862
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned

1248
01:50:59,904 --> 01:51:02,948
for a thing like that, but not
today.

1249
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:07,662
- No, not burned,

1250
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:14,669
but you'll be booked for
burying Wayne Peters illegally

1251
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,546
and we'll find out more.

1252
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:22,802
- Oh, that's the witch
who killed the teacher.

1253
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:27,348
- Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to live.

1254
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:34,397
- Burn the witch.

1255
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,606
- Burn the witch.

1256
01:51:35,648 --> 01:51:37,775
- Burn the witch, burn
the witch, burn the witch,

1257
01:51:37,817 --> 01:51:44,573
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1258
01:51:44,657 --> 01:51:51,205
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1259
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:55,960
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1260
01:51:56,043 --> 01:52:01,257
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1261
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:07,179
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1262
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:13,561
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1263
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:15,855
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1264
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:19,150
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1265
01:52:19,191 --> 01:52:22,153
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1266
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:26,073
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1267
01:52:27,158 --> 01:52:27,992
- Burn!

1268
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:28,826
- Burn her.

1269
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:29,660
- Burn.

1270
01:52:29,702 --> 01:52:30,702
Burn.

1271
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:57,187
- Poor baby.

1272
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,565
Poor, poor baby.

1273
01:53:05,613 --> 01:53:08,574
Don't worry, everything will be
okay

1274
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,078
because I love you so much.
