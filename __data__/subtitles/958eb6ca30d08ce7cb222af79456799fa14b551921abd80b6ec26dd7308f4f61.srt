<b>There's someone on the roof.</b>

3

<b>Jules, maybe you're used to sleepwalking.</b>

4

<b>Listen.</b>

5
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,875

<b>Naturally. Channel Bose too, right?</b>

12
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:00,291
<b>Mark, stop.</b>

13
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,541

14

18

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,916
<b>Jules, it was probably</b>

26
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,208

28
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,583

30
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:41,458
<b>Who?</b>

31
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,750

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,125
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

34

49

<b>Okay, thank you.</b>

<b>Next.</b>

915

<b>Hey guys, you can call like this.</b>

916
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,083
<b>Hmm, not sure.</b>

917
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:27,666
<b>I don't think Jonathan is</b>

<b>Jonathan doesn't wear black?</b>

<b>Mr. Deathmetal?</b>

<b>I don't think he listens</b>

<b>to that anymore either.</b>

923
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:36,541
<b>Just face I guess.</b>

924
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,666
<b>All right, well then,</b>

<b>At least it's very little though.</b>

<b>Oh, sorry folks.</b>

<b>Santa's gotta go feed his reindeer.</b>

<b>You know, I'm not in charge here, so.</b>

01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:15,458
<b>Are we gonna break too or?</b>

941
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:16,291
<b>Sure.</b>

942
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,791
<b>This one's nice.</b>

<b>What are you saying?</b>

952
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:47,291
<b>Nothing.</b>

<b>Come on, ready?</b>

954
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:49,500
<b>Let's get going.</b>

<b>You okay?</b>

956
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:51,083
<b>Yeah.</b>

957
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,041
<b>Look, you know my theory of</b>

<b>You don't even know.</b>

960
01:01:58,541 --> 01:01:59,791
<b>Because you know I'm right.</b>

961
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,250
<b>Santa's shaw is the prime suspect.</b>

962
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,875
<b>Stop, that is ludicrous.</b>

963
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,416
<b>We can just look at the facts.</b>

964
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,166
<b>Do you wanna just do that?</b>

965
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,208
<b>Facts, okay, she's</b>

<b>just so happened to be obsessed</b>

972
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:17,500
<b>with Art the Clown.</b>

973
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,416
<b>And there's nobody.</b>

974
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,083
<b>How about you show me</b>

975
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,375

<b>Like how do you not see that?</b>

979
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,791
<b>Jonathan Shaw hadn't</b>

<b>testified on a sister's behalf.</b>

981
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:27,791
<b>She'd probably be serving</b>

982
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:29,250
<b>a life sentence right now.</b>

983
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:30,166
<b>You shouldn't be saying that shit.</b>

984
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:43,541
<b>(dramatic music)</b>

<b>So why'd you wanna see me right now?</b>

<b>(audience laughing)</b>

991

<b>see your little brother?</b>

994
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:15,291
<b>Actually, I was thinking,</b>

996
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,333
<b>Aunt Justice tonight?</b>

<b>How much of it did you read?</b>

1266
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:12,833
<b>Tell me.</b>

1267
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:14,916
<b>Olivette?</b>

1268
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,500
<b>Jesus. Gabby, you...</b>

1269
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,791
<b>You promised me.</b>

1270
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:21,916
<b>I'm sorry. I want to</b>

1271
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,250
<b>know what happened to you.</b>

1272
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,166
<b>Is it true?</b>

1273
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:27,708
<b>All that stuff about the</b>

1274
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,708
<b>clown and Uncle Michael.</b>

1275
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,000
<b>You saw him today, didn't you?</b>

1276
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:33,791
<b>I told them all</b>

1277
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,041
<b>that's why you freaked out.</b>

1278
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:38,250
<b>Gabby, I'm sick.</b>

1279
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,208
<b>I see things that aren't there,</b>

1280
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,416
<b>and sometimes I write</b>

1281
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,250
<b>about it in my journal</b>

1282
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,041
<b>and talk about it with</b>

1283
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:49,333
<b>people who can help me.</b>

1284
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:52,708
<b>So you didn't really chop off the clown's</b>

1285
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:53,750
<b>head with a magical sword?</b>

1286
01:18:55,083 --> 01:19:04,708
<b>Damn, that wasn't so cool.</b>

1287
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:11,291
<b>Guys, you have to promise me</b>

1288
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,875
<b>you're not going to tell anyone what you</b>

1289
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,125
<b>read in my journal, okay?</b>

1290
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:16,791
<b>Not your parents, not</b>

1291
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:17,666
<b>your friends at school.</b>

1292
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,583
<b>No one. Promise me?</b>

1293
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,500
<b>I promise.</b>

1294
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:24,291
<b>Mickey's over.</b>

1295
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,250
<b>Let's play video games</b>

1296
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,458
<b>so I can kick your ass.</b>

1297
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,583
<b>Yo, shots, Cole.</b>

1298
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,500
<b>You probably still passed out.</b>

1299
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,125
<b>Look, I just want to call</b>

1300
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:48,833
<b>and see if you're okay, man.</b>

1301
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:50,958
<b>Yeah, give me a call</b>

1302
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,416
<b>back whenever you get this,</b>

1303
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,541
<b>but if you can't reach me,</b>

1304
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,750
<b>I'll be at the beta bash, so...</b>

1305
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:56,416
<b>Peace.</b>

1306
01:19:58,583 --> 01:19:59,291
<b>You don't think I was</b>

1307
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,000
<b>that innocent before, do you?</b>

1308
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:04,666
<b>Uh, yes. Yes, I do, actually.</b>

1309
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:05,916
<b>Okay, I get it's like a</b>

1310
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,166
<b>touchy subject, you know?</b>

1311
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,625
<b>But come on, it didn't happen yesterday.</b>

1312
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,416
<b>It happened five years ago.</b>

1313
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,708
<b>Yeah, I don't think that's something you</b>

1314
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,208
<b>ever really get over.</b>

1315
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,208
<b>Well, she still didn't</b>

1316
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:15,291
<b>even sound the way she did.</b>

1317
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,958
<b>Besides, chalking it out</b>

1318
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:18,083
<b>is good therapy, I suppose.</b>

1319
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,916
<b>It's basically doing her a favor.</b>

1320
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:22,958
<b>Wow. How so, what's that about?</b>

1321
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:25,125
<b>Well, what about Jonathan?</b>

1322
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,375
<b>You think he's still willing to do it?</b>

1323
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,916
<b>I don't know, Mia.</b>

1324
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,375
<b>Cole, I want that interview.</b>

1325
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,583
<b>I mean, sitting across from someone who</b>

1326
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,583
<b>actually encountered Mark the Clown,</b>

1327
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,458
<b>the most famous serial police, Jack the</b>

1328
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:42,833
<b>Ripper, it's a story.</b>

1329
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:44,916
<b>I encountered that, um...</b>

1330
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,041
<b>What, a good mile away? What did she say?</b>

1331
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,666
<b>That Kim was on his butcher.</b>

1332
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,541
<b>You know what I mean.</b>

1333
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:53,958
<b>I want to know what it's like to be in a</b>

1334
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:56,000
<b>prison that's that kind of evil.</b>

1335
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,000
<b>What goes through your brain when he's</b>

1336
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:01,541
<b>close enough to you that you feel his</b>

1337
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:02,833
<b>breath on your body?</b>

1338
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,250
<b>What does he smell like?</b>

1339
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,750
<b>When you look into his eyes, what do you</b>

1340
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,958
<b>see? Is there a soul or...</b>

1341
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:13,958
<b>A place!</b>

1342
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:14,416
<b>He sounds...</b>

1343
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:17,916
<b>You sound like you want to fuck him.</b>

1344
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:19,458
<b>I don't want to fuck him.</b>

1345
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,750
<b>I mean, I don't know what you want with</b>

1346
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:24,750
<b>him, but you said he</b>

1347
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:25,500
<b>looks up to you, right?</b>

1348
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,000
<b>Maybe you can give it some for me.</b>

1349
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:28,500
<b>Mia.</b>

1350
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:34,083
<b>Come on. Do it for me. Please.</b>

1351
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:38,250
<b>I'll be nice. I promise.</b>

1352
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,625
<b>I'll end in just 20 minutes. Tops.</b>

1353
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,375
<b>I think it worked for your life.</b>

1354
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:59,875
<b>Well, you were very persuasive.</b>

1355
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,500
<b>I'll see you later.</b>

1356
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:10,791
<b>Okay, so remind me how to play</b>

1357
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:11,625
<b>this game. It's been a while.</b>

1358
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,791
<b>Wait. We need more players.</b>

1359
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:15,833
<b>Dad, come on.</b>

1360
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,666
<b>Dad?</b>

1361
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:42,333
<b>You're not supposed to be</b>

1362
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:43,750
<b>close. Do calls for my mic.</b>

1363
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,208
<b>You want to turn out my tears attack?</b>

1364
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:46,458
<b>Oh, no.</b>

1365
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:46,916
<b>Let me hear you,</b>

<b>please. Let me just get out.</b>

<b>He was dressed as Santa Claus and he was</b>

01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,791
<b>handing out presents to kids.</b>

1369
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:52,958
<b>Every little kid that was</b>

<b>there, I heard a commotion.</b>

1371
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,500
<b>And I saw some caroling in the guy out.</b>

1372
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,375
<b>And then bam! There was</b>

1373
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,375
<b>an explosion right there.</b>

1374
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,166
<b>Holy shit.</b>

1375
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:01,333
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

1376
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:02,625
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

1377
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:05,416
<b>It's not safe. It's not safe.</b>

1378
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:06,625
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

1379
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,958
<b>It's not safe.</b>

1380

<b>It's not safe.</b>

<b>Santa, what are you talking about?</b>

1382
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:13,666
<b>A mouse-crowding clown.</b>

01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,166
<b>I saw him. I saw him today.</b>

1384
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:18,833
<b>Listen to me. No, I saw him today.</b>

1385
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:20,000
<b>Okay, I saw him.</b>

1386
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,583
<b>And I was going to say the same thing</b>

1387
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:22,208
<b>because I knew you</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

1390
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:24,916
<b>And, um, I think he's</b>

<b>going to come for us.</b>

1392
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,583
<b>No, no. He's going to come for us.</b>

<b>we live here, we're in danger.</b>

1395
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,333
<b>Okay, we're in danger. We're going to be</b>

<b>No, it was him, okay? I saw him.</b>

1399
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:37,666
<b>Listen to me.</b>

1400
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:38,791
<b>Stop it. You're</b>

<b>Jonathan, Jonathan, we have to go.</b>

1403
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:42,791
<b>You called Jonathan?</b>

<b>Jonathan, no, Jonathan.</b>

1405
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:46,416
<b>We have to go. Jonathan, break down.</b>

01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:03,416
<b>Yeah, we'll break.</b>

<b>Jonathan, dude, your sister</b>

<b>She saw something on the news.</b>

1410

<b>She's adamant about getting you over here</b>

01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,250
<b>as soon as possible.</b>

<b>She thinks you're in danger.</b>

1413
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,333
<b>I am. What did you see?</b>

1414
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,000
<b>She saw the news,</b>

<b>man, about the explosion.</b>

1416
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:24,958
<b>Look, I think a few</b>

1417
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,750
<b>people killed him. Now she's--</b>

1418
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,083
<b>Dude, it's bad. I need to--</b>

1419

<b>Okay, tell it up. I'm</b>

<b>Did you get it?</b>

1426
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,375
<b>You. I got it.</b>

1427
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:05,875
<b>I gave her something to help her sleep.</b>

01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:06,708
<b>Good.</b>

1429

<b>You're right.</b>

1430
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,750
<b>We'll talk about it when I get back.</b>

<b>Hey, sweetie.</b>

1434
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:30,041
<b>You okay?</b>

<b>Where's Deanna?</b>
