Will you come with me?

896

Come on.

897
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:24,999
I need to talk to you
about something.

898
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,025
But before I do, I...

899
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,329
I just want you to know
that you can trust me, okay?

900
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:33,032
Okay.

901
00:53:33,665 --> 00:53:34,692

done anything to you

that might have scared you

904
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:46,131
or upset you?

905
00:53:50,962 --> 00:53:52,164

906
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,725

I see things.

912

And I can't tell
if they're real or not.

Listen to me.

914
00:54:22,866 --> 00:54:24,956
When I was younger,

915
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:27,494
I... I used to have these

916
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:30,996
horrible visions.

917
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:33,966
They were so terrible that I

918
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:37,065
convinced myself
that they were real.

919
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:42,593
But I learned
that those thoughts,

920
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,023
they were just lies.

921
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,896

was playing on me

922
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,395
because I was so unhappy.

923
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,328
This isn't a lie.

924
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,362

for certain?

We think it might be time
for you to take a step back.

00:59:01,398 --> 00:59:03,564
And perhaps
we postpone your vows.

What? No. Why?

983
00:59:05,864 --> 00:59:09,727
We're also concerned about

you've all but confirmed it.

1012
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:27,023
you will keep your distance
from Carlita.

1256
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:45,230
I had no idea
they'd gone to such lengths.

1257

I don't understand.

1258
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:55,131
They need a male.

1259
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:58,791
They've only birthed females.

1260
01:19:58,926 --> 01:20:00,891
They've all died
except for Carlita.

1261

After all these years,
so many failures...

1262
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:07,726
They believe the only way

1263
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:10,527
is for the beast to mate
with its own offspring.

1265
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,156

No.

This.

1268

[Brennan] It's the mark.

1269
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:46,395
Carlita doesn't have the mark
on her head.

1270

You see? Carlita.

1274

I don't know.

Well, if this is the child
that we're looking for,

1280

then all we have to do

1281

is find a baby
with the mark on its scalp.

1282
01:21:20,298 --> 01:21:21,728

missed something.

[Carlita chuckles]

1612
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:36,597
[Margaret] You want it?

1613
01:49:36,732 --> 01:49:38,063
[all laugh]

1614
01:49:38,198 --> 01:49:39,564
Give it to Mama.
Give it to Mama.

1615
01:49:39,699 --> 01:49:40,692
Give it to Mama.

1616
01:49:44,197 --> 01:49:46,329
[cattle crying in distance]

1617
01:49:51,699 --> 01:49:53,197
[cattle lowing]

1618
01:49:59,999 --> 01:50:01,659
- [gun cocks]
- [gasps]

1619
01:50:02,495 --> 01:50:04,329
[Brennan] I'm so sorry,
Margaret.

1620
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:08,999
I tried just to leave you be.

1621
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:14,197
You need to go.

1622
01:50:14,866 --> 01:50:17,395
Now. [breathing shakily]

1623
01:50:18,196 --> 01:50:19,692
I came to warn you.

1624
01:50:20,998 --> 01:50:22,527
They know you're alive.

1625
01:50:23,464 --> 01:50:24,928
You weren't supposed
to survive.

1626
01:50:25,063 --> 01:50:26,532
None of you were.

1627
01:50:26,668 --> 01:50:28,230
Especially the girl.

1628
01:50:30,029 --> 01:50:31,099
[girl laughing]

1629
01:50:31,234 --> 01:50:32,999
[Brennan] She'll be important,
Margaret.

1630
01:50:35,627 --> 01:50:37,296
I just want to be left alone.

1631
01:50:38,929 --> 01:50:40,164
I know.

1632
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,692
- But they will come for you.
- [gun cocks]

1633
01:51:01,801 --> 01:51:03,494
They've even
given it a name.

1634
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:06,630
Your son.

1635
01:51:06,765 --> 01:51:08,428
[wind whistling]

1636
01:51:08,997 --> 01:51:10,099
[Brennan] Damien.

1637
01:51:10,234 --> 01:51:12,692
