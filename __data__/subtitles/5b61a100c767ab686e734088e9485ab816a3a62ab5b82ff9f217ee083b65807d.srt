emotions, you know, with this one.

154
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,750
A year ago, you had just won a Grammy.

155
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,208
You were in the
middle of a big world tour.

00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,541
Rough patch might be generous.

158
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:22,541
I was wondering if you could share
anything from that period of your life.

159
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,458
I was dealing with a lot of stress
and pressure from the demands of the tour.

160
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,166
And I should have asked for help, but

161
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:36,375
instead I drowned it
all out with drugs and alcohol

162
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,541
and a lot of bad decisions.

163
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,791
And I let myself get
completely out of control.

164
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,375
And actually, I want to take this

165
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:48,958
opportunity to
apologize to my fans, my loved ones,

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,458
my team, everyone who was
counting on me and supporting me.

167

I let you all down.

00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:02,208
And I promise that
will never happen again.

00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,458
Yep, I'm fine.

192
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,166
I'm fine, I think
I just took a weird step.

193
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,541
Let's take a break, everyone.

194
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:05,583
Can we get some ice?

195
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,500
Anton, I'm fine, I'm fine.

196
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:07,666
Sky.

197
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,916
Can we please just go again?

198
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,833
I want to get it right, okay?

199
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,458
Okay, let's go.

200
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,833
Line up.

201
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:17,083
Music.

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,958
[music]

203
00:14:31,958 --> 00:15:03,208
[music] [knocking]

204
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:07,125
One second.

205
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,083
Yeah, come in.

206
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,166
Hey.

207
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,791
You okay?

208
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,625
You ready to go?

209
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,500
Yeah, Mom, I just need a minute.

210
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,250
You should feel really good about today.

211
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:31,625
I know.

212
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,500
I do.

213
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,000
Good.

214
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,291
We're ready whenever you are.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,375
Final rehearsal's
confirmed for Wednesday.

216
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,958
So we'll be at the
venue first thing in the morning.

217
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,541
You have a fitting photo shoot, then
stage walkthroughs, then a fan meet and greet.

218
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,000
Please go straight
to bed when you get home.

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,333
It's going to be a long day.

220
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,416
Oh, and a reminder,
Darius gets in tomorrow.

221
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,708
He's going to be here after opening.

222
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,500
I want him to feel the love, please.

223
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,166
The label is advancing
a lot of money on this tour.

224
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,083
Have I ever not been good with Darius?

225
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,208
Darius adores you, obviously.

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,500
I just want you to
remember who's paying the bill.

227
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,000
Hey, straight to bed, Skye.

228
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:40,333
Goodnight.

229
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,333

00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,666
What do you want from me?

236
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,708
I get in just-- I get in just
for-- I have pain same as last night.

237
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,375
Fuck that, Skye Riley.

238
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,208
It's just going to suddenly show up here.

239
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,041
You texted her to come over.

240
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:38,166
What?

241
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,875
What?

242
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:39,541
What?

243
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:40,208
What?

244
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:40,541
What?

245
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,041
What?

246
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:48,958
I don't-- I don't remember texting her.

247
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,875
How come I don't remember texting her?

248
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,416
Oh, she's got the fuck off me.

249
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,041
Get the fuck off me!

250
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, oh, she-- Holy shit, I'm sorry.

251
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:01,666
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,958
I am having the worst week.

253
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,875
The worst!

254
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,333
Louis, what was with the sword?

255
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:23,750
What?

256
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:24,833
What sword?

257
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:26,500
Oh, that's--

258
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,875
I'm so sorry about that.

259
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,375
I cannot be too careful right now, okay?

260
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:38,083
I am in the middle of
some genuinely fucking freaky shit.

261
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,958
Okay, I'm talking like fucking
scary, fucking haunted house shit, you know?

[buzzing]

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:46,541
Yo.

264
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,250
Do you believe in like weird stuff?

265
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,083
Yeah.

266
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,458
I'm going to go.

267
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:54,916
What?

268
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,041
No, no, no, no.

269
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,250
No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,666
Please stay.

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,416
Please stay.

272
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:58,875
What am I doing?

273
00:18:59,166 --> 00:18:59,958
What am I doing?

274
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,250
Scott fucking Riley's here
and Louis is being fucking crazy.

275
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,750
I'm so stoked to see you.

276
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:05,583
I'm pumped.

277
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Come on, come in.

278
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,291
I will chill.

279
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,208
Be my guest.

280
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,750
Please, take his feet.

281
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:10,958
Make yourself at home.

282
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
I'm sorry about the mess.

283
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,541
You said you wanted-- what was it?

284
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,125
It was-- you wanted Vicodin, right?

285
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah.

286
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:18,458
I got you.

287
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,208
I got you.

288
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:19,750
I want anything else.

289
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,791
I got banger ketamine.

290
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,000
I got really good fucking molly.

291
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,125
I got some-- I don't know what--

292
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,500
No, dude, just the Vicodin for my back.

293
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,083
All right, you're back.

294
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:32,541
Ouch.

295
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,125
That sucks.

296
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,000
I hate that.

297
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,625
Okay, will you
chill and I'll be right back?

298
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,833
You'll chill and
I'll be right back, okay?

299
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,458
I'll be right back.

300
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,083
Oh, my God.

301
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,541
You smell good.

302
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,791
I missed you.

303
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000

304
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,375

It's some snow.

308
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
I mean, this is not a huge storm.

309
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,125
It's not, you know, a-- a--
a dangerous situation out there.

310
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,500
It's our first snow of the season.

311
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,875
And over in pop culture news,
singer-songwriter Sky Riley is back.

312
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,916
Nearly one year after she
was hospitalized in a car crash,

313
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,000
a tragically killed actor Paul Hudson.

314
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,458
Hudson had been
driving the vehicle after the

315
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,583
high-profile couple
had left the private party,

316
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,958
where both were
reportedly seen intoxicated.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,208
The accident occurred while Riley
was in the middle of a blockbuster tour,

318
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,791
and at the time, there was
speculation surrounding Riley's substance abuse,

319
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,833
especially after candid photos of the
singer went viral just two weeks before the--

00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,958

What is it?

340
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,000

She's your best friend.

433

I'm sure she'd be willing to forgive

434
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,625
whatever it was that
happened between the two of you.

435
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,250

different person than you were.

Can you please just leave it alone?

friends are hard to come by.

438

for you when Gemma was around.

464
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,500

465
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,041
to be a special presenter.

466

541

543
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,250
oh my gosh, can I give you a hug?

544
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,166
Oh my gosh, yes.

545
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,958
Scott, you gotta check out my SoundCloud.

546
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,333
Like, who does your production?

547
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,916
All right, dog,
let's grab that photo now.

548
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:15,625
Nice.

549
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,000
Oh, can we do one more vertical?

550
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,208
Doctor, I need a new brain

551
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,666
Oh my God, that was amazing.

552
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:30,333
Could you sign for Alfredo?

553
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:34,541

Skye.

555
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:39,375
Yeah.

560

No, thanks for coming out.

561
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,833
I can see your sat on the inside.

562
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:03,458
Sorry, what?

563
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,125
I could make you happy.

564
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,458
We would be so happy to get there.

00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,291
And you're so beautiful,

567
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,250
you have the most amazing skin.

568
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,083
Dude, get the fuck out.

569
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:22,333
I love you, I love
you, Skye, Skye, Skye, Skye,

570
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,166
I love you.

571
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,541
Hey folks, just
give us like one quick sec.

572
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:37,416
You okay?

573
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,708
(sighs)

574
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,041
Can you take a break?

575
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:46,666
You sure?

576
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,333
Let's just get through this.

577
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,416
Skye, everything great?

578
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:00,750
Yeah, fine.

579
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,500
All right, who's next?

580
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:13,125
(phone ringing)

581
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,041
Hi, what's your name?

582
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,750
It's a pretty cool shirt you got,

583
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,625
you want me to sign it?

584
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:40,375
(soft music)

585
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,500
Okay, how about a photo?

586
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,500
Yeah, that's so sweet.

587
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,875
All right, one, two, cheese.

588
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,833
All right, now that's a good one.

589
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,458
(soft music)

590
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,791
(ominous music)

591
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:59,625
(phone ringing)

592
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,958
It's Gemma, leave it.

593
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,583
(phone ringing)

594
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,125
Hi, hi, it's me.

595
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,416
I was just
thinking about you and how much,

596
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,000
how much I want to
apologize about everything.

597
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,916
Anyway, I don't know
if you want to talk to me.

598
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,500
Will you call me, please?

599
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:27,708
I miss you.

600
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:38,416
(phone ringing)

601
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:41,000
Hey.

602
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:42,166
Hey.

603
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,500
How have you been?

604
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,375
Pretty good, I guess.

605
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,375
Surprised to hear from you.

606
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:55,416
I know, sorry I
just called out of the blue.

607
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,833
That's okay, it's cool.

608
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:05,500
Actually, I kind of feel

609
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,166
really overwhelmed at the moment.

610
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,166
I know it's not, I
know it's not your problem

611
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,916
and it's probably really
shitty of me to even be calling you

612
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:20,333
but I don't really have
anyone I can talk to right now.

613
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,166
What's going on?

614
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,291
Any chance you'd want to come over?

615
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:27,583
Well, like right now?

616
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,666
Yeah, unless you're busy or something.

617
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:39,000
No, I, yeah, no, I can
come over, yeah, give me like 45.

618
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:40,375
Perfect.

619
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,583
Okay, cool, see you soon.

620
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,125
See you then, bye.

621
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:52,916
(sighing)

622
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,333
(door slamming)

623
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:03,750
(water dripping)

624
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,458
(sighing)

625
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,916
(sighing)

626
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,708
(door opening)

627
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,958
(door closing)

628
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,500
(somber piano music)

629
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,875
I'm just scared

630
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,750
(sighing)

631
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:47,458
(somber piano music)

632
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,291
(somber piano music)

633
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,666
I got thick skin but I'm all

634
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,375
Made up of broken bars

635
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,708
Got a body but it's borrowed

636
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:14,541
With a shadow for a heart

637
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,333
Is this how my story's told

638
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:22,500
I get hurt and

639
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,500
(glass clattering)

640
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:54,375
(footsteps)

641
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:00,041
Hello?

642
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,541
(sighing)

643
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:27,666
(door opening)

644
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,791
(door closing)

645
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,000
(door creaking) (door knocking)

646
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,916
(door creaking)

647
00:44:48,333 --> 00:45:02,708
(somber piano music)

648
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:10,958
(crying)

649
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,791
(crying)

650
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:26,833
(somber piano music)

651
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:26,875
(crying)

652
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:33,250
(crying)

653
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:33,541
(eerie music)

654
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,666
And I

655
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,958
(crying)

656
00:45:54,250 --> 00:46:15,833
(door clicking)

657
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:16,583
(dramatic music)

658
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,250
(panting)

659
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,916
(screaming)

660
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:22,708
Jesus, fuck!

661
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,625
What is happening right now?

662
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,333
Shh, shh.

663
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:42,083
Is someone else here?

664
00:46:52,958 --> 00:47:01,166
(eerie music)

665
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,125
Skye, what's going on?

666
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,958
(eerie music)

667
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,208
What the fuck?

668
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,791
Right, so I'm confused.

669
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,791
Oh, hi, choo choo.

670
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:30,708
How did you get here so fast?

671
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,458
Wait, why, what do you mean?

672
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,500
You called me like an hour ago.

673
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,750
An hour?

674
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:44,625
Whoa.

675
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:48,583
How you doing, Skye?

676
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:56,708
I, um, didn't sleep last night,

677
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,500
and I think I had some sort of crazy,

678
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:01,333
lucid nightmare fever dream,

679
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,333
and it scared the,

680
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,791
it scared the crap out of me.

681
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:12,000
Thirsty?

682
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:18,375
This therapist from my recovery program,

683
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,500
she suggested that
anytime I feel overwhelmed

684
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,458
by the urge to use or get drunk,

685
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,875
that I should stop whatever I'm doing

686
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,500
and drink a full glass of water.

687
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,916
It's supposed to be some
sort of form of acknowledgement

688
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,375
for what I can and can't control.

689
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,375
Well, it's good to see you.

690
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,166
Jesus, Gemma.

691
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,250
I'm so sorry.

692
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:48,041
I was a ginormous fucking asshole.

693
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,500
I know you such a huge apology.

694
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:52,625
You really do.

695
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,291
I don't know why it's taken
you like a year to tell me that.

696
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:56,916
I know, I'm sorry.

697
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:59,833
I, I did want to call sooner.

698
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,083
I just didn't know
if you would forgive me

699
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,208
or if you like hated me

700
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,500
and never wanted to hear from me again.

701
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,375
Apology accepted.

702
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,250
Oh, God.

703
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:12,833
Fucking love you.

704
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,041
You know that, right?

705
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,333
Seriously, am I right or die?

706
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,250
Okay, okay.

707
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,916
Before we start like
sucking each other's dicks,

708
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:19,416
what's going on?

709
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,333
Why are you being so weird?

710
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,291
I don't know.

711
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:28,833
I don't know.

712
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:34,416
Such a mess.

713
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,500
This time, Master, are we talking?

714
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:44,625
No.

715
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,208
Something really bad happened.

716
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,583
You remember Lewis Vergoli?

717
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,833
Lewis Vergoli from high school?

718
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,250
He died in front of me yesterday.

719
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:03,958
What?

720
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:06,250
I went to his
apartment to buy Vicodin from him.

721
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,000
Sky, what the fuck?

722
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,208
Just for pain, I swear.

723
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,625
Gemma, I haven't
touched alcohol or coke in a year.

724
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,291
I promise, but my back is still fucked

725
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,375
since I have a
history of substance abuse.

726
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,583
No one will prescribe me
anything stronger than Tylenol.

727
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,416
You think that maybe
there's like a reason for that?

728
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,375
Well, I don't know what else to do.

729
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:24,875
Everyone's counting on me.

730
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,375
Okay, just wait.

731
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,166
All right, go back.

732
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:28,875
What happened to Lewis?

733
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,416
When I showed up, there
was something off about him.

734
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,625
He was scared of something.

735
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:39,750
He started freaking out and screaming,

736
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,666
like screaming, screaming,

737
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:46,916
and then he grabbed this metal gym way

738
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:48,291
from a bench press.

739
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:55,791
He like just smashed
his whole face in with it.

740
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:56,375
What?

741
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,291
Ew, oh my God, what?

742
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:00,458
I don't know what to do.

743
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:04,833
I just freaking ran out
and Gemma, I just left him there.

744
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,958
Does anyone else know about this?

745
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:07,583
No.

746
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,916
Should I tell the police?

747
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,416
No, Sky, no, listen to me.

748
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,666
If anyone connects
you to a drug dealer's death,

749
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,875
the story will take over your entire life

750
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,000
and fuck up everything.

751
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,333
It's not your fault.

752
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,166
I keep seeing his face everywhere.

753
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,500
She feels fucked up.

754
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,250
Yeah, no wonder, I can't imagine.

755
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,416
How scary that must've been.

756
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,333
Oh God, I'm sorry.

757
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,750
I'm so sorry I'm
laying all of this on you.

758
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,666
I just, no, I just don't
really have anyone to talk to.

759
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,500
You want me to spend the night?

760
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,041
Really, would you?

761
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,666
Me and Marty here.

762
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,375
Oh God, I missed you, but I didn't.

763
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:14,125
(ominous music)

764
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,500
(crying)

765
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,500
(crying)

766
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:46,291
(crying)

767
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:51,958
(gasping)

768
00:53:51,958 --> 00:54:05,291
(sighing)

769
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:14,458
(sighing)

770
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:18,833
I hear you okay.

771
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:20,458
Yeah.

772
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:27,875
(sighing)

773
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,166
Gemma, I'm so sorry about everything.

774
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,791
I know, it's okay,
I heard he forgave you.

775
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,250
(somber music)

776
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,333
(gasping)

777
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:59,708
I don't know why I destroy everything.

778
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,791
I feel like my brain is...

779
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,250
This really fucked up place,

780
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,375
full of all this chaos and noise,

781
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:24,125
and I'm trapped there, all alone,

782
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,375
in this darkness, and
I just wanna quiet the noise,

783
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,500
but I don't know how.

784
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,958
So because you're a horrible person,

785
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:48,000
what did you say?

786
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:51,583
Gemma?

787
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
(gasping)

788
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,041
Gemma?

789
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:19,625
(crying)

790
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:25,208
(ominous music)

791
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:30,708
Oh hey, you're up.

792
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,041
(ominous music)

793
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:36,875
What the fuck is happening?

794
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,208
What do you mean, I made matcha?

795
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,416
Matcha, wait.

796
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:45,083
Wait, it's morning?

797
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:46,208
What time is it?

798
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,666
Fuck, fuck, I'm so
late, why didn't you wake me?

799
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,500
I'm sorry, I didn't
know, I don't have your schedule.

800
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,083
My mom's gonna fucking kill me.

801
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:55,708
Shit.

802
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,250
Can I help you or something?

803
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:06,458
Will you come on tour?

804
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:07,458
What?

805
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,125
Come in a rehearsal with me today.

806
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,666
I can't, I have a
friend's thing later on.

807
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:12,625
What?

808
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,708
What friend, do you have to go?

809
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:16,875
Well yeah, I made a commitment.

810
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,166
Well then can you start tomorrow?

811
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,583
I mean, I don't know, I
sort of feel like this is like

812
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,208
a thing we should have
a conversation about first.

813
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,708
Are you kidding me?

814
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,625
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

815
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,791
There are a hundred
people waiting for just you.

816
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:34,625
I know, I know.

817
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:34,833
Okay.

818
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,166
Hey Elizabeth.

819
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,958
Thought we said 830.

820
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm so sorry, it's my
fault, but I'm ready, I'm ready.

821
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,208
Let's do this, I'm sorry everyone.

822
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,125
Here, don't start,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

823
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:01,875
Sorry.

824
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:11,625
(humming)

825
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:17,208
(screaming)

826
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,666
I need some water for
my daughter, for my daughter.

827
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,166
I need some water, I need some water.

828
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,791
I need a waiter with some water,

829
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,166
I need a waiter with some water.

830
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,625
(sniffing)

831
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,208
(dramatic music)

832
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,875
(upbeat music)

833
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,625
I got a secret to tell you

834
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,333
I think you already know

835
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,333
(humming)

836
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,750
There's something wrong with me

837
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,000
Bet you can see it's starting to show

838
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,000
(humming)

839
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,958
I'm feeling different in my skin

840
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,125
I feel like something is changing

841
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:27,750
(humming)

842
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,041
Is it just me or are the colors melting

843
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:32,583
Nothing to paint

844
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,958
Might be a tragedy

845
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,708
Death stitch right in front of me

846
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,000
Am I a future disaster

847
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,000
This waiting, it happened

848
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,000
This waiting, it happened

849
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,458
Light, blood and white

850
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,750
But the sea is shaking out of my way

851
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,208
I'm holding glass in
my head and it could break

852
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,750
Nothing so physical

853
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,333
Maybe a cynical disaster

854
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,208
Waiting, it happened

855
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,916
Light, blood and white

856
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,000
Sittin'

857
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:10,541
Oh

858
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,541
It's like the switch of an engine

859
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:18,791
I think I broke all the brakes

860
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,416
Am I defective

861
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,208
Cause I'm dying to make stupid mistakes

862
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,500
Oh, might be a tragedy

863
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:32,125
(gun fires)

864
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,583
(screams)

865
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:34,125
Fuck!

866
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:35,625
God.

867
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:39,666
Oh my God!

868
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:40,583
Fuck!

869
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:42,750
Oh, fuck, fuck!

870
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:44,000
(screams)

871
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:44,458
Fuck!

872
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,250
Oh God!

873
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,958
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

874
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:52,500
You okay?

875
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:53,791
My leg!

876
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,708
What happened?

877
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:56,041
What's wrong?

878
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:59,375
(beeping)

879
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:05,291
Who was that?

880
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,166
One of you was out of
place and knocked me over.

881
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:09,666
Who was it?

882
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,708
Sky, I don't think that's what happened.

883
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:15,333
Do not tell me what
I just experienced, Anton!

884
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:16,208
I'm not.

885
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,541
I'm just saying that
from where I was watching,

886
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,541
I didn't see anyone out of place.

887
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:34,833
(ominous music)

888
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:35,625
Sky!

889
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,041
(gun fires)

890
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,500
(ominous music)

891
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,083
(gun fires)

892
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:52,500
(ominous music)

893
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
(ominous music)

894
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,166
Yeah.

895
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,000
(ominous music) (gun fires)

896
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,583
(sniffles)

897
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:10,666
(phone rings)

898
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:23,250
(ominous music)

899
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:31,708
(sniffles)

900
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:38,416
(ominous music)

901
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:39,458
(ominous music)

902
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,291
(gun fires)

903
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,333
(grunts)

904
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,166
What happened?

905
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:50,125
Where's Joshua?

906
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,458
Christ, what did you do?

907
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:54,000
Hey, everything okay?

908
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,041
Can I get you anything?

909
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,875
What the fuck is your problem, man?

910
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,166
Sorry, what?

911
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,291
Are you fucking with me?

912
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,791
I have no idea what
you're talking about, I swear.

913
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:04,125
He trashed my dressing room!

914
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:04,375
What?

915
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,833
No, I didn't!

916
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,708
I fucking saw you, Joshua!

917
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:11,708
Sky, I, Sky, I
would never, ever do something

918
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:12,625
like that to you, okay?

919
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:15,416
Come on, what reason would I have?

920
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,625
Fuck you.

921
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,083
Fuck you!

922
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,208
Fuck you, Joshua, fuck you!

923
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,208
All right, that's enough.

924
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,166
Mom, you need to believe me.

925
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,125
He did this!

926
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:26,458
He fucking did this!

927
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,416
To cool off.

928
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,333
You're not actually taking his side!

929
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,666
I am on your side, okay?

930
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:31,291
Always.

931
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,541
But Joshua has
been with me the entire day.

932
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:34,833
What?

933
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:37,666
What are you even talking about?

934
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,333
Look, I don't even
care what happened in here.

935
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:39,958
We'll get it fixed.

936
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:43,041
I just, I need you to tell me the truth.

937
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:43,833
I'm gonna ask you something,

938
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,583
and I want you to be honest with me.

939
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:49,541
Sky, are you using again?

940
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:50,375
What?

941
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,416
Nobody has to know.

942
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,666
You just have to tell me the truth.

943
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:57,500
Oh my God, no, I am not using again, Mom.

944
01:03:58,166 --> 01:03:59,458
You want me to take a drug test?

945
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,500
Okay, I believe you.

946
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:07,875
What's going on?

947
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,000
I don't know, I don't know.

948
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,708
I just, fuck, I feel crazy all the time.

949
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,125
Everything's going wrong.

950
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,333
Nobody will fucking listen to me.

951
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,125
And everyone fucking hates me.

952
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,416
Come on, do you hear yourself?

953
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,291
Everybody loves you.

954
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,750
We're all here for you.

955
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,250
We're here because we believe in you.

956
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,541
We believe in this tour.

957
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,791
I think doing this
tour was a huge mistake.

958
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:32,958
It's too much.

959
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,791
I'm not ready for it.

960
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:35,416
Okay, you know what?

961
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:37,166
We're gonna look at the book tonight,

962
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,041
look at the dates, carve out some time

963
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,958
for you to decompress before opening.

964
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,416
But right now, you
need to pull it together

965
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:45,833
and get back out there, okay?

966
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,833
Because we need to be on time

967
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,250
for Darius's foundation event.

968
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,875
Fuck, no, Mom,
please don't make me do that.

969
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:51,208
No.

970
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,375
I can't get out on stage

971
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,750
in front of a bunch of people tonight.

972
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:54,333
Skye.

973
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:57,375
Mom, you're not, fuck,
you're not listening to me.

974
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:00,333
I am not in the head
space to put in a fucking dress

975
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:01,625
and play dancing monkey

976
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,333
in front of a room full of strangers.

977
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:06,583
Darius is counting
on you to be there, okay?

978
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,916
You gave him your word.

979
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,625
You are a woman who keeps her word.

980
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,958
You are not gonna cancel on a commitment

981
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:18,708
to underprivileged youth
right before launching a tour.

982
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,750
(sighing)

983
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:30,041
(dramatic music)

984
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,333
(dramatic music)

985
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,291
Music inspires
hope, was founded on the idea

986
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,458
that no dream could be true.

987
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,500
With the help we've
enforced, everyone in this group,

988
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,250
and from all of us across the country,

989
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:59,083
the foundation has been
able to reach more families this year

990
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:00,791
than ever before.

991
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,541
Thanks to you, more
and more children every day

992
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:10,291
are able to make
their wildest dreams a reality.

993
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,375
And now, without
further ado, it is my great pleasure

994
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:19,791
to introduce our
wonderful, strong artist,

995
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,541
ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

996
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,916
for Skye Riley.

997
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,375
(audience applauding)

998
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:36,750
Thank you.

999
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:38,708
Thank you.

1000
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:41,625
Thank you so much.

1001
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,333
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1002
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,916
I'm Skye Riley,
and I'm here tonight to...

1003
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,166
I'm here tonight to...

1004
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:08,333
(clears throat)

1005
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,416
So, how's everyone doing tonight?

1006
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,958
Hope you're all enjoying the party.

1007
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,875
Don't worry though, I'm sober, so.

1008
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:26,166
(audience chuckling)

1009
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:36,833
What can I say
about how music inspires hope?

1010
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:40,166
Well, music gave me
everything I ever wanted.

1011
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,750
Then again, music did
almost kill me, so there's that.

1012
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,291
I guess that's not fair.

1013
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,250
Music didn't put all
those drugs up my nose, I did.

1014
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:57,125
(audience chattering)

1015
01:07:57,125 --> 01:08:03,500
I think I'm supposed to be up here

1016
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,625
offering words of inspiration and advice.

1017
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,541
Well, when I think
about what I wish someone

1018
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:13,500
would have told me when I was younger

1019
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,083
and first getting
started, I suppose I'd say,

1020
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,500
this business is really hard.

1021
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:26,416
And you'll spend years
of your life chasing success,

1022
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:30,541
thinking that when it
comes, it will magically fix

1023
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:36,791
everything that's
bad and wrong about you.

1024
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,750
And then you
achieve success and you realize

1025
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,666
that it can't fix
the deeply broken person

1026
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:42,750
that you have always been.

1027
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:47,125
And now you can't
escape the miserable thing

1028
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:49,916
that you've
become, and one day you realize

1029
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,833
how badly you wish
you could just trade it all

1030
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,833
just for one fucking moment of happiness.

1031
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:08,083
Oh, sorry about that.

1032
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:18,083
What I meant to say
is I hope the next generation

1033
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:22,208
of young artists finds
themselves truly inspired tonight.

1034
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,041
I know I sure am.

1035
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:32,416
And without any
further ado, I'd like to introduce

1036
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,041
our next guest, a very special person

1037
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:39,125
who surely needs no
introduction, Paul Hudson.

1038
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,958
(audience chattering)
Why does it say that?

1039
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,833
That's not, this, no, why did,

1040
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,375
that's, why did,

1041
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,708
that's, that's.

1042
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:03,250
(ominous music)

1043
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:14,625
No, no, stay away from me.

1044
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,250
Stay away from me.

1045
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,625
Paul's dead, you're not.

1046
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,666
Paul, stop smiling at me.

1047
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:27,833
No, no.

1048
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,958
I can't hold it.

1049
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,500
(groaning)

1050
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,583
(panting)

1051
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:51,958
(gasping)

1052
01:10:51,958 --> 01:11:03,750
(screaming)

1053
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:21,666
(audience chattering)

1054
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:28,666
(ominous music)

1055
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,791
(ominous music)

1056
01:11:47,791 --> 01:12:13,916
(ominous music)

1057
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:14,125
(panting)

1058
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,458
(ominous music)

1059
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:33,875
(ominous music)

1060
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:42,125
(panting)

1061
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:57,083
(ominous music)

1062
01:12:57,083 --> 01:13:06,000
(panting)

1063
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:27,333
(ominous music)

1064
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:31,458
(panting)

1065
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:57,750
(panting)

1066
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:01,375
Okay, okay, okay.

1067
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:06,833
(panting)

1068
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,583
(panting)

1069
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:30,666
(panting)

1070
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:31,750
Lucy.

1071
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:44,166
It just stares at me, smiling.

1072
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:48,000
(screaming)

1073
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:57,291
(panting)

1074
01:14:57,291 --> 01:15:02,250
No.

1075
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,625
(screaming)

1076
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:16,500
(ominous music)

1077
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,791
(ominous music)

1078
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:27,958
(ominous music)

1079
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:33,583
(ominous music)

1080
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:58,000
(ominous music)

1081
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,500
(audience chattering)

1082
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:21,500
(ominous music)

1083
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:30,958
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

1084
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:31,416
What are you doing?

1085
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:33,708
Sending a photo of you to my friend

1086
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:34,916
in case you're some kind of creep.

1087
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,208
What, I'm not a creep.

1088
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:38,250
Well, that's whatever a creep says.

1089
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:41,250
(audience chattering)

1090
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,375
Look, I realize you're super famous

1091
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:46,041
and I invaded your privacy.

1092
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:46,833
I apologize.

1093
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,583
This is also very weird for me.

1094
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:50,291
How do you know Louis?

1095
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:51,958
I don't, I didn't.

1096
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,791
I was trying to
contact Louis to warn him,

1097
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:57,333
track down his
address and went to his apartment.

1098
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,041
The front door was
unlocked and he was already dead inside.

1099
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,000
I checked his phone
and you were the last person

1100
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,708
he texted with.

1101
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,583
What were you trying to warn him about?

1102
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,000
Look, I'm aware
that what I'm about to say

1103
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,541
is going to sound completely insane,

1104
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,916
but Louis didn't kill himself.

1105
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,458
He was
systematically infected, possessed,

1106
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,333
and then murdered by
some kind of metaphysical being.

1107
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,625
What the fuck are you talking about?

1108
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:26,083
If it helps, you might
call it a spirit or a demon.

1109
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,000
Maybe, I have no clue what this thing is,

1110
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,583
but it disguises
itself to look like people,

1111
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:36,000
like smiling people, but only the person

1112
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,708
that's been infected by it can see it.

1113
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,166
That's not real.

1114
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,375
That's some supernatural bullshit.

1115
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,375
But you've seen it, haven't you?

1116
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:45,541
That's why you're still sitting here.

1117
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I don't know, I
don't know what's happening.

1118
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,791
I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

1119
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,291
That's precisely
what this thing does to you.

1120
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,041
It's what it did to Louis
while it was latched onto him.

1121
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:02,375
It's like a parasite that
infects a host through their mind.

1122
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:05,250
In less than a week,
it drives the host insane.

1123
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:08,166
It's like it feeds off
all the bad shit in her head,

1124
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:09,833
and then once it's done feeding,

1125
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:12,041
it forces the host to kill themselves

1126
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:13,041
in front of a witness,

1127
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:15,625
and then that
witness becomes the new host.

1128
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,208
That's how you got it from Louis.

1129
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:20,083
Before that, it was
passed to Louis by a cop in Jersey.

1130
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:22,083
That cop was the
first one I tried to contact,

1131
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,625
but I guess he went off the grid.

1132
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,666
The cop caught it from some
doctor who got it from a patient,

1133
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:27,041
who got it from a college professor,

1134
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,000
and the chain keeps going back.

1135
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,291
I've documented all of this.

1136
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,916
I can show you,
right? Why did you even know

1137
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,708
all of this?
Because it killed my brother.

1138
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,375
My brother was a host.

1139
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,583
Eight people before you.

1140
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,458
He tried to tell me
what was happening to him,

1141
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:45,125
but he made it hard to trust him,

1142
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:49,625
and the stuff he was
saying sounded certifiably crazy.

1143
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,583
He begged me for
help, but I didn't listen.

1144
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:55,958
And then a few days later,

1145
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:59,875
I got a call informing
me that he tore his own jaw off

1146
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:00,541
with a crowbar.

1147
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:08,000
(gunshot) Have you gone to the police?

1148
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:09,291
And say what?

1149
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,833
My brother's suicide was actually caused

1150
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:15,208
by some cosmic evil
beam that no one else can see.

1151
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,375
The police can't stop this thing anyway.

1152
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:19,125
Aren't you supposed to
wait until this thing kills me?

1153
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,750
No, I want you to help me destroy it.

1154
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:22,500
How?

1155
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,625
From what I can tell, the chain stops

1156
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:30,166
when an infected
host dies in some other way

1157
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,291
outside of the beam's control.

1158
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:35,291
My guess is that
just like other parasites,

1159
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,500
without a living host,

1160
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,375
it has no way to survive.

1161
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,333
It ceases to exist.

1162
01:19:40,916 --> 01:19:44,333
So it only stops if
I die before it kills me?

1163
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,166
Exactly. We need to kill you first.

1164
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,000
What?

1165
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:48,833
Only technically.

1166
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:54,500
Look, there are ways that
we can very safely stop your heart.

1167
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,250
That'll deprive it of a living host.

1168
01:19:57,416 --> 01:20:01,291
Once it goes, I can
resuscitate your heart and bring you back.

1169
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,916
You're out of your fucking mind.

1170
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,375
I know. It seems extreme.

1171
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:05,250
Extreme? You're asking to kill me.

1172
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:07,541
Whoa, hey, just keep it down.

1173
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:10,208
I don't even know. I don't even know.

1174
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,583
My name's Morris. I'm an ER nurse.

1175
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:14,583
And if we don't do
this, it's gonna kill you

1176
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,541
like you killed Lewis
and infect another victim.

1177
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,125
Look, I've already
got everything prepared.

1178
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,875
We should just go right now
and get rid of this thing tonight.

1179
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,333
I can do this.

1180
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,333
You're nearly out of time.

1181
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,708
This thing's been feeding
on you for three days already.

1182
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,166
It's already
taking control of your brain,

1183
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,875
and pretty soon you won't even realise

1184
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,541
the way this is manipulating you,

1185
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,166
and then it'll be too late to stop it.

1186
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:37,500
We have to go right now.

1187
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:38,875
Skye, does that sky ryley?

1188
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,958
Holy shit, dude. That sky?

1189
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:42,583
Oh, that sky ryley!

1190
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,333
Would you do a quick TikTok with us?

1191
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,000
No, right? You should do this, Skye.

1192
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,083
I watched that video.

1193
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:49,416
We knocked down
that old lady like 50 times.

1194
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:51,500
That shoe was so fucking funny.

1195
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:53,791
(all cheering)

1196
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,083
Skye!

1197
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,666
(all cheering)

1198
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,666
(door creaking)

1199

(diabolic ampersands Itsome changes with slow, solemn, long pants)

1232

No!

No!

1247
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:15,041
No!

1248
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:16,666
No!

1249
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:17,333
No!

What?

1263
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:44,458
What?

1264
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:45,875
What?

1265
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:46,500
What?

1266
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,375
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1267
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:52,791
Are you crying right now?

1268
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,208
I'm crying.

1269
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:57,583
Are you crying?

1270
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:01,000
Hmm?

1271
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,166
Huh?

1272
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:07,958
Hey, hey, I'm fucking talking to you!

1273
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,666
Are you fucking kidding me?

1274
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:14,000
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1275
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:15,125
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1276
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,208
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?

1277
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,708
I don't know, I
don't know, I don't know, Paul.

1278
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,125
Why don't you tell me
since I can't do anything right?

1279
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:23,583
Jesus Christ!

1280
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,833
I swear, I swear,
fucking God, you are so--

1281
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,666
What, what?

1282
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,666
What, I'm so, I'm so fucking what?

1283
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:31,958
Say it, say it, what am I?

1284
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:34,666
Tell me, I am so fucking--

1285
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:35,500
Huh?

1286
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:38,250
You're fucking psycho!

1287
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,375
Oh, yay!

1288
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:39,708
Yeah!

1289
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:40,333
Psycho!

1290
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,833
It's out of the bag!

1291
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:43,791
You're fucking crazy!

1292
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,666
I'm so you crazy!

1293
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,208
Oh, yeah!

1294
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,333
You wanna fucking be crazy?

1295
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,083
Yeah, yeah, stop it!

1296
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:48,666
Fucking crazy!

1297
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,125
Stop it, what are you doing?

1298
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:51,666
Paul, that fucked you!

1299
01:28:51,666 --> 01:28:52,250
Stop, stop it!

1300
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:53,708
Is it crazy?

1301
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:54,916
Yes, that is crazy!

1302
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:56,041
You fucking psycho!

1303
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:58,875
Jesus fucking Christ.

1304
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,583
Fucking drive.

1305
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:02,791
Fucking hate you!

1306
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:04,416
Good, good!

1307
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,125
Because I fucking hate you too.

1308
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,041
I fucking...

1309
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,416
You crazy bitch.

1310
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,500
(laughing)

1311
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,083
You psycho bitch!

1312
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:18,708
(laughing)

1313
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:21,333
Are you gonna cry?

1314
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:23,375
Are you gonna cry now?

1315
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,041
Is that your name?

1316
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:24,666
Oh, God!

1317
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:28,708
Oh, you look so
fucking ugly when you cry.

1318
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,625
It's horrible, I can't...

1319
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,291
I can't fuck it.

1320
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,291
(crying)

1321
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:37,875
Oh, help me, God!

1322
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,041
(crying)

1323
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,583
(screaming)

1324
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,333
What the fuck are you doing?

1325
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,708
What are you doing?

1326
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:47,541
(screaming)

1327
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:49,708
Oh, my God!

1328
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:53,458
(crying)

1329
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,416
It's okay, it's okay.

1330
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,500
Everything's fine.

1331
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:57,333
Hey, hey.

1332
01:29:59,166 --> 01:29:59,625
You're okay.

1333
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:02,625
You have a mild concussion.

1334
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,291
Where am I, where am I?

1335
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,416
Harvest Moon, it's
a private wellness clinic.

1336
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,083
You fainted and hit your head.

1337
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:21,291
We found you lying on your living room,

1338
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,291
floor unconscious.

1339
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:24,958
The doctor said you were sleep deprived

1340
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,291
and extremely dehydrated.

1341
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,500
No, no, that's just not...

1342
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:31,166
That's not what happened.

1343
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,333
Sasha, could you go find Dr. Fowler

1344
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:34,708
and let him know Sky's awake?

1345
01:30:35,166 --> 01:30:35,958
Of course, yeah.

1346
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,916
I hope you're feeling better, Sky.

1347
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:41,166
I brought a sweatshirt for you,

1348
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:44,583
just in case you get cold.

1349
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:58,458
(sighing)

1350
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:02,000
We can cover that with makeup,

1351
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,458
and the team's
already working on a fill piece

1352
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:06,208
for your hair.

1353
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:13,083
Don't worry, you won't
be able to tell the difference.

1354
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,541
And I've cleared your schedule,

1355
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,500
so today you can just have a whole day

1356
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:21,416
of rest and recuperation.

1357
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:24,750
Where's my phone?

1358
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:25,666
Where's my phone?

1359
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,041
I need my phone.

1360
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:26,333
It's right here.

1361
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,458
I got it.

1362
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,000
I need it, give it to me.

1363
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:29,958
Maybe later.

1364
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:33,041
Right now we're
just gonna focus on relaxing.

1365
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,833
Please, please.

1366
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,583
Something really
crazy is happening to me.

1367
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:40,916
I need to get out of here right now.

1368
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,958
No, we are gonna stay here together

1369
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,541
until we head to the
venue tomorrow for the pre-show.

1370
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:49,583
That way we can make sure you're 100%

1371
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:51,625
and ready to perform.

1372
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,750
No, no, I can't, I--

1373
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,458
Can't what?

1374
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,208
I can't do the show.

1375
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:05,583
If you cancel the show,

1376
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:07,958
then you will be checking yourself

1377
01:32:08,125 --> 01:32:10,333
into a recovery program.

1378
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:14,375
That's the only
explanation as to why Sky Riley

1379
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,375
is canceling another
tour the night before it starts.

1380
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:19,041
You will have to explain to the label

1381
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,916
who've invested millions of dollars.

1382
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:22,583
Mom, you're putting the work there.

1383
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:23,583
Mom, you don't understand.

1384
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:26,458
No, you don't understand, Sky.

1385
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,416
There are no more second chances.

1386
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:31,958
If you cancel, this is it.

1387
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:35,333
The media will rake you over the calls.

1388
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:37,250
We'll be sued by the label for millions.

1389
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:40,625
It will be the end
of everything we've built.

1390
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:43,333
Oh my God.

1391
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,541
Why is that all you care about, Mom?

1392
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:50,083
You treat me like
I'm some fucking wind-up toy.

1393
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:51,583
You don't give a shit about me

1394
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:52,583
other than the business.

1395
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:53,833
I bring in--

1396
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:55,666
You arrogant little asshole.

1397
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:57,791
I have given up everything for you.

1398
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,583
Every second of my time.

1399
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:03,375
Years of my life, my career,

1400
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:08,708
and here I am
sacrificing every fiber of my being

1401
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:10,208
to support you.

1402
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:12,541
You're too selfish to even see it.

1403
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:17,333
You put everyone through absolute hell

1404
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,583
and still we support you.

1405
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,750
But you want to go and throw it away?

1406
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:22,333
Fine.

1407
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:23,500
Do it.

1408
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:24,375
Throw it away.

1409
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:25,000
I don't care.

1410
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,708
That's what
everyone expects of you anyway.

1411
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,500
I wish you could feel what it's like

1412
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,500
having to live inside my head.

1413
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,875
I've tasted what's inside your head.

1414
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,958
No, no, please, no.

1415
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:45,916
Please, no.

1416
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:47,708
No.

1417
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:51,458
No, no.

1418
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:52,041
No!

1419
01:33:53,541 --> 01:33:53,750
(glass shattering)

1420
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,791
(screaming)

1421
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,041
No, no, no.

1422
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:06,583
(screaming)

1423
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:16,416
What are you doing to your poor mother?

1424
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:21,166
No, no, no.

1425
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:23,583
No.

1426
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,666
(glass shattering)

1427
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:29,166
(glass shattering)

1428
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:50,166
(crying)

1429
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:56,708
(eerie music)

1430
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:59,375
(glass shattering)

1431
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:06,250
(gasping)

1432
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:18,708
(gasping)

1433
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:28,666
(gasping)

1434
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:34,708
(gagging)

1435
01:35:36,708 --> 01:35:39,500
(gasping)

1436
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,625
No, no, it's not real.

1437
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:45,208
It's not real, it's not real.

1438
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:47,000
It's not real.

1439
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:49,125
No, no.

1440
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:50,250
(glass shattering)

1441
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:50,458
No!

1442
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,000
(glass shattering)

1443
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,208
(gasping)

1444
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,208
(gasping)

1445
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,666
(gasping)

1446
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:12,583
(gasping)

1447
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:22,000
(gasping)

1448
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,291
(gasping)

1449
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:25,083
(gasping)

1450
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:27,833
(knocking)

1451
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:29,541
It's Joshua.

1452
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:32,666
(footsteps)

1453
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,375
(gasping)

1454
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,166
I need a second.

1455
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:37,041
I'm changing.

1456
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:37,791
Sorry.

1457
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:39,666
You know what?

1458
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,291
I'll wait out here.

1459
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,250
Also, the doctor said
he's gonna come and see you

1460
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:43,833
in a few minutes.

1461
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:48,291
Actually, I feel kind of thirsty.

1462
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:51,375
You think you should
go find me something to drink?

1463
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:54,208
Oh, I brought some bottles of water,

1464
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,250
put them in the little refrigerator.

1465
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:57,458
I feel like soda.

1466
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:58,833
Could you get me a soda, please?

1467
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,500
Sure, yeah, no problem.

1468
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:02,750
What kind?

1469
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:05,750
Any kind, just surprise me.

1470
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:07,541
You got it.

1471
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:08,458
You know what?

1472
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:11,500
I'll be right back
with one surprising soda.

1473
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,750
(gasping)

1474
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:21,166
(gasping)

1475
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:26,458
(door slamming)

1476
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:28,958
(gasping)

1477
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:38,875
(gasping)

1478
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:40,416
Fuck.

1479
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:42,333
Fuck.

1480
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:52,875
(gasping)

1481
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:57,708
(gasping)

1482
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:58,708
(gasping)

1483
01:37:58,708 --> 01:37:59,625
(gasping)

1484
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:09,000
(crying)

1485
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:15,458
(eerie music)

1486
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,541
(eerie music)

1487
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:03,541
(eerie music)

1488
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:35,041
(crying)

1489
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:38,958
Sky?

1490
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:49,375
Are you, oh my God, is that blood?

1491
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:54,875
No.

1492
01:39:57,708 --> 01:40:00,625
Hey, we need a doctor over here.

1493
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,375
Yeah, can we please get some help?

1494
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,708
Somebody please come help us.

1495
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,541
Fuck off, she had
an accident or something.

1496
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,125
Are you hurt?

1497
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:08,500
We need a doctor or something.

1498
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:09,791
Oh my God, Sky.

1499
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,291
Hey, this is Dr. Rosales,

1500
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:14,000
I need to send somebody
down to the lobby immediately.

1501
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:16,750
No, no, no, no,
easy, I got you, I got you.

1502
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:18,000
Get away from me!

1503
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:18,958
Oh, shit!

1504
01:40:22,541 --> 01:40:24,000
Hey, just take it easy.

1505
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,125
(gunshot)

1506
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,958
Oh my God, get the fuck away from me!

1507
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:29,375
(crying)

1508
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:32,291
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1509
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:33,000
Sky?

1510
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:36,750
Sky, what are you doing?

1511
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,208
Think about the tour.

1512
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,375
Fuck, the tour!

1513
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:46,500
(gunshot)

1514
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,791
Man, what the fuck?

1515
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:49,791
Jeez.

1516
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:52,000
That's guy riding.

1517
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:53,708
Looks like a fucking wheel.

1518
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:56,208
(eerie music)

1519
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:00,958
(dramatic music)

1520
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:04,000
(gunshot)

1521
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,333
(screaming)

1522
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:05,833
Stop!

1523
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:07,500
Fuck!

1524
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,875
Oh, God.

1525
01:41:10,416 --> 01:41:10,625
Sky?

1526
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,500
What are you doing out here?

1527
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:14,875
Jenna, what are you doing here?

1528
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:16,333
Your mom told me, are you bleeding?

1529
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:18,291
In your car, here.

1530
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:19,958
Why is no of your mom driving from me?

1531
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:20,916
Why? Where is she?

1532
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:22,166
Why don't you just
drive me up over there?

1533
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:22,750
What's going on?

1534
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:25,833
What happened?

1535
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:27,083
Sky.

1536
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:29,750
Where are you, fuck?

1537
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,750
Hey, get out, I need your car!

1538
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:34,541
Miss Riley, what?

1539
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:36,916
Shut the fuck up!

1540
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:37,541
I'm fucking out of here!

1541
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,500
She got a gun, she got a gun!

1542
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,541
The fuck are you doing?

1543
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,875
Jenna, I love you, but
if I don't leave right now,

1544
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:44,916
I'm gonna fucking die!

1545
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:47,791
Fuck it, I'm coming with you, move over!

1546
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:49,041
No, Jenna, no!

1547
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,458
You gotta drive, move over!

1548
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:53,875
(screaming)

1549
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:19,458
(dramatic music)

1550
01:42:19,458 --> 01:42:20,666
Dude, where are we going?

1551
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:22,791
What am I doing, where am I going?

1552
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,625
Where am I going, Sky?

1553
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:28,416
I don't know, just keep driving.

1554
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:30,875
No, I need you to
explain what the hell is going on.

1555
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:36,625
I need to get to Staten Island.

1556
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,291
What, gross, why?

1557
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,333
Oh shit.

1558
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:42,375
(screaming)

1559
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:49,708
Jesus Christ, you
didn't go to a hospital!

1560
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:51,666
No, I need to go to Staten Island!

1561
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,000
What the fuck is going on?

1562
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,208
Why are we going to Staten Island?

1563
01:42:57,291 --> 01:43:00,958
(grunting)

1564
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:03,791
Sky?

1565
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,291
Jenna, pull over.

1566
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:08,041
What, you just told
me to go to Staten Island?

1567
01:43:08,166 --> 01:43:09,791
Jenna, just fucking pull over, please!

1568
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,083
All I've ever done
is make your life hell.

1569
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:18,083
I don't deserve
you, so please just pull over

1570
01:43:18,625 --> 01:43:20,833
and get away from me so
I don't fuck up your life too.

1571
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:24,250
(breathing heavily)

1572
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:26,875
Now fuck that noise.

1573
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:31,666
Ride or die, bitch!

1574
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:42,875
I need to tell you something.

1575
01:43:43,583 --> 01:43:43,833
What?

1576
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:47,208
(phone ringing)

1577
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,958
Sky.

1578
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:59,083
(phone ringing)

1579
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:09,541
Huh?

1580
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:10,833
Hey, it's me.

1581
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:13,416
I got your voicemail,
sorry, it's taking me a few days

1582
01:44:13,416 --> 01:44:16,250
to get back to you, but
honestly, I wasn't even sure

1583
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,791
if I was gonna call you back.

1584
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:21,666
Did you spend the night at my place?

1585
01:44:22,291 --> 01:44:22,500
What?

1586
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,958
I haven't been to
your place in like a year.

1587
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:28,500
Since you said I was a
stupid opportunistic cunt, remember?

1588
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:32,958
Also, what's up with these
weird-ass fucking text messages

1589
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:33,916
you've been sending me?

1590
01:44:36,875 --> 01:44:37,125
Hello?

1591
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:38,375
No!

1592
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:40,375
Jenna hates you, Sky.

1593
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:44,000
No, please, please,
Jenna, no, please, Jenna, no.

1594
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:45,250
I'm here, please.

1595
01:44:45,666 --> 01:44:45,875
Please.

1596
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:52,000
No, no, no, no, no, fuck you!

1597
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:53,291
Fuck you!

1598
01:44:54,791 --> 01:44:56,375
Fuck you, fuck you!

1599
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:57,166
(crying)

1600
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:58,375
Tell me to fuck up.

1601
01:44:59,416 --> 01:45:00,125
Let me go!

1602
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:01,541
No one cares about you.

1603
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:02,875
This is gonna happen to you.

1604
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:03,666
You're not driving, you're not driving.

1605
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:05,833
You're not driving, stop.

1606
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:08,416
You're in my head, you're in my head.

1607
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:12,125
You're in my head, you're in my head!

1608
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:13,375
You're in my head!

1609
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:13,750
You're in my head!

1610
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,500
You're not in control, I am!

1611
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:24,875
You're not in control, I am!

1612
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:29,041
I'm in control, I'm in control, I am...

1613
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,083
I'm in control, I am
in control, I'm in control...

1614
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,458
(screaming)

1615
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,250
(dramatic music)

1616
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:52,000
(breathing heavily)

1617
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:56,875
I'm in control.

1618
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:02,291
(screaming)

1619
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:03,000
Fuck you!

1620
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,708
Why'd you fucking cry?

1621
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,125
(dramatic music)

1622
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:18,833
(car horn honking)

1623
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,666
Jesus Christ!

1624
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:31,375
Christ, are you okay?

1625
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,000
Where are your shoes?

1626
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:33,500
Shut up, here, take this.

1627
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,041
Why are you having--

1628
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:34,958
Just take it!

1629
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,750
Hey, if this
theory of yours doesn't work,

1630
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:40,375
or you see me change and start smiling,

1631
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,000
shoot me in the--

1632
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,041
Whoa, hold on!

1633
01:46:43,541 --> 01:46:45,916
Hey, you need to stop it, no matter what.

1634
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,208
We're going to.

1635
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,500
Promise! All right!

1636
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:52,500
All right, I promise I'll shoot you.

1637
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:57,250
How do we stop my heart?

1638
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:05,541
(door slamming) Sorry, I
haven't done anything about the lights.

1639
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:09,791
Is this a pizza hut?

1640
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,041
It's the only thing I
could find for lease on short notice

1641
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:14,666
that had a large enough freezer.

1642
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:16,333
Why do we need to freeze him?

1643
01:47:17,125 --> 01:47:17,958
For your brain.

1644
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:21,041
Fuck.

1645
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:28,250
Once we stop your heart,

1646
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:30,875
your brain stops receiving oxygen.

1647
01:47:31,333 --> 01:47:33,000
Normally, necrosis sets in immediately.

1648
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:34,250
You'd have two minutes, maybe,

1649
01:47:34,583 --> 01:47:35,916
before permanent brain damage occurs.

1650
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,375
But if we bring your
body temperature down far enough,

1651
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,500
we can delay the process,

1652
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,416
giving us up to nine
minutes before permanent damage.

1653
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:44,708
We need to make sure this
thing isn't able to hang around.

1654
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:49,541
And I like our odds with
nine minutes better than two.

1655
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:55,541
(door slamming)

1656
01:47:55,541 --> 01:48:06,291
(eerie music)

1657
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:08,666
Freezer door latch is broken.

1658
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:10,666
If it closes all the way,
it can't be opened from the inside.

1659
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:14,541
(phone buzzing)

1660
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:17,500
Here, change into this.

1661
01:48:22,958 --> 01:48:24,375
Jesus, that's a lot of blood.

1662
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,250
Are the cops gonna be looking for you?

1663
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:26,750
I don't know.

1664
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,375
Let's just do this.

1665
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:34,250
Once your body
temperature drops low enough,

1666
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:37,416
I will inject you with a
drug that will cause your heart

1667
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:39,958
to start slowing down until it stops.

1668
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:42,541
How long will it take?

1669
01:48:45,416 --> 01:48:47,916
It's critical you reach
flatline as fast as possible.

1670
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:51,833
So I'll need to inject it
directly into your internal jugular.

1671
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:55,041
After 30 seconds, you'll be dead.

1672
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,208
Wait, wait, wait.

1673
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,625
Jacob, look at my neck.

1674
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:01,666
I see the needle.

1675
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,166
(door slamming)

1676
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:07,416
What the fuck, man?

1677
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:08,625
I know, sorry.

1678
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,166
Lie down here.

1679
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:18,166
(sniffing)

1680
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:28,958
(breathing heavily)

1681
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:36,333
Oh my God, I'm so fucking cold.

1682
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:37,333
Oh, that's the idea.

1683
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:39,083
I'll be monitoring your heart rate.

1684
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:40,625
The moment you flatline,

1685
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:42,541
I'll start a timer for eight minutes.

1686
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:44,125
Once the timer's up,

1687
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:48,583
I will inject a dose
of adrenaline into your heart

1688
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:50,083
and start CPR resuscitation.

1689
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,125
I can't believe I
might die in the freezer

1690
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:55,208
with a fucking pizza.

1691
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:57,208
I promise I'm gonna bring you back.

1692
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:04,208
Morris, I'm sorry about your brother.

1693
01:50:05,416 --> 01:50:06,791
I know the story you're doing this.

1694
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:08,291
Thank you for helping me.

1695
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,458
Can I ask, what
made you change your mind?

1696
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:20,458
Every good thing in my
life ends up broken because of me.

1697
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:26,625
I hurt everything and everyone I touch.

1698
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:32,375
It doesn't matter
what happens to me anymore.

1699
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,916
But I've not let
this fucking thing use me

1700
01:50:40,916 --> 01:50:43,416
to hurt anyone else.

1701
01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:50,791
Put this in your mouth.

1702
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:54,875
Don't move.

1703
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:56,958
You just have to get something.

1704
01:50:59,625 --> 01:51:01,041
I'm hurt, where are you going?

1705
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,250
(doorbell ringing) (dramatic music)

1706
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:08,666
Morris?

1707
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:24,041
(crying)

1708
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,916
(crying)

1709
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:40,375
Hey, don't leave me alone here.

1710
01:51:44,166 --> 01:51:44,500
Morris.

1711
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,458
(crying)

1712
01:52:02,541 --> 01:52:11,000
(crying)

1713
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,666
(crying)

1714
01:52:16,666 --> 01:52:16,875
No!

1715
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:35,333
(crying)

1716
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:40,666
(gun firing)

1717
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:51,333
(crying)

1718
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:04,000
I've been waiting
for you for such a long time.

1719
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,625
Morris, Morris, what's that?

1720
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:11,000
Morris, can't help you anymore.

1721
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:15,500
It's just you and me.

1722
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:19,541
I like wearing your skin.

1723
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,250
(gun firing)

1724
01:53:27,041 --> 01:53:31,791
You can't get away from me, Skye.

1725
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:33,500
(crying)

1726
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:36,500
(crying)

1727
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:47,541
(screaming)

1728
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,625
You'll never escape who
you truly are on the inside.

1729
01:53:53,041 --> 01:53:56,375
(crying)

1730
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,000
You got me!

1731
01:54:02,375 --> 01:54:06,250
(screaming)

1732
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:09,416
(crying)

1733
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:18,291
(crowd cheering)

1734
01:54:21,958 --> 01:54:34,500
(crying)

1735
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,000
(crying)

1736
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,291
(crying)

1737
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:38,458
(crying)

1738
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:50,958
(crying) (crying)

1739
01:54:51,708 --> 01:54:53,458
Fuck you.

1740
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:04,291
(crying)

1741
01:55:04,291 --> 01:55:05,541
(crying)

1742
01:55:05,541 --> 01:55:07,083
(crying)

1743
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:29,708
(crying) (crying)

1744
01:55:33,125 --> 01:55:34,875
This isn't real, Skye.

1745
01:55:36,541 --> 01:55:38,166
(crying)

1746
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:53,208
(crying)

1747
01:56:08,083 --> 01:56:10,333
You're not in control, Skye.

1748
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:14,291
(crying)

1749
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,000
I am.

1750
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:23,541
(crying)

1751
01:56:30,041 --> 01:56:31,000
Break a leg out there.

1752
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:37,333
(crying)

1753
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:39,125
(crying)

1754
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:54,666
(crying)

1755
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:54,875
No!

1756
01:56:57,916 --> 01:57:01,791
(crying)

1757
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:09,916
(crying)

1758
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:10,708
(crying)

1759
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:30,000
(crying)

1760
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,166
(crying)

1761
01:57:35,166 --> 01:57:36,833
(crying)

1762
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:56,041
(crying)

1763
01:57:56,083 --> 01:57:56,875
Skye!

1764
01:57:57,833 --> 01:57:58,458
Skye!

1765
01:58:01,208 --> 01:58:03,000
(crying)

1766
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:25,291
(crying) (crying)

1767
01:58:25,291 --> 01:58:25,750
I'm dead.

1768
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:30,583
(crying)

1769
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:36,083
(crying)

1770
01:58:46,958 --> 01:58:56,875
(crying)

1771
01:58:56,875 --> 01:58:59,250
(crying)

1772
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:02,000
(crying)

1773
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,166
What the?

1774
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,833
(crying)

1775
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:45,833
(crying) (crying)

1776
01:59:45,833 --> 02:00:02,458

(eerie music)

1781
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:46,875
(eerie music)

1782
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:53,291
(screaming)

1783
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:55,791
(gunshots)

1784
02:00:55,791 --> 02:00:58,416
(screaming)

1785
02:00:58,416 --> 02:01:02,916

(screaming)

1788
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:16,958
(screaming)

1789
02:01:21,083 --> 02:01:24,375
Knocked out, love will be the death of me

1790
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:30,041
I'm not scared to go on a good road

1791
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:34,500
Knocked out, love will be the death of me

1792
02:01:35,291 --> 02:01:35,541
I'm not scared
