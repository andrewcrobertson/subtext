I'm being too inquisitive...

mystery about what is going on there.

- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

108
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:12,413
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

109
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:16,793
which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

117

was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

That does sound odd.

a bit of a row about it.

120
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:48,866
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

121

Did the crew get back all right?

I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

169
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:47,775
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

170
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:52,947
which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

171
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,283
Now...

172
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,080
I know there have been some
conflicting views...

173
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,959
regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

174
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,879
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

175
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,841
created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base.

176
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:17,846
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

177
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:21,934
many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

178
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:27,273
this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

179
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,235
I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

180
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:36,198
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

181
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:41,287
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

182
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,872
And I hope you will too.

183
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,336
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

184
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:52,214
for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

185
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:54,800
contained in this situation...

186
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,511
if the facts were
prematurely made public...

187
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,806
without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

188
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,891
Anyway...

189
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,311
this is the view of the Council.

190
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:10,357
The purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

191
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,276
on the situation...

192
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:15,654
and to prepare a report
to the Council...

193
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:20,993
recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

194
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:26,040
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

195
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:31,253
in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

196
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,215
Well, I think that's about it.

197
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:37,509
Any questions?

198
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:43,223
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

199
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:46,226
this cover story will
have to be maintained?

200
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,688
[FLOYD]
I don't know, Bill.

201
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:54,068
I suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the Council.

202
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,029
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

203
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,908
before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

204
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:04,036
As some of you know,
the Council has requested...

205
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,955
that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

206
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:10,042
from everyone who has
knowledge of this event.

207
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:13,962
Were there any more questions?

208
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,138
[HALVORSEN] I'm sure
we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...

209
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,807
as fully as possible...

210
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:30,479
and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

211
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,357
[HALVORSEN] Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
[FLOYD] Thank you.

212
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:12,164
[MICHAELS]
Anybody hungry?

213
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,211
[FLOYD] What've we got?
[MICHAELS] You name it.

214
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,383
[FLOYD] Is this chicken?
[MICHAELS] Something like that.

215
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,385
[MICHAELS]
Tastes the same, anyway.

216
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,304
[HALVORSEN]
Got any ham?

217
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,972
[MICHAELS]
Ham, ham, ham...

218
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,807
[HALVORSEN]
There, that's it.

219
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,103
Look pretty good.

220
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:38,065
[MICHAELS] They're getting better at it
all the time.

221
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,985
[HALVORSEN]
That was an excellent speech.

222
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,403
[MICHAELS]
It certainly was.

223
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,323
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

224
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:47,824
Thanks, Ralph.

225
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:50,661
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

226
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,454
I admire how
you've handled this.

227
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:56,208
[HALVORSEN] It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

228
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,044
We're only too happy to
be able to oblige.

229
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,338
[MICHAELS]
Have you seen these yet?

230
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,967
[HALVORSEN] Have a look.
[MICHAELS] Here's what started it all.

231
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:06,885
[FLOYD]
Oh, yeah.

232
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:08,679
[HALVORSEN]
When we found it...

233
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,847
we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

234
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,184
but all the geological evidence
was against it.

235
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:19,064
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

236
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,983
So we decided to have a look.

237
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,735
[MICHAELS] We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

238
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:27,614
so we excavated out,
but we didn't find anything else.

239
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,826
[HALVORSEN] And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

240
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,162
it hasn't been covered
by erosion or other forces.

241
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:36,707
It's been deliberately buried.

242
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,626
Deliberately buried.

243
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,923
[MICHAELS]
How about a little coffee?

244
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:47,050
[FLOYD] Great.
[HALVORSEN] Good idea.

245
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:55,517
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is?

246
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,686
[HALVORSEN]
I wish to hell we did.

247
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:02,274
The only thing we're sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago.

248
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:07,112
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

249
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,989
[MICHAELS]
Watch this, now. It's hot.

250
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:54,076
[BEEPING]

251
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,224
[HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]

252
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,699
[NEWSCASTER]
Good evening.

253
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,869
Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...

254
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,788
left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.

255
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:04,959
This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.

256
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,671
This afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...

257
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,468
with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.

258
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,971
It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...

259
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,308
but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.

260
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:23,811
Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.

261
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,190
[REPORTER] The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...

262
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:32,362
and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.

263
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,906
Three of the men
were put aboard asleep...

264
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:38,284
or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.

265
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:41,412
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kim ball...

266
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,498
and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

267
00:59:43,915 --> 00:59:46,626
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...

268
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,128
and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

269
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:52,215
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?

270
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,633
[BOWMAN]
Marvelous.

271
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,970
We have no complaints.

272
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,473
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...

273
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,935
joins me in wishing you
a safe, successful voyage.

274
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:05,979
[BOWMAN] Thanks very much.
[POOLE] Thank you.

275
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:10,358
Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...

276
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,113
this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure.

277
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,614
Why was this done?

278
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:20,118
[BOWMAN] This was done to achieve
the maximum conservation...

279
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:23,871
of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.

280
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,709
The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.

281
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:31,713
Their efforts won't be utilized
until we approach Jupiter.

282
01:00:32,005 --> 01:00:35,842
[REPORTER] Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?

283
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:40,430
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.

284
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,099
The only difference is
that you don't dream.

285
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:47,395
[REPORTER] As I understand it, you only
breathe once a minute. Is this true?

286
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:50,231
[POOLE] Right, and the heart
beats three times a minute.

287
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:54,110
Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.

288
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,947
[REPORTER] The sixth member of the crew
was not concerned...

289
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,241
about the problems of hibernation...

290
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:03,911
for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:

291
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,541
The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...

292
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,711
though some experts prefer
to use the word mimic...

293
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:14,297
most of the activities
of the human brain...

294
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:18,551
and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability.

295
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,347
We next spoke with
the HAL 9000 computer...

296
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:25,516
whom, we learned,
one addresses as Hal.

297
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,394
Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?

298
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:32,607
[HAL] Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.

299
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:36,277
[REPORTER] Hal, you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission...

300
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:40,406
perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element.

301
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,409
You're the brain
and nervous system of the ship.

302
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:47,372
Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.

303
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,666
Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?

304
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,169
[HAL]
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

305
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:58,132
The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.

306
01:01:58,508 --> 01:02:03,304
No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.

307
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,225
We are all, by any practical
definition of the words...

308
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:10,853
fool proof and incapable of error.

309
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:14,899
[REPORTER] Hal, despite your enormous
intellect, are you ever frustrated...

310
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:18,194
by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?

311
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,655
[HAL]
Not in the slightest bit.

312
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:22,990
I enjoy working with people.

313
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:27,787
I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

314
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:32,250
My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...

315
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,628
so I am constantly occupied.

316
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:39,340
I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...

317
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:44,303
which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.

318
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:48,141
[REPORTER] Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...

319
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,227
in such close proximity with Hal?

320
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:54,188
[POOLE]
It's like what you said earlier.

321
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,566
He's like a sixth
member of the crew.

322
01:02:56,816 --> 01:03:00,862
You quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...

323
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,114
really just as another person.

324
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:07,034
[REPORTER] In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...

325
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,578
of emotional responses.

326
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,164
When I asked him
about his abilities...

327
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:15,334
I sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.

328
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:18,963
Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?

329
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:22,633
[BOWMAN] Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.

330
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:26,471
He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.

331
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,764
As to whether or not
he has feelings...

332
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,809
is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.

333
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,003
[HAL]
Excuse me, Frank.

334
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:00,463
What is it, Hal?

335
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,591
[HAL] We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.

336
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,885
Fine.

337
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,804
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

338
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:10,306
Certainly.

339
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,446
[DAD] Hello, Frank.
[MOM] Happy birthday, darling.

340
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,573
[DAD] Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.

341
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:28,950
[POOLE]
A bit higher, Hal.

342
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,536
[DAD] Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.

343
01:04:31,786 --> 01:04:33,621
Ray and Sally were going
to be here...

344
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,123
but Ray's back
went bad on him again.

345
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:38,501
How do you like your cake?

346
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,127
Sorry you can't join us.

347
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:41,963
I ran into Bob the other day.

348
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,257
He said to wish you happy birthday.

349
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:47,176
All my students
send their best wishes too.

350
01:04:47,385 --> 01:04:49,095
They talk about you all the time.

351
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:52,431
You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.

352
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:54,100
[MOM]
We were on TV last week.

353
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:56,978
[DAD] Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...

354
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:59,480
what we thought
of our illustrious sons.

355
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,067
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.

356
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,902
Perhaps you can listen in.

357
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:07,071
[MOM]
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.

358
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:10,950
I'll be glad to get the gift,
but tell me how much to spend.

359
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,995
[DAD] Oh, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...

360
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,871
I think I straightened it out.

361
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,207
I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...

362
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:22,962
and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.

363
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:25,339
I can't think of anything else to say.

364
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:29,719
[MOM] Give our love to Dave.
[DAD] Be sure to give him our regards.

365
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:33,306
[DAD] We wish you the very
happiest of birthdays.

366
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:35,141
All the best, son.

367
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:37,560
[MOM & DAD SING]
Happy birthday to you

368
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:39,895
Happy birthday to you

369
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,690
Happy birthday, dear Frank

370
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,526
Happy birthday to you.

371
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,322
[DAD]
See you next Wednesday.

372
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,327
[HAL]
Happy birthday, Frank.

373
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:58,706
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

374
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,726
[POOLE]
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

375
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,897
[HAL]
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

376
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,858
[POOLE]
Lovely move.

377
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,864
Rook to king one.

378
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:34,992
[HAL] I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.

379
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:39,163
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.

380
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:41,874
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

381
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:49,298
[POOLE]
Looks like you're right. I resign.

382
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:51,467
[HAL]
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

383
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:52,677
[POOLE]
Thank you.

384
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:32,758
[HAL] Good evening, Dave.
[BOWMAN] How are you, Hal?

385
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:36,345
Everything's running smoothly, you?
[BOWMAN] Not too bad.

386
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,223
- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.

387
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,934
- May I see them?
- Sure.

388
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:48,399
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

389
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:51,736
I think you've improved a great deal.

390
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:55,906
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.

391
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,077
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

392
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,874
By the way...

393
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:08,627
do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

394
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,755
No, not at all.

395
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:13,507
Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...

396
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:17,636
but lately I've wondered...

397
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:21,766
whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission?

398
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:23,642
How do you mean?

399
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:27,813
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

400
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:32,401
Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.

401
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:37,823
I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...

402
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:42,203
that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.

403
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:46,582
I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.

404
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,670
That's a rather difficult
question to answer.

405
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,548
You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?

406
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:57,468
No, not at all.

407
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:01,222
Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...

408
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,517
strange stories floating
around before we left.

409
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,896
Rumors about something
being dug up on the moon.

410
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:13,442
I never gave these stories
much credence...

411
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:17,822
but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...

412
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,699
I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

413
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,910
For instance...

414
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,456
the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.

415
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,960
And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...

416
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,546
Kim ball and Kaminsky aboard...

417
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:38,843
already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.

418
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:42,263
You working up your crew
psychology report?

419
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,182
Of course I am.

420
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:49,353
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.

421
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,647
Just a moment.

422
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,274
Just a moment.

423
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:59,113
I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.

424
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:04,368
It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.

425
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:09,039
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.

426
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,750
And it will stay that way
until it fails.

427
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,003
We have 72 hours till failure?

428
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:18,132
Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.

429
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:22,553
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

430
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,473
and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

431
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:52,434
[CONTROLLER] X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

432
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:55,521
Roger your two-zero-one-three.

433
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:58,232
Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.

434
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,570
We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.

435
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:08,033
Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...

436
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:09,910
prior to failure.

437
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,149
[BOWMAN]
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

438
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,505
Open the pod doors, Hal.

439
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,878
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

440
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,172
[HAL]
Yes...

441
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,508
it's puzzling.

442
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:08,513
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.

443
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:14,144
I would recommend...

444
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:18,523
that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail.

445
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:23,111
It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.

446
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:27,491
We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...

447
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:30,827
for the short time
it will take to replace it.

448
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:42,297
[CONTROLLER] X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

449
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,217
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

450
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:49,846
We concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction.

451
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,724
We advise you that
our preliminary findings...

452
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:55,685
indicate that your on board
9000 computer...

453
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:58,104
is in error predicting the fault.

454
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,316
I say again, in error
predicting the fault.

455
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:06,071
I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...

456
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,574
the results from our twin
9000 computer.

457
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,161
We're sceptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...

458
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:16,122
to determine reliability
of this conclusion.

459
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:17,958
Sorry about this little snag.

460
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,086
We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.

461
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,463
X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.

462
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:27,133
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.

463
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:34,683
[HAL] I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.

464
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,351
No, I'm not, Hal.

465
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,228
Are you quite sure?

466
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:42,148
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.

467
01:21:43,358 --> 01:21:46,987
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

468
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:50,824
Well, I don't think there is
any question about it.

469
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:54,369
It can only be
attributable to human error.

470
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:58,373
This sort of thing
has cropped up before...

471
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:02,168
and it has always
been due to human error.

472
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:07,382
Listen, Hal...

473
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:09,884
there's never been
any instance at all...

474
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:13,346
of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

475
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:15,181
None whatsoever, Frank.

476
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:19,102
The 9000 Series has
a perfect operational record.

477
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:23,648
[POOLE] I know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 Series, but...

478
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:29,904
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

479
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:32,115
None whatsoever, Frank.

480
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:36,161
Quite honestly, I wouldn't
worry myself about that.

481
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:42,834
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

482
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,796
Fine. Thanks very much.

483
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:52,344
I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

484
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:55,180
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

485
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:56,514
See you later, Hal.

486
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,163
[BOWMAN]
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

487
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,965
[POOLE]
What sort of trouble are you having?

488
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:33,927
[BOWMAN] I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

489
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,553
[POOLE]
We'll have a look at it.

490
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:43,436
[BOWMAN]
Open the door, Hal.

491
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:04,290
[BOWMAN]
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

492
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:19,723
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

493
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:30,150
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

494
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,155
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

495
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,742
I don't think he can hear us.

496
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:41,202
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

497
01:24:42,662 --> 01:24:44,748
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

498
