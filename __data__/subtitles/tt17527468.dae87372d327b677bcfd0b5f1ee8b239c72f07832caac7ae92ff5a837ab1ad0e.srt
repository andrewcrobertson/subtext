1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,230
[upbeat rock music playing]

2
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,239
[PJ] <i>Tonight is</i>
<i>the fucking night, okay?</i>

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,868
We've looked like shit for
years, and we are developing.

4
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,828
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

5
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,039
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

6
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,499
We're getting out there.

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,042
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

8
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,754
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

9
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,422
Man, speak for yourself.

10
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,549
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

11
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,069
just like nobody wanted to fuck
me last year or the year before.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,471
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

13
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,555
I think that it's time.

14
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,765
Oh, really? It's time?

15
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,017
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,619
we've all been going
to school together?

17
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,853
I've been building tension.

18
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,289
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

19
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:03,355
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,857
And just what would I say?

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,319
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

22
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,154
How's his penis?

23
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,157
Still awesome and big and throbbing
and, uh, like a male penis?"

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,880
They could have broken up,
you never know.

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,660
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

26
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,330
I'm not doin' that with
Isabel, you know what I mean?

27
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,583
Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'
the long game with her, okay?

28
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,585
-Mmm. -Here's how
it's gonna shake out.

29
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,879
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

30
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,090
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

31
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,550
I show up, I'm in a little suit

32
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,636
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,845
It's probably white, okay?

34
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,348
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

35
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,433
What the fuck happened to her?

36
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,977
She's washed up.

37
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,938
I mean Jeff has run her ragged.

38
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,066
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

39
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,653
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

40
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,154
Josie, tick-tock.

41
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,299
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

42
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,200
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

43
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,452
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

44
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,537
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,121
I might have a good shot
that way.

46
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,500
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

47
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,253
What the fuck are you wearing?

48
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,590
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

49
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,384
I think you wanna be here.

50
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,802
Who said that?

51
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,363
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

52
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,473
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

53
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,976
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,912
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

55
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,146
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

56
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,499
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

57
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,024
You have Munchausen's.

58
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,734
Look, just follow my lead.

59
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,111
- Hello, ladies.
- [girl 1] Oh.

60
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,505
[girl 2 chuckles] Oh.
You know what?

61
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,756
- Just keep going.
- [PJ] How was your summer?

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,490
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

63
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,950
Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?

64
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,952
This school has such
a gay problem.

65
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,538
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

66
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:46,125
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

67
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,043
Like, look at Matthieu.

68
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,837
[boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,131
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

70
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,894
- Thanks, bitch.
- [Matthieu and boy chuckle]

71
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,136
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

72
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,697
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

73
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,598
- Every show.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,933
- [Isabel giggles]
- [PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.

75
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,059
Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,272
- [gentle music playing]
- [laughing]

77
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,990
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

78
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,326
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

79
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,536
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,901
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

81
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,374
yeah, it was good.

82
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,792
What are you guys doing here?

83
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,936
You guys never come to the fair.

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,170
What happened to your arm?

85
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,547
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

86
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,031
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

87
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,176
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

88
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,886
[Josie] No, I just tripped
and I...

89
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,888
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

90
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,431
Did you go to juvie?

91
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,117
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- [man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

92
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,660
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- <i>it's time to get ready,</i>

93
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,271
<i>get wild, and get horny
for our very own Vikings!</i>

94
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,106
Oh, my God, what did you do?

95
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,692
-[Josie yelping] -[man] <i>And the
man who will lead us to victory</i>

96
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,778
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

97
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,155
<i>shit-eating Huntington Ferrets,</i>

98
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,574
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

99
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,242
[girl 3] Jeff! Have my babies!

100
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,953
[girl 4] Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

101
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,412
- [crowd cheers]
- [PJ groans]

102
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,015
[PJ] I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

103
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,750
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

104
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,210
What's the grossest animal?

105
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,296
[girl 5] Jeff,
come sign my tits!

106
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,465
- [whistle blows]
- [girl 6] Eat my pussy!

107
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,343
That's right.

108
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,472
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

109
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,683
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

110
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,184
- Take this.
- [Josie] No.

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,686
Really quick.
This is the moment.

112
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,562
Stop yelling at me!

113
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,206
Could you give that back
really quickly?

114
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,983
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

115
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,694
[PJ] I am loving all the...

116
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,445
holes in your pants.

117
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,571
Thanks.

118
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,573
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

119
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,700
[PJ] Thank you.

120
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,035
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

121
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,079
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

122
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,581
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- [Brittany] No, not that.

123
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,208
[PJ] Brittany.

124
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,769
Are you thinking of riding the
Ferris wheel at all tonight?

125
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,212
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

126
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,296
I need to pull trig.

127
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,798
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

128
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,067
I'm gonna say something crazy.

129
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,636
I think you could eat food,

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,222
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

131
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,557
Mmm, gross.

132
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,225
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

133
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,578
-[Brittany] Oh, no. -Yeah, this
is fucking disgusting. Ugh.

134
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,396
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,689
Oh, I don't know.

136
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,125
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

137
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,192
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

138
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,028
- Yes, you could.
- No.

139
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,071
No bun. [clears throat] Okay.

140
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,365
Um, Isabel.

141
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,659
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

142
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,827
I don't think so.

143
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,495
[PJ] I think so.
It was really good.

144
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,955
It was super funny.

145
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,500
[PJ clears throat]

146
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,463
You're just so...
You're skinny too, as well.

147
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,966
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

148
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,718
Yeah, you're skinny...

149
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,237
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

150
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,180
You probably should eat.

151
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,658
They're gonna send you to the
hospital with how skinny you are.

152
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,101
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

153
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,914
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

154
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,023
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

155
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,778
[groans] Fuck! Fuck!

156
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,780
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

157
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,323
You know what? I'm good.

158
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,325
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

159
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,785
If it's not happening here,

160
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,537
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

161
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,748
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

162
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,833
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

163
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,418
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

164
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,878
That's the only hope for me.

165
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,421
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

166
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,839
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

167
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,692
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

168
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,842
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

169
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,986
We're going to have
to join a church.

170
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,220
He'll be the gay pastor.

171
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,805
My whole life's fucked!

172
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,640
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

173
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,391
but everybody knows he's fruity.

174
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,811
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

175
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,522
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

176
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,190
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

177
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,393
but we try to make it work
for him, but he's not happy.

178
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,777
And yeah, guess what?

179
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,613
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

180
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,990
He's fucking the evangelist!

181
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,910
[crying] I don't wanna
live like that.

182
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,746
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

183
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,625
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

184
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,545
- [Jeff] Isabel.
- [Isabel] Leave me alone!

185
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,980
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

186
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,172
- What?
- Look.

187
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,049
- [Isabel] Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

188
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,467
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

189
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,636
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

190
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,888
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

191
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,223
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

192
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,225
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

193
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,309
Yes, come on.

194
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,853
Irish Catholic.

195
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,330
- And I'm regular Christian!
- [groaning in frustration]

196
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,082
- [PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.
- [Josie] PJ, stop.

197
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,899
[Jeff grunts]
You're hurting my head.

198
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,360
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

199
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,797
And it's giving me PTSD about all
the other times I've had migraines.

200
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,656
- Just do it now.
- No.

201
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,379
-Just go fucking ask her. -No.
Isabel, would you like a safety ride?

202
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,410
Isabel.

203
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,246
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

204
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,723
- [Jeff] Isabel...
- [Isabel breathes heavily]

205
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,166
Get out of the car.

206
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,500
You can't tell me what to do.

207
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,377
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- [Jeff] Okay,

208
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,422
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

209
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,549
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

210
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,801
- Move, you prick!
- [groans]

211
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,845
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

212
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,072
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

213
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,765
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

214
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,018
-Hey. -Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

215
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,520
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

216
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,189
Get out! Come on.

217
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,416
-I feel like we should just drive.
-Drive.

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,649
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

219
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,294
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

220

- He's not moving.

221

[Isabel] He's gonna move.

222

- [PJ] We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

223
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,115
- Drive. He'll move.
- [PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.

224
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,576
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

Are you okay?

232

I'm coming!

You're not alone.
You're not alone.

234

- Back up! Back up! [screams]
- We didn't even do anything.

235
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,061
- No, come here. [grunting]
- [groaning]

236
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,371
- Man down! Man down!
- [Jeff] You!

237
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,647
[PJ] Oh, my God.

238
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,416
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,650
[PJ] We should go. Let's go.

240
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,109
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

241
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,694
Let's just kind of peel on out.

242
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,255
- [Josie] Fine.
- What did you do to him?

243
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,114
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

244
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,450
- [Jeff wailing]
- You fucking cowards!

245
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,618
You better fucking run!

246
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,497
[Jeff] I don't understand.
What the fuck? [sobs]

247
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,750

<i>Attention.</i>

250
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>The library is out of use again.</i>

251
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,467
<i>Huntington shot up
our remaining books,</i>

252
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,221
<i>so there will be no reading

253
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,140
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

254
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:21,311
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

I know I won't even digest it.

256

I have to throw up."

257
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,359
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

258
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,486
She's like, "No, not, just...

259
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,029
Maybe, but not the bun."

260
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,032
Oh, it was just really sweet.

261
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,951
You had to be there.

00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,035
I was there.

What? Yeah.

Welcome back to class.

Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

[scoffs] Nice try, PJ,

282
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,532
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

All right, check it out.

00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,263
-Today I got a special lesson for all of you.
-Josie, so, how'd you do it?

back at the ranch...

Okay, so, did he fight back?

No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

294
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,990
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

295
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,557
or anything, just let me know...

296
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
I heard you did something to
him, I just don't know what.

297
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,411
and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

298
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,395
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

299
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,105
Oh, my God.

about that?

339
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,077
- [PA chimes]
- [Principal Meyers] <i>Excuse me.</i>

340
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,728
<i>Could the ugly, untalented gays</i>

341
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,689
<i>please report
to the principal's office?</i>

342
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,691
Guess that's you guys.

343
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,318
Hello, Principal Meyers. First of
all, I want to say, God bless...

344
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,946
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

345
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,656
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

346
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,117
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

347
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,953
all-American, red-blooded, muscular
man this town has ever seen.

348
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,097
Sir, please, look in the mirror.

349
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,706
- Shush.
- Okay.

350
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:32,127
The homecoming game with
Huntington is nearly a month away.

351
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,563
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

352
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,255
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

353
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,607
- [Josie] Twenty years.
- [PJ] Couldn't be clearer.

354
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,692
[Josie] I think I can explain.

355
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,967
I can explain.

356
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,011
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

357
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,512
[Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.

358
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,973
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

359
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,308
Yeah, actually.

360
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,393
How come you can't buck up

361
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,104
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

362
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,274
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

363
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,027
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

364
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,612
Did you ever think of that, sir?

365
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,840
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

366
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,116
Okay. What? What? Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

367
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,118
-Can we just calm down, everybody.
-Zip it.

368
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,828
- You know what?
- What?

369
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,372
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

370
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,957
- No! No!
- [Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!

371
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,461
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

372
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,672
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

373
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,800
for...

374
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,762
for our self-defense club.

375
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,894
Self-defense... What is that?

376
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,355
- [Josie] Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

377
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,398
- Well, here's the thing...
- Yes! Yes!

378
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,359
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

379
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,693
A fight club.

380
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,196
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

381
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,280
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

382
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,657
No, we don't. Shut up.

383
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,176
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

384
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,552
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

385
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,537
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

386
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,330
while you perform
<i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

387
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,041
Just stay in your lane until
you're munching beaver at Wesleyan.

388
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,876
Yes, sir.

389
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,271
[Hazel] I can't believe they're
letting you guys start a fight club.

390
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,589
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

391
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,150
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

392
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,175
We're doing it.

393
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,094
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

394
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,681
Josie, did you see the way that Isabel
and Brittany were looking at us?

395
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,475
-[Josie groans] -Also, you
heard the announcements.

396
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,685
Girls are terrified.

397
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,395
It's perfect. They need this.

398
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,022
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

399
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,234
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

400
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,545
Guys do that all the time, okay?

401
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,712
That's the point of feminism.

402
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,029
That's not the point
of feminism.

403
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,906
You also don't care
about feminism.

404
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,230
Your favorite show is <i>Entourage.</i>

405
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,742
You're missing the point!

406
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,804
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

407
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,347
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

408
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,081
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

409
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,583
- [grunts frustratedly]
- About juvie?

410
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,477
- [PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

411
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,895
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

412
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,254
I just didn't correct you.

413
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,548
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

414
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,871
You try to punch me in the
face, I stop it from happening.

415
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,011
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

416
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,263
Look, this is how we do this.

417
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,681
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

418
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,057
Which I've got covered.

419
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,184
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

420
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,269
[PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.

421
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,854
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

422
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,105
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

423
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,708
[Josie and PJ]
You know Stella-Rebecca?

424
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,452
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

425
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,587
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

426
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,696
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

427
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,780
[Josie sighs]

428
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,532
- Josie.
- What?

429
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,034
- We're doing this.
- No.

430
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,744
Yeah. Listen to me.

431
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,555
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

432
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,498
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

433
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,167
They are grateful to us.

434
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,711
We build a community, we bond,

435
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,963
we share, we connect.

436
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,966
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

437
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,426
Next thing you know,

438
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,237
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

439
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,621
- [player 1] Jeffrey!
- [PJ] Josie...

440
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,766
Isabel knew your name.

441
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,851
- [player 2] Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

442
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,062
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

443
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,688
we just run the risk of becoming

444
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,666
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

445
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,010
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

446
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,320
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

447
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,989
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

448
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,193
We're the lowest of the low.

449
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,700
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

450
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,828
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

451
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,498
There's a serious lack of female
solidarity at this school.

452
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,708
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

453
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,211
Yeah, I mean, we just felt like

454
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,838
there's a serious lack of female
solidarity at this school.

455
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,717
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

456
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,762
What's your plan here?

457
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,472
I don't need a plan.

458
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,599
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

459
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,060
[upbeat electronic
music playing]

460
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,354
[PJ sighs]

461
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:21,940
Okay.

462
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,149
What's up, lads?

463
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,402
What the fuck?

464
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,487
- These girls are ugly.
- [Josie] Okay.

465
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,988
Where is Stella?

466
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,615
She was booked
for a car convention.

467
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,242
What? It's a Monday.

468
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,910
[Josie] Um, maybe we should go

469
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,179
- before someone cool shows up?
- [door opens]

470
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,705
Before I die? Pick one.

471
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,290
[Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

472
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
I love David Fincher.

473
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,795
- [sighs] Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

474
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,798
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

475
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,383
and stopped huffing paint.

476
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,218
[Josie] She'll never stop
huffing paint.

477
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,445
[Hazel] So, I thought
we'd start...

478
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,470
Um...

479
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,431
- Okay.
- Sorry.

480
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,683
[PJ] All right.

481
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,936
Listen up, you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

482
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,688
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

483
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,523
Um, it's a self-defense club.

484
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,858
It's not really, "Fight."

485
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,445
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

486
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,155
and they're picking on the weak

487
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,824
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

488
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,535
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

489
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,704
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

490
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,998
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

491
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,666
Then, punch-bucket,

492
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,668
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

493
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,837
and we punch you
until you bleed.

494
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,883
Before that, perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

495
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,152
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

496
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,219
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

497
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,305
Juvie was way crazier.

498
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,390
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

499
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,517
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

500
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,353
I get up. I'm blind.

501
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,731
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

502
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,691
Broke her fuckin' nose.

503
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,568
Josie?

504
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,736
Care to share?

505
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,364
Yeah, all right.

506
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,201
Juvie was insane.

507
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,537
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

508
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,457
so I took her outside and I
punched her till she died.

509
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,877
So, you killed a girl?

510
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,754
Uh, no.

511
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,924
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

512
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,259
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

513
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,220
when she came back
to life, so...

514
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,056
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl...

515
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,849
She came back to life.

516
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,519
Mmm. But I remember her being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

517
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,521
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

518
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,689
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

519
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,066
Josie, if you'll step forward.

520
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,443
No, I don't wanna do that.

521
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,505
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

522
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,030
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

523
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,615
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

524
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,843
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

525
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,118
They wanna see the punch.

526
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,203
Who am I gonna punch?

527
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,579
Punch me. Just punch me.

528
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,248
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

529
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,332
I can punch you.

530
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,834
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

531
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,237
Something people
would always say,

532
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,395
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

533
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,587
- Come on up.
- [Josie grunts]

534
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh! [groans, thuds]

535
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,675
Oh, fuck!

536
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,970
- [Josie sighs]
- [PJ breathing heavily]

537
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,368
Will there an advisor
for this club?

538
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,060
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

539
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

540
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,147
where we punch each other
in the face?

541
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,110
The Holocaust. It happened.

542
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,863
Yes, it did.

543
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,949
But how? The seeds were sown
in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>

544
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,869
which y'all are gonna reenact while
I do some little reading over here.

545
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,787
[PJ] I mean, he's perfect.

546
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,873
[Josie] No.

547
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,165
- What?
- No.

548
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,750
Please.

549
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,562
Dude, we're not fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

550
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,438
Yeah, and I've never had so many
girls look at me in my life.

551
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,672
Fuck! When did you show up?

552
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,173
Hey, guys. [chuckles]

553
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,718
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

554
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,762
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

555
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,615
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

556
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,684
and they were coming at me with,
like, swords and, like, knives

557
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,477
and, like, guns and stuff,

558
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,689
and you taught me how to punch
like that, then I wouldn't die.

559
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,191
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

560
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,443
But, unfortunately,

561
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,166
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

562
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,946
What? Why?

563
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,031
I don't know.

564
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,824
Why? It was just
so empowering.

565
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,117
What was empowering?

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,078
- Oh, my God, hi. Um...
- [players groaning]

567
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,331
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

568
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,459
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

569
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,961
- [bell rings]
- Isabel, let's go.

570
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,052
[Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.

571
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,511
- I'm so strong.
- [Isabel giggles]

572
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,555
[whimsical music playing]

573
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,141
I mean...

574
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,477
[chuckling mischievously]

575
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,607
- [PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
- [Josie sighs]

576
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,108
Great class today.

577
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,110
Hey, uh, girl.

578
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,612
Thanks for coming in today.

579
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,906
We have to come in.
It's class.

580
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,116
Try telling Dimitri Walker that.

581
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,453
Little motherfucker came the first
week and I ain't seen him since.

582
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,038
Dimitri Walker committed suicide

583
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,790
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

584
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,292
[chuckles] Sure, he did.

585
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:55,713
Anyways, um, we were wondering if
you wanted to be our club advisor.

586
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,924
- What kind of club is that?
- [PJ] It's a women's club.

587
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,801
We talk about women's issues.

588
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,971
For example, periods,

589
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,098
declining egg count,

590
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,265
skirts...

591
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,517
Skirts?

592
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,395
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

593
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,690
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

594
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,775
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

595
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,419
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

596
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,361
- Makes sense.
- [PJ] Yeah.

597
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,113
Listen. I'm kind of,

598
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,365
you know, retiling the bathroom.

599
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,034
- [PJ] Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

600
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,037
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

601
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,831
Back to the club,

602
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,767
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off of stuff.

603
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,418
[Josie] Can I be honest?
You're a man

604
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,044
who's not coping
with what's going on.

605
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,504
- Yeah.
- You know what?

606
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,132
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

607
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,341
And here's one thing

608
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,735
- my mom's always said to me.
- [PJ] Mmm.

609
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,804
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

610
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,431
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

611
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,766
[Josie] It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

612
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,685
-but you don't even come
to the dang club. -No.

613
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,812
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

614
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,123
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

615
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,232
You just say
you're doing something

616
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,984
and then you don't do
any of those things.

617
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,212
You know what I mean? You say,
"I support women." You don't.

618
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,779
Don't come. Yeah.

619
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,575
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

620
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,618
- Amazing.
- What?

621
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:08,870
- Yeah.
- Really?

622
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,163
- Okay.
- [PJ] So cool.

623
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,914
[grunts]

624
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,046
How many girls go
to this school, again?

625
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,799
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

626
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,051
Hey, guys.

627
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,846
[PJ] Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

628
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,974
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

629
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,018
[Mr. G] Hey, ladies.

630
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,103
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

631
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,314
All right. Um...

632
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,608
Hello, everybody.

633
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,693
Okay, excuse me.

634
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,153
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

635
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,446
Um...

636
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,031
[loud thumping]

637
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,618
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

638
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,253
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

639
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,758
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

640
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:08,179
There are serious rules that
we need to establish, 'kay?

641
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,057
First...

642
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,392
listen.

643
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,894
Second,

644
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,648
be on time.

645
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,275
Yeah.

646
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,039
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

647
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,197
What time is it?

648
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,990
- [Annie] 3:30.
- 3:30!

649
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,618
Club starts at 3:15.

650
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,204
Not 3:16.

651
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,874
[scoffs] Not 3:17,

652
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:41,420
but the doors close at 3:15.

653
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,172
No exceptions.

654
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,883
I don't care if you're like...

655
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,719
-[door opens] -"Oh, but I had
to go to extra help for math

656
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,515
because I... I need
to get a full ride

657
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,058
because my mom
lives in a trailer

658
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,310
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

659
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,479
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

660
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,106
Shut up, okay?

661
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,693
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

662
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,660
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

663
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,953
Nice.

664
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,913
[PJ] Uh, we're just getting
started here.

665
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,540
So, um...

666
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,353
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

667
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,045
We're gonna do wrestling.

668
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,339
I think I need a volunteer.

669
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,091
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

670
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,177
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

671
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,620
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

672
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,990
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

673
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,348
Don't be late.

674
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,659
- But this week is good...
- [PJ] Yeah. No worries.

675
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,910
if you're late.
Take it easy.

676
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,120
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

677
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,062
This is a self-defense
class, right?

678
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,373
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

679
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,940
against, like, football players.

680
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,027
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

681
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,446
[chuckles nervously, sighs]
They're gonna pork us.

682
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,531
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

683
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,949
There's a cash prize, right?

684
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,913
[Isabel] I thought this was
to be part of, like,

685
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,245
a local underprivileged
female community.

686
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,124
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

687
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,752
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

688
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:03,979
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

689
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,463
So, uh, you know, like...

690
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,050
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

691
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,052
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

692
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,470
- Love that.
- [PJ] Yeah.

693
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,513
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

694
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,312
- [Annie grunts]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

695
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,647
I don't know about this shit.

696
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,066
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

697
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,151
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

698
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,629
- Look.
- [Josie] We can take it slower.

699
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,013
- [PJ] Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

700
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,614
Take that route.
Little slower.

701
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,158
Look. You just use your natural
instincts, just come at me.

702
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,368
Whatever you want, 'kay?

703
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,578
- [PJ grunts]
- Oh, fuck.

704
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:38,913
- [girls gasp]
- [PJ] Okay.

705
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,540
That's great.
I say that we go again.

706
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,209
- Oh!
- [Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.

707
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,294
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

708
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,939
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

709
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,565
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

710
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,424
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

711
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,426
- [Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

712
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,904
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

713
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,763
I know that,

714
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,641
you know, this is
a little messy right now

715
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,685
but, like, the only way

716
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,063
that we can learn how to defend
ourselves is by teaching each other.

717
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,441
Huntington is coming.

718
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,151
[inspirational music playing]

719
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,319
We need this.

720
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,865
I know that things
might seem scary,

721
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,034
but that's okay, because...

722
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,121
because...

723
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,207
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

724
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,875
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

725
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,294
- Right?
- [Josie] Yes.

726
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,546

727

assaulted on your birthday again.

- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

729
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,804
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

730
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,389
Yeah, absolutely.

731
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,557

732
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,392
I'll be able to kill my stepdad.

00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,853
- Awesome.
- Okay.

734
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,247
[PJ] And if you believe
in yourselves

735
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,481
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,567

811
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,484
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

812
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,403
No, I mean, seriously, to
have a safe space like this,

813
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,988
it means a lot to people,

814
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,449
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

815
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,201
and actually get
to know these girls,

816
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,703
like, it would be
really important,

817
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,872
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

818
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,547
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

819
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,131
-Yeah. -I love talking
about my trauma.

822
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,431
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

823
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,742
- Don't say "girls." It's you.
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

824

- I just wanted to say

825
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,062
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

826
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,564
It seems so supportive of women.

827
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,774
Especially the hot ones.

828
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,609
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

829
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,570
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

830
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:07,575
but we're getting a little
close to the game now and, um...

831
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,909
I'm just a bit concerned

832
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,036
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

833
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,374
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

834
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,544
Okay.

835
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,925
[Josie] So, we know
that the club has been a place

836
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,969
where we can feel
empowered physically,

837
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,763
but we also thought it could be

838
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,433
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

839
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,892
and talk about our feelings.

840
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,646
Okay, so who's been raped?

841
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,971
Just, you know, raise your hand.

842
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,736
Gray area stuff counts too.

843
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,869
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

844
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,001
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

845
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,838
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

846
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,632
fuck, whatever.

847
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,258
You know?

848
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,594
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

849
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,804
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

850
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,890
And then the form
tells me to call,

851
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:16,185
so I call and then they say they can't
get involved until he tries to kill me.

852
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,668
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

853
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,605
but that doesn't count.

854
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,690
So, it's just, like, annoying.

855
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,067
Been there.

856
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,527
We've all been there.

857
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,322
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

858
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,616
but I'm more annoyed

859
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,912
that everyone knows me for
being beautiful and popular

860
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,998
and no one knows that I'm
actually smart and super driven.

861
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:41,919
Like, I literally own a jewelry
business and no one talks about it!

862
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,005
See?

863
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,633
[Hazel] Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

864
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,594
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

865
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,263
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

866
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,182
It's been really, really dark.

867
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,243
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

868
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:01,689
get to know some new people who
actually want to, like, get to know me.

869
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:04,412
-I want to bring it back to Brittany
for one second. -I can go next,

870
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,235
if that's okay.

871
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,241
I don't really like talking
about juvie

872
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,160
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

873
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,330
You know, obviously, we get
a lot of props or whatever

874
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,774
'cause people think
it's so badass.

875
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,627
But, really wasn't.

876
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,298
I mean, unless you consider getting
hazed horrifically every single night,

877
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,634
like, badass. I mean, um,

878
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:34,012
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

879
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,098
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

880
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,142
fight people basically
every single night.

881
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:41,353
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

882
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:44,815
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

883
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,151
and, um, pipes as well.

884
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,362
And, um, we had to just, like, fight
people, sometimes to the death.

885
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,197
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

886
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,492
um, and that guilt probably will,
like, always shackle me forever.

887
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,664
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

888
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,500
Like, I don't have
to just let things

889
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:07,087
happen to me 'cause of you guys.

890
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,090
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

891
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,676
for what the club
has become and...

892
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,386
Um...

893
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,930
Just especially, you know, from
where we started and, uh...

894
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,058
Yeah, sorry.

895
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,745
[chuckles] I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

896
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,936
I've never really,

897
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,356
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

898
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,108
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

899
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,568
I'm going through a divorce.

900
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,739
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

901
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,240
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

902
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,326
men... men need therapy.

903
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,995
[softly] Yeah.

904
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,873
[in normal voice] I think that's
a good place to maybe wrap up.

905
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

906
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,220
Um...

907
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,014
Thank you, um, for that.

908
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,434
Um...

909
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,105
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

910
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:11,485
but I was going to study for Mr. G's
women murdered in history test,

911
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,821
if you wanna...

912
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,367
Yeah.

913
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,661
Yeah, okay, sure.

914
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,456
[man and woman
moaning in pleasure]

915
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,541
Mom?

916
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,670
[woman giggles]

917
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,339
[man groans]

918
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,632
Mom?

919
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,096
Oh, hi, honey.

920
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,722
What are you doing home
so early?

921
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,519
[grunts, groans]

922
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,603
Uh...

923
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,480
Are you kidding me?

924
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,150
I had a long day. [chuckles]

925
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,252
[Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

926
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,301
[Stella-Rebecca]
First club fundraiser.

927
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,952
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

928
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,371
Hello, ladies.

929
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,932
[Stella-Rebecca]
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

930
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,059
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

931
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,626
It's so weird. [chuckles]

932
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,212
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

933
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,463
Thanks, PJ.

934
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,173
- [Hazel groaning]
- Ah. We're havin' fun.

935
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,758
We're selling panties.

936
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,094
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

937
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,805
Very nice.

938
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,181
[PJ] Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

939
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,025
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

940
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,979
Um, I can't. Uh...

941
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,733
Isabel and I have plans, so...

942
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,026
[Hazel continues groaning]

943
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,944
You're hanging out with Isabel?

944
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,195
Yep.

945
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,448
[PJ] Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

946
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,283
I have to keep up.

947
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,618
Hazel, what is wrong?

948
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,994
Are you constipated
or something?

949
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,329
[Hazel] I'm fucking tired.

950
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,664
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

951
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,625
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

952
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,043
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

953
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,544
He's like the crybaby.

954
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,964
With the balls?

955
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,300
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

956
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,054
He's like the main guy.

957
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
[sputters] Jeff?

958
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,534
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

959
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,061
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

960
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,729
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

961
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,856
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

962
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,358
[Stella-Rebecca yelps]

963
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,525
I'm good. [chuckles]

964
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,235
[PJ] Looking good, Stella!

965
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,528
[Isabel laughs]

966
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,732
[PJ] Are you gonna tell her?

967
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,035
[Tim] Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

968
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,371
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

969
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,619
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

970
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,668
[player] Hit me! Ow!

971
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,380
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

972
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,675
Got it. Thank you.

973
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,385
- [players shouting]
- [sighs]

974
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,139
[whistle blows]

975
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,266
Jeff!

976
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,144
[easygoing music playing]

977
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,064
[Josie laughing]

978
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,609
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

979
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,319
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

980
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,406
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

981
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,949
[Josie and Isabel laughing]

982
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,788
I wanted to...

983
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,457
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

984
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,334
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

985
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,837
Me too.

986
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,216
I think it's really impressive

987
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,428
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

988
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,889
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

989
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,308
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

990
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,603
You're really, really brave.

991
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,022
No. [chuckles]

992
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,440
No. No, no.

993
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,776
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl. [chuckles]

994
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,861
You're...

995
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,988
Yeah, you're...

996
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,574
really, really brave.

997
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,078
What?

998
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,710
Actually, Isabel, uh...

999
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,713
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

1000
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,257
There's something
you maybe should know.

1001
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,508
Uh...

1002
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,721
I mean it's pretty insane.

1003
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,556
Okay. [chuckles]
What... what is it?

1004
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,559
I just, I...

1005
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,522
I heard Jeff is cheating on you.

1006
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,926
- [music stops]
- [glasses clinking]

1007
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,737
Wait... [laughing]

1008
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,158
Wait, what? [chuckles]

1009
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,453
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

1010
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:36,541
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

1011
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:41,421
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

1012
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:45,133
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

1013
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,011
- like, constantly.
- [Josie and Isabel laughing]

1014
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:52,140
I mean, just at it with each
other, which is pretty fucked up.

1015
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,227
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

1016
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,229
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

1017
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,855
[cries] Oh.

1018
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,398
[sobbing]

1019
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,201

1190
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,578
[PJ] Wait. Stop.

1191
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,871
We don't... Wait, no,
we don't know that for sure.

1192
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:57,959
PJ, don't be sad it's over.
Be happy it happened.

1193
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,670
[PJ] All right, can everyone
calm the fuck down, please?

1194
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,339
The club is not over,
Josie, right?

1195
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,758
[Isabel] No matter what,

1196
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,428
this club has brought me
so much.

1197
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,512
I feel...

1198
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,684
so much more powerful and, um...

1199
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,644
protected.

1200
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,896
- Me too.
- [PJ chuckles]

1201
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,398
- Great.
- [Hazel] Oh, my God, PJ.

1202
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
Okay, I'm sorry
that you didn't get

1203
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,377
what you wanted
out of this group,

1204
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,278
but I think the rest of us did.

1205
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,863
Oh. Good for fucking you,
Hazel.

1206
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,198
I'm glad that you finally
wrote one email.

1207
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,950
- Accomplished a lot.
- I actually did.

1208
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,036
I practically ran this club
for you and Josie.

1209
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,746
Hey, let's calm down, maybe.

1210
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,141
You really think that you're the
reason that we have this club?

1211
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,333
The reason? No.

1212
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,560
But I can tell everyone that
if you want.

1213
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,961
Hazel. Uh, hey,
let's calm down, right?

1214
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:43,546
You're really ungrateful.

1215
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,649
You're so lucky that we even
let you be a part of this.

1216
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,383
PJ, you're a liar.

1217
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,596
[PJ scoffs]

1218
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,098
Yeah, well, you have no friends,

1219
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,392
and a skank as a mom, so...

1220
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,949
- [Josie] Hazel.
- [PJ scoffs]

1221
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,706
[door closes]

1222
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:22,794
[Brittany] PJ...

1223
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,194
This doesn't mean
it wasn't worth it.

1224
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,221
[mellow music playing]

1225
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,640
[students chattering]

1226
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:36,974
[crying]

1227
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,776
Hazel.

1228
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:47,860
[door closes]

1229
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,531
Whoa.

1230
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:56,536
I love God.

1231
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:58,871
- Yes, same.
- [chuckles]

1232
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,590
Yeah.

1233
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,801
Oh, my God, I always
wanted one of these.

1234
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,390
But my mom says they hide your
figure and make you look ugly.

1235
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,517
Um, you can borrow it
if you want.

1236
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,352
Like, as a joke or...

1237
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,563
whatever.

1238
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,731
Thanks.

1239
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:25,815
[Josie] Yeah.

1240
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,449
[Isabel] Wow, you and PJ

1241
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,409
really have been
friends forever.

1242
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,162
Oh, I mean,
since the first grade, so...

1243
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,040
We had the same
babysitter, Rhodes.

1244
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,877
PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I
think she's kind of like a mentor.

1245
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,714
[Josie clears throat]

1246
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,842
Yeah, but you guys, like,
could not be more different.

1247
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,844
She's so, like...

1248
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,263
like...

1249
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,515
[chuckles] You know?

1250
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,839
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- And you're...

1251
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,560
You're so, like...

1252
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,063
[both chuckle]

1253
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,444
- You know what I mean?
- No, yeah, I know.

1254
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:16,532
Josie...

1255
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,284
[gentle music playing]

1256
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,734
[grunts softly]

1257
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,577
[Isabel breathing heavily]

1258
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,124
[PJ] I'm tryna help
your jewelry business grow.

1259
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,793
- [Brittany] Really?
- [PJ] Yeah.

1260
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,276
I don't know if I can hire you
because you're like a convict.

1261
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,508
Wow.

1262
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:19,345
This is, um, a total shithole.

1263
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,508
[Brittany chuckles lightly]

1264
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,185
Kind of a mess. Sorry.

1265
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,817
Well, I hear that
if you hire a convict,

1266
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,151
they give you a tax break.

1267
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,030
[Brittany groans]

1268
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,199
I fucking hate Mr. G.

1269
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,493
Everything he says
is so pathetic.

1270
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,704
Oh, yeah. I mean,

1271
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,206
I feel like he, like,
jerks off to a poster

1272
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,293
of the 1999 Rockbridge team
every single night, so...

1273
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,295
Literally the peak
of his existence.

1274
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,386
[Brittany sighs]

1275
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,683
Like, what is the point
of this assignment?

1276
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:11,272
Who is bell hooks
and why do we care?

1277
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,733
Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,
like, study over here.

1278
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:15,985
[whispering] Watch out.

1279
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,371
What?

1280
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,416
Uh, nothing, I'm just...

1281
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,754
I'm just concerned
'cause I'm, like...

1282
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:39,383
Your wrists are so small, and the
pen is so heavy that I'm like,

1283
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,802
- "Is she getting exhausted?"
- Mmm.

1284
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,766
I'm surprised you can even see
what you're doing

1285
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,014
with all the surface area

1286
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,457
- that yours are taking up.
- [gasps]

1287
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,351
Wow.

1288
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,786
Must be a struggle
for you to write.

1289
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,312
Okay, does this hurt?

1290
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,332
Actually, yeah, that does hurt
my tiny, delicate wrists.

1291
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,076
Yeah, that was
the lightest tap of all time.

1292
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,543
- Can you feel that?
- Can't even feel that.

1293
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,527
- Can't feel anything.
- Just like muscles in there.

1294
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,329
Um...

1295
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:09,914
Uh...

1296
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,377
PJ, I'm... I'm straight.

1297
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:20,800
Oh.

1298
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:24,595
Um...

1299
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,142
Yeah. Um...

1300
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:33,270
-I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.
-No, that's all...

1301
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:36,190
It's all good. I shouldn't
have assumed anything.

1302
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,321
[drums playing]

1303
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,917
[sighs] Um...

1304
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,503
I wanted to tell you something.

1305
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,256
What?

1306
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,925
Like, something that happened
last night.

1307
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:05,720
What happened?

1308
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,431
[softly] With Isabel.

1309
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:13,769
Wait.

1310
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,232
Wait, seriously?

[spectators cheering]

1312
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,655

I know. I just like getting
caught up in the festivities.

That's why you started this?

No, no, no.

Not entire... Okay.

1414
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,348
Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

1415
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,934
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

1416
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,312
The point of the club

1417
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:10,232
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

1418
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:13,360
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

1419
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:14,796
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

1420
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,197
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

1421
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,907
This is the second wave
all over again.

1422

I didn't want to.

1424
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,076
I would never want to do this.

You're pathetic, Josie.

1426

[PJ] Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

1427
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,563
All right, look.

1428
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,940
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1429
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:53,233
I just look like this.

1430
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,486
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

1431
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:58,405
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked y'all group

1432
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,656
and what y'all stood for.

1433
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,326
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

1434
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,661
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

1435
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,498
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

1436
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,874
Is this about the time I said

1437
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,959
Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?

1438
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,420
Because it's true.

1439
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:16,673
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

1440
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:17,957
but you never hear about them.

1441
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,094
And then it's like,

1442
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,471
[in high-pitched voice] "Oh,
it's so hard to be a girl."

1443
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,139
"We, like, make less money."

1444
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,183
"We had to lose
our last names."

1445
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,643
"I love you."

1446
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:29,662
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

1447
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,232
"Oh, I love the mint green
backsplash in the kitchen."

1448
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,584
[in normal voice]
And all of a sudden,

1449
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,402
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

1450
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:39,279
and suddenly, the fucking
kitchen is lime green.

1451
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,739
I think...

1452
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,242
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

1453
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,744
Oh, you look confused, like
how I'm confused right now,

1454
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:48,497
on how you created a fucking
fight club to get some cooch.

1455
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,750
And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

1456
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,710
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

1457
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,021
you know what I'm talking about?

1458
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,272
You know what I mean?
Caressing the back

1459
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,173

1460
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,137
Sorry, I just don't know if you're
supposed to be talking to us like that.

1461
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,719
Just, like, as a teacher...

1462
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,388
Man, I knew women were evil.

1463
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,433

Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

1470
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:30,497
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

1471
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,834
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

1472
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,128
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

1473
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,672
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

1474
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,382
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

1475
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,176
and then he wouldn't be so upset

1476
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,571
and then whatever the fuck just
happened would not have happened.

1477
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:47,556
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

1478
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,142
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

1479
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,145
Well, I mean, yeah, it was your
idea to start the whole club.

1480
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,899
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

1481
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,984
You know that.

1482
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,070
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

1483
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,907
You followed my lead when
you created that insane story

1484
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,660
about girls betting on you to
fight other girls with shivs.

1485
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:11,538
You're just mad

Without you.

1488
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,896
No, you never would
have talked to her without me,

1489
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,379
- ever.
- [chuckles]

1490

happen for you.

girls," and whatever?

Is that you're the only one
who didn't do anything.

1496
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,567
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
Brittany's straight, so...

1497
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,236
Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.

1498
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,779
Does it even matter?

1499
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,990
Do you even care?
Do you actually like her?

1500

Do you care about anyone
other than yourself?

Why... why... why you look
like a scared puppy?

1555
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,258
[Josie] Hey, Rhodes.

1556
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,718
Do you have a minute to talk?

1557
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,470
If you don't wanna
borrow firearms,

1558
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,264
- then why are you here?
- Um...

1559
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,474
- Like, for advice?
- [sighs]

1560

I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.

You're too old for this shit.

[sighs]

1563
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,189
Girl, when I was in high school,

1564
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,859
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

1565
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,152
And back then it was worse

1566
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,029
because they hated you
just for being gay.

1567
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:15,157
[both] Not for being
gay and untalented.

1568
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,033
Mmm.

1569
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,910
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

1570
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:20,954
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

1571
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:22,873
And I used to say,

1572
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,308
[in high-pitched voice]
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

1573

Look, that's not the point.

01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,752
You want some advice?

1575
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,628
Invest in yourself,

1576
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,472
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

1577
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:33,592
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

1578
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:34,926
I just, um...

1579
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,262
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

1580
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,680
- So, like...
- [coughing]

1581
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,432
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

1582
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,643
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

1583
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,062
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

1584
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:47,814
it's just gotten more sad.

1585
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,693
Okay, um...

1586
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,570
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

1587
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:55,572
and then work it out
with PJ there.

1588
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:56,740
I wouldn't do that.

1589
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,908
Why not?

1590
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,951
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

1591
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:03,079
Well, I'm guessing they've been fucking
people up for the past month, right?

1592
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,665
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

1593
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,185
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

1594
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,044
I don't know. Football?

Oh, girl.

1597
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,968
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

1598
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:19,012
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

1599

How you don't know...

1600
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,768
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

1601
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,938
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

1602
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,066
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

1603
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,442
It's called quartering.

1604
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:33,985
I know... I know
what it's called.

1605
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,112

She said this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,390
Apparently, every time
Huntington plays Rockbridge,

1628
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,601
they try to kill a player
and his pets.

would you lay it out like that?

'Cause it is.
Why would we do that?

1645
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,176
Because we made these girls trust
us and then we humiliated them.

And I do think that it's nice
you always take notes

is trying to kill

you're a Black Republican,

you are the smartest
out of all of us, okay?

You think I don't know that?
