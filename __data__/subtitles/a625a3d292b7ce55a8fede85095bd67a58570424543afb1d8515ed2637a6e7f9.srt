1
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,570
Another glass of...

2
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:22,935
rosÃ©?

3
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,071
No.
The hour is long past.

4
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,139
Check.

5
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:34,407
Check!

6
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:03,139
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,339
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,681
Do not advance!

9
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,309
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,520
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,819
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,988
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,131
Oh, God.

14
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,455
Go.

15
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,317
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,253
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

17
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,595
<i>Leave a message.</i>

18
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:26,959
<i>Hey, Jamie.</i>

19
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,455
<i>Are you there?</i>

20
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,325
<i>Just wondering,
are you and Sukie</i>

21
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,393
- <i>going to shot night tonight?</i>
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:34,670
<i>I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.</i>

23
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,803
<i>Maybe Carla's going.</i>

24
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,299
<i>Do you know if Carla's going?</i>

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,366
Are you going?

26
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:40,940
<i>Anyway, call me if you would.</i>

27
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:42,403
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:44,141
<i>Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.</i>

29
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,111
<i>Miss you, friend. It's Marian.</i>

30
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,687
Hey. Marian.

31
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,018
Hi, Bart.

32
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,988
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,451
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:58,793
What?

35
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,729
Phish concert.

36
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,029
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,591
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:06,592
P-H.

39
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,737
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,530
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:13,236
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:15,502
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,504
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:18,780
That's fine.

45
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,716
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,751
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,687
- What expression?
- "Anyhoo."

48
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,052
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,725
What is it?

50
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,386
A word.

51
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,388
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,929
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,326
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:38,965
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,835
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,364
It's very good.

57
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,234
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:46,644
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,713
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,212
People don't usually
call them "engagements."

61
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,819
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:59,216
Yes.

63
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,921
The fact remains.

64
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,318
The engagement.

65
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,958
That's right.

66
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,607
Oh, my.

67
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,346
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,644
My God!

69
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:40,059
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

70
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,325
<i>Leave a message.</i>

71
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:44,492
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,065
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,627
<i>During sex?</i>

74
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,465
- Hi, Sukie.
<i>- Wow.</i>

75
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,041
- Who? Here?
<i>- Yes, there.</i>

76
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,813
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:00,706
- I was just masturbating.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

78
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:01,949
Me... me time.

79
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,020
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,098
No.

81
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,034
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:21,870
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,400
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,666
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,843
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,175
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,441
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,047
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,884
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,347
Why else would you be here?

91
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,953
To socialize.

92
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:40,548
Hello, girls.

93
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:45,685
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:47,687
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:49,755
Why not 2K?

96
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,759
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:59,699
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,173
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,538
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,914
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,544
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:12,119
So, first lick...

103
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,715
Here.

104
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,026
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,093
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,754
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,624
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,935
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:29,036
Ooh!
Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:31,797
Here.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,603
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:38,309
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,047
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,642
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:43,512
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,854
Here.

117
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,055
She's a free spirit.

118
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,485
I admire her.

119
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,190
Free.
Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:53,786
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,095
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:07:55,096 --> 00:08:00,232
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,763
Pull that out!

124
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:06,073
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:08,438
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,641
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,248
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:18,184
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,615
20th... soon-to-be 21st...
Century lesbian.

130
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,518
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,125
- This right here is what it gets you.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:26,962
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,293
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:29,591
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

135
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,999
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,462
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,332
What problems?

138
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,828
Internal.

139
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,401
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,106
I don't know how else to put it.

141
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:41,372
Problems with
what I feel internally.

142
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,275
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,277
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,445
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,482
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:55,287
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:58,488
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:01,227
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:03,361
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,099
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,695
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:10,302
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:12,007
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,074
Where are you going?

155
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,669
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,979
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,640
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,279
Can't she move?

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,347
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:24,349
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,878
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,123
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:31,356
There's good birding.

164
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:33,028
Birding?

165
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,755
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,361
It's very pleasant.

167
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:39,365
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,465
I've been unhappy,

169
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,698
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,139
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,933
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,638
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,475
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,510
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,348
We get our shit together, together.

176
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,119
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,649
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,024
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,026
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,687
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,029
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,031
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:10,362
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,463
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:15,169
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,534
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,537
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

188
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:23,507
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:25,344
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,115
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,546
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,053
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:32,120
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,090
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:36,916
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:39,424
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:41,987
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,494
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,166
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,399
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,764
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,766
You said she wouldn't be here.

204
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,209
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,738
That was a gift.

206
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,311
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:02,876
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:05,252
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,814
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:08,585
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,257
I never liked her.

212
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,951
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,393
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:15,889
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:19,926
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,071
It's your dildo, Susanne.

217
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:26,471
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:28,539
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,903
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,245
<i>Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

221
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:32,972
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,842
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

223
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:38,043
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

224
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,121
Right.
<i>Tallahassee.</i>

225
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,287
Sure.
<i>You got it?</i>

226
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:41,915
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,225
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

228
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,018
By tomorrow.
<i>No later.</i>

229
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,525
Uh-huh.
<i>Okay.</i>

230
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:49,627
Okay.
<i>Over and out.</i>

231
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:53,531
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,600
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:57,997
A reference?

234
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,834
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:02,034
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,739
His balls.

237
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,578
Can the reference be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

238
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:08,777
No kidding.

239
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:11,451
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

240
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,420
Tallahassee?

241
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:16,719
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

242
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,391
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

243
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,524
I think Curlie here...

244
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,263
Don't call me Curlie.

245
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,199
Isn't your name Curlie?

246
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,365
My name is Curlie.

247
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,169
We just met. It's too familiar.

248
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,237
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

249
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:30,535
No, I got good sense.

250
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:33,307
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

251
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,837
Okay. Is that a good car?

252
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,411
Not really.

253
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,040
You sell those shirts?

254
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,075
There's also a place
here in Wilmington...

255
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,044
Fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

256
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,255
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

257
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:49,114
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

258
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,324
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

259
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:51,622
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

260
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:52,788
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

261
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,053
Down and across.

262
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,560
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

263
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:57,122
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

264
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,860
Direct route, down and across.

265
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,533
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

266
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,338
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

267
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:06,703
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

268
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,211
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

269
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:10,641
The interstate is not life.

270
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,577
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

271
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:14,513
You're the one that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

272
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,877
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

273
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,879
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

274
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,353
He said it was a rush job.

275
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,486
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

276
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,850
Tomorrow can wait a day.

277
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,357
We could even go to Miami.

278
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,622
Bikinis and high heels.

279
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,362
A medical doctor?

280
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:29,957
Or a reverend?

281
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,126
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

282
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,304
No, not for medical doctors, either.

283
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:37,998
Make up your mind...
Which are you?

284
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,803
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

285
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:44,246
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

286
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,612
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

287
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,252
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

288
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:53,816
Well, we're here.

289
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,358
Okay. Who are you?

290
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,987
- The car.
- The car?

291
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,660
The Dodge Aries.

292
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,925
The Dodge Aries?

293
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,267
What are you, a mynah bird?

294
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,433
I'm Curlie.

295
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,303
I understand that.

296
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:09,965
You're not the Dodge.

297
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:14,034
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

298
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:26,046
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

299
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,587
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

300
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:31,821
And once we get to Tallahassee, it stops
being art and starts being vandalism.

301
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,021
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

302
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,660
- soap and water.
- It won't.

303
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,629
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

304
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,093
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

305
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:42,161
Marian, it's art.

306
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,503
Stop saying it's art.

307
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,164
That doesn't end all discussion.

308
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,374
We're gonna be driving through

309
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,442
some conservative towns...
The South.

310
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:50,235
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

311
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,204
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

312
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,975
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

313
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,241
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

314
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:58,683
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

315
00:14:58,684 --> 00:15:01,290
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

316
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,522
My project.

317
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:04,557
What's your project?

318
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:08,265
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

319
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,663
How long's it been?

320
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,436
Weeks?

321
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:17,637
Months?

322
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:19,903
Oh, my God, Marian.

323
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,267
Don't tell me it's been years.

324
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,203
H-How many years? Who was it?

325
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:26,547
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

326
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,141
Donna.

327
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:29,649
Yeah, Donna.

328
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,390
Oh, my God.

329
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:37,052
Oh, my God. Donna?

330
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:40,219
She work for Al Gore now?

331
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,594
Nader.

332
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:43,927
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

333
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,666
Wait a minute.

334
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,604
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

335
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,266
Yes, I did.

336
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,610
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

337
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,106
and then these broads come in

338
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:01,581
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

339
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,616
You gave them the car.

340
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,420
You don't know who they were?

341
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,114
I told you their names.

342
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,555
Their names, yes, but...

343
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,392
This place is a dump.

344
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:12,493
They drive the car
instead of you.

345
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:13,659
Is that bad?

346
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,221
Bad if they find the goods.

347
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,696
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

348
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,291
I like clutter.

349
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,633
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

350
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:21,865
Sterile doesn't work for me.

351
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,537
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

352
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:25,099
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

353
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,331
I'm a dick-yank?

354
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,739
Don't antagonize.

355
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,334
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

356
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,270
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

357
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:32,876
And you would?

358
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,241
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

359
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,112
Not per se.

360
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,586
"Per se"?!

361
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:42,050
They left a local number.

362
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,185
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

363
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,956
Someone whose balls I can break.

364
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:53,370
Now you've gone and done it.

365
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:01,333
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

366
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:06,845
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

367
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,616
Tomorrow.

368
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,522
This is great.

369
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,887
This is so slutty.
I love this.

370
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:19,593
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

371
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,496
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

372
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:22,695
The Butter Churn awaits.

373
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,092
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

374
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,061
No. No, don't even.

375
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,326
You come with me.

376
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,098
I'll show you how this is done.

377
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,042
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

378
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,649
It's a dyke bar.

379
00:17:42,553 --> 00:17:44,882
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

380
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,819
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

381
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,821
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

382
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:52,956
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

383
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,960
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

384
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,636
Hello?

385
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,840
Confidence.

386
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:11,403
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

387
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,779
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

388
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,748
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

389
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,486
Jamie, I have done this before.

390
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,081
It's just like this.

391
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,588
One message.

392
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,151
You dig the female body.

393
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,493
Your body.

394
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,529
You're like this.

395
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,323
Not like this.

396
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,391
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

397
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,458
I have done this before.

398
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,866
I am not a schoolmarm.

399
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,428
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

400
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,364
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

401
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:40,070
Three years.

402
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,907
And four months and 14 days.

403
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:47,813
<i>âª Peanut, peanut butter âª</i>

404
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,375
Okay.

405
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:50,717
<i>âª Yeah, it tasted real good,
but it stuck to my teeth... âª</i>

406
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:52,378
You feeling your body?

407
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,215
Very much so.

408
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,822
Okay.

409
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,792
Who looks good to you?

410
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,091
<i>âª Peanut, peanut butter... âª</i>

411
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,599
They all look fine.

412
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,699
Fine?

413
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,997
Like, "You'll do"?

414
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:08,867
"Please, please
come home with me, baby.

415
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:10,330
"You seem totally okay.

416
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,035
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

417
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:13,674
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

418
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,038
I said they all looked fine.

419
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,810
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

420
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:20,648
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

421
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,552
Why are you jousting with me?

422
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,949
I'm not jousting.

423
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,181
I'm asking which of these women

424
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:27,919
you want to throw up
against the wall

425
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,481
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

426
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,725
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

427
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,595
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

428
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,091
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

429
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,357
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

430
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,523
They sense it,

431
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:39,865
whether you want to fuck them

432
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,328
or you think they're just fine.

433
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,802
I have to be me.

434
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,837
It has to be done
with authenticity.

435
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,839
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

436
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,534
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

437
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,041
You don't know
what our life was like.

438
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,779
You know nothing
about its worth.

439
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,209
Then why didn't
the two of you move

440
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,211
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

441
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,377
That didn't happen.

442
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,478
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

443
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,820
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

444
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,218
No, I'm not.

445
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,154
This is not me.

446
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,286
You're right.
I can't do this.

447
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,189
No, Marian.

448
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,061
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

449
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,667
You can do this.

450
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,603
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

451
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,901
Your best self.

452
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:17,166
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

453
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,871
but this really isn't
right for me.

454
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:21,809
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

455
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,174
<i>âª Yeah, come on,
open up that jar... âª</i>

456
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:26,472
"On the town"?

457
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,375
<i>âª Put it on that cracker âª</i>

458
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:30,884
<i>- âª Peanut, peanut butter âª
- âª Tastes real fine... âª</i>

459
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:37,989
Here we go.

460
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,551
Right here. Look.

461
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,893
Hold it. Better.

462
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:43,060
Great. Turn.

463
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,932
Oh.

464
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,100
Hello.

465
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:51,608
Good evening.

466
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:55,072
I'm Amber.

467
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,877
Marian.

468
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,881
What you reading?

469
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,543
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

470
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:07,184
Wow. Thick one.

471
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,122
Hello, Marian.

472
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,729
Hello.

473
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:18,161
So, is this gonna be
a threesome?

474
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,195
No.

475
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,164
No, no.

476
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,397
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

477
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,840
Rats.

478
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:30,042
Well...

479
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,880
I'll just...

480
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,836
How was it?

481
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:03,498
Bouncy.

482
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:09,042
How's your book?

483
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,175
Good.

484
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,375
It's about two free spirits

485
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,344
who visit a repressed family
in New England.

486
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:19,150
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

487
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:21,713
That is why we are going
the other way.

488
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,121
Although there was
this one chick

489
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:24,793
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

490
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,454
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

491
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,621
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

492
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:30,194
No, I'm not kidding.

493
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,097
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

494
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:33,835
in India supposedly
who can do that.

495
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,837
Black belts in cunnilingus.

496
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:38,202
They can even
cunniling themselves.

497
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,501
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

498
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,810
You got to ask the librarian.

499
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,768
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

500
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,408
Who wrote your book?

501
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:48,949
Henry James...

502
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,182
American writer.

503
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,349
Famous family. His brother, too.

504
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,417
Rick?

505
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:56,891
No, I'm kidding.

506
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,750
I know who Henry James is.

507
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,291
White and uptight.

508
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,591
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

509
00:24:04,592 --> 00:24:06,461
Boy, that was a great read.

510
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:09,464
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

511
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:12,269
That's a very apt simile.

512
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,942
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:17,373
Put me off the whole book thing.

514
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,606
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

515
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,674
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

516
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:24,635
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't think you should've
brought someone back to the room.

517
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:26,778
Okay.

518
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,120
I knew this was coming.

519
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:29,858
How do you think I felt?

520
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,453
You told me to have
a night on the town.

521
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:33,686
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

522
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,996
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

523
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,360
We operate on a handshake basis.

524
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,230
- What does that mean?
- "Hiya. How you doing?

525
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,594
"How much for that Cadillac car?

526
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,629
How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

527
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,235
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

528
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:45,467
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

529
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,766
- Well, then why'd you ask?
- I...

530
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,769
<i>âª You teach me âª</i>

531
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,540
I don't know. I'm...

532
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,642
<i>âª You teach me âª</i>

533
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,182
<i>âª You âª</i>

534
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,579
Sorry.

535
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,317
<i>âª Teach me âª</i>

536
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:03,926
<i>âª You teach me... âª</i>

537
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,127
No. I'm sorry.

538
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:09,293
Why are you sorry?

539
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:11,790
You're good. I'm a little...

540
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,165
No, I'm a big baby sometimes.

541
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:16,136
Uncle Gino's!

542
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:19,876
You are not going
to believe this.

543
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,603
See over there?

544
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,011
UNG soccer team.

545
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:25,309
Uh-huh.

546
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,443
I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

547
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,576
Uh-huh.

548
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,248
They're very committed lesbians,

549
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:31,414
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

550
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:33,053
which is practically on our way.

551
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,351
Not exactly.

552
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,056
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

553
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,420
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

554
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,488
Forget the map.
After today's game,

555
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,754
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

556
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,096
And guess who's invited.

557
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,526
I'm sure you are.

558
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:45,594
Nuh-uh.

559
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,398
Us.

560
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,564
You see?

561
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:52,040
Shit happens when
you eat at Uncle Gino's.

562
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,570
Goal! Goal!

563
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,449
Hello?

564
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,319
<i>Well,
here I am, my thumb up my ass.</i>

565
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,750
- They didn't.
- <i>No.</i>

566
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:46,027
That's all right.
We've got a plan B.

567
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,325
<i>Another way to get them back?</i>

568
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:49,295
Yes, sir.

569
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:52,726
- <i>I'm not gonna wait forever.</i>
- Yes, sir.

570
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,002
I understand that, sir.

571
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,300
<i>You do understand?</i>

572
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,401
- You got my word on it.
- <i>Your word.</i>

573
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:00,240
Let me just...

574
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:03,441
No-show.

575
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:09,578
<i>âª And I think
I'm gonna miss you âª</i>

576
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:15,023
<i>âª For a long, long time âª</i>

577
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:17,025

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,429

580
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,929
<i>âª And I think

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,074
<i>âª For a long âª</i>

582
00:27:33,075 --> 00:27:37,343
<i>âª Long time. âª</i>

583
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:57,066
Rotate right.

584
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:07,207
<i>âª I feel so bad âª</i>

585
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:10,672
<i>âª I've got a worried mind âª</i>

586
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:13,411
<i>âª I'm so lonesome
all the time... âª</i>

587
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:14,841
Um...

588
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,150
Ca-Can we, um...

589
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:17,712
See, actually,
we're just friends.

590
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:23,488
<i>âª Baby behind on Blue Bayou âª</i>

591
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:30,693
<i>âª Saving nickels, saving dimes âª</i>

592
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:32,958
Come on, Marian.

593
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,531
<i>âª Working till
the sun don't shine âª</i>

594
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,567
It's no big deal.

00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:40,504
<i>âª Looking forward

596

00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:48,072
<i>âª I'm going back someday âª</i>

00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:50,151
<i>âª Come what may âª</i>

599
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:53,650
<i>âª To Blue Bayou âª</i>

600
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,719
<i>âª Where the folks are fun âª</i>

601
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,359
<i>âª And the world is mine âª</i>

602
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,232
<i>âª On Blue Bayou... âª</i>

603
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,998
- Susanne Shinkleman?
- Susanne Shinkleman.

604
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:14,670
Who the fuck are you?

605
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,870
Since when do women
curse like that?

606
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:20,313
You know Jamie Dobbs?

607
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,876
- Do you know Jamie Dobbs?
- You guttersnipe.

608
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,681
Should've known
it was about that cunt!

609
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,289
And Marian Pallavi?

610
00:29:30,117 --> 00:29:31,555
You-you shouldn't do that.

611
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:33,491
He can't fight back.
He can't hit a girl.

612
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,086
He's old-school.

613
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,627
We just want to locate
your friends.

614
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:39,992
They inadvertently took
something that belongs to us.

615
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:42,093
- We don't want to hurt them.
- They're not my friends.

616
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,567
Hurt 'em as much as you want.

617
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,272
Okay.

618
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:47,671
It would be helpful
if you had a picture.

619
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,543
Picture? Yeah.

620
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,155
Got a picture of one of 'em.

621
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,857
If you find 'em, give it to her.

622
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,398
Okay.

623
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:13,763
Will do.

624
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:16,831
<i>âª Where those fishing boats âª</i>

625
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,405
<i>âª With their sails afloat âª</i>

626
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:24,411
<i>âª If I could only see... âª</i>

627
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:27,743
If you bring someone back,
just...

628
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,580
I'll take my book to the office.

629
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,846
<i>âª How happy I'd be... âª</i>

630
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:34,685
I still have
a couple of chapters left.

631
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,292
Marian.

632
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,120
We don't yet know exactly
where they are,

633
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:43,858
but we do know who they are.

634
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,596
We've got a picture of one of
the girls. We're all set to...

635
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,191
<i>Oh,
who gives a shit who they are?</i>

636
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,401
<i>I want the package.</i>

637
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:49,732
We will find
and deliver the package.

638
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,734
Under control.
<i>I am unhappy.</i>

639
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,802
I understand that
you are unhappy, sir.

640
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:55,199
<i>Damn right I am.</i>

641
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,135
I've got my two best men
on the...

642
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:05,484
All right.

643
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:07,585
Get some coffee.

644
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:10,358
You two are gonna be
driving all night.

645
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,608
Where you headed, miss?

646
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:04,544
Home.

647
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,644
And where's that?

648
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,514
Some motel. I don't know.

649
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,450
You don't know?

650
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,419
I can't remember the name.

651
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,421
A motel on the highway.

652
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:15,983
And where you coming from?

653
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,248
A house.

654
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,854
Whose house?

655
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:20,053
I don't know.

656
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,726
It was a slumber party.

657
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:25,664
Little old for slumber parties,
aren't you, miss?

658
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:29,338
Look, mister...

659
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,952
You know what?

660
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm gonna drop you off at home.

661
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:56,287
Aw.

662
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,948
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

663
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:03,375
Hey, handsome.

664
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:05,476
Want to get plastered?

665
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:10,855
I'll drive when it's my turn.

666
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,857
At the end of three hours.

667
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:14,958
I have no sympathy for you,
my friend.

668
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,125
You could've just asked her,
and you'd be fine right now.

669
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:19,699
I just asked. She answered.

670
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,261
But you cannot relate
to the public,

671
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,571
which, in a service profession,
is a big fucking handicap.

672
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:24,935
And that sound

673
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:26,574
is beginning to get irritating.

674
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,070
Well, your lectures
are getting irritating.

675
00:36:28,071 --> 00:36:30,578
I don't lecture, my friend.
That's my point.

676
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,712
I take people in. I react.

677
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:34,879
I read people
to get what I want.

678
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,947
You, though,
you think life is this

679
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:39,114
orderly series of people
to beat the shit out of.

680
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,347
Well, real life
is not like that.

681
00:36:41,348 --> 00:36:43,756
You only see it that way
because you're not nourished

682
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:46,924
by human contact, the human
give-and-take, so forth.

683
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,926
Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

684
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:50,356
That's what you're
comfortable with.

685
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:51,863
- Yeah, yeah.
- Caveman shit.

686
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,227
You don't engage
the whole person.

687
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,361
Well, you did a great job
helping me engage

688
00:36:55,362 --> 00:36:58,562
that very agile harpy.

689
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,102
Didn't have to.

690
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:02,203
No need whatsoever
for the physical approach,

691
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,502
which you couldn't see
because you don't savor

692
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:06,009
the stuff of life.

693
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,714
I'm not a sissy boy,
if that's what you mean.

694
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:09,948
Kiss my ass. I...

695
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:13,720
- Hello?
<i>- Okay, we're on track.</i>

696
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:15,722
<i>Marian Pallavi was picked up
for vagrancy</i>

697
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:18,087
<i>last night in Marietta, Georgi.</i>

698
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:20,222
<i>- Just north of Atlanta.</i>
- On it.

699
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,862
Georgia.

700
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,041
Thank you.

701
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,109
For what?

702
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:41,946
Just picking me up.

703
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,783
Am I not gonna pick you up?

704
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:45,609
Hard not to.

705
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,919
"Ma'am, your friend here is in the
hoosegow. Care to come get her?"

706
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,723
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

707
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:51,615
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

708
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,826
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

709
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:56,962
And so I say thank you.

710
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,969
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

711
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,565
and I've been careful
not to ask,

712
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:10,040
but damn, Marian,

713
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:13,571
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

714
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:15,573
I think it was jail, not prison.

715
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:17,113
Oh. I'm sorry.

716
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:19,511
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

717
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:21,315
It wasn't hell-raising.

718
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:23,086
Sorry to disappoint.

719
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,957
A policeman didn't like my tone.

720
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,256
Oh.

721
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,929
You copped some attitude.

722
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,195
I don't have attitude.

723
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,802
Marian, if I may,

724
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:38,068
there are certain things in life

725
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:40,873
which you got to sense
and understand

726
00:38:40,874 --> 00:38:43,007
in order to live life,

727
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:46,043
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

728
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:48,375
well, all these
funny little creatures

729
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:50,850
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

730
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,413
we call 'em human beings.

731
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:55,217
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

732
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,758
And your whole social situation,

733
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,221
you got to understand
what that is.

734
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:00,124
Uh-huh.

735
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,553
You know what that means?

736
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:02,895
"Social situation"?

737
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:04,798
I know what
"social situation" means.

738
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:05,997
Okay, good.

739
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:07,966
So, the whole thing
with a cop is...

740
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,232
And you should remember this
for future reference...

741
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:13,697
When you're in
a social situation with a cop,

742
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:15,600
there ain't no social situation.

743
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:18,537
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

744
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:20,605
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

745
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:22,673
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

746
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:24,180
for two years now, and...

747
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:25,885
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

748
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:28,283
Thank you. I understand.

749
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,450
But if authority
is being abused,

750
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,058
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

751
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,094
Florida.

752
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,066
Lesbian...

753
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:46,873
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

754
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,390
You okay?

755
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:11,327
Spare tire.

756
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:27,347
What?

757
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:32,117
Something burning?

758
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:50,168
Jamie, it's cold.

759
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,974
Don't touch it.

760
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,273
I saw this movie once where

761
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,880
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

762
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:01,376
and they opened the box,

763
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:05,183
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

764
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:22,331
Head!

765
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,606
No, I'm kidding.

766
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:36,378
It was a minor traffic accident.

767
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:37,841
Fast stop.

768
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:41,119
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

769
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,286
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

770
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:47,026
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

771
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:50,293
That's right.

772
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:53,164
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

773
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:56,002
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

774
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:57,828
Just drove off
with something we need.

775
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:59,434
Didn't even know they had it.

776
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:02,240
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

777
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:05,638
Just making out.

778
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,541
Oh, yeah?

779
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:09,048
With who?

780
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,382
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

781
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:17,453
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

782
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:20,323
sample case back.

783
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,128
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

784
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:24,723
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

785
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:27,363
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

786
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:29,630
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

787
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:35,833
No, no.

788
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,175
We should just call the cops.

789
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:38,572
We will, Jamie.

790
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:41,806
First, we should see
what's in here.

791
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:43,346
Why? I don't want to look.

792
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:45,381
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

793
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:47,812
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

794
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:49,385
This might tell us who they are,

795
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:51,354
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

796
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:53,719
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

797
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,523
Protect us?

798
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:57,855
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

799
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:59,330
What do we lose by looking?

800
00:43:00,729 --> 00:43:02,234
Look.

801
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:05,369
I just want to know
what's going on.

802
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:08,372
This might tell us.

803
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,473
I bet it's locked.

804
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:37,202
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

805
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:38,566
That was awful.

806
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,535
You just said
not to call the cops.

807
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,141
In ignorance.

808
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:43,538
No, what you said was true.

809
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:45,309
The cops could think
you're involved.

810
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,871
You just spent
the night in jail.

811
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:48,312
For vagrancy.

812
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:50,710
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

813
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,052
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

814
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:53,284
Here's what we do.

815
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:55,286
First, we get to Tallahassee.

816
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,717
Bye!

817
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:01,226
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

818
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:02,755
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

819
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,526
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

820
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:06,429
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

821
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,694
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

822
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,201
the address
where they're headed?

823
00:44:09,202 --> 00:44:11,434
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

824
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:13,337
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

825
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:15,372
Bye!

826
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:21,180
Welcome to El Conquistador.

827
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,743
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

828
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,185
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

829
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:28,748
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

830
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,156
You take the Rainbow Card?

831
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:31,718
Uh, I'm sure we do.

832
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,786
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

833
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:35,656
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

834
00:44:35,657 --> 00:44:37,757
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

835
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,297
You do that, right?

836
00:44:39,298 --> 00:44:40,529
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

837
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,069
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

838
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,664
for sensitive materials?

839
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,105
We do have in-room safes

840
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:47,140
for any valuables
that you may have.

841
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,900
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

842
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,704
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

843
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,607
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

844
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:53,674
Do you have ice?

845
00:45:02,915 --> 00:45:04,620
This is it?

846
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:07,557
They said Farm Road 80.

847
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:10,097
What's the matter?

848
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,264
Afraid of the stuff of life?

849
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:37,388
Is this, um... Slappy's?

850
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:39,325
That's right.

851
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:46,056
Have you seen two, um,
nonlocal women come in here?

852
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:47,498
That's one of them.

853
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:50,731
I was sittin' here listening

854
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:52,436
to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

855
00:45:52,437 --> 00:45:55,703
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

856
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:58,806
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

857
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:03,909
Now, that's true.

858
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,813
Love will bite your ass.

859
00:46:16,562 --> 00:46:18,429
Oh, I can send Sukie.

860
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,464
But why would these people
just be waiting there

861
00:46:20,465 --> 00:46:21,927
in the drive-away office?

862
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:23,203
Well, clearly, this was not

863
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:24,831
your garden-variety
decapitation.

864
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:26,338
This was some kind of a...

865
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,274
Well, I don't know what it was,

866
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:30,936
but they know
we have their stuff.

867
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:32,179
Yeah?

868
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,874
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

869
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,547
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

870
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,450
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

871
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:41,618
But why would we get
in touch with them?

872
00:46:42,522 --> 00:46:44,521
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

873
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:47,117
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

874
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:48,525
Jamie.

875
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:50,230
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

876
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:52,232
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

877
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:53,629
She hates you.

878
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,698
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

879
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:58,866
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

880
00:46:59,803 --> 00:47:02,242
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

881
00:47:02,243 --> 00:47:04,673
Attorney?
Are you a college boy?

882
00:47:04,674 --> 00:47:07,841
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

883
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,173
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

884
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:11,878
I'm running booking, jackass.

885
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:14,012
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

886
00:47:14,013 --> 00:47:15,618
and kick your number-running ass

887
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:17,620
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

888
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:20,458
Who's running booking?

889
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:22,229
- You are.
- Who is?

890
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,363
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

891
00:47:24,364 --> 00:47:26,024
- Shink!
- Yeah.

892
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:27,400
Telephone.

893
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:30,127
Sergeant Shinkleman.

894
00:47:30,128 --> 00:47:32,096
Hey. It's me.

895
00:47:32,097 --> 00:47:33,801
<i>Oh, what a lovely surprise.</i>

896
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:36,133
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

897
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:38,608
Did the two creeps find you?
<i>What?</i>

898
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,577
The two weirdos looking for you.

899
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:41,843
I tried to be helpful.

900
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:44,746
Uh, but who were they?
<i>How should I know?</i>

901
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:46,649
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

902
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,519
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

903
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,325
<i>- George and Lennie.</i>
- George and Lennie?

904
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,185
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

905
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:56,857
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

906
00:47:56,858 --> 00:47:58,727
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

907
00:47:58,728 --> 00:48:01,026
"Break a big murder case"?

908
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:03,831
<i>Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.</i>

909
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:05,866
Curlie's Drive-Away?
<i>Yeah.</i>

910
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:08,638
<i>And you ask Curlie about...</i>

911
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,004
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

912
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,105
Ask him about the what
in the attachÃ© case?

913
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:16,481
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

914
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,043
Jamie, that is about

915
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:20,749
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

916
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,751
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

917
00:48:22,752 --> 00:48:24,324
I guarantee you someone's there.

918
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:26,920
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

919
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:29,362
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

920
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:31,188
I'll take Alice.

921
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:32,794
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

922
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:35,027
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

923
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:37,800
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

924
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,901
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

925
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:42,936
Wetumpka, Alabama.

926
00:48:42,937 --> 00:48:44,575
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

927
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:45,840
They hadn't been there,

928
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:49,272
but a very personable
music lover

929
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:50,944
told us of another juke joint

930
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:52,847
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

931
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:54,046
Stop!

932
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,818
Called Ike's.

933
00:48:56,689 --> 00:48:58,688
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

934
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,426
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

935
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:02,593
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

936
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:04,463
I think the soccer team
was just confused

937
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:06,465
about which joint
these girls were going to,

938
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:08,027
so we're gonna drive...

939
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,733
Stop saying words.

940
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,406
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

941
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:14,968
They arrived in Tallahassee

942
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:18,511
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

943
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:20,710
Tallahassee.

944
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,349
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

945
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,450
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

946
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:25,946
Not a juke joint.

947
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:27,585
You should arrive
by early morning.

948
00:49:27,586 --> 00:49:28,718
I'll meet you there.

949
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:30,984
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

950
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:32,953
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

951
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:34,889
We have not slept
since the night before last,

952
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,990
and we...

953
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:38,597
Hello?

954
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:42,029
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

955
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:44,503
Certainly.

956
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:46,439
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

957
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,869
or right here at the hotel,

958
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,410
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

959
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:52,038
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

960
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:55,075
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

961
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,516
Maybe we should stay here.

962
00:49:57,517 --> 00:49:59,046
Replenish the ice.

963
00:50:03,556 --> 00:50:05,656
This is great, but how...

964
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:08,055
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

965
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:11,728
Rainbow.

966
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:12,861
Yes.

967
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:15,325
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

968
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,063
Like, a really, really good one?

969
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:18,131
Of course.

970
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,167
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

971
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:23,774
Theoretically.

972
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:33,454
So...

973
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:38,492
I've been thinking
about it, and...

974
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:43,353
finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

975
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:47,061
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

976
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:49,964
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

977
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:52,967
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

978
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:54,903
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

979
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:57,742
but I usually have stuff to do.

980
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:00,546
Perrier-JouÃ«t Belle Epoque '95.

981
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:03,077
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

982
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:07,619
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

983
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,621
Something I decided

984
00:51:09,622 --> 00:51:11,117
last night
while I was lying in bed

985
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:14,120
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

986
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:18,388
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

987
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,862
Especially since, with you,

988
00:51:19,863 --> 00:51:21,897
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

989
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:22,966
Am I right?

990
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:26,474
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

991
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,542
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

992
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:31,071
Yes, please.

993
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:33,271
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

994
00:51:33,272 --> 00:51:34,877
I mean, we're good friends,

995
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,879
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

996
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,309
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

997
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:41,917
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

998
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:44,887
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

999
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:47,087
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1000
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,056
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1001
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:51,663
She was always saying
that this or that

1002
00:51:51,664 --> 00:51:53,533
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1003
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:55,800
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1004
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,736
the sex was great.

1005
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:00,607
Ladies, have we decided?

1006
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:05,007
Don't rush us, buddy.

1007
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:09,043
First, we'll dance.

1008
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:23,861
Maybe I do overthink things.

1009
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:26,864
Yeah.

1010
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:30,868
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1011
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:38,072
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1012
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:39,403
Ah, you know Debbie.

1013
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:42,472
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1014
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:44,045
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1015
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:47,213
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1016
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:48,984
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1017
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:51,415
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

1018
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,655
One accomplishment.

1019
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:47,899
Huh? Name me one.

1020
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,363
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1021
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:52,300
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1022
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,105
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1023
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,843
on a creaky porch swing

1024
00:55:57,844 --> 00:55:59,570
on a warm summer evening...
Crickets, so forth?

1025
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,881
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1026
00:56:02,882 --> 00:56:04,751
trousers around your ankles,

1027
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:07,149
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1028
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,888
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1029
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:11,923
Yes, people might stroll by

1030
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:13,452
and see you
looking foolish up there

1031
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,893
slapping ham on the veranda,

1032
00:56:14,894 --> 00:56:17,929
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1033
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,459
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1034
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,099
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1035
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,135
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1036
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,499
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1037
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,842
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1038
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:31,778
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1039
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,472
that I've been carrying
on my back

1040
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,750
all the way from Philadelphia!

1041
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:55,495
Help.

1042
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,011
"Big case."

1043
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:08,409
That woman.

1044
00:57:11,986 --> 00:57:14,711
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1045
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,503
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1046
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:39,176
Yes, sir.

1047
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:03,094
Honey, we eating soon?

1048
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:04,932
Okay.

1049
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:09,167
Oh. All right.

1050
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:42,727
Jamie?

1051
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:47,700
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1052
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:51,946
Jamie, no!

1053
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:01,680
Jamie, why?

1054
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,325
Oh, my God.

1055
01:00:09,326 --> 01:00:10,657
Marian.

1056
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,560
Sir?

1057
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:15,167
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1058
01:00:16,236 --> 01:00:18,169
Tallahassee, sir.

1059
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,930
Where to, exactly?

1060
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,142
Yes, um...

1061
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:25,077
The track.

1062
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:27,145
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1063
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:28,938
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1064
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:30,412
Oh, come on now.

1065
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:33,250
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1066
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:35,186
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1067
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:37,486
No. I like this one.

1068
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:41,061
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1069
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,886
Last night was beautiful,

1070
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:44,558
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1071
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,164
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1072
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:47,990
Okay!
All right!

1073
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,399
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1074
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,335
We're here for two things.

1075
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,470
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1076
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:57,175
Screw you!

1077
01:00:57,176 --> 01:00:59,001
We're here for two items.

1078
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,409
Whoa. She's naked.

1079
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,807
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1080
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:04,182
We're here for two items.

1081
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:06,316
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1082
01:01:06,317 --> 01:01:08,417
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1083
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,221
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1084
01:01:10,222 --> 01:01:12,289
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1085
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,324
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1086
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:16,953
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1087
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:19,197
Let's get this show on the road.

1088
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:23,135
Yeah, baby.

1089
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:30,374
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1090
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:34,180
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1091
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,677
Whoa.

1092
01:01:37,678 --> 01:01:40,086
This is so groovy.

1093
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:43,089
Now I can love you forever.

1094
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,717
Whoa.

1095
01:01:44,718 --> 01:01:46,126
And ever

1096
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:50,690
and ever and ever

1097
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:55,827
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1098
01:01:55,828 --> 01:02:00,304
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1099
01:02:00,305 --> 01:02:04,407
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1100
01:02:04,408 --> 01:02:09,038
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1101
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,350
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1102
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:17,079
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1103
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,753
Never to wilt...

1104
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,297
Took 'em straight here.

1105
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:27,463
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1106
01:02:27,464 --> 01:02:29,466
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1107
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:34,767
This is all they had?

1108
01:02:34,768 --> 01:02:36,506
What's all they had?

1109
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:42,181
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1110
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:44,216
What are you talking about?

1111
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:46,449
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1112
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,946
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1113
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:50,618
Come on, girls.

1114
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:52,324
Where's the last phallus?

1115
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,824
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1116
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,792
I-I...

1117
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:01,431
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1118
01:03:01,432 --> 01:03:03,334
What have you done, jerk-off?

1119
01:03:03,335 --> 01:03:05,204
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1120
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:06,667
They gave you the combination,

1121
01:03:06,668 --> 01:03:08,669
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1122
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:10,374
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1123
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,179
past the first number.

1124
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:28,558
The senator is a good man.

1125
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:32,330
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1126
01:03:32,331 --> 01:03:33,694
Many of us did.

1127
01:03:33,695 --> 01:03:36,202
It was a different time.

1128
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:39,271
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1129
01:03:39,272 --> 01:03:41,802
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1130
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:49,248
Housekeeping.

1131
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:55,519
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1132
01:03:57,215 --> 01:03:58,555
thing.

1133
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:03,856
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1134
01:04:06,466 --> 01:04:08,993
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1135
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:12,238
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1136
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:14,868
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1137
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:18,167
He was just a kid.

1138
01:04:21,479 --> 01:04:25,482
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1139
01:04:25,483 --> 01:04:27,616
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1140
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:30,520
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1141
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:33,920
You saw him, sort of.

1142
01:04:48,836 --> 01:04:52,135
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1143
01:04:52,136 --> 01:04:54,775
Think of it: eBay,

1144
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:59,076
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1145
01:04:59,077 --> 01:05:01,551
Comments, reviews.

1146
01:05:01,552 --> 01:05:03,949
Think of what
it would do to him.

1147
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:08,328
His children, his family,
his career.

1148
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:14,531
We're not unreasonable.

1149
01:05:14,532 --> 01:05:16,303
We'll gladly pay for it.

1150
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:18,260
We just...

1151
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:20,229
Will you please shut up!

1152
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,439
That wasn't my idea!

1153
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,067
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1154
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:24,134
I was experimenting.

1155
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:25,410
But you liked it.

1156
01:05:25,411 --> 01:05:26,708
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1157
01:05:26,709 --> 01:05:28,446
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1158
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:29,876
Drunk on cock.

1159
01:05:29,877 --> 01:05:31,680
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1160
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:33,352
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1161
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:35,244
- To understand life.
- No!

1162
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,851
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1163
01:05:40,426 --> 01:05:43,362
God, man, what are you doing?!

1164
01:06:16,827 --> 01:06:17,859
Mommy.

1165
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,519
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1166
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,015
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1167
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:44,280
Then we switch hotels.

1168
01:06:44,281 --> 01:06:46,392
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1169
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:47,822
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1170
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:50,220
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1171
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:52,465
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1172
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:01,803
Next customer, please.

1173
01:07:01,804 --> 01:07:04,608
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1174
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,335
Don't ask me why.

1175
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:10,911
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1176
01:07:10,912 --> 01:07:12,748
I need to speak to the senator.

1177
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:16,279
<i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1178
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,689
Someone who has his...

1179
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:22,396
personal effects.

1180
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,824
<i>Who is this?</i>

1181
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:57,155
Senator?

1182
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,630
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1183
01:07:59,631 --> 01:08:02,501
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1184
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:06,098
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1185
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:07,737
Everybody's things.

1186
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:10,509
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1187
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,511
If you're not alone,

1188
01:08:12,512 --> 01:08:14,546
believe me, I'll know it.

1189
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,788
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1190
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:27,383
made a phone call
from here last night.

1191
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:28,660
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1192
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,157
Well, this is for her.

1193
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,598
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1194
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:34,863
You've missed them.

1195
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:37,603
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1196
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:59,185
Done.

1197
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:02,220
With what?

1198
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,564
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1199
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,928
Want to join me?

1200
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,927
Jamie.

1201
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:41,666
I want...

1202
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,261
Uh-huh?

1203
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,330
I... I-I want...

1204
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:48,839
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1205
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:53,436
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

1206
01:11:14,828 --> 01:11:16,091
Who are you?

1207
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:19,192
Democrats.

1208
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:20,765
Mind if we sit down?

1209
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:30,676
Are they all there?

1210
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:36,012
Count 'em.

1211
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:54,030
We didn't deserve this...

1212
01:11:55,429 --> 01:11:57,132
this commodification.

1213
01:11:59,103 --> 01:12:01,300
These are all good people.

1214
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:04,073
Important people, too,
some of them.

1215
01:12:05,175 --> 01:12:08,913
There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.

1216
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:12,983
The owner of
a large-market football team.

1217
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,184
A Supreme Court justice.

1218
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:23,762
You little people
titillate yourselves

1219
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:26,292
with something
that was never meant for you,

1220
01:12:26,293 --> 01:12:30,560
trafficking in
other people's attainments.

1221
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:32,133
Senator, save the sanctimony.

1222
01:12:32,134 --> 01:12:35,137
And hand over
the million smackers.

1223
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,306
I used to believe in
the unfettered free market.

1224
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,413
I don't know.

1225
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:53,990
Whose head, Senator?

1226
01:12:53,991 --> 01:12:58,292
Don't get lofty with me, women.

1227
01:13:01,759 --> 01:13:03,363
Did we do the wrong thing?

1228
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,498
What if he's the next president?

1229
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:09,269
You girls are cute.

1230
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:12,437
My friends and me are having
a little basement party later.

1231
01:13:12,438 --> 01:13:13,879
You want to join?

1232
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:23,790
Not tonight.

1233
01:13:27,554 --> 01:13:29,355
Sukie?

1234
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:30,488
There you are.

1235
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,523
So what was that
crackhead phone call about?

1236
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,525
Wha-What do you mean?
How'd you know I'd be here?

1237
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:36,868
How many dyke bars are there
in Tallahassee?

1238
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:39,134
What, are you an executive now?

1239
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:40,905
Did they, uh, make you
the president

1240
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:42,501
of Little Miss Liar Pants, Inc.?

1241
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:45,569
Oh, this? No, I just, uh...

1242
01:13:57,584 --> 01:13:59,220
'Cause we thought
they didn't know where we were,

1243
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:00,925
but somehow they did,
and this morning,

1244
01:14:00,926 --> 01:14:02,553
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1245
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:04,357
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1246
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:06,227
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1247
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:08,031
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1248
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:11,266
Well, you've had a full day.

1249
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:16,436
She's yours now.

1250
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:20,475
Hang on. This doesn't look good.

1251
01:14:37,624 --> 01:14:39,261
Motherfucker.

1252
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,941
What's she chasing?

1253
01:14:49,942 --> 01:14:51,372
Yeah.

1254
01:14:52,111 --> 01:14:53,439
We forgot to tell you about

1255
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,672
the suave guy's head
in the hatbox.

1256
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:05,990
Boy, I think
I could win against him.

1257
01:15:05,991 --> 01:15:07,992
And now we get to just
keep on going.

1258
01:15:07,993 --> 01:15:10,423
Who's gonna complain
if we keep the car?

1259
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,722
Things could not have
worked out better.

1260
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:14,967
Well, I guess.

1261
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:17,364
What's wrong?

1262
01:15:17,365 --> 01:15:21,434
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1263
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,799
but I have to admit,

1264
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,669
I'll miss his...

1265
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,078
No worries, girl.

1266
01:15:27,839 --> 01:15:29,574
I made a cast.

1267
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:31,214
And two copies.

1268
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,447
Great.

1269
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,020
But why two?

1270
01:15:36,021 --> 01:15:37,615
For each other.

1271
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,782
Ladies, your visitor is here.

1272
01:15:39,783 --> 01:15:41,817
Can we get our car?

1273
01:15:41,818 --> 01:15:45,294
You know, hers and hers.

1274
01:15:49,069 --> 01:15:50,299
Aunt Ellis.

1275
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:53,103
Oh, hello, darling.

1276
01:15:53,104 --> 01:15:54,698
- She's your aunt?
- Uh-huh.

1277
01:15:54,699 --> 01:15:56,106
Uncle John met her in church.

1278
01:15:56,107 --> 01:15:57,899
Watch what you say.
She's very religious.

1279
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,144
So good to see you.

1280
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:02,343
This is my friend Jamie.

1281
01:16:02,344 --> 01:16:03,949
Oh, how are you, young lady?

1282
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,445
This your first time
in Tallahassee?

1283
01:16:05,446 --> 01:16:08,217
Yes, ma'am,
and what a beautiful city.

1284
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:11,022
- Not like Miami.
- Oh, no, no.

1285
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:13,255
Not like Miami.

1286
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:15,224
You able to stay with us long?

1287
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:16,687
No, unfortunately...

1288
01:16:16,688 --> 01:16:18,392
Right after birding,
we're off to Massachusetts.

1289
01:16:18,393 --> 01:16:20,460
- We just decided last night.
- Jamie.

1290
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:22,264
Well, what do they have
in Massachusetts

1291
01:16:22,265 --> 01:16:24,860
that we don't have right here
in North Florida?

1292
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:26,973
Women can get married there.

1293
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:32,539
To each other?

1294
01:16:35,016 --> 01:16:36,345
Hmm.

1295
01:16:37,348 --> 01:16:40,117
Well, that's an innovation.

1296
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:56,629
Ladies!
