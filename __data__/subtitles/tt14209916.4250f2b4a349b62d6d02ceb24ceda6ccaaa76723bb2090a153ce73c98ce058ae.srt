00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you say it's all over</font>

2
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for you and me, girl</font>

3
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's a time for love</font>

4
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a time for
letting it be, baby</font>

5
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:56,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you're playing
a game called...</font>

6
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

7
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Making believe that
you just don't feel the same</font>

8
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

9
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jane</font>

10
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

11
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, mmm.</font>

12
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

13
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, Jane,
you're playing a game</font>

14
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">called hide-and-go-seek</font>

15
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoo!</font>

16
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mwah.</font>

17
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jane, you're playing for fun...</font>

18
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

19
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
the first thing I thought</font>

20
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I saw you?</font>

21
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."</font>

22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it's a her?</font>

23
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you call her?</font>

24
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ragni, maybe.</font>

25
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry?</font>

26
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ragni</font>

27
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, let me think about
that for a second.</font>

28
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ragni you hate it.</font>

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, boy's name? Texas.</font>

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You kidding me?</font>

31
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas is, like, a state,
you know? I know.</font>

32
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's about
3 or 4 hours</font>

33
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till we reach the peak.</font>

34
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, great.</font>

35
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?</font>

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.</font>

37
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course. It's about the band.</font>

38
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,</font>

39
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.</font>

40
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's just that
I don't want</font>

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to use your brother's band.</font>

42
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not? Honey...</font>

43
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's super, super good.</font>

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He works super hard. Yeah.</font>

45
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.</font>

46
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know this.</font>

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.</font>

48
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.</font>

49
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His singing is like shit.</font>

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...</font>

51
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olaf!</font>

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, god.</font>

53
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for me.</font>

54
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you so sensitive?</font>

55
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you I could get us here.</font>

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

57
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. I love you.</font>

58
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsa.</font>

59
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Look.
What is it? Hmm? Hmm?</font>

60
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

61
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.</font>

62
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.</font>

63
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.</font>

64
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have such good luck
in nature.</font>

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you see?</font>

66
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's demented or something.</font>

67
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

68
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. Yeah.</font>

69
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Demented?</font>

70
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I-I think we should leave it.</font>

71
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.</font>

72
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comeon_ Ah!</font>

73
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.</font>

74
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.</font>

75
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not afraid, Elsa.</font>

76
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.</font>

77
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

78
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't panic.</font>

79
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do?</font>

80
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If it's black, fight back.</font>

81
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If it's brown, lay down."</font>

82
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But is it black
or is it brown?</font>

83
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it looks brown to me.</font>

84
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in Appalachia.
It's black.</font>

85
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to fight it.
How do you know?</font>

86
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not a bear expert.</font>

87
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you do, don't...</font>

88
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run! Where are we going?
Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.</font>

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
Uphill. Uphill.</font>

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run! Where do we go?</font>

91
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, Elsa! Run! Where do we go?</font>

92
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god. Oh, my god!</font>

93
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's coming! Come on!</font>

95
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! It's following...</font>

96
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olaf! No!</font>

97
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God!</font>

98
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please help!</font>

99
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Olaf!</font>

100
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is drugs.</font>

101
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your brain on drugs.</font>

102
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.</font>

103
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thrill can kill.</font>

104
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...</font>

105
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And pulling the trigger.</font>

106
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky</font>

107
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.</font>

108
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found</font>

109
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the body of a man
who fell to his death</font>

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when his parachute
failed to open.</font>

111
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found</font>

112
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers</font>

113
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.</font>

114
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,</font>

115
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.</font>

116
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine</font>

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wrapped in
football-size packages</font>

118
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.</font>

119
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.</font>

120
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?</font>

121
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

122
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the ID.</font>

123
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who that is.</font>

124
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Full name,
Andrew C. Thornton II.</font>

125
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man was out of his mind.</font>

126
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the "C" stand for? Hmm?</font>

127
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.</font>

128
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thornton was one of
Syd white's guys out of Missouri.</font>

129
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.</font>

130
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Part of
the bluegrass conspiracy.</font>

131
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's more of this
out there.</font>

132
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They dumped it somewhere.</font>

133
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Reba,
you have a dog, right?</font>

134
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had.</font>

135
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Border Collie. Barry.</font>

136
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for your loss.</font>

137
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Border Collie, huh?</font>

138
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a cool dog.</font>

139
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he play fetch and stuff?</font>

140
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He loved fetch.</font>

141
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

142
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. I just...</font>

143
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just awesome.</font>

144
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, Gabe.</font>

145
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Daveed.</font>

146
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, mind if I order first?</font>

147
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This won't take long.</font>

148
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, I just bought these.</font>

149
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?</font>

150
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear about Thornton?</font>

151
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a tough way to go.</font>

152
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He only had 30 kilos on him.</font>

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any idea where
we could find the rest?</font>

154
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chattahoochee.</font>

155
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Georgia?</font>

156
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an area
called blood mountain.</font>

157
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the plane's going down,</font>

158
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the pilots know
where to drop our load.</font>

159
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we just go and get it.</font>

160
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.</font>

161
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.</font>

162
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie's in mourning.</font>

163
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joanie just died.</font>

164
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he quit.</font>

165
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joanie's the reason why he quit.</font>

166
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not here anymore.</font>

167
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner he moves on,
the better.</font>

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Syd, I-I just don't...</font>

169
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop.</font>

170
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.</font>

171
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.</font>

172
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa Syd, watch.</font>

173
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's great.</font>

174
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.</font>

175
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow's lunch is in the
fridge, and the chicken's...</font>

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chicken's in the microwave.
Just hit "start."</font>

177
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought you were off tonight.</font>

178
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talked about this, remember?</font>

179
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me picking up some extra shifts?</font>

180
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you were okay with it.</font>

181
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was okay with it
until I realized</font>

182
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why you want those extra shifts.</font>

183
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you could go and do
overtime with Ray The Pediatrician.</font>

184
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.</font>

185
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville</font>

186
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this weekend
to see his band play.</font>

187
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.</font>

188
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, but it's gonna be fun.</font>

189
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.</font>

190
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Nashville.</font>

191
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a good guy, Deirdra.</font>

192
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just..</font>

193
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give him a chance.</font>

194
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't do that.</font>

195
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>

196
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what.</font>

197
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?</font>

198
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close my door.</font>

199
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough for today.</font>

200
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what?</font>

201
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Eddie.</font>

202
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They spelled
her name wrong, Daveed.</font>

203
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says "John"
Oh!</font>

204
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Says "John"</font>

205
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her name is fucking Joan.
Look, we...</font>

206
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could get it fixed.</font>

207
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.</font>

208
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got seven more days of "John."</font>

209
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Chutist has been identified</font>

210
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.</font>

211
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, is that us? Hey.</font>

212
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?</font>

213
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Says you haven't seen Gabe in weeks.</font>

214
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sad, man.</font>

215
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so fucking sad.</font>

216
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

217
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get the, uh...
The penne, please?</font>

218
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...</font>

219
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just plain.</font>

220
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd be late.</font>

221
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It finally came in.
Check it out.</font>

222
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many weeks' allowance
is that?</font>

223
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a thousand, but worth it.</font>

224
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no. Can I use the toilet?</font>

225
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom is gonna be home soon.</font>

226
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.</font>

227
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why by lunch?</font>

228
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The light, Henry.</font>

229
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I got to go pee.</font>

230
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go outside.</font>

231
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do I skip school with you?</font>

232
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're bossier than
the teachers.</font>

233
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the adoption people...</font>

234
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure who I
talked to over there,</font>

235
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">told me I was supposed
to be getting me a lab.</font>

236
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fun one, a...
A man's-best-friend type.</font>

237
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
if there was an error,</font>

238
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the one I got
is just kind of...</font>

239
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bob? ...I don't know,</font>

240
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just kind of fancy.</font>

241
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bob, captain says
it's time to go. Got it.</font>

242
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.</font>

243
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Reba.</font>

244
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got plans for tonight?</font>

245
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.</font>

246
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't...
Mind looking after Rosette?</font>

247
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. I have to go to Georgia</font>

248
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the Thornton case,</font>

249
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you said
you were good at dogs.</font>

250
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said I had a dog.</font>

251
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.</font>

252
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A trucker overheard
a couple of guys</font>

253
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talking at a bar last night.</font>

254
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you in the car.
No, no, no.</font>

255
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.</font>

256
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on. You got to
be sort of good with them.</font>

257
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only had her for a day.</font>

258
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please?</font>

259
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.</font>

260
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go.</font>

261
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be fine.</font>

262
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

263
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't believe
I left the backpack.</font>

264
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can. I know the way.</font>

265
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">School's
gonna call, you know.</font>

266
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Let 'em.</font>

267
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your mom's gonna be pissed.</font>

268
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So's your dad.</font>

269
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't care if I play hooky.</font>

270
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For a girl who likes
to be left alone,</font>

271
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you do a lot of shit
for attention.</font>

272
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.</font>

273
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to paint
the waterfall.</font>

274
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admit it.</font>

275
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want her to find out
and worry about you.</font>

276
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus fuck!</font>

277
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coral, it's Sari.</font>

278
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Dee Dee over there?</font>

279
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">School just called.</font>

280
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?</font>

281
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,</font>

282
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so can you please
just put him on?</font>

283
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.</font>

284
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is wrong with him?</font>

285
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never mind.</font>

286
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A love song of the waterfall</font>

287
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear through
virgin timbertop...</font>

288
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 cents.</font>

289
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna see
that wrapper outside</font>

290
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the ground, now, am I?
No, ma'am.</font>

291
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?</font>

292
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Empty your pockets.</font>

293
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vest pocket. Come on.</font>

294
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that perfume?</font>

295
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's none of your business.</font>

296
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it smells really nice.</font>

297
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, it's European.</font>

298
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.</font>

299
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it too much?</font>

300
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at all.</font>

301
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smells expensive.</font>

302
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it is.</font>

303
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a sucker?</font>

304
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

305
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like the green one.</font>

306
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a red one.</font>

307
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am. Uh-huh.</font>

308
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit. He's here.</font>

309
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I in the right place?</font>

310
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Right.</font>

311
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you it was big.</font>

312
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's big.</font>

313
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that smell?</font>

314
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's European.</font>

315
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone been smoking?</font>

316
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, he was.</font>

317
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you believe it? What?</font>

318
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
cigarettes kill people.</font>

319
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but... and animals.</font>

320
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.</font>

321
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself</font>

322
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.</font>

323
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get out of here.</font>

324
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out.</font>

325
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

326
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a dusty
beaver here, ranger</font>

327
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yeah, well, I'm working on that.</font>

328
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Henry!</font>

329
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!</font>

330
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

331
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?</font>

332
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marking our territory.</font>

333
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh! Don't shit out here!</font>

334
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not shitting.</font>

335
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?</font>

336
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.</font>

337
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Henry.</font>

338
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check it out.</font>

339
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's drugs, I think.</font>

340
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's drugs?</font>

341
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that guy from assembly?</font>

342
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He showed us pictures of
stuff that looked just like this.</font>

343
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.</font>

344
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is definitely cocaine.</font>

345
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Of course.</font>

346
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.</font>

347
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.</font>

348
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?</font>

349
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I do it.</font>

350
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

351
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With who?</font>

352
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With Faulk.</font>

353
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After church.</font>

354
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faulk does not
do cocaine after church.</font>

355
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you friends with Faulk?</font>

356
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He's a pervert.</font>

357
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you wouldn't know.</font>

358
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liar.</font>

359
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just mad
you're never invited.</font>

360
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care I'm not invited.</font>

361
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like you care.</font>

362
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do some, then.</font>

363
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

364
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've done it before.
You can do it again.</font>

365
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.</font>

366
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.</font>

367
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wouldn't be good.</font>

368
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

369
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knife me.</font>

370
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so how do I do it?</font>

371
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You eat it.</font>

372
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much?</font>

373
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a tablespoon's worth.</font>

374
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

375
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

376
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what the hell?</font>

377
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rookie.</font>

378
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do it, then.</font>

379
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh.</font>

380
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, shit!</font>

381
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

382
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.</font>

383
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much do you think
this stuff is worth?</font>

384
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's sell drugs together.</font>

385
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and Faulk.</font>

386
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's more.</font>

387
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something got into it.</font>

388
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A deer, maybe.</font>

389
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?</font>

390
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'd be like this.</font>

391
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it'd be, like, going
into trees like, bang!</font>

392
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
Bang!</font>

393
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.</font>

394
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?</font>

395
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.</font>

396
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My throat's really runny.</font>

397
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that.</font>

398
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it do the cocaine?</font>

399
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move a muscle.</font>

400
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to me.</font>

401
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to grab
Eddie, not run your mouth.</font>

402
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we have trouble.
You understand? Got it.</font>

403
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of it.</font>

404
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.</font>

405
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grandpa Syd!
Gabe, driving me nuts.</font>

406
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little...</font>

407
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

408
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is on the wings of love</font>

409
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the wings of love</font>

410
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only the two of us</font>

411
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">together flying high</font>

412
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:06,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">flying high
up on the wings of love...</font>

413
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joan loved this song.</font>

414
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said he sang with the soul
of a thousand-year-old man.</font>

415
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, Eddie, listen.</font>

416
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, when Joanie died,</font>

417
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I didn't, you know...</font>

418
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

419
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I could've did more.</font>

420
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

421
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should've been there.</font>

422
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't need you there.</font>

423
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.</font>

424
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's against my constitution.</font>

425
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm more than a drug dealer.</font>

426
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not. Come on, Eddie.</font>

427
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're friends, right?</font>

428
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

429
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he's happy she's dead.</font>

430
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not happy she died.</font>

431
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,</font>

432
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we can call it that.</font>

433
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes...</font>

434
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if he did it to her.
What?</font>

435
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Joanie died of cancer.</font>

436
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

437
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he gave her the cancer.</font>

438
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't give no one cancer.</font>

439
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you can. With stress.</font>

440
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop protecting him.</font>

441
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.</font>

442
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Running free, traveling</font>

443
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the wings of love</font>

444
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

445
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the wings of love,
up and above...</font>

446
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so we start...</font>

447
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you notice my nails?
Those are beautiful.</font>

448
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. We start...
Excuse me. Is the ranger in?</font>

449
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm wearing the stuff.</font>

450
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:42,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,</font>

451
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">13, come through here?
My daughter...</font>

452
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost your daughter
in the park.</font>

453
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she came here on her
own, heading to the waterfall.</font>

454
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Hikers under 16 must
be accompanied by an adult.</font>

455
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.</font>

456
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we get
a lot of runaways,</font>

457
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bad apples, youngsters
who aren't too happy</font>

458
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the way things are at home.</font>

459
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not a runaway.</font>

460
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She just came to paint the...</font>

461
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can someone just please point me</font>

462
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the direction
of blood mountain?</font>

463
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is blood mountain.</font>

464
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. I-I'm Peter. 
Oh.</font>

465
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Peter,
Wildlife Inspection Rep.</font>

466
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're about to
head up there ourselves.</font>

467
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?</font>

468
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection</font>

469
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a very important process.</font>

470
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We wouldn't want you distracted</font>

471
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by our little
damsel in distress here.</font>

472
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing can distract me</font>

473
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from making sure the
entire biological community</font>

474
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is safe for all our friends.</font>

475
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friends?</font>

476
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He means animals.
I don't like that word.</font>

477
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't like
to call them animals.</font>

478
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I won't be a burden.</font>

479
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get my hat.</font>

480
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

481
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoes okay for hiking?</font>

482
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.</font>

483
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have on boots. Yep.</font>

484
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Eddie.</font>

485
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm done playing this game.</font>

486
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You-you wanted...</font>

487
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were the one
who wanted to play this.</font>

488
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still have
three more questions.</font>

489
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen. What?</font>

490
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.</font>

491
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're not. You
just don't want to lose.</font>

492
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm-a go in here and
take a piss, all right?</font>

493
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know
rangers carried guns.</font>

494
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Park rangers are peace officers.</font>

495
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means we can shoot people.</font>

496
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forest is a dangerous place.</font>

497
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That gang of pubes
are dangerous.</font>

498
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Gang of pubes"?</font>

499
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teens. Delinquents.</font>

500
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been attacking hikers.</font>

501
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hurt anyone?</font>

502
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They cut them with a knife.</font>

503
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call themselves the doochamps.</font>

504
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your back.</font>

505
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.</font>

506
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of nowhere.</font>

507
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck is this?</font>

508
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's afraid, buds.</font>

509
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Empty your pockets.</font>

510
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

511
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Empty your pockets, please.</font>

512
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you asked so nicely.</font>

513
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think this is a joke?</font>

514
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

515
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him, buds.</font>

516
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm shaking a
fucking knife, man. Come on.</font>

517
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stab him. Come on,
man. It's a fucking knife!</font>

518
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go on!</font>

519
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

520
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.</font>

521
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, rocky. Ah! Banzai!</font>

522
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me
this fucking board!</font>

523
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going down, man!</font>

524
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Submit! Submit!</font>

525
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

526
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold this!</font>

527
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aah! Fucking skateboard!</font>

528
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my.</font>

529
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck is wrong with y'all?!</font>

530
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

531
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this road.</font>

532
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, love it up there.</font>

533
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, wait, where is it that
you wanted to go again?</font>

534
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? The falls.</font>

535
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret falls. Right,
well, we can go up this way</font>

536
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or take the loop.
I love the loop.</font>

537
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you can see the top of
the... this is a more direct...</font>

538
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. We're going this way.</font>

539
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, crap.</font>

540
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.</font>

541
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just distracting you completely.</font>

542
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can hear you.</font>

543
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.</font>

544
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's taking you so long?</font>

545
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you do?</font>

546
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please tell me
you found them like this.</font>

547
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They attacked me.</font>

548
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:21,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they dead?</font>

549
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, one might be.</font>

550
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.</font>

551
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus chr... they're kids.</font>

552
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved this fucking Jersey, man.</font>

553
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, they're fine.</font>

554
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank god.</font>

555
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No fucking way.</font>

556
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daveed?</font>

557
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

558
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

559
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up.</font>

560
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you find this?</font>

561
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

562
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is this energy
coming from, bud?</font>

563
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tried to fucking kill me.</font>

564
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a foul mouth there, bud.</font>

565
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell him that all the time.</font>

566
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did you find this?</font>

567
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up on the mountain.</font>

568
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the rest of it?</font>

569
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

570
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I just took out the
3 of you in 15 seconds.</font>

571
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think
I'll do to just you</font>

572
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're already
on the floor?</font>

573
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

574
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We stashed it under a gazebo.</font>

575
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going back for it later tonight.</font>

576
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gazebo?</font>

577
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pavilion-type structure.</font>

578
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.</font>

579
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't.</font>

580
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are my buds dead?</font>

581
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show us where. Oh, god.</font>

582
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, i-i'm
feeling kind of tired.</font>

583
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I should rest.</font>

584
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Want a dirt nap?</font>

585
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, go get the gun.</font>

586
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the glove.</font>

587
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prefer we left guns
out of this.</font>

588
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Same.</font>

589
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.</font>

590
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Eddie, please go get

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

593
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right.</font>

594
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'm coming.</font>

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax.</font>

596
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's getting real cold out.</font>

597
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,161

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up. Keep walking.</font>

600
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna be a long hike if
we can't talk to each other.</font>

601
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It better not be a long hike.</font>

602
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?</font>

603
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I don't
think he's too happy</font>

604
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.</font>

605
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it wasn't me.</font>

606
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eh, l dont blame him, though.</font>

607
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting stabbed sucks.</font>

608
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, shut the fuck up.</font>

609

614
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo...</font>

615
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.</font>

616
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was wondering
how Rosette is doing.</font>

617
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.</font>

618
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if dogs think
about that sort of thing, but, uh...</font>

619
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I...</font>

620
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks again for helping out.</font>

621
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

622
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

623
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this mess.</font>

624
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People don't have
any respect.</font>

625
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.</font>

626
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... let me pick that up.</font>

627
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Thank you, ranger.
Dee Dee!</font>

628
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is sticking.
I got some oil in the car.</font>

629
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee! Henry!</font>

630
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if that stays open,</font>

631
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">critters can get in there.
Oh, yeah, critters.</font>

632
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of critters? Huh?</font>

633
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Squirrels?
Squirrels could get in there.</font>

634
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chipmunks?
Yeah, chipmunks get in there.</font>

635
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee! Uh, skunks.</font>

636
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.</font>

637
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.
Got his own little mask on.</font>

638
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. I think they're cute.</font>

639
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, skunks.</font>

640
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Skunks. Hmm.</font>

641
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Possums. Possums.</font>

642
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely possums. Possum.</font>

643
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, possum.</font>

644
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Mckinndry!</font>

645
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry?</font>

646
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here! Hello?</font>

647
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry?</font>

648
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up here!</font>

649
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Whoa. Oh.</font>

650
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, what are you
doing up there?</font>

651
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not safe at all.
No.</font>

652
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too high.
You got to come down.</font>

653
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down here.</font>

654
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.</font>

655
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit, Henry. It's high.</font>

656
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there was a bear.</font>

657
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A really terrible bear.</font>

658
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bear? Yeah, I know.</font>

659
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was fucked! Hey!</font>

660
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's inappropriate.</font>

661
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for cussing, but it
attacked me and Dee Dee.</font>

662
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It attacked you?</font>

663
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.</font>

664
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bears are
very peaceful creatures.</font>

665
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have done
something to upset it.</font>

666
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, did you feed it?
What did you do?</font>

667
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing! Y'all need to hide!</font>

668
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!</font>

669
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to listen to me!</font>

670
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, where is Dee Dee?</font>

671
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The monster took her.</font>

672
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.</font>

673
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down here now.</font>

674
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A...</font>

675
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I...</font>

676
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee!</font>

677
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

678
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peter!</font>

679
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Peter!</font>

680
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Oh, no!</font>

681
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It let me go! He ran off!</font>

682
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, jump down. It's too high.</font>

683
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it gone?</font>

684
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you see it?</font>

685
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

686
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you shooting at me?</font>

687
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get your ass down!</font>

688
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your fault.</font>

689
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right behind you. I saw it.</font>

690
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down.</font>

691
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

692
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

693
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

694
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger! Ranger!</font>

695
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did it get you?</font>

696
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That asshole!</font>

697
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get him.</font>

698
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna get that asshole.</font>

699
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get help.</font>

700
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

701
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God almighty.</font>

702
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. What...</font>

703
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

704
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

705
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What should I do?</font>

706
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker!</font>

707
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back! Help us!</font>

708
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck!</font>

709
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something wrong with it.</font>

710
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I told you there was.</font>

711
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it acting like this?</font>

712
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you feed it cocaine?</font>

713
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. But you're safe.</font>

714
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bears can't climb trees.</font>

715
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course they can!</font>

716
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why are you up here?</font>

717
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

718
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

719
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, climb. Henry, go.</font>

720
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!</font>

721
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climb. Go, Henry!</font>

722
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, move! Go higher!</font>

723
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go up!</font>

724
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, go!</font>

725
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

726
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, Henry! No! Whoa!</font>

727
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god. Henry!</font>

728
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

729
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

730
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

731
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off of me! No, no!</font>

732
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off! Get off of me!</font>

733
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, jump! Jump down!</font>

734
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, Henry!</font>

735
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.</font>

736
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're almost there.
Come on, baby.</font>

737
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go.</font>

738
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

739
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.</font>

740
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was so messed up.</font>

741
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That little man
was an expert on bears</font>

742
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.</font>

743
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What did you say?</font>

744
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found cocaine,
Mrs. Mckinndry.</font>

745
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was cocaine in the
forest, and the bear ate it</font>

746
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee</font>

747
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now on that guy back there.</font>

748
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear him scream?</font>

749
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's so dead.</font>

750
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to not remember that.</font>

751
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it kind of seems like</font>

752
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the thing that stays
with a man forever.</font>

753
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...</font>

754
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive? Yeah.</font>

755
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It chased her that way.</font>

756
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to go. Let's go.</font>

757
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He get at you, too?</font>

758
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking beast.
Yeah, you can say that again.</font>

759
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call an ambulance.
I already did.</font>

760
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep him awake.</font>

761
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I've been trying.</font>

762
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You piles of shit!</font>

763
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the doochamps!
Hey, that's-that's not ours.</font>

764
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found it.</font>

765
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It's not ours."</font>

766
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a Park Ranger.</font>

767
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not dumb. I know.</font>

768
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They say I can't keep
my park safe,</font>

769
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.</font>

770
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd have been
at Yellowstone by now</font>

771
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it weren't for you shits!</font>

772
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buds. Huh?</font>

773
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's someone outside.</font>

774
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.</font>

775
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

776
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, uh, open it
when I'm count to 3.</font>

777
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait. But you're
gonna shoot him?</font>

778
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!</font>

779
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He took a bite out of my ass!</font>

780
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?</font>

781
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, open it when I say so.</font>

782
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

783
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a fucking bear.</font>

784
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

785
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.</font>

786
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sorry? I'm sorry.</font>

787
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd the bear go?
You killed him.</font>

788
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the bear?</font>

789
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know! Close the door!</font>

790
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the motherfucking door.
Jesus Christ.</font>

791
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liz Close the door.</font>

792
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.</font>

793
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.</font>

794
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

795
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's up there.</font>

796
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's up there.</font>

797
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it. I got it.</font>

798
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the kid
can help you.</font>

799
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm done
playing this game.</font>

800
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What game? 20 questions.</font>

801
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.</font>

802
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did he ask so far?
He just keeps guessing.</font>

803
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, "is it a spider?</font>

804
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Is it an arrow?"</font>

805
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, new?</font>

806
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.</font>

807
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody knows that.</font>

808
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, are we close
to the gazebo?</font>

809
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that one of your questions?</font>

810
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?</font>

811
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.</font>

812
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.</font>

813
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it bigger than a bread box?</font>

814
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Whoo!</font>

815
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

816
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it Abraham Lincoln?</font>

817
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.</font>

818
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Broad, then narrow it down, man.</font>

819
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have one question left.</font>

820
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee! Dee Dee!</font>

821
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure this is the way?</font>

822
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty sure.</font>

823
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee! It's okay.</font>

824
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's mama.</font>

825
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank god.</font>

826
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew! What the heck?</font>

827
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's paint. It's just red paint.</font>

828
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?</font>

829
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a nurse, Henry.</font>

830
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good point.</font>

831
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

832
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, smart girl.</font>

833
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.</font>

834
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Mckinndry, have
you ever done cocaine?</font>

835
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

836
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you ask?</font>

837
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects,</font>

838
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.</font>

839
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.</font>

840
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if they never want
to do it again?</font>

841
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, then it-it should be fine.</font>

842
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But mama bear and papa bear
would be very angry</font>

843
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because drugs,
especially cocaine,</font>

844
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are very, very bad.</font>

845
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if they would
never find out?</font>

846
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Henry.</font>

847
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We always find out.</font>

848
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee!</font>

849
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more words</font>

850
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're telling me you love me
while you're looking away</font>

851
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no more words</font>

852
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more...</font>

853
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medic!</font>

854
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just open it.</font>

855
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, open it. You think?</font>

856
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just push? Harder.</font>

857
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing it as hard as...
Just let...</font>

858
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. You go. Let me do it.</font>

859
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go. Yeah.</font>

860
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, show me how it's done.</font>

861
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, Beth.
You're strong, right?</font>

862
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.</font>

863
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

864
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See anything? Just, can you...</font>

865
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you help?
Can you help? Yeah.</font>

866
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to
feminism, huh? Is that dead?</font>

867
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.</font>

868
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

869
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

870
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I'm trying.</font>

871
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, push.</font>

872
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying.</font>

873
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said they called in
a concussion.</font>

874
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They did.</font>

875
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

876
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's been shot.</font>

877
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Obviously.</font>

878
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

879
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the ranger.</font>

880
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom.</font>

881
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. She's got a gun.</font>

882
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom! Hello?</font>

883
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Put that down.
Put that down.</font>

884
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

885
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">B... did you shoot that guy?</font>

886
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Buh"?</font>

887
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beth?</font>

00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay. Calm.</font>

889
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beth, we should go.</font>

890
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh. It's okay. It's okay.</font>

891
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bear</font>

892
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bear.</font>

893
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

894
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom, get up!</font>

895
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look back.
Don't look back.</font>

896
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on. Push.</font>

897
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

898
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Sorry.</font>

899
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on.</font>

900
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody else surprised by</font>

901
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that rain this morning?
I know! Was.</font>

902
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave him!</font>

903
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,368

907
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Oh, god.</font>

908
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</font>

909
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Jesus, Beth,
I wasn't even on yet.</font>

910
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is wrong
with that bear?</font>

911
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
have you got a gun for?</font>

912
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, move! Move!</font>

913
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put that away!</font>

914
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I go out of my head</font>

915
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I just can't get enough.</font>

916
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!
Shoot it! Shoot it!</font>

917
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit! Kill it!</font>

918
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the tree!</font>

919
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The big fucking bear! Shut up!</font>

920
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it chasing us?</font>

921
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We slip and slide
as we fall in love...</font>

922
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom, try to shut
the fucking door!</font>

923
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the fucking door,
you dumb-ass!</font>

924
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, you got to stop
yelling at me!</font>

925
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

926
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beth, speed up!</font>

927
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough</font>

928
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough</font>

929
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

930
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough...</font>

931
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're like an angel
and you give me your love</font>

932
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just can't seem
to get enough of</font>

933
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough,
I just can't get enough</font>

934
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

935
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

936
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

937
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

938
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

939
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough</font>

940
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't get enough,
I just can't...</font>

941
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
how to talk to him, you know.</font>

942
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, what-what do you say to
a kid who just lost his mommy?</font>

943
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom is the reason
I'm the man I am today.</font>

944
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what a man you are.</font>

945
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Attacking innocent people
for no reason.</font>

946
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you not?</font>

947
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Just continue.</font>

948
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, when my daddy died,</font>

949
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my mama bought me
this pet lizard.</font>

950
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the coolest little thing.</font>

951
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It had all these
green scales on it.</font>

952
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She used to call it
a tiny dinosaur.</font>

953
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought that was so awesome.</font>

954
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was real bad
at connecting with people,</font>

955
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I practiced
conversation starters</font>

956
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on that lizard every day.</font>

957
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then
that's how I met rocky and Joe.</font>

958
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my team, man.</font>

959
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:46,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're planning on moving
to New York City together.</font>

960
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are my buds, man.</font>

961
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I should get Gabe a lizard?</font>

962
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know what?</font>

963
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lizards are good listeners, bud,</font>

964
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but people...</font>

965
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are good at hearing.</font>

966
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.</font>

967
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we... it's okay.</font>

968
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all are hugging.</font>

969
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

970
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the fuck is the gazebo?</font>

971
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I say something without
you getting angry with me?</font>

972
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm already angry with you.</font>

973
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gone.</font>

974
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the actual...</font>

975
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Please,
please! Daveed, stop.</font>

976
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:53,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.</font>

977
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!</font>

978
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I promise. I-I don't
know where it went.</font>

979
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just gone.</font>

980
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, duffel
bags don't have legs.</font>

981
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,</font>

982
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm-a give you one more chance.</font>

983
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the ba...</font>

984
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun down and
move away from the teenager.</font>

985
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:15,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the weapon and step away
about 5 to 10 paces.</font>

986
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, listen. Just
calm down, all right?</font>

987
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't fucking around.</font>

988
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just do it.</font>

989
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

990
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to do this.
Shut up!</font>

991
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming down there.</font>

992
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uhm</font>

993
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

994
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh!</font>

995
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:53,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trying to...</font>

996
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find a safe spot to hop down.</font>

997
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get up there?</font>

998
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I jumped from
that tree over there, but...</font>

999
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hurt my hip a little.</font>

1000
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can try to catch you
if you want.</font>

1001
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no! You stay
right where you are!</font>

1002
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lets, uh, see, uh.</font>

1003
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it.</font>

1004
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1005
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1006
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.</font>

1007
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? I shot
my own fucking fingers?</font>

1008
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to move.</font>

1009
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd he take
those two fingers off?</font>

1010
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not even
next to each other.</font>

1011
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you!</font>

1012
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come out of there!</font>

1013
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Come on out!</font>

1014
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No fucking way!</font>

1015
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God! Goddamn it!</font>

1016
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two, on your bellies.</font>

1017
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now! And no more moving.</font>

1018
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!</font>

1019
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you grab them for me?</font>

1020
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I grab his fingers?</font>

1021
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.</font>

1022
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow. Slow.</font>

1023
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy.</font>

1024
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh, god.</font>

1025
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1026
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you get back on your belly.</font>

1027
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll hold on to these.</font>

1028
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, where you at?</font>

1029
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1030
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1031
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. The river.</font>

1032
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, look.</font>

1033
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Dee Dee's sweater.</font>

1034
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. So we're crossing?</font>

1035
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on the right track.</font>

1036
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel it.</font>

1037
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama?</font>

1038
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1039
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, man.</font>

1040
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My fucking Jersey, man.</font>

1041
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long are
you gonna keep us like this?</font>

1042
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until that guy in the gazebo</font>

1043
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">throws his weapon
into the woods.</font>

1044
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then
we'll be here forever.</font>

1045
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?</font>

1046
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need to die
because of this.</font>

1047
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, I got this.
Do you?</font>

1048
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have your fingers
in my pocket.</font>

1049
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all gonna get arrested.</font>

1050
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,</font>

1051
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so get ready for 10 to 15 years</font>

1052
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of shitting
in front of your cellmate</font>

1053
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and supervised shower time.</font>

1054
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective, your honor, sir,
I'm not with them.</font>

1055
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never even done coke.</font>

1056
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, maybe once.
Once... at a party once.</font>

1057
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go to jail.
You're not going to jail.</font>

1058
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.</font>

1059
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never been able
to shit in front of people.</font>

1060
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like to shit in peace.</font>

1061
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody move.</font>

1062
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bear.</font>

1063
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1064
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1065
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not falling
for none of your...</font>

1066
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

1067
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, y'all just stay
still. Don't move.</font>

1068
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just play dead.</font>

1069
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

1070
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

1071
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man. You fucked.</font>

1072
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, can you breathe?</font>

1073
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1074
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that's a yes.</font>

1075
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can someone do something?</font>

1076
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe your boy can do something.</font>

1077
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just, like... move it?</font>

1078
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?</font>

1079
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee!</font>

1080
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, stay close. I
haven't seen paint in a while.</font>

1081
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

1082
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

1083
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

1084
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he okay?</font>

1085
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me, please.</font>

1086
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have food?</font>

1087
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name was Elsa,</font>

1088
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she was so beautiful.</font>

1089
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are-are you... are you hurt?</font>

1090
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you attacked?</font>

1091
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Devil bear.</font>

1092
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My... I'm looking
for my daughter.</font>

1093
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:35,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was attacked
by the devil bear.</font>

1094
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:36,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you seen her?</font>

1095
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have?</font>

1096
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was she alive? Yes.</font>

1097
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, can you just point
to where she went?</font>

1098
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.</font>

1099
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't...</font>

1100
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry!</font>

1101
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you.</font>

1102
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you. Come.</font>

1103
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not moving.</font>

1104
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it died.</font>

1105
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It died on top of me?</font>

1106
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check its pulse.</font>

1107
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you, like,
feel it breathing?</font>

1108
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure.</font>

1109
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, hey, guy?</font>

1110
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective.</font>

1111
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we call a truce</font>

1112
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I can see
if the bear is dead?</font>

1113
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1114
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1115
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1116
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

1117
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S-Still breathing.</font>

1118
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should go.</font>

1119
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll probably be all right.</font>

1120
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell, man?</font>

1121
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna wake up eventually.</font>

1122
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.</font>

1123
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"She."</font>

1124
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1125
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bear is a girl.</font>

1126
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?</font>

1127
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because its
vagina is on my ear.</font>

1128
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit. She's moving.</font>

1129
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's awake.</font>

1130
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit. Well, stay
back. Stay back.</font>

1131
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1132
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chill out.
Just chill out!</font>

1133
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.</font>

1134
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay back.</font>

1135
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1136
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

1137
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no. Don't
eat that. Don't eat that.</font>

1138
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be goddamned.</font>

1139
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we shoot her?</font>

1140
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.</font>

1141
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1142
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no, no!</font>

1143
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie! Daveed, help.</font>

1144
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this?</font>

1145
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1146
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?</font>

1147
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I don't like this.</font>

1148
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop.</font>

1149
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go limp! Slide down!
I'm limp already.</font>

1150
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!</font>

1151
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.</font>

1152
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, you got to
fight back, all right?</font>

1153
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's-it's playing with you.</font>

1154
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd stay still if I were you.</font>

1155
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!</font>

1156
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.</font>

1157
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daveed!</font>

1158
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we've been through! Come on!</font>

1159
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, help him!</font>

1160
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get lower. You're not listening!</font>

1161
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie.</font>

1162
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god. He's gonna die.</font>

1163
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, girl.</font>

1164
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go, girl.</font>

1165
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

1166
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.</font>

1167
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like
cocaine Christmas.</font>

1168
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't have to tell me twice.</font>

1169
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1170
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daveed!</font>

1171
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bag's worth $14 million.</font>

1172
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a truce, and a truce
is on god where I'm from.</font>

1173
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!</font>

1174
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need that bag.</font>

1175
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.</font>

1176
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.</font>

1177
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shot..</font>

1178
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I didn't.</font>

1179
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run! Go, go!</font>

1180
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1181
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

1182
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.</font>

1183
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Gabe? You didn't
bring him here, did you?</font>

1184
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down.</font>

1185
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's safe at home watching TV.</font>

1186
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? How long
has he been alone?</font>

1187
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left him with me!</font>

1188
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I look like "daddy
day care center" to you?</font>

1189
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1190
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck happened to you? A lot.</font>

1191
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get the coke? A little.</font>

1192
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bear ate most of it.</font>

1193
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? The bear.</font>

1194
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It fucking did cocaine.</font>

1195
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A fucking...</font>

1196
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bear did cocaine, dad!</font>

1197
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck this!</font>

1198
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.</font>

1199
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.</font>

1200
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me. Look at me.</font>

1201
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on the hook here.</font>

1202
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:38,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.</font>

1203
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the people that I deal with,</font>

1204
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they don't care how,
just that it was.</font>

1205
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look at me.</font>

1206
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:48,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna come
after me, my family</font>

1207
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I don't get them
every penny's worth.</font>

1208
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear what I'm saying?</font>

1209
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you and Gabe.</font>

1210
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?</font>

1211
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have a choice.</font>

1212
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a bag
with the cop and the bear</font>

1213
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over at the pavilion structure.</font>

1214
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1215
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, son. Come on.</font>

1216
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's there?</font>

1217
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy. Stay away.</font>

1218
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the duffel?</font>

1219
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave it to the bear.</font>

1220
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave it to the bear?</font>

1221
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. The bear.</font>

1222
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It loves coke.</font>

1223
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wh-which way did it go?</font>

1224
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not fucking around here.</font>

1225
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Syd White.</font>

1226
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I've been
following you for years.</font>

1227
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all have.</font>

1228
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reba.</font>

1229
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.</font>

1230
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you now.</font>

1231
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful
when you cuff these guys.</font>

1232
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:05,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're kind of shifty.</font>

1233
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What...</font>

1234
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1235
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry, Bob.
- I'm sorry, Bob.</font>

1236
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shot him?</font>

1237
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to hurt him.</font>

1238
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't work for you.</font>

1239
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The department trusted you.</font>

1240
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The state of Tennessee
trusted you.</font>

1241
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:34,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The United States of America,
it trusted you.</font>

1242
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1243
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trusted you with Rosette.
I know.</font>

1244
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Rosette?</font>

1245
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dog in my car.</font>

1246
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left a dog in the car?</font>

1247
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You left my son in Saint Louis.</font>

1248
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is she?</font>

1249
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She being a good girl?</font>

1250
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
She's such a good girl.</font>

1251
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">E-enough.</font>

1252
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me which way the bear went,</font>

1253
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:06,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.</font>

1254
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.</font>

1255
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,</font>

1256
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that's just me.</font>

1257
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what do you guys say?</font>

1258
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's so funny?</font>

1259
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apex predator,</font>

1260
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.</font>

1261
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead north, man.</font>

1262
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we will.</font>

1263
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead... dead north.</font>

1264
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:39,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1265
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The devil bear
is in there.</font>

1266
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't go in there.</font>

1267
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have kids?</font>

1268
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would have.</font>

1269
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go find mine.</font>

1270
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his name would be Texas.</font>

1271
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a flashlight? Yeah.</font>

1272
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:43,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

1273
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:45,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1274
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, lady and little man.</font>

1275
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, you both.</font>

1276
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1277
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What about me?</font>

1278
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch where you step.</font>

1279
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you. Stay close.</font>

1280
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:27,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1281
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

1282
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay still, Henry.</font>

1283
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look like polar bears.</font>

1284
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry? Dee Dee?</font>

1285
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:47,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama! Deedee?</font>

1286
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?</font>

1287
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Them, they're...
They're harmless. Dee Dee!</font>

1288
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama, I just...
Baby!</font>

1289
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee, you're okay.</font>

1290
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you hurt?</font>

1291
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just my leg. Your leg?</font>

1292
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That looks really deep.</font>

1293
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Don't touch it.
Ow! Ow! Henry!</font>

1294
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:04,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's keep you warm.</font>

1295
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.</font>

1296
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You smart girl.</font>

1297
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You left us clues.</font>

1298
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found you.</font>

1299
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put that on.</font>

1300
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love you so much.</font>

1301
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

1302
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.</font>

1303
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I just... it's okay.
Henry told me everything.</font>

1304
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything?</font>

1305
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:22,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean that
you guys did drugs?</font>

1306
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told her? No.</font>

1307
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.</font>

1308
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just so glad I found
you and you're okay.</font>

1309
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, what was that?</font>

1310
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cocaine bear's back.</font>

1311
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you walk? Uh, a little.</font>

1312
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:38,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go, Henry.</font>

1313
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go that way. Go ahead.</font>

1314
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Come on.</font>

1315
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. It's a way out.</font>

1316
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:53,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the falls.
Oh, wow.</font>

1317
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, stay away from the ledge!</font>

1318
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god.</font>

1319
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:57,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>

1320
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Syd, let's cut our losses.</font>

1321
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Let's just
deal with the fallout.</font>

1322
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw what that
bear did to that hiker.</font>

1323
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1324
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck!</font>

1325
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?
What the fuck?</font>

1326
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1327
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie.</font>

1328
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this.</font>

1329
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1330
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:46,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1331
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn bear.</font>

1332
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie, put the rest in the bag.</font>

1333
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got what you wanted?</font>

1334
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1335
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's-there's a
lot more out there.</font>

1336
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to keep looking,
understand?</font>

1337
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not whole yet.</font>

1338
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:27,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm leaving, Syd.</font>

1339
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the bag.</font>

1340
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you all get so soft?</font>

1341
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All got sand in your pussies.</font>

1342
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?</font>

1343
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dead end. What do we do?</font>

1344
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay away from the bears.</font>

1345
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:20,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This way.</font>

1346
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. There's an opening.</font>

1347
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, come here.</font>

1348
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.</font>

1349
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has a gun.</font>

1350
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1351
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:38,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1352
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hell is this?</font>

1353
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.</font>

1354
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:46,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad. Who are you?</font>

1355
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a mom.</font>

1356
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.</font>

1357
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:53,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!</font>

1358
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.</font>

1359
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?</font>

1360
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:02,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

1361
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Help him out!
Yeah, yeah.</font>

1362
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's stuck.</font>

1363
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1364
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are these guys?</font>

1365
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going home.</font>

1366
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W-We're not gonna say
anything, but we're going home.</font>

1367
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's going anywhere!</font>

1368
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad. Shut up, Eddie.</font>

1369
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut</font>

1370
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away. Back off. Back off.</font>

1371
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here,
you little fuckers!</font>

1372
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1373
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Get... fuckers!</font>

1374
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay away.</font>

1375
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Stay away.</font>

1376
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. He hit the bear.</font>

1377
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just give 'em the bag.</font>

1378
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot the fucking bears!</font>

1379
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get over here.
Dee Dee and Whoa!</font>

1380
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!</font>

1381
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.</font>

1382
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck's the matter with you?</font>

1383
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:53,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!</font>

1384
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get 'em off me!</font>

1385
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck him. Help me out!</font>

1386
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow. Eddie!</font>

1387
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:01,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coward. Daveed!</font>

1388
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, catch.</font>

1389
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:10,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am taking
the fucking children home.</font>

1390
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:12,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama!</font>

1391
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:15,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell yeah, Mrs. Mckinndry.</font>

1392
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:16,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around, dad.</font>

1393
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids have been dragged
into this.</font>

1394
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!</font>

1395
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are dead.</font>

1396
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are no son of mine.</font>

1397
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you!</font>

1398
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did this.</font>

1399
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:29,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the reason
this is all happening.</font>

1400
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a good thing
he's not like you,</font>

1401
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you're
a piece of crap person</font>

1402
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a bad dad!</font>

1403
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck are you?</font>

1404
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Henry,</font>

1405
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I am so fucking tired!</font>

1406
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me, too.</font>

1407
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:12,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

1408
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's protecting the cubs.</font>

1409
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:15,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1410
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to jump. Wait, what?</font>

1411
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.</font>

1412
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna be okay.</font>

1413
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, here, here.</font>

1414
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have some coke,

1415
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here!
It's not that far, you guys.</font>

1416
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna be all right.</font>

1417
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready? Mm-hmm.</font>

1418
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2, 1. Jump!</font>

01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1422
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. It's okay.</font>

1423
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eddie. Help.
We made it.</font>

1424
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:25,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the shit out of here,

1425
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit. He shot you.</font>

1426
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help! Help!</font>

1427
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:15,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S-Six more days of John.</font>

1428
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1429
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Six more days...</font>

1430
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to know,
what I said earlier...</font>

1431
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're more than a
drug dealer, all right?</font>

1432
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my friend.
You're my best friend.</font>

1433
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</font>

1434
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, I...</font>

1435
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:33,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my last question.</font>

1436
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1437
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 20 questions.</font>

1438
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my last one.</font>

1439
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? All right. Sure.</font>

1440
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it Joanie?</font>

1441
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Joanie, right?</font>

1442
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

1443
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you guess?</font>

1444
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so fucking obvious.</font>

1445
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't want to guess it</font>

1446
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have you crying
on me all day.</font>

1447
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a nurse!</font>

1448
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:11,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He-he got
grazed by a bullet.</font>

1449
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in shock.</font>

1450
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put pressure on him.</font>

1451
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:13,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've called backup.</font>

1452
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.</font>

1453
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should get going.</font>

1454
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take care of yourself.</font>

1455
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Hi.</font>

1456
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rosette.</font>

1457
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:46,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose dog is this?</font>

1458
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's mine.</font>

1459
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine and Gabe's.</font>

1460
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:50,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it on cocaine?</font>

1461
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good dog.</font>

1462
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?</font>

1463
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:01,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1464
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you'd be okay.</font>

1465
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the toughest person
I know.</font>

1466
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you get that
from your mom.</font>

1467
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're right.</font>

1468
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for coming to get me.</font>

1469
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your mom. I love you.</font>

1470
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, too, Henry.</font>

1471
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm sorry I pushed
Ray on you too soon.</font>

1472
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:26,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You deserve to be happy.</font>

1473
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henry, let's walk over here.</font>

1474
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.</font>

1475
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also don't want to look.</font>

1476
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh. Don't look.</font>

1477
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just cruise on by.</font>

1478
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, here come the po-po.</font>

1479
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, mom.</font>

1480
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to go to Nashville
with you and Ray.</font>

1481
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we can go after me
and Henry get out of rehab.</font>

1482
01:28:46,863 --> 01:28:48,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rehab?</font>

1483
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're cokeheads now.</font>

1484
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know?</font>

1485
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:52,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got the bite,
and we're about that life,</font>

1486
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Mckinndry. Mm-hmm.</font>

1487
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.</font>

1488
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rodney,
are you getting it?</font>

1489
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to god, Carol.</font>

1490
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carot well, then zoom in.</font>

1491
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is the red light on?
No, I got it.</font>

1492
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they're so cute.</font>

1493
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this is
gonna be good.</font>

1494
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1495
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:26,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are they looking
at us like that?</font>

1496
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:27,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1497
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:29,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1498
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:32,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bass</font>

1499
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ooh, white</font>

1502
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">vision, dreams of passion</font>

1503
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">blowing through my mind</font>

1504
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all the while I think of you</font>

1505
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">high price</font>

1506
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a very strange reaction</font>

1507
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:52,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for us to unwind</font>

1508
01:29:52,846 --> 01:29:54,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the more I see, the more I do</font>

1509
01:29:54,848 --> 01:29:56,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something like a phenomenon</font>

1510
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">telling your body to come along</font>

1511
