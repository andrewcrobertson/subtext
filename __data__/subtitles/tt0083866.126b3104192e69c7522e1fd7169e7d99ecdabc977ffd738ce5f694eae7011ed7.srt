882
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,374
DOCTOR 1: Does he
sleep at night?

883
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,625
MARY: I don't know.
I don't know.

884
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,335
What's the matter
with Elliott?

885
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,298
DOCTOR 2: Have you noticed
any surface sweating?
MARY: No.

886
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,301
Has it lost any hair?
GERTIE: He never had any hair.

887
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,261
DOCTOR 1: Are the children
all right?
MARY: Yes.

888
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,723
PSYCHIATRIST: Did it ever
build anything or
write anything down?

889
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,890
MIKE: Uh... No.

890
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,644
Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its
own environment?

891
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,440
He's smart. He
communicates
through Elliott.

892
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,192
Elliott thinks
its thoughts.

893
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,280
No. Elliott feels
his feelings.

894
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,287
SCIENTIST 1: We've identified
his primary carrier protein by
electrophoresis.

895
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,538
It's definitely not albumin.

896
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,833
SCIENTIST 2: Testing shows no
deficit. Some F&F. HTS test...

897

SCIENTIST 3: EEG analysis
shows complete coherence

898

brainwave activity between
both subjects.

<i>Nitrates.
255 million equivalent.</i>

902
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,095
DOCTOR 2: Better do IV
and oral contrast.

903
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,474
If there's no response,
let's move to
hypertonic saline.

904
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:55,100
DOCTOR 3: We have
meta-starch available.

905
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,560
DOCTOR 2: Cut five per kilo.

906
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,728
DOCTOR 3: CVP line could help.

907
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,189
DOCTOR 2: I think you
get more information
with this one gain.

908
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:06,403
ELLIOTT: You have no right to
do this. You're scaring him.

909
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,947
You're scaring him!

910
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,240
DOCTOR 2:
Respiratory rate, 12.

911
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:12,743
DOCTOR 4: Good air entry but
decreased tidal volume
on the boy.

912
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:16,580
Put him on O2 five liters by
nasal cannula and draw blood
gas in 20 minutes.

913
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,707
DOCTOR 2: Temperature's
dropped from 20 to 17 degrees
centigrade.

914
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,334
DOCTOR 3: Get a
hypothermia blanket...

915
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,461
ELLIOTT: Please
leave him alone.

916
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,632
Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

917
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,259
DOCTOR 2: Get a Doppler-scope
in here and set me up for
a 2D cardiac echo.

918
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:31,804
DOCTOR 1: Skin is cool
and diaphoretic.

919
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,640
DOCTOR 2: He's not refusing
at all. He needs inotropic
support.

920
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,268
DOCTOR 4: PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

921
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,938
It could be sepsis.

922
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,023
DOCTOR 3: We've drawn two sets
of blood cultures.

923
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:46,318
DOCTOR 2: He needs
broad-spectrum coverage.
How about amp, gen, flagyl?

MILITARY DOCTOR:
He shouldn't talk now.

928
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,671
Well, he has to
talk now, Major.

929
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,302
Elliott, that machine,
what does it do?

930
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,473
(VERY WEAKLY)
The communicator?

931
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,019
Is it still working?

932

KEYS: It's doing something.

933
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:25,607
What?

934
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,610
I really shouldn't tell.

935
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,697
(BREATHLESSLY)
He came to me.

936
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,032
He came to me.

937
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,328
Elliott, he came to me, too.

938
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:43,041
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

939
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,669
I don't want him to die.

940
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,131
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

941
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,885
He needs to go home.

942
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,722
He's calling his people

943
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,976
and I don't know
where they are.

944
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:04,313
He needs to go home.

945
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,443
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left
here intentionally.

946
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,449
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

947
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,076
It's a miracle.

948
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,581
And you did the best
that anybody could do.

949
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,128
I'm glad he met you first.

Incredible.

four nucleotides like we do.
He has six.
