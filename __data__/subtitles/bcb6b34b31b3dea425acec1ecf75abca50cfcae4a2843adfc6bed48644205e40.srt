1
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,820
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,020
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,220
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,720
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,820
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,620
What is the most resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,220
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,120
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,619
Uh...

10
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,419
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--

11
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,820
An idea.

12
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,619
Resilient. Highly contagious.

13
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,820
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

14
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,419
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,819
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,619
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,719
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,319
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,719
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,419
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,119
...from even the most skilled extractor.

22
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,419
How can you do that?

23
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,520
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,319
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

25
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,419
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

26
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,920
...your defense is never down.

27
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,719
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,219
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

29
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,819
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

31
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,319
...I need to know what's in that safe.

32
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,020
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

34
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,020
He knows.

35
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,520
What's going on up there?

36
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,420
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

37
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,119
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

38
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,719
The information is in the safe.

39
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,120
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
What's she doing here?

41
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,319
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

42
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

43
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,620
If I jumped, would I survive?

44
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,419
With a clean dive, perhaps.

45
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,219
Mal, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,620
I thought you might be missing me.

47
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,020
You know that I am.

48
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,120
But I can't trust you anymore.

49
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,220
So what?

50
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,919
Looks like Arthur's taste.

51
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

52
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,120
Please, have a seat.

53
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
Tell me...

54
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
...do the children miss me?

55
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,320
You can't imagine.

56
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,619
What are you doing?

57
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,320
Just getting some fresh air.

58
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Stay where you are, Mal.

59
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Goddamn it.

60
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,419
Turn around.

61
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,720
The gun, Dom.

62
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Please.

63
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,620
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

64
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,420
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

65
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,820
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

66
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,320
I want to know the name
of your employer.

67
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,119
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

68
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,820
That depends
on what you're threatening.

69
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,820
Killing him would just wake him up.

70
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,820
But pain...

71
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,620
Pain is in the mind.

72
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,520
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

73
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,019
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

74
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,620
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

75
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,820
He was close. Very close.

76
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Stop him!

77
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

78
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,520
He won't wake.

79
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,220
- Give him the kick.
- What?

80
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
Dunk him.

81
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
He's out.

82
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,119
You came prepared, hmm?

83
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

84
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,419
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

85
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,119
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

86
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,320
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

87
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,419
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

88
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,419
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

89
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,219
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

90
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,619
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

91
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,620
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

92
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,819
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

93
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,720
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

94
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,420
But your deception was obvious.

95
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,619
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

96
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,019
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

97
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,420
We won't last two days.

98
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,519
Cobb?

99
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,819
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

100
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

101
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,020
I've always hated this carpet.

102
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,520
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

103
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,420
But very definitely made of wool.

104
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,920
Right now...

105
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,420
...I'm lying on polyester.

106
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,120
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

107
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,220
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

108
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm still dreaming.

109
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,220
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

110
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,720
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

111
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,519
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

112
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,919
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

113
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,519
We're not in your dream.

114
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,220
We're in mine.

115
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,219
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

116
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,719
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

117
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,019
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

118
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,320
That's enough.

119
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,920
You. What the hell was all that?

120
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,319
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

121
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,219
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

122
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,219
He's not gonna check every compartment.

123
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,019
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

124
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Listen. Every man for himself.

125
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,419
Yes, hello?

126
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,220
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.

127
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,319
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

128
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,719
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.

129
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,619
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

130
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,720
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

131
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,319
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

132
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,820
Why?

133
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,720
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

134
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,920
Grandma says you're never coming back.

135
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,420
Phillipa, is that you?

136
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,719
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

137
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,620
She's shaking her head.

138
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,220
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

139
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Daddy?

140
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,019
Yeah, James?

141
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,920
Is Mommy with you?

142
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,720
James, we talked about this.

143
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Mommy's not here anymore.

144
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,720
Where?

145
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,019
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

146
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,219
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

147
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,462
And you be good, you be--

148
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

149
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,519
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

151
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,119
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

152
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,519
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

153
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,852
It's getting worse, isn't it?

154
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:08,319
One apology's all you're
getting, all right?

155
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,919
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

156
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,519
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

157
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,519
...to COBOL Engineering two hours ago.

158
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,920
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

159
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,919
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

160
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,419
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

161
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,720
Stateside.

162
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,420
Send my regards.

163
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,420
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

164
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
So I offer you the satisfaction.

165
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,820
It's not the way I deal with things.

166
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,020
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

167
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,920
But I can't speak for COBOL Engineering.

168
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,420
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

169
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,419
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

170
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,719
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

171
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,819
...why can't you plant one there instead?

172
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,019
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

173
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,519
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

174
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,719
Elephants.

175
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,119
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

176
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,219
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

177
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,620
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

178
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,219
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

179
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,019
Because I can find my own way
to square things with COBOL.

180
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,319
Then you do have a choice.

181
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,220
Then I choose to leave, sir.

182
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,820
Tell the crew where you want to go.

183
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,220
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

184
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,420
How would you like to go home?

185
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,520
To America. To your children.

186
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,219
You can't fix that. No one can.

187
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,720
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

188
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,319
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

189
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,020
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

190
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,919
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

191
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

192
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,320
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

193
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,720
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

194
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,019
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

195
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,119
...I'd need a guarantee.

196
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,520
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

197
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,620
But I can.

198
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,820
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

199
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,019
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

200
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,820
...waiting to die alone?

201
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,220
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

202
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

203
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,719
This can't be done.

204
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,119
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

205
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,820
You don't know that.

206
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
I've done it before.

207
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,420
Who'd you do it to?

208
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,620
Why are we going to Paris?

209
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,920
We're gonna need a new architect.

210
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,920
You never did like your office, did you?

211
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,820
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

212
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,920
Is it safe for you to be here?

213
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,519
Extradition between France
and the United States...

214
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,919
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

215
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,819
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

216
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,519
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

217
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,219
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

218
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,419
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

219
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,419
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

220
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,119
I never taught you to be a thief.

221
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,419
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

222
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,919
But after what happened...

223
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,720
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

224
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,320
What are you doing here, Dom?

225
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,819
I think I found a way home.

226
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,520
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

227
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,220
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

228
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,320
But I need your help.

229
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,219
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

230
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,319
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

231
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,919
- Money.
- Not just money.

232
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,419
You remember.

233
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,819
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

234
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,819
...things that never existed...

235
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,119
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

236
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,519
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

237
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,619
They don't actually come into the dream.

238
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,119
They just design the levels and
teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

239
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,520
Design it yourself.

240
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,620
Mal won't let me.

241
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,020
Come back to reality, Dom.

242
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,920
- Please.
- Reality.

243
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,819
Those kids, your grandchildren...

244
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,919
they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

245
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,320
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

246
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,520
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

247
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,620
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

248
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,819
I've got somebody better.

249
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
Ariadne?

250
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,120
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

251
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,619
Pleased to meet you.

252
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,419
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

253
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,720
A work placement?

254
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,319
Not exactly.

255
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,920
I have a test for you.

256
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,719
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

257
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,519
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

258
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,920
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

259
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,620
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

260
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,720
Stop.

261
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,320
Again.

262
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,820
Stop.

263
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,020
You're gonna have to do better than that.

264
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
That's more like it.

265
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,419
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

266
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,319
Now, that's when we're awake.

267
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,419
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

268
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,619
Such as?

269
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,819
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

270
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,819
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

271
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,919
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

272
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,319
Genuine inspiration, right?

273
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,819
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

274
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,619
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

275
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,219
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

276
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,119
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

277
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,719
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

278
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,519
Now, this is where I need you.

279
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,019
You create the world of the dream.

280
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,519
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

281
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,419
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

282
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,019
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

283
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,920
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

284
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,719
Let me ask you a question.

285
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,319
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

286
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,519
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

287
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,719
I guess, yeah.

288
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,520
So how did we end up here?

289
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,920
Well, we just came from the, uh...

290
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,620
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

291
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,120
Where are you right now?

292
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,519
We're dreaming?

293
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,119
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

294
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,320
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

295
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,820
If it's just a dream,
then why are you--?

296
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,119
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

297
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,619
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

298
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,019
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

299
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,819
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

300
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,220
...and then wake up.

301
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,219
How did architects become involved?

302
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,220
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

303
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,619
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

304
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,920
Five minutes?

305
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,619
What--? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

306
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,019
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

307
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,019
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

308
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,520
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

309
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,320
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

310
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,219
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.

311
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,019
Almost everything else is here too.

312
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,119
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

313
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,419
- Yours?
- Yes.

314
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,119
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

315
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,019
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

316
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,019
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

317
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,119
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

318
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,619
How else do you do it?

319
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,719
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

320
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,619
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

321
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,619
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

322
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,819
Well...

323
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,419
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

324
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,520
...but it's more about the feel of it.

325
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,120
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

326
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,020
It's something, isn't it?

327
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,420
Yes, it is.

328
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,819
Why are they all looking at me?

329
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,519
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

330
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,019
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

331
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,219
Converge?

332
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,519
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

333
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,319
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

334
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

335
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Just you.

336
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,620
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

337
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,119
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

338
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,920
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

339
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,020
Very impressive.

340
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,219
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

341
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,719
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

342
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,319
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

343
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,319
You draw from stuff you know, right?

344
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,719
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

345
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,019
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

346
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,719
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

347
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,919
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

348
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,119
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

349
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,219
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

350
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,919
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

351
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,719
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

352
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,820
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

353
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,419
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

354
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,419
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

355
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,120
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

356
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,719
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

357
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,120
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

358
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,019
There was still time on the clock.

359
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,719
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

360
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,419
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

361
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,119
A totem, it's a small personal--

362
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,819
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

363
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,819
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

364
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,619
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

365
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,519
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

366
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,119
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

367
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,619
- Like a coin?
- No.

368
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,420
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

369
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,419
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

370
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,719
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

371
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,719
That way,
when you look at your totem...

372
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,020
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

373
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,719
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

374
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,419
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

375
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,620
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

376
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,120
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

377
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,820
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

378
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,119
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

379
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,519
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

380
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,819
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

381
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,620
It's a necessary risk.

382
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,320
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

383
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
We need a forger.

384
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,720
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

385
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
You never know.

386
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I'm gonna get you a drink.

387
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,820
You're buying.

388
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,663
Your spelling hasn't improved.

389
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:31,619
Piss off.

390
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,719
How's your handwriting?

391
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,719
- It's versatile.
- Good.

392
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,120
Thank you very much.

393
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,219
Inception.

394
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,219
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me--

395
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,719
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

396
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,220
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

397
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,519
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

398
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,419
He is good at what he does, right?

399
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,619
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

400
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,819
Not like you.

401
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,019
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

402
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,719
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

403
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,519
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

404
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,019
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

405
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,219
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

406
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,019
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

407
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,719
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

408
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,119
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

409
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,719
Right there you have
various political motivations...

410
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,919
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

411
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,919
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

412
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,919
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

413
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,619
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

414
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,320
Which is what?

415
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,720
The relationship with the father.

416
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,619
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

417
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,819
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

418
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,419
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

419
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,919
Why don't you take me there?

420
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,119
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

421
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,819
COBOL Engineering.

422
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,319
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

423
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,019
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

424
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,819
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

425
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,187
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

426
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,820
All right.

427
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,819
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

428
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,520
My God, it's you, isn't it?

429
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,119
No, it isn't you.

430
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,720
Not dreaming now, are you?

431
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,520
Get him!

432
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,120
There!

433
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
One cafe.

434
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,920
Shh.

435
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,020
One cafe.

436
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,520
One cafe.

437
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,620
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

438
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,320
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

439
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,719
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

440
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
Different tail.

441
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Cobb said you'd be back.

442
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,019
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

443
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,920
It's just...

444
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,719
...pure creation.

445
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,319
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

446
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,519
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

447
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,219
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

448
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,819
What kind of tricks?

449
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,519
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

450
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,620
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

451
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,420
The infinite staircase.

452
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,620
See?

453
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,819
Paradox.

454
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,419
So a closed loop like that...

455
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,619
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

456
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,819
But how big do these levels have to be?

457
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,119
It could be anything from the floor
of a building to an entire city.

458
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,719
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

459
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,319
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

460
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,819
And the better the maze...

461
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,619
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

462
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,120
Exactly.

463
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,419
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

464
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,419
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

465
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,720
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

466
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,419
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

467
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,919
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

468
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,219
Why?

469
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,620
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

470
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,319
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

471
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,720
- They're still together?
- No.

472
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,420
No, she's dead.

473
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,120
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

474
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,220
What was she like in real life?

475
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,420
She was lovely.

476
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,419
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

477
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,720
To formulate compounds for a job?

478
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,219
And to go into the field with us.

479
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,619
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

480
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,519
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

481
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,819
- Which are?
- Great depth.

482
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,320
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

483
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,119
Three.

484
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,819
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

485
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,919
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

486
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,820
A powerful sedative.

487
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,819
- How many team members?
- Five.

488
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,720
Six.

489
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,619
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

490
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,919
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

491
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,420
This time, it seems there is.

492
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,119
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

493
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,420
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

494
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Perhaps you will not want to see.

495
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,020
After you.

496
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,319
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

497
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,220
They come every day to share the dream.

498
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,820
You see? Very stable.

499
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,620
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

500
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,919
In dream time?

501
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,719
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

502
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,220
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

503
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,219
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

504
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,320
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

505
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,320
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

506
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,820
They come to be woken up.

507
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,120
The dream has become their reality.

508
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,420
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

509
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,320
Let's see what you can do.

510
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,920
You know how to find me.

511
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,520
You know what you have to do.

512
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,820
Sharp, no?

513
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

514
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,520
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

515
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,719
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

516
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,719
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

517
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,520
That's not your concern.

518
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,319
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

519
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,019
You asked me for inception.

520
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,619
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

521
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,719
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

522
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,719
This idea will define him.

523
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,719
It may come to change...

524
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,219
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

525
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,719
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

526
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,019
And we can no longer compete.

527
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,619
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

528
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,220
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

529
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,919
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

530
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,619
That's where we come in.

531
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,019
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

532
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,919
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

533
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,619
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

534
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,019
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

535
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,319
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

536
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,819
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

537
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,420
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

538
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,019
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

539
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,219
Mr. Browning...

540
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:54,320
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

541
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,319
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

542
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,819
Not sure that's necessary.

543
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,720
No, no, no. I think we should.

544
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,620
How is he?

545
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,119
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but--

546
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,820
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get--

547
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,220
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

548
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,120
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

549
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,120
Leave that.

550
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,220
Here.

551
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,920
Must be a cherished memory of his.

552
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,519
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

553
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,320
Robert...

554
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,119
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

555
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,187
I know this is hard,
but it's imperative--

556
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:13,630
Not now, Uncle Peter.

557
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,419
The vultures are circling.

558
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,919
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

559
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,520
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

560
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,519
and adopt his physical presence, study his
mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

561
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,519
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

562
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,919
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

563
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,919
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

564
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,619
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

565
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,719
So he gives himself the idea.

566
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,239
Precisely. That's the
only way it will stick.

567
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,119
It has to seem self-generated.

568
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,719
Eames, I am impressed.

569
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,420
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

570
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,819
Were you going under on your own?

571
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,519
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

572
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,619
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

573
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,419
Yeah, I was just--
I was working on my totem, actually.

574
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,820
Here, let me take a look.

575
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,219
So you're learning, huh?

576
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,920
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

577
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,019
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

578
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,320
It was Mal's, actually. This...

579
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,719
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

580
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,820
Just spin and spin.

581
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,320
Arthur told me she passed away.

582
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,319
How are the mazes coming along?

583
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,319
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

584
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,019
...that we are trying to access.

585
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:09,620
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

586
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,719
You know, I-- Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

587
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,619
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

588
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,919
Why is that so important?

589
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,119
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

590
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,620
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

591
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,519
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

592
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,120
You can't keep her out, can you?

593
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,519
- Right.
- You can't build...

594
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,019
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

595
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,319
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

596
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,319
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

597
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,719
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

598
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,820
No one said it's getting worse.

599
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,320
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

600
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,320
Why can't you go home?

601
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,420
Because they think I killed her.

602
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,919
- Thank you.
- For what?

603
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,419
For not asking whether I did.

604
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,719
"I will split up my father's empire."

605
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,119
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

606
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,019
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

607
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,719
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

608
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,719
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

609
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,319
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

610
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,019
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

611
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,919
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

612
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,719
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

613
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,420
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

614
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,519
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

615
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,419
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

616
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,419
All right, well, try this. Um...

617
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,320
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

618
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,819
That might work.

619
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,119
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

620
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,219
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

621
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,419
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

622
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,619
Specificity?

623
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,619
Inception's not about being specific.

624
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,820
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

625
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,119
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

626
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,319
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

627
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,219
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

628
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,719
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

629
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,320
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

630
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,619
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

631
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,919
Sedation.

632
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,919
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

633
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,020
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

634
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,620
Good night.

635
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,319
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

636
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,419
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

637
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,819
- ...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

638
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,219
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

639
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,819
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

640
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,119
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20--

641
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,219
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

642
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,020
It's a week, the first level down.

643
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,619
Six months the second level down,
and the third level--

644
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,220
That's 10 years.

645
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,020
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

646
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,519
Depends on the dream.

647
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,019
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

648
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,519
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

649
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,419
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

650
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,320
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

651
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,219
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

652
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,619
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

653
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,919
That's the clever part.

654
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,319
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

655
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,319
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

656
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,920
Or tipping.

657
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,720
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

658
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,820
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

659
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,119
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

660
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,319
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

661
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,719
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need--

662
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,819
We need at least a good 10 hours.

663
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,320
Sydney to Los Angeles.

664
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,919
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

665
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,320
He must be flying private, then.

666
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,919
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

667
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,319
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

668
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,919
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

669
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,319
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

670
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,019
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

671
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,720
I bought the airline.

672
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
It seemed neater.

673
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,520
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

674
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,320
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

675
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,520
You know how to find me.

676
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,420
You know what you have to do.

677
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,720
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

678
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,620
Of course I do.

679
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,220
You said you had a dream.

680
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,920
That we'd grow old together.

681
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,120
And we can.

682
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,720
You shouldn't be here.

683
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,919
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

684
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,319
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

685
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,453
You've asked me to
share dreams with you.

686
00:55:49,454 --> 00:55:52,330
Not these. These
are my dreams.

687
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,519
Why do you do this to yourself?

688
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,620
It's the only way I can still dream.

689
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,620
Why is it so important to dream?

690
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,820
In my dreams, we're still together.

691
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
These aren't just dreams.

692
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,719
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

693
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,920
I know I did.

694
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:43,119
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

695
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,319
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

696
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,020
They're memories that I have to change.

697
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,720
Well, what's down there that you regret?

698
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,320
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

699
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,320
This is your house?

700
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,419
Mine and Mal's, yes.

701
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,320
Where is she?

702
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,020
She's already gone.

703
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,319
That's my son, James.

704
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,520
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

705
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,120
That's Phillipa.

706
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,419
I thought about calling out to them...

707
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,420
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

708
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,219
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

709
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,220
Right now or never, Cobb.

710
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,519
Then I start to panic.

711
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,420
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

712
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,519
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

713
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,219
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

714
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,420
But the moment's past.

715
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,020
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

716
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,120
As I'm about to call out to them...

717
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,220
...they run away.

718
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,220
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

719
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,720
The real world.

720
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,820
What are you doing here?

721
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,719
My name is--

722
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,220
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

723
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,819
I'm just trying to understand.

724
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,120
How could you understand?

725
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,420
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

726
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,620
To be half of a whole?

727
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,420
No.

728
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,820
I'll tell you a riddle.

729
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,620
You're waiting for a train.

730
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,820
A train that will take you far away.

731
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,220
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

732
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,419
...but you don't know for sure.

733
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,520
But it doesn't matter.

734
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,919
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

735
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,820
Because you'll be together.

736
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,020
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

737
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,519
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

738
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,020
What happened here?

739
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,820
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

740
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,319
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

741
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,719
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

742
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,320
I'll come back for you. I promise.

743
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,920
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

744
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,920
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

745
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,120
It's time.

746
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,619
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

747
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,019
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

748
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,419
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

749
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,120
All right.

750
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,719
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

751
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,020
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

752
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,719
And it doesn't have to be me...

753
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:13,220
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

754
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,720
Get us another seat on the plane.

755
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,819
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

756
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,620
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

757
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,519
Complete the job en route...

758
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,119
...I make one phone call from the plane...

759
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,220
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

760
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,419
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

761
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,220
Thank you.

762
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,119
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

763
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,119
Would you care for a drink?

764
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,619
Oh. Water, please.

765
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,120
Oh, um, same, please.

766
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,420
Um...

767
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,219
Thank you.

768
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,219
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

769
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,019
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

770
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,720
Yes, he, um...

771
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,620
He was my father.

772
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,120
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

773
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,719
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

774
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,220
Hey.

775
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,320
To your father.

776
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,120
May he rest in peace, huh?

777
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,155
Couldn't have peed
before you went under?

778
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:21,819
Sorry.

779
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,119
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

780
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,319
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

781
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,520
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

782
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:44,220
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try--?
- Walk away.

783
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,519
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.

784
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,820
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

785
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:09,620
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

786
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,519
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

787
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,219
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

788
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,220
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this--?

789
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,520
Great.

790
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,920
Come on.

791
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,619
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

792
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,519
You might at least drop me at my stop.

793
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,887
I'm afraid that it doesn't--

794
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,319
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

795
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,120
What the hell is going on?

796
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,120
This wasn't in the design.

797
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,419
Cobb?

798
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,620
Cobb?

799
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,820
Get him!

800
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,919
Are you all right?

801
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,219
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

802
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,319
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

803
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,720
Saito?

804
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,820
Get Fischer in the back room now.

805
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,820
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

806
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,619
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

807
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,519
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

808
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,119
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

809
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,319
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

810
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,019
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

811
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,919
Why the hell were we ambushed?

812
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,519
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

813
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,219
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

814
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,540
...teach his subconscious
to defend itself,

815
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,619
so his subconscious
is militarized.

816
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,419
It should've shown in the research.

817
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,319
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

818
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,819
Don't tell me to calm down!

819
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,919
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

820
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,219
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

821
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,719
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

822
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,919
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

823
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,919
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

824
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,119
Put him out his misery.

825
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,119
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

826
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,419
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

827
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,519
No. It won't wake him up.

828
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,319
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

829
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,719
Not from this.

830
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,420
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

831
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,719
Right. So, what happens when we die?

832
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,719
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

833
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,419
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

834
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:45,819
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

835
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,219
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

836
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,319
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

837
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,319
Which, in our case, is just you.

838
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,219
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

839
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,819
- ...trying to escape until the sedation--
- How long?

840
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:03,219
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

841
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,620
Let's get him upstairs.

842
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:07,720
Great.

843
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,120
Thank you.

844
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:14,019
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

845
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,719
And if we get killed...

846
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,120
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

847
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,820
Someone got first aid?

848
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,619
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

849
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,563
I didn't know we'd be
dealing with gunfire.

850
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:36,719
You had no right.

851
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,219
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

852
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,419
You knew about this
and went along with it?

853
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,619
I trusted him.

854
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,619
When? When he promised you
half his share?

855
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,119
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

856
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,319
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

857
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,919
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

858
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,019
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

859
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,336
There is a way out.
We continue on with the job,

860
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:00,219
and we do it
as fast as possible...

861
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,719
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

862
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,319
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

863
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,419
I am sitting this one out on this level.

864
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,019
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

865
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,419
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

866
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,320
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

867
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,720
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

868
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,720
Downwards is the only way forwards.

869
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,419
Get ready.

870
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,820
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

871
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:37,719
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

872
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,819
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

873
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,219
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

874
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,420
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

875
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,219
I don't know any safe.

876
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,320
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

877
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,320
Tell us what it is.

878
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,920
I don't know.

879
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,919
We have it on good authority
you do know.

880
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,420
Yeah? Whose authority?

881
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:11,420
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

882
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,520
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

883
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,020
Useful?

884
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,820
Maybe.

885
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,120
You're on. You've got an hour.

886
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,520
An hour?

887
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,019
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

888
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,819
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

889
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:37,220
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

890
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,120
- What's that?
- Good authority.

891
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,120
Uncle Peter.

892
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,920
Just make them stop.

893
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,519
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

894
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,419
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

895
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,020
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

896
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,120
You have one hour. Start talking.

897
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,320
You all right?

898
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,520
You okay?

899
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:17,920
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

900
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,019
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

901
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,019
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

902
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,919
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

903
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,920
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

904
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,819
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

905
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,620
No, he never gave me any combination.

906
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,419
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

907
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,819
Well, what, then?

908
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,519
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

909
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,620
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

910
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,320
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

911
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,520
Perhaps after your mother died.

912
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,320
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

913
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:08,519
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

914
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,019
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

915
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,920
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

916
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,919
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

917
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,619
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

918
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,120
And if he dies?

919
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,719
Worst-case scenario?

920
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,619
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

921
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,819
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

922
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,719
I appreciate that, Saito.

923
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,919
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

924
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,119
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

925
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,120
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

926
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,920
Filled with regret?

927
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,420
Waiting to die alone.

928
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,220
No.

929
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,420
I'll come back.

930
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,820
And we'll be young men together again.

931
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,919
Breathe.

932
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,119
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

933
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,119
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

934
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,219
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

935
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,920
All right. What is in the safe?

936
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,120
Something for you.

937
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,920
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

938
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,719
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

939
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,119
That's an alternate.

940
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,619
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

941
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,419
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

942
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,319
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

943
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,020
Destroying my whole inheritance?

944
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,820
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

945
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,620
He loved you, Robert.

946
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,819
In his own way.

947
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,820
In his own way.

948
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,620
At the end...

949
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,120
...he called me in to his deathbed.

950
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,420
He could barely speak.

951
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,720
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

952
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,920
He pulled me close.

953
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,620
And I could only make out...

954
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,020
...one word.

955
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,620
"Disappointed."

956
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,520
When were you in limbo?

957
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,519
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

958
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,119
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

959
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:42,419
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

960
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:46,619
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

961
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,219
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

962
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,220
...we're also going deeper into you.

963
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:55,320
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

964
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,719
We were working together.

965
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,619
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

966
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,019
I kept pushing things.

967
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,920
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

968
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:15,319
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

969
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,220
...that we could get trapped so deep...

970
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,320
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

971
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,520
...we lost sight of what was real.

972
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,120
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

973
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,720
We did that for years.

974
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,820
We built our own world.

975
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,920
How long were you stuck there?

976
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,220
Something like 50 years.

977
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,720
Jesus.

978
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,419
How could you stand it?

979
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,320
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

980
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,619
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

981
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,220
And what about for her?

982
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,620
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

983
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:21,220
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

984
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,620
Limbo became her reality.

985
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,820
What happened when you woke up?

986
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:34,020
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

987
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:39,520
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

988
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,220
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

989
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,920
Eventually, she told me the truth.

990
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,619
She was possessed by an idea.

991
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:57,520
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

992
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,120
That our world wasn't real.

993
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,320
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

994
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,220
...that in order to get back home...

995
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
...we had to kill ourselves.

996
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,419
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

997
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,519
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

998
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,419
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

999
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,819
I can tell the difference.

1000
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,319
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

1001
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,219
You don't know you're dreaming!

1002
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,619
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1003
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,620
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1004
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,619
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1005
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:51,920
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

1006
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,119
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1007
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,619
Just-- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1008
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:30,219
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1009
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,019
No, I'm not.

1010
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,320
Now, you listen to me.

1011
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,119
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1012
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,219
Now, just step back inside.

1013
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,119
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1014
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,320
We've talked enough.

1015
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,019
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1016
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,920
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1017
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,020
We're gonna talk about this.

1018
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,019
All right?

1019
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:06,220
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1020
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,219
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1021
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,119
Take a second, think about our children.

1022
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,020
Think about James.

1023
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,419
Think about Phillipa, now.

1024
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,519
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1025
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,020
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1026
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,820
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1027
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,120
How you've threatened to kill me.

1028
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,519
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1029
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,519
Why did--? Why would you do this to me?

1030
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,519
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1031
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,719
We're going home to our real children.

1032
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,519
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1033
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,020
You're waiting for a train.

1034
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:55,119
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1035
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,219
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1036
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,698
You know where you hope
this train will take you,

1037
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,219
but you can't know for sure.

1038
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,619
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1039
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,019
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1040
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,019
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1041
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,620
Jesus Christ!

1042
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,819
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1043
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:24,219
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1044
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,620
So I ran.

1045
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,720
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1046
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,720
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1047
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,020
All right, let's go.

1048
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:46,420
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1049
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,819
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1050
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,320
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1051
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,019
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1052
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:03,219
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1053
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,219
But you don't have to do that alone.

1054
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,720
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1055
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:13,420
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1056
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,019
We have to move.

1057
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,619
Time's up.

1058
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,519
All right. I don't know any combination.

1059
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,719
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

1060
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,819
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1061
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,919
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1062
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,319
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1063
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,719
I said, right now! Right now!

1064
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,820
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1065
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,719
You'll have to do better than that.

1066
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,220
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1067
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,720
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1068
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,520
What'd you get?

1069
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,419
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1070
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,619
This helps us how?

1071
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,920
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1072
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,219
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1073
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,919
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1074
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,620
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1075
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,719
Damn it.

1076
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,920
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1077
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,719
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1078
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,463
Destroy his one positive relationship?

1079
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,919
No, repair his relationship
with his father...

1080
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,319
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1081
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:36,519
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1082
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,019
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1083
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,720
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1084
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,519
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1085
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,319
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1086
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,519
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1087
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,019
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1088
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,719
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1089
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,919
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1090
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,219
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1091
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,519
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1092
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,819
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1093
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,420
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1094
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:15,319
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1095
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,819
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1096
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,820
- You ready?
- Ready!

1097
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,119
Sweet dreams.

1098
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,220
Am I boring you?

1099
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,720
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1100
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,220
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1101
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,320
There goes Mr. Charles.

1102
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:44,619
Mr. Fischer, right?

1103
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:48,319
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--

1104
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,619
Hmm.

1105
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:52,520
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1106
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,820
In case you get bored.

1107
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,419
Must've blown you off.

1108
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,420
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1109
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,020
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1110
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,219
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500--

1111
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,519
About $500, right?

1112
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,619
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1113
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,819
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1114
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:29,719
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1115
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,219
And why don't you approve?

1116
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,319
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1117
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,619
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1118
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,719
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

1119
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,719
So now you've noticed how much time...

1120
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,520
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1121
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:47,019
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1122
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,620
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

1123
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,219
You look a bit perkier.

1124
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,720
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1125
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,519
Turbulence on the plane?

1126
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,319
No, it's much closer.

1127
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,220
That's Yusuf's driving.

1128
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,019
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1129
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,219
Rod Green from marketing.

1130
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,020
But that's not true at all, is it?

1131
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,619
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1132
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,820
I'm the head of your security down here.

1133
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,919
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1134
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,519
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1135
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:38,120
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1136
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,420
Security, huh?

1137
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,019
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1138
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,820
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1139
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,919
Subconscious security.

1140
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,119
You're talking about dreams?

1141
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,220
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1142
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,620
I am here to protect you.

1143
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,619
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1144
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,119
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1145
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,020
You're not safe here.

1146
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,420
They're coming for you.

1147
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,820
Strange weather, isn't it?

1148
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,820
You feel that?

1149
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,919
What's happening?

1150
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,319
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1151
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,319
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1152
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,620
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1153
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:15,520
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1154
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,220
We should probably get out of here.

1155
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:37,019
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1156
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:41,219
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1157
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:44,520
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1158
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,619
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1159
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:55,820
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1160
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,019
Yeah, I...

1161
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,719
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1162
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:06,020
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1163
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,420
Mm-hm.

1164
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,019
- You're not real?
- No.

1165
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:17,519
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1166
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,819
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1167
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,919
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1168
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,320
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1169
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,419
Yeah.

1170
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,720
Okay.

1171
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,920
Okay.

1172
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,720
Can you get me out of here?

1173
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,220
Right away. Follow me.

1174
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,720
Hold on a second.

1175
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,519
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1176
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,919
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1177
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,720
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1178
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,720
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1179
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,019
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1180
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,319
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1181
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,019
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1182
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,320
...you may not wake up.

1183
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,820
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1184
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,820
You remember the training.

1185
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,320
Remember what I said to you.

1186
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,320
Give me the gun.

1187
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,720
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1188
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,619
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1189
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,620
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1190
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:20,619
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1191
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:23,420
There was rain.

1192
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,520
Uncle Peter.

1193
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:29,420
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1194
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,720
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1195
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:38,019
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1196
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,520
It had something to do with, um...

1197
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,020
Something to do with a safe.

1198
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,219
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1199
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,119
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1200
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,019
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1201
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,519
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1202
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,519
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1203
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,219
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1204
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:02,019
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1205
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,919
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1206
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,819
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1207
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,820
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1208
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:16,719
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1209
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,719
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1210
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,220
Five.

1211
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:24,619
Five, two-- It was something,
it was a long number.

1212
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,919
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1213
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,119
Yep.

1214
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:32,319
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1215
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,719
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1216
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,019
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1217
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,632
And then when the van hits
the barrier of the bridge,

1218
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:42,219
that should be unmistakable.

1219
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,519
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1220
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,119
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1221
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,519
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1222
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,520
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1223
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,920
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1224
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,820
They're with me. Go on.

1225
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,119
Mr. Charles.

1226
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,219
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1227
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,520
They were trying to put you under.

1228
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,019
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1229
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:42,720
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1230
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,819
Hey. I see you've changed.

1231
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,620
I'm sorry?

1232
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,019
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1233
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,419
Oh.

1234
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,720
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1235
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,319
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1236
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,319
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1237
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,519
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1238
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,019
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1239
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:08,220
Shh.

1240
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,219
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1241
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,819
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1242
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,520
And you saw them torture him?

1243
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,920
The kidnappers are working for you?

1244
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,319
Robert.

1245
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,320
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1246
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,919
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1247
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,519
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1248
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,820
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1249
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,619
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1250
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,719
That's his last insult.

1251
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:57,619
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1252
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:01,620
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1253
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:12,620
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1254
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:17,120
But he's wrong.

1255
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:20,419
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1256
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,019
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1257
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,319
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1258
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:28,220
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1259
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,920
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1260
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:39,520
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1261
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,220
All right.

1262
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,419
- He's out.
- Wait.

1263
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,719
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1264
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,219
We're going into Fischer's.

1265
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,019
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1266
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,519
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1267
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,319
That's right.

1268
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,519
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1269
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,120
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1270
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,220
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1271
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,720
You good?

1272
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,119
Hey. You ready?

1273
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:22,920
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1274
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,820
Cobb?

1275
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,920
Cobb? What's down there?

1276
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,919
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1277
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,020
I mean, what's down there for you?

1278
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,420
Did you see that?

1279
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,719
Eames, this is your dream.

1280
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,019
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1281
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,919
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1282
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,619
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1283
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:57,319
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1284
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,020
I could do it.

1285
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,919
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1286
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,219
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1287
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:09,219
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1288
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:13,519
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1289
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,019
You're not coming in?

1290
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,519
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1291
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,720
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1292
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,120
Come on, Fischer!

1293
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:21,819
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1294
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:23,520
Move!

1295
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,120
Go!

1296
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,420
Sod it.

1297
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:55,220
I hope you're ready.

1298
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,720
No, it's too soon.

1299
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,419
Cobb, do you hear that?

1300
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:17,220
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1301
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,219
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1302
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,819
So, what do we do?

1303
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:23,420
We move fast.

1304
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,120
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1305
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,320
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1306
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,420
- Hey!
- That's him!

1307
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,719
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1308
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,219
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1309
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,320
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1310
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,119
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1311
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,719
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1312
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,520
Eames?

1313
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,819
Did Eames add any features?

1314
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,519
I don't think I should tell you.

1315
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,020
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1316
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:36,119
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1317
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,519
Good. Explain it to them.

1318
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,920
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1319
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,820
Paradox.

1320
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,820
- What was that?
- The kick.

1321
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,319
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1322
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,119
Yeah, we missed it.

1323
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,519
Man.

1324
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,019
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1325
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,420
Uh-huh.

1326
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:40,319
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1327
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,319
We finish the job before the next kick.

1328
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,620
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1329
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,919
If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.

1330
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,919
If you need help, hang up...

1331
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,420
How do I drop you without gravity?

1332
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,620
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1333
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:46,720
You okay?

1334
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:55,019
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1335
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,720
Go, go, go!

1336
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,019
There's something wrong.

1337
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:02,620
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1338
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:06,019
Just buy us more time, all right?

1339
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:08,019
- Come on!
- On my way.

1340
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,920
Come on! Move!

1341
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,720
All right.

1342
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,719
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1343
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,419
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1344
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,820
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1345
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:01,719
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1346
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,320
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1347
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,319
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1348
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,320
There's an entire army headed your way.

1349
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,520
I'm in.

1350
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,020
There he is.

1351
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,220
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1352
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:59,020
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1353
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,920
Cobb.

1354
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,020
No, she is not real.

1355
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,919
How do you know that?

1356
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,720
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1357
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,220
Hello.

1358
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,120
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1359
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:14,920
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1360
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:19,220
I couldn't shoot her.

1361
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:23,219
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1362
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,520
It's all over.

1363
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,820
So that's it, then? We failed?

1364
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,620
We're done. I'm sorry.

1365
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,120
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1366
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:41,719
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna
happen in there. I swear we had this.

1367
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,020
Let's set the charges.

1368
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:47,320
No, there's still another way.

1369
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:52,019
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1370
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:55,020
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1371
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:57,219
And we will find him.

1372
01:53:57,220 --> 01:54:01,319
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1373
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:04,420
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1374
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,119
Look, you get him in there.

1375
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:10,219
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1376
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,220
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1377
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:19,119
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1378
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,420
Saito will never make it, will he?

1379
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,919
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1380
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,019
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1381
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,420
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1382
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,819
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1383
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,219
Mal's gonna be down there.

1384
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,819
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1385
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:46,919
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1386
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,220
She wants me back down there with her.

1387
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,020
All right?

1388
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:26,920
- This is your world?
- It was.

1389
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,720
And this is where she'll be.

1390
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,020
Come on.

1391
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,920
Saito. Saito.

1392
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:25,319
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1393
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:28,920
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1394
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:32,720
Don't be silly.

1395
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,320
You built all this? This is incredible.

1396
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,820
We built for years.

1397
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,820
Then we started in on the memories.

1398
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,320
This way.

1399
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,019
This was our neighborhood.

1400
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:07,519
Places from our past.

1401
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,519
That was our first apartment.

1402
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:11,919
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1403
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,619
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1404
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:17,619
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1405
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:20,019
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1406
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:21,820
What is that?

1407
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:25,119
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1408
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,720
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1409
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:29,019
Come on.

1410
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,519
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1411
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,720
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1412
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,320
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1413
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,119
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1414
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:22,720
What?

1415
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:24,919
I'm gonna improvise.

1416
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:29,720
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1417
01:59:42,620 --> 01:59:46,720
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1418
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,119
Highly contagious.

1419
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:52,620
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1420
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,620
It can grow to define...

1421
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,220
...or destroy you.

1422
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:04,120
The smallest idea, such as:

1423
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,120
"Your world is not real."

1424
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:11,120
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1425
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:16,819
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1426
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:18,820
Do you think he is?

1427
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,520
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1428
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,220
I know what's real, Mal.

1429
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:30,620
No creeping doubts?

1430
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,920
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1431
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:35,519
Chased around the globe...

1432
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,319
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1433
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,220
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1434
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:44,320
Admit it.

1435
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:48,419
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1436
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,119
So choose.

1437
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:52,520
Choose to be here.

1438
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:54,520
Choose me.

1439
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:21,619
You know what I have to do.

1440
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:24,520
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1441
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,319
Because you left us.

1442
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,319
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1443
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,520
You're confused.

1444
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,720
Our children are here.

1445
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,719
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1446
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:42,020
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1447
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,620
Up above?

1448
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:02,220
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1449
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,120
Watch.

1450
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:06,319
James? Phillipa?

1451
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,919
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1452
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,519
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1453
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,620
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1454
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:16,320
What if I'm what's real?

1455
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,720
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1456
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:23,520
But what do you believe?

1457
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,720
What do you feel?

1458
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,320
Guilt.

1459
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,720
I feel guilt, Mal.

1460
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:37,219
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1461
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:41,619
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1462
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:44,320
...reminding me of the truth.

1463
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,220
What truth?

1464
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:53,820
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1465
02:02:57,020 --> 02:03:00,320
You planted the idea in my mind?

1466
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:03,320
What is she talking about?

1467
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:09,520
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1468
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:13,520
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1469
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,720
We were lost in here.

1470
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,320
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1471
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:30,220
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1472
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,120
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1473
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,220
And she couldn't break free.

1474
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:43,620
So I decided to search for it.

1475
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:49,119
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1476
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,220
And I broke in...

1477
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,920
...and I planted an idea.

1478
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:58,420
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1479
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:06,020
That her world wasn't real.

1480
02:04:18,620 --> 02:04:22,020
That death was the only escape.

1481
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,220
You're waiting for a train.

1482
02:04:33,320 --> 02:04:36,220
A train that'll take you far away.

1483
02:04:37,220 --> 02:04:40,420
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1484
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:43,520
...but you can't know for sure.

1485
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,220
Yet it doesn't matter.

1486
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,820
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1487
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:59,219
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1488
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:01,820
...that even after she woke...

1489
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:07,220
That even after
you came back to reality...

1490
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,120
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1491
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:18,219
That death was the only escape.

1492
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:21,119
Mal, no! Jesus!

1493
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:25,019
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1494
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,620
You betrayed me.

1495
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:31,119
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1496
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:34,319
We can still be together, right here...

1497
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,920
...in the world we built together.

1498
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:00,120
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1499
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,220
You can't have him.

1500
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:06,720
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1501
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:13,020
Fischer is on the porch.

1502
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:16,219
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1503
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:19,020
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1504
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:37,719
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1505
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:41,620
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1506
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:46,819
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1507
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:50,520
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1508
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,619
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1509
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:59,219
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1510
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,720
No.

1511
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,320
I wish.

1512
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,420
I wish more than anything, but...

1513
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:11,219
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1514
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,920
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1515
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:16,119
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1516
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,120
Look at you.

1517
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:24,320
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1518
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,320
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1519
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,619
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1520
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:32,420
Does this feel real?

1521
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:37,420
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1522
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:47,720
No, no, no!

1523
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,120
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1524
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,820
I was dis--

1525
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:41,920
I was dis-- Disa--

1526
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,320
- I know, Dad.
- Dis--

1527
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:53,420
I know you were disappointed...

1528
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:55,620
...I couldn't be you.

1529
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,420
No.

1530
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,320
No, no, no.

1531
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,320
I was disappointed...

1532
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:06,020
...that you tried.

1533
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,920
What?

1534
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:41,520
Come on, come on.

1535
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,220
Dad?

1536
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:54,620
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1537
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:10,919
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1538
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,820
I will!

1539
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:55,619
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1540
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:56,919
Yes.

1541
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:00,220
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1542
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,420
But we did.

1543
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:08,720
We did. You don't remember?

1544
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,220
I miss you more than I can bear...

1545
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:20,520
...but we had our time together.

1546
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,020
And I have to let you go.

1547
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,920
I have to let you go.

1548
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,420
I'm sorry, Robert.

1549
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,720
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1550
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:54,820
...not just to live for him.

1551
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,020
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1552
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:10,020
What happened?

1553
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,119
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1554
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:13,620
No, to find Saito.

1555
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:17,620
He'll be lost.

1556
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:22,020
No, he'll be all right.

1557
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:40,020
Have you come to kill me?

1558
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,720
I'm waiting for someone.

1559
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:54,020
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1560
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,120
Cobb?

1561
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,820
Impossible.

1562
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:04,920
We were young men together.

1563
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:08,920
I'm an old man.

1564
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:12,220
Filled with regret.

1565
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:18,020
Waiting to die alone.

1566
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:23,420
I've come back for you.

1567
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:30,520
To remind you of something.

1568
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:36,220
Something you once knew.

1569
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:41,320
That this world is not real.

1570
02:16:46,020 --> 02:16:50,720
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1571
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:54,320
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1572
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:01,720
Come back...

1573
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:07,620
...so we can be
young men together again.

1574
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,420
Come back with me.

1575
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,920
Come back.

1576
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:29,320
Hot towel, sir?

1577
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:32,819
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1578
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,320
Do you need immigration forms?

1579
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:38,720
Thank you.

1580
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,820
Hot towel, sir?

1581
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:44,820
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1582
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:57,320
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1583
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:00,120
Thank you, sir.

1584
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,520
Welcome.

1585
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:47,320
This way.

1586
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:12,020
James? Phillipa?

1587
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,020
Look who's here.

1588
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,720
Hey.

1589
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:27,519
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1590
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:29,920
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1591
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:32,620
Look what I've been building!

1592
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:36,619
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

1593
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:39,619
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1594
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:42,420
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!

1595
02:20:42,582 --> 02:20:47,582
