1
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,179
So, who is the woman
in the station wagon?

2
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,249
<i>Beth.</i>

3
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,086
Keenish.

4
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,622
Herr... Konish?

5
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,658
'Ö.' It's not an 'E.'

6
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,526
<i>'Ö.' "Herr König."</i>

7
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,762
<i>Where's Gretchen?</i>

8
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,199
<i>Gretchen and the movers</i>
<i>are right behind us.</i>

9
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,936
Okay, so, she's not your mother?

10
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,574
No, she's Beth.

11
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,479
Ah, okay.

12
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,415
And what is going on
with your sister?

13
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,817
She deaf or something?

14
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:38,853
<i>-No.</i>

15
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,656
But she can't speak.
It's fucking annoying.

16
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,010
You okay, honey?

17
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,981
The nice man who owns this place
will take us to our new home.

18
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,984
Oh!

19
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,500
Ah, very good, Luis!

20
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,336
You've been practicing, huh?

21
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,538
How was your journey?

22
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,206
Oh, very pleasant, thank you.

23
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,442
<i>We almost forgot</i>
<i>how beautiful it is here.</i>

24
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,078
<i>Ah,</i>
<i>we almost forgot</i>
<i>how beautiful you are, Beth.</i>

25
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,479
<i>-Oh, stop!</i>

26
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,181
Keep going!

27
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,050
Gretchen, come say hi.

28
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,321
Gretchen.

29
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,024
-What's up?
-Oh, Jesus.

30
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,293
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>Willkommen.</i>

31
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,327
Thank you.

32
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,661
No, thank you, Beth.

33
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,031
We are so glad to have you back.

34
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,667
And please do not worry
about your late arrival.

35
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,936
I completely understand.

36
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,072
<i>We have something</i>
<i>for you.</i>

37
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,607
It's...

38
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,478
The original sketch.

39
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,646
We drew that up the night
that you showed us

40
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,449
the land you acquired.

41
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,518
Beth, that is...

42
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:22,523
Well, we will display
this in the new guest lodge.

43
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,359
- Oh!
<i>- You know, you two lovebirds</i>

44
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:30,297
stumbled into my nest
almost eight years ago
to the day.

45
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,099
<i>And I believe there were more</i>

46
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,869
than just architectural plans
that were conceived this day.

47
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,104
<i>Hello, Alma.</i>

48
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,013
Your German
is already better
than your father's, huh?

49
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,285
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

50
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,325
<i>Hey, Gretchen.</i>
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

51
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,629
<i>I wish we could have spent</i>
<i>a little more time together</i>
<i>after the funeral,</i>

52
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,264
<i>but I get it.</i>

53
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,733
<i>You're all over Europe</i>
<i>with your dad's family, huh?</i>

54
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,904
<i>Don't forget you have a band</i>
<i>that needs your voice.</i>

55
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,906
<i>Anyway, I'm sending you</i>
<i>the new mix.</i>

56
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,041
<i>I knew your mom</i>
<i>would have loved it.</i>

57
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,455
Beth? It's occupied.

58
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,587
Gretchen, let's go!

59
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,856
<i>Herr König is taking us</i>
<i>to the new house.</i>

60
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,825
<i>Can you sit with Alma</i>
<i>this time?</i>

61
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,124
Car? What?
Car what?

62
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,826
What?

63
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,335
<i>Hello there!</i>

64
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,881
My name is Bonomo.
I'm your neighbor.

65
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,417
I have my hands full.

66
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,119
Oh, me too.

67
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,889
<i>Are you the housekeeper?</i>

68
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,691
No, I'm a daughter.

69
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,326
Oh, really?

70
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,061
Haven't heard about you.

71
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,497
Are you from England as well?

72
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,798
No, I'm not.

73
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,067
Why would you have heard
about me?

74
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,702
I told...

75
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:03,070
Jesus.

76
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,638
Forgive me, my dear.

77
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,142
Didn't mean to startle you.

78
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,677
I told Dr. Bonomo
about your family.

79
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,181
Dr. Bonomo is the medical
superintendent
of the local hospital

80
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,085
and also the chronic disease
treatment facility,

81
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,320
which I am also funding.

82
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,190
<i>This is Gretchen.</i>

83
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:24,525
Gretchen.

84
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,861
Yeah.

85
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,397
Gretchen is from
the United States.

86
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,501
It has been decided
that she is moving in
with her father.

87
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,706
What a pleasant surprise.

88
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,950
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

89
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,252
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

90
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,755
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

91
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,191
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

92
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,095
Hi, mom.

93
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,169
I know this is weird, um...

94
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,006
But it's good to hear
your voice.

95
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,147
Going with dad was a bad idea,
and I miss our house.

96
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,718
I'm short on money, but I'm
gonna try to come home soon.

97
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,966
<i>I know it's been tough.</i>

98
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,334
<i>But we are very happy</i>
<i>you're here.</i>

99
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,704
Excuse me.

100
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,640
Gretchen, my dear.

101
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,943
I, uh...

102
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,514
<i>I've been thinking,</i>
<i>for a young woman like you</i>

103
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:58,585
there's... not so many things
to do here during the summer,
and so...

104
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,055
I have a little idea.

105
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,127
<i>A proposal. How would you like</i>
<i>to come work for me</i>
<i>at the resort?</i>

106
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,830
<i>Oh, Herr König...</i>

107
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,397
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's an easy job,</i>

108
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,299
<i>and it will give you</i>
<i>something to do</i>

109
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,234
<i>while your parents build</i>
<i>the new resort for me.</i>

110
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,104
I could use some more
English-speaking staff.

111
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,039
Herr König, I think Gretchen...

112
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,009
I would pay you
an appropriate salary,
of course.

113
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,410
<i>I don't...</i>
- Yeah, sure. I'll do it.

114
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,051
Oh.

115
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:32,553
Schön.

116
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,187
<i>Wonderful.</i>

117
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,157
<i>Come by the reception tomorrow.</i>

118
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,261
<i>Here's your ID badge,</i>
<i>sir.</i>

119
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,131
<i>Would you like to pay</i>
<i>with cash or credit card?</i>

120
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,336
Cash, or credit?

121
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,339
Cash.

122
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,709
"That will be
45 euro for a single room."

123
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,746
Uh, that will be 45 euro
for a single room.

124
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,886
Oh, and this is Beatrice

125
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:07,287
and I am Gretchen.

126
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:19,600
<i>You have to be polite</i>
<i>and friendly,</i>
<i>even if the guest is rude.</i>

127
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,603
<i>And remember to put up the sign</i>
<i>if you go to the bathroom.</i>

128
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,173
But if you have
any real trouble,
just call the boss.

129
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,710
He lives up the resort street,
on the hill.

130
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,413
He lives in a vacation
bungalow?

131
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,851
No, he has a villa way up there.

132
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,386
He bought the hotel,
and so the bungalows

133
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,255
are basically in the front yard
of his villa.

134
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,758
Weird, right?

135
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:45,960
Super.

136
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,406
This happens
sometimes.

137
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,178
How's your first day, my dear?

138
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,250
Can't complain.

139
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,887
And how is your German
coming along?

140
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,622
Not good.

141
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,026
This is okay.

142
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,928
You know, there are
English-speaking schools

143
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,131
over the border, in Italy.

144
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:32,472
Well, I'll be along
to pick you up in one hour.

145
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,610
Oh, I have my bike.

146
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,711
Oh?

147
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,479
No.

148
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,248
No, no, no.

149
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,686
<i>No, it will be too dark</i>
<i>on the country roads by then.</i>

150
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,255
<i>This is why you</i>
<i>will not work late.</i>

151
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,692
You will help Beatrix
with the peak times.

152
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,226
What?

153
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,196
I thought we were going to split
the evening shifts.

154
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,167
<i>-You have a car.</i>

155
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,802
<i>-I have a life, too.</i>

156
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,039
Beatrix, I will not get drawn
into another debate with you.

157
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,540
I don't wanna have
a debate with you.

158
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,209
<i>-No. Every time I raise</i>
<i>an issue with you,</i>

159
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,145
<i>there is something</i>
<i>you have to say about it.</i>

160
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,313
<i>-I do everything you ask!</i>
<i>-No.</i>

161
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,916
<i>-What? I work every day</i>
<i>late shifts!</i>

162
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,717
<i>-You're blasting your</i>
<i>Scheisse music on the car radio</i>

163
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:17,985
<i>on your way to work.</i>

164
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,021
<i>I hear it across the forest.</i>

165
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,588
<i>This is a nature reserve</i>

166
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,057
<i>and you are disturbing</i>
<i>the wildlife</i>

167
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,791
<i>with your 'boom, boom...'</i>

168
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:57,024
They can dance on the carpet...

169
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,322
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

170
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,382
Hey, Alma!
What the fuck are you doing?

171
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,810
<i>Gretchen, turn it down!</i>

172
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:57,410
Alma?

173
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,082
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

174
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:09,223
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to your face?</i>

175
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,995
My father's daughter
scratched me.

176
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:16,396
Your sister?

177
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,866
-She's not my sister.
<i>-Oh.</i>

178
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:20,201
Come on now.

179
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,503
I'm sure she really wants you
to be her sister.

180
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,611
She had a chance at getting one
but she ate her twin.

181
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:38,718
<i>It's called vanishing twin</i>
<i>syndrome.</i>

182
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,456
It's when one fetus dies
in the early stages
of the pregnancy

183
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,895
and then the surviving fetus
absorbs the dead one.

184
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,664
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>it was kind of badass.</i>

185
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,068
But yeah, she's a bitch.

186
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:57,604
Okay.

187
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,910
Another reason to not have kids.

188
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,645
<i>Thanks for finishing my shift.</i>

189
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,682
<i>Erik and I haven't been</i>
<i>on a date in ages.</i>

190
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,483
Here's my master key.

191
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,987
There's only one. Don't lose it.

192
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:17,191
And at 10 p.m. sharp
you lock everything up
like I showed you.

193
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,526
And boss doesn't
need to know.

194
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,162
It's fine.

195
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:22,096
Okay.

196
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,737
Uh-huh.

197
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:05,739
Can I get a room?

198
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:10,177
May I see your ID or passport?

199
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,946
You can't just ask for my name?

200
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,553
Uhm...

201
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,456
Is it just you...

202
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,692
or are you here with a partner?

203
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,728
We have special rates
and amenities

204
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,966
for couples and newlyweds.

205
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,004
For now, just me.

206
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,106
Okay.

207
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,912
I'm Ed.

208
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:49,216
<i>What's your name?</i>

209
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,153
I'm Gretchen.

210
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,991
You look like
you don't belong here, Gretchen.

211
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,962
I won't be here
for long anyways.

212
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,669
<i>-You like music?</i>

213
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,809
Sure.

214
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,248
Then you should come to Paris.

215
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:28,755
Okay.

216
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,177
Hey!

217
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,916
Is this normal?

218
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,253
It's only my second day.

219
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,921
<i>-Better go check on her.</i>

220
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:03,124
Uh-huh.

221
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:14,701
Resort Alpschatten...

222
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,141
<i>Gretchen?</i>

223
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,376
-Yes.
<i>-Where's Beatrix?</i>

224
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,645
Uh, I stayed longer
and let her leave.

225
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,382
But I know how to lock up,
it's no trouble.

226
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,782
<i>Gretchen.</i>

227
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,852
<i>I want you to lock the doors</i>
<i>and wait for me,</i>

228
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,988
<i>I will come pick you up</i>
<i>right now.</i>

229
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:34,955
Uh...

230
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,859
Yeah, Herr König, it's fine.

231
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,296
There's a confused guest
and I need to go check on her.

232
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,599
But I have my bike here,
so you don't need to pick me up.

233
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,967
<i>Gretchen, listen to me</i>
<i>carefully.</i>

234
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,668
<i>I need you to lock the doors...</i>

235
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,803
<i>Fuck no.</i>

236
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,460
<i>Gretchen?</i>

237
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,075
Hello!

238
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,145
Please let me in!

239
00:26:54,248 --> 00:26:56,016
Please let me in right now!
Please!

240
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,066
<i>I started bleeding.</i>

241
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,404
<i>The woman stood there</i>
<i>until the police arrived.</i>

242
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:52,841
-I was chased.

243
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:54,541
Fuck!

244
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:59,780
It's really important
that your statement
is as accurate as possible.

245
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:05,285
The receptionist, she stated
that she did not see any woman
in the parking lot.

246
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:08,789
May I suggest...

247
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:12,426
we change the last part into...

248
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:18,065
"The woman stood there
until Mrs. So-and-so
entered the room...

249
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,767
"Then the police arrived."

250
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,240
That is so much better.

251
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:28,709
I think...

252
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,980
you are the victim of a prank.

253
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,016
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>is very nice here, honey.</i>

254
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,018
<i>It's best we run some tests,</i>

255
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,287
<i>but this is actually</i>
<i>very common.</i>

256
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:44,791
-Dad.
-Gretchen?

257
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,393
What happened?

258
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:47,461
Did you fall?

259
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,396
Yeah, that's not
the important part.

260
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,665
Your sister had
some kind of seizure.

261
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:53,166
<i>We need to get her checked out.</i>

262
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,102
Dad, I was attacked.

263
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:58,873
-By who?
-I don't know, the cops think
it was a prank...

264
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,808
A prank? Did somebody hit you?

265
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:03,310
No, I fell, but...
<i>- Gretchen?</i>

266
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,350
She fell, it's okay.

267
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,088
<i>We are going</i>
<i>to do an MRI...</i>

268
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,773
It might be childhood epilepsy.

269
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,576
Epilepsy?

270
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:36,643
<i>It might be?</i>

271
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:37,946
It means it might be genetic

272
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:39,580
and not caused
by an injury or tumor.

273
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,383
The cause itself
isn't life-threatening.

274
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,020
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah.

275
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,623
The better news
is I'm the superintendent

276
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:52,593
of the chronic disease
treatment center up here.

277
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,297
What's causing the seizures?

278
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:00,835
<i>-There are many</i>
<i>possible triggers</i>
<i>for a seizure in a child.</i>

279
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:02,569
<i>Fever. Certain lights.</i>

280
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,940
Certain sounds.
A change in hormone levels.

281
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,042
But Alma is too young for that.

282
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,243
<i>Has there been</i>
<i>a stressful event</i>

283
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:12,646
<i>or disruption</i>
<i>in your family lately?</i>

284
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,426
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

285
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:28,795
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

286
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:31,365
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

287
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:34,134
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

288
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,838
<i>Mom, this place</i>
<i>is completely fucked.</i>

289
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:41,174
<i>Alma keeps freaking out,</i>
<i>and they say she has epilepsy</i>
<i>or something.</i>

290
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:44,912
<i>I think Dad is blaming me.</i>

291
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,382
<i>I'm coming back home.</i>

292
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,550
<i>I got the money.</i>

293
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,326
- <i>What happened to you?</i>
- Jesus.

294
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,331
Uh, I don't wanna talk about it.

295
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:14,374
I'm police investigator
Henry Lando.

296
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,278
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about the...

297
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,448
incident last night.

298
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:31,658
Which one?

299
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,728
You told the police
that you were chased by a woman.

300
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:41,035
I don't wanna talk to you.

301
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,569
Excuse me?

302
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,338
Um... excuse me.

303
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,909
There's another guest waiting.

304
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:58,418
I think there's something wrong
with my air conditioning.

305
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:02,255
Could you come see me
when you're done?

306
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,791
Fine.

307
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,439
I'm checking out.

308
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:21,943
Oh.

309
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,978
Okay.

310
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:36,656
You didn't charge me.

311
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:39,292
Don't I have to pay
for the room?

312
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,462
Um...

313
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,265
No, you don't.

314
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:54,775
Do you smoke?

315
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,725
You coming?

316
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:16,463
Yeah, just give me a minute.

317
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,672
<i>I have a house</i>
<i>back in the States.</i>

318
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,707
<i>I just need to get</i>
<i>to an airport.</i>

319
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:03,543
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

320
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,015
<i>We have one of these in Paris.</i>

321
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,962
<i>And then the woman went</i>
<i>into that weird pink bungalow.</i>

322
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:23,563
I wasn't going in there.

323
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:29,569
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

324
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:42,850
...and then the woman went
into that weird pink bungalow.

325
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:45,920
<i>I wasn't going in there.</i>

326
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:51,025
That pink bungalow
is called the "Lover's Nest."

327
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:04,771
...and then
the woman went into that
weird pink bungalow.

328
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:07,909
I wasn't going in
there.

329
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,483
Watch out!

330
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,896
<i>Do you smell this?</i>

331
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:12,967
Yes.

332
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:24,677
Or are those molecules
binding to a receptor
in your nasal cavity?

333
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,683
Got me.

334
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,167
And are you...

335
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:50,938
right now, in this moment...

336
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:59,180
are you putting your slashed
skin back together yourself?

337
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,787
And what makes you think
you can take charge of the rest?

338
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:08,956
Hm?

339
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,359
<i>If I were you...</i>

340
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:17,298
<i>I would stay home</i>
<i>until my body was done</i>

341
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:20,067
<i>growing back those cells.</i>

342
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:25,072
I wouldn't want
to get hurt even more.

343
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:28,876
<i>As if I was stuck in a loop.</i>

344
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,612
<i>Can you... do this?</i>

345
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:38,651
Good.

346
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,027
Apology accepted.

347
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,165
Luis.

348
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,447
What are you doing?

349
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,115
I'm getting my stuff.

350
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,684
What? You're not going
to sleep in the bed?

351
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:13,487
I mean, they said we can...

352
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:16,656
-I can't sleep here again,
Gretchen. I've got work to do.

353
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:20,895
<i>Beth has been watching Alma</i>
<i>while I've been here</i>
<i>looking after you.</i>

354
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:23,430
I have to go home
and give her a break.

355
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,700
-Please don't leave.
-You'll be fine.

356
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,136
There are people here
all the time.

357
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:31,472
No, there's not!
It's deserted all night!

358
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,908
It's fine. You'll be home soon.

359
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:38,145
What if she comes back?

360
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,613
Gretchen, stop it!

361
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,282
But why? I'm not making this up!

362
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,318
I don't want to hear
any more about this shit.

363
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:47,421
You're making it
very difficult for your sister.

364
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,729
I wasn't high.

365
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,599
Oh, you were!

366
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:00,401
You were tested.

367
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:03,703
You stole money from Herr König

368
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,574
and then you ran away
with a complete stranger.

369
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,509
I can't force you
to do anything.

370
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,911
You are almost eighteen
years old.

371
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:12,913
But you don't have a job anymore

372
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:16,217
and you will not
be getting an allowance.

373
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,119
If you wanna run away,

374
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,189
then take your fucking bicycle.

375
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,003
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

376
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,405
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

377
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,941
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

378
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,844
<i>so get ready to say it!</i>

379
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:47,915
<i>Mom? Mom...</i>

380
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,451
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

381
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:54,188
<i>It's really bad.</i>

382
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,127
<i>I just wanna come home.</i>

383
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,333
Where's Gretchen?

384
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,435
<i>Or what do you think?</i>

385
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:10,037
Where's Gretchen?

386
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:12,973
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

387
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,223
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to come see me.</i>

388
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,793
<i>I saved your life.</i>

389
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:37,364
I saw the woman.

390
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,836
You saw her?

391
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:47,274
And you didn't tell anyone?
They think I'm crazy.

392
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:50,544
I need you to help me
find that woman.

393
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,014
<i>She's wanted for murder.</i>

394
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:57,051
<i>And I expect her</i>
<i>to come for you again.</i>

395
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,255
I can protect you.

396
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,758
If we find her...

397
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:10,831
I personally take you
wherever you want to go.

398
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,536
<i>Does Alma</i>
<i>listen to music often?</i>

399
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,972
<i>She loves music,</i>
<i>especially since Gretchen</i>
<i>moved in with us.</i>

400
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:20,674
<i>Now...</i>

401
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:23,177
<i>And this is extremely</i>
<i>important.</i>

402
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:27,214
<i>Nobody must know</i>
<i>about this investigation.</i>

403
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:30,017
<i>I don't know who to trust.</i>

404
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,186
Loud music
has showN to trigger seizures

405
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:33,822
in people with Alma's condition.

406
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:38,025
Alma?
Dr. Bonomo says music, no more.

407
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,362
It's just music.

408
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,130
<i>You going out?</i>

409
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:05,886
<i>A month ago,</i>
<i>a married couple on vacation</i>

410
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,988
had rented this cabin.

411
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:10,691
<i>A cabin not far from here.</i>

412
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:13,927
<i>The husband told the police</i>
<i>that in the evening</i>

413
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,096
<i>he'd lost consciousness.</i>

414
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,700
When he woke up...

415
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:24,938
he found a strange,
blonde woman in his bedroom.

416
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:30,411
Along with his wife,
who he found unconscious.

417
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:35,582
<i>The blonde woman's voice</i>
<i>had a hypnotic effect</i>
<i>on the man.</i>

418
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:39,821
<i>He chased the woman</i>
<i>into the woods,</i>
<i>but she got away.</i>

419
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,023
When the husband returned
to the cabin,

420
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:47,661
his wife had choked
on her vomit.

421
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:52,699
Jesus.

422
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:01,942
Dude...

423
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:06,881
The other night,
a half-naked woman
came into the reception,

424
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,083
and she wasn't responding
to anything.

425
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:18,525
Where was she staying?

426
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:29,670
<i>The Lover's Nest.</i>

427
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:46,220
You're right.
The next bungalow is not in use.

428
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:00,701
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>stakeouts were gonna be</i>
<i>so boring.</i>

429
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,205
When are we gonna see
some action?

430
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:07,174
<i>Almost 11.</i>

431
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:10,577
<i>Be on the lookout and listen</i>
<i>for anything strange.</i>

432
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:49,416
<i>She'll choke.</i>

433
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,521
<i>Last time I was too late.</i>

434
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:19,379
<i>Gretchen?</i>

435
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,383
Did we wake you?

436
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:34,862
<i>All the owls</i>
<i>have individual calls</i>

437
00:51:35,096 --> 00:51:38,632
<i>so that they can understand</i>
<i>each other over long distances.</i>

438
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,800
<i>And maybe we</i>
<i>can make a secret call</i>

439
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:43,871
so that we
can understand each other.

440
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:46,974
Now, I brought you something.

441
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:49,143
I know that you will like this.

442
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:00,087
Gretchen, come sit with us.

443
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:01,322
Gretchen?

444
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:03,657
I'm so sorry, did we wake you?

445
00:52:06,693 --> 00:52:07,560
No.

446
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,630
Okay, good. Please join us.

447
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,700
I went out last night.

448
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:16,904
Where did you go?

449
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:18,806
<i>The resort.</i>

450
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,044
What were you doing there?

451
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:24,879
I was with Trixie.

452
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:26,746
<i>-Hm.</i>

453
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:30,918
I didn't know Beatrix
was working late last night.

454
00:52:31,185 --> 00:52:33,220
<i>-She wasn't.</i>

455
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:36,290
She was really confused.

456
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,892
Come to think of it,
a lot like the guest

457
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:40,261
we spoke about over the phone
the other night.

458
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:43,297
Hm. I will look into this.

459
00:52:43,596 --> 00:52:46,633
Why is there nobody
working the reception after ten?

460
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:50,371
<i>Seems like a lot of people</i>
<i>need assistance after ten.</i>

461
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:52,672
It doesn't make sense
economically.

462
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,309
- That's stupid, it's a hotel.
<i>- Gretchen!</i>

463
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:56,543
I can show you the numbers
if you like.

464
00:52:56,643 --> 00:52:58,245
It's not so interesting, but...

465
00:52:58,346 --> 00:52:59,914
Maybe another time.

466
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,583
It's quite the place
you got here.

467
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:05,219
-Gretchen, what's the matter?

468
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:06,954
Why did you bring us here?

469
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,397
Your parents are planning a--

470
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:17,965
A new resort, I know.

471
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:22,003
Why do we have to live here?

472
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:22,903
<i>Gretchen!</i>

473
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:24,671
Because it's pretty outside?

474
00:53:24,771 --> 00:53:27,008
Calm down, right now.

475
00:53:45,525 --> 00:53:48,295
You are here because your family
belongs here.

476
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,902
That's a fucking weird way
to put it!

477
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:57,972
Gretchen, that's enough!
What has gotten into you?
<i>-I don't know dad!</i>

478
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:00,640
I'm just reflecting
on this very fucking weird
living situation

479
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,742
that everybody just seems
to be cool with.

480
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:03,844
Out!

481
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:05,112
<i>Now!</i>

482
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:08,816
- Great.
<i>- No, no, Luis.</i>

483
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,951
A gentleman knows
when it's time to leave.

484
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:12,820
You need some family time,
I understand.

485
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,788
No, no, no, Herr König,
we don't want you to leave.

486
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:16,756
It's alright, thank you
for the wonderful afternoon

487
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:19,160
and I wish you a good evening.
-I'm very sorry.

488
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,561
No, Luis, we are
so very happy to have you here.

489
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,065
We've been desperately eager
for you to be here.

490
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:28,469
And Gretchen, if there
is anything that... bothers you,

491
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:30,637
don't be afraid to...

492
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:32,973
talk to me.

493
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:38,012
Oh, I leave your package
just here.

494
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:41,916
Oh... it was a surprise.

495
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:44,218
I was not supposed
to say anything.

496
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,352
I am so sorry.

497
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:46,887
What package?

498
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:51,258
What package?
-It has your family name on it.

499
00:55:04,939 --> 00:55:07,041
It was your mother's stuff.

500
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:10,643
<i>The small stuff, at least.</i>

501
00:55:10,945 --> 00:55:12,779
I received it this morning.

502
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,648
<i>I... your father should perhaps</i>
<i>change the address</i>

503
00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:17,118
<i>on the counter...</i>

504
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:19,220
What is it doing here, dad?

505
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,127
I sold the old house.

506
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:34,602
It was... still my house.

507
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:37,104
<i>And I put the money</i>
<i>in an account for you.</i>

508
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:43,477
<i>I... I didn't want you</i>
<i>to get worked up again--</i>

509
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:55,322
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>you have reached</i>
<i>the Vanderkurt residence.</i>

510
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:58,092
<i>Neither Gretchen nor Olivia</i>
<i>are here now,</i>

511
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,660
<i>but we are dying to hear</i>
<i>what you have to say,</i>

512
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,863
<i>so get ready to say it.</i>

513
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:06,267
<i>Mom, I really wanna come home.</i>

514
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,570
<i>It's really bad.</i>

515
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,708
<i>I really want to come home.</i>

516
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,383
<i>What do you think?</i>

517
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:29,657
<i>What do you think, mom?</i>

518
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,725
<i>What's your take</i>
<i>on that, mom?</i>

519
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:52,279
<i>Next message.</i>

520
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:57,784
<i>Hello Ms. Vanderkurt,</i>
<i>my name is Alma.</i>

521
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:00,753
<i>I'm calling you</i>
<i>because of my sister, Gretchen.</i>

522
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:03,390
<i>Gretchen calls you</i>
<i>when she feels bad,</i>

523
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,292
<i>but you never answer.</i>

524
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:07,294
<i>I can hear her from my room.</i>

525
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:09,263
<i>I'm worried.</i>

526
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,797
<i>If you get my message,</i>

527
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:13,400
<i>I want you to call Gretchen</i>
<i>back on the phone.</i>

528
00:57:13,968 --> 00:57:16,203
<i>You can tell her</i>
<i>that you love her.</i>

529
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,205
<i>It would mean a lot to her.</i>

530
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:20,608
<i>It would make her happy.</i>

531
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:23,677
<i>If you'd like to,</i>
<i>you can come visit us.</i>

532
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,146
<i>You are always welcome here.</i>

533
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,202
Good, you're packed.

534
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:51,805
Do you even know how to drive?

535
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,774
Where is everybody?

536
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,947
They're at the hospital
with Dr. Bonomo.

537
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:03,217
Alma had a very strong seizure.

538
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:07,354
<i>It's your fault, Gretchen.</i>
<i>You know that.</i>

539
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:09,323
<i>You terrified her.</i>

540
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:15,496
I want you now
to write a farewell note.

541
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,732
Then we will pick up
some money for you at my house

542
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:20,634
and I'll drive you
to the station.

543
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,802
The last train leaves
in one hour.

544
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:41,588
Bring your bike.

545
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,053
You like it?

546
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:15,322
Sure.

547
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:18,492
<i>You know it? A common cuckoo.</i>

548
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:21,495
<i>A magnificent creature.</i>

549
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,064
<i>-Common.</i>

550
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:29,536
Ah. But its behavior is not.

551
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:32,673
Its nature is quite remarkable.

552
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:37,945
A nature modern man
destroys by disregard.

553
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:43,117
<i>Some species need our help</i>
<i>to survive and reproduce.</i>

554
00:59:45,185 --> 00:59:47,654
I'm a preservationist, you know?

555
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,443
<i>Oh, come along now.</i>

556
01:00:09,543 --> 01:00:14,214
<i>I want you to understand</i>
<i>who you got involved with.</i>

557
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:18,719
Herr Lando here
was trespassing on my property

558
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,954
<i>with an illegal firearm.</i>

559
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:22,824
What are you doing?

560
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:24,224
He's a cop.

561
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:27,694
No, he's not.

562
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:29,864
Not anymore.

563
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:32,299
<i>You see, Erik here...</i>

564
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:34,468
is actually a policeman.

565
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:38,038
He has access to police files.

566
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:41,942
Herr Lando was recently
discharged

567
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:45,279
when they found out
he was investigating a case,

568
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:49,450
<i>one that he is personally</i>
<i>involved with.</i>

569
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:53,954
Okay, Erik. I think it is time
to take Herr Lando
to the police station.

570
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,256
Gretchen, let's get your money.

571
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:02,496
<i>This way, please.</i>

572
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,098
Come along, now.

573
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:08,629
<i>You are a liability, Gretchen.</i>
<i>I can't let you out.</i>

574
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,099
What the fuck did you spray
me with?

575
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:14,034
<i>-Just pheromones.</i>

576
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:16,737
<i>I am giving you the chance</i>
<i>to be of great use</i>

577
01:02:16,838 --> 01:02:19,039
<i>in our quest for preservation.</i>

578
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:22,075
<i>The adolescent</i>
<i>needs to be trained.</i>

579
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,814
<i>Consider yourself lucky.</i>

580
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:38,659
It's a mild sedative.

581
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,060
What?

582
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,696
It'll make Alma sleep
through the night.

583
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,137
I'm staying here tonight.

584
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:57,077
<i>These creatures can't speak</i>
<i>like you or I.</i>

585
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:58,679
<i>But when trained,</i>

586
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:03,051
<i>their song can be dizzyingly</i>
<i>persuasive.</i>

587
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:32,566
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

588
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,672
Something
is not right.

589
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:01,095
Gretchen, your parents
need to hurry up

590
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:02,629
with those construction plans.

591
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:05,499
This one needs her own
mating grounds soon, no?

592
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,037
And you know what else
she needs, Erik?

593
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:12,807
<i>What happened</i>
<i>to Herr Lando's wife</i>

594
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,976
<i>must not repeat itself.</i>

595
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:21,883
<i>I'm very sorry</i>
<i>for what happened</i>
<i>to your wife, Herr Lando.</i>

596
01:06:22,216 --> 01:06:28,488
But this one's mother
wandered off my area
of authority.

597
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:32,927
She got nervous
when this one left the nest

598
01:06:33,094 --> 01:06:35,328
<i>before we had another offspring</i>

599
01:06:35,428 --> 01:06:36,831
ready to replace her.

600
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:40,700
<i>There were family matters</i>
<i>prolonging my endeavor.</i>

601
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,307
Actually...

602
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:51,311
Are you aware that
you have had the good fortune

603
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:55,615
to witness three laying
ceremonies as of now?

604
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:56,683
Wow.

605
01:06:57,118 --> 01:07:00,822
Most people don't get
to attend a single one.

606
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:03,991
And those that do
don't remember that they did.

607
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:10,097
<i>A sacred process that keeps</i>
<i>an ancient creature alive</i>
<i>and well.</i>

608
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:13,567
<i>A magnificent creature</i>
<i>whose approach to family</i>

609
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,838
<i>is beyond human comprehension.</i>

610
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:21,441
Which brings me back to you,
Erik.

611
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:24,411
You will get Beatrix
ready to conceive.

612
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:27,949
<i>Consider your mishap last night</i>
<i>a dry run.</i>

613
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:34,788
Erik?

614
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,905
Shh...

615
01:07:58,212 --> 01:07:59,412
Oh.

616
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:03,217
No, no, no, no.

617
01:08:03,516 --> 01:08:05,186
<i>You should be on your side.</i>

618
01:08:05,286 --> 01:08:07,021
<i>You could choke, my dear.</i>

619
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:41,055
<i>Honey?</i>
<i>Honey, what's wrong?</i>

620
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:42,990
I don't feel so good.

621
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,060
Take this.

622
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,456
I think they
impregnate women at the resort.

623
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:48,089
After my mom died,

624
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,992
I accidentally called
our house...

625
01:09:52,592 --> 01:09:55,695
and I heard her voice
on the answering machine.

626
01:09:58,565 --> 01:10:00,868
It kind of helped,

627
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:04,071
so I kept calling.

628
01:10:06,907 --> 01:10:09,176
Maybe you can do that too.

629
01:10:54,255 --> 01:10:56,991
<i>Do you know what this bird</i>
<i>is famous for?</i>

630
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:05,533
This bird lays its eggs
in the nests
of other bird species

631
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:10,570
and then lets those birds
raise its offspring.

632
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:15,575
No! Not in here!

633
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,876
Your parents spent
their honeymoon here?

634
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:02,356
How old is your sister?

635
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:09,330
Gretchen?

636
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:12,600
Yes, I am fine.

637
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,336
<i>We are in the treatment center</i>
<i>by the hospital.</i>

638
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:16,703
-If you come back
in the morning,

639
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:19,106
Alma won't even know
you were gone.

640
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:21,609
<i>Alma is going</i>
<i>to stay here for the evening.</i>

641
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:24,111
<i>Dr. Bonomo is going to monitor</i>
<i>her sleep.</i>

642
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:24,979
<i>Dad?</i>

643
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,547
<i>-Beth and I are coming home.</i>

644
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,781
Dad, I really need
to talk to you about--

645
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:32,685
<i>-What is it, Gretchen?</i>

646
01:12:33,821 --> 01:12:35,856
We can't trust them.

647
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,292
<i>-Gretchen, we can talk</i>
<i>when we're home.</i>

648
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:41,228
<i>I told you</i>
<i>I will protect you.</i>

649
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,400
<i>Get ready.</i>

650
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:48,402
What's wrong with Beth?

651
01:13:03,884 --> 01:13:07,254
<i>Dr. Bonomo, June 21st.</i>

652
01:13:08,956 --> 01:13:13,294
This is homo-cuculidae, Alma.

653
01:13:14,094 --> 01:13:18,566
<i>Astonishing resemblance</i>
<i>to her surrogate mother, Beth.</i>

654
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:22,970
<i>The surrogate mother's distress</i>
<i>grows in close proximity</i>

655
01:13:23,103 --> 01:13:25,005
<i>to the biological mother.</i>

656
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:29,343
<i>Thus both host parents</i>
<i>have been removed</i>
<i>from the premises.</i>

657
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:35,149
Compared to animal brood
parasites,

658
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:40,221
homo-cuculidae developed
a unique evolutionary trait.

659
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:44,724
<i>Instead of leaving</i>
<i>their offspring</i>
<i>in the care of a host,</i>

660
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:49,063
<i>homo-cuculidae returns</i>
<i>to claim their young.</i>

661
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,365
Contact with the biological
mother

662
01:13:51,465 --> 01:13:55,102
speeds up the process
of the offspring's physical
development

663
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:58,806
<i>and its abilities</i>
<i>significantly.</i>

664
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:07,548
We are about to initiate
the first close-distance
encounter

665
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:09,950
with the biological mother.

666
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:31,771
Brood parasites.

667
01:14:34,408 --> 01:14:36,243
<i>They don't impregnate.</i>

668
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,979
They implant eggs.

669
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:44,285
My wife and I tried
to get pregnant.

670
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:50,424
I was supposed to fertilize
that egg.

671
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,862
Like your father...

672
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,598
<i>on his honeymoon.</i>

673
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:01,869
<i>And then what do they do?</i>

674
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,539
Release them into the wild.

675
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,311
When the mother shows up...

676
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:12,546
I end this experiment.

677
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:16,483
What about my sister?

678
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:22,189
That is not your sister.

679
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:25,225
Two.

680
01:15:25,392 --> 01:15:27,528
<i>Yeah, the sister</i>
<i>of the young one</i>

681
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:29,863
and a rogue police detective.

682
01:15:30,397 --> 01:15:34,368
<i>Yeah, I am afraid we must</i>
<i>commence definitive measures</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

683
01:15:34,935 --> 01:15:36,203
<i>She's dead.</i>

684
01:15:37,404 --> 01:15:39,440
The feather
I wrote my name with.

685
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:42,943
<i>The plumage</i>
<i>of the apportioners.</i>

686
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:05,599
Yeah.

687
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:34,328
No! No!

688
01:16:43,303 --> 01:16:45,172
I'm not going to hurt you.

689
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,643
Alma. Alma?

690
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:24,945
Alma, we have to go.

691
01:17:25,112 --> 01:17:27,014
We have to go now.

692
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:56,009
Just stay right here.

693
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:50,130
Cover your ears
and stay close to me.

694
01:19:35,742 --> 01:19:37,277
Alma?

695
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:28,182
She's dead!

696
01:27:28,983 --> 01:27:30,518
Mom is dead!

697
01:27:31,085 --> 01:27:35,555
<i>Where's your machine gun,</i>
<i>my dear?</i>

698
01:27:35,823 --> 01:27:37,992
Is it under your cast, huh?

699
01:27:41,128 --> 01:27:42,096
Why me?

700
01:27:42,196 --> 01:27:44,965
It's not about you,
you little brat.

701
01:27:45,765 --> 01:27:48,436
This is nature.

702
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:50,905
<i>She is supposed</i>
<i>to be focusing...</i>

703
01:27:51,005 --> 01:27:54,607
<i>on reproduction and breeding.</i>

704
01:27:55,009 --> 01:28:01,182
And you are competing
for resources
with her offspring.

705
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:03,951
<i>Our process here ensures</i>

706
01:28:04,051 --> 01:28:06,887
<i>that each new generation</i>
<i>we breed</i>

707
01:28:06,987 --> 01:28:09,789
<i>is more powerful than the last.</i>

708
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:13,327
<i>And my dear,</i>
<i>when I am done with you</i>

709
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:16,297
<i>and reunite Alma with--</i>

710
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,297
Stay away
from her, Alma.

711
01:30:54,722 --> 01:30:55,990
No.

712
01:30:57,291 --> 01:31:00,527
S-She... can't.

713
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:07,835
But she says thank you.

714
01:31:08,768 --> 01:31:10,938
Thank you, Alma.

715
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:44,004
Thank you, Alma.

716
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:53,947
I really need your help.

717
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:08,495
<i>Henry!</i>

718
01:32:08,996 --> 01:32:11,265
<i>You said you'll protect me.</i>

719
01:32:14,568 --> 01:32:16,170
I stand by it.

720
01:32:16,603 --> 01:32:19,506
<i>-Did you ever tell your wife</i>
<i>you'd protect her?</i>

721
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,346
What?

722
01:32:27,147 --> 01:32:31,185
<i>Did you tell her</i>
<i>you'd protect her?</i>

723
01:32:36,323 --> 01:32:37,424
<i>Did you?</i>

724
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:44,098
Yes!

725
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:46,867
<i>-Okay, we are coming out now.</i>

726
01:33:12,526 --> 01:33:13,994
Alma!

727
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:17,297
I need you to come
to me now, my angel.

728
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,335
<i>What are you doing?</i>

729
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:22,703
She's one of them!

730
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:24,772
<i>Alma!</i>

731
01:33:24,873 --> 01:33:26,173
I don't think so.

732
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:27,341
<i>-Come to me.</i>

733
01:33:28,008 --> 01:33:30,110
She will be.

734
01:33:30,377 --> 01:33:32,413
She will become!

735
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:35,549
- I don't think so.
<i>- Alma!</i>

736
01:33:35,716 --> 01:33:37,918
<i>We need to find out</i>
<i>how many there are.</i>

737
01:33:38,018 --> 01:33:41,355
I need to take my sister
away from this place.

738
01:33:42,055 --> 01:33:44,324
-Stop!
-Let her go.

739
01:33:44,658 --> 01:33:47,862
Let her go, she's destined
to become a mother.

740
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:49,696
She is not your sister!

741
01:33:49,797 --> 01:33:51,031
They stopped reproducing before.

742
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:53,400
They will go extinct
without preservation.

743
01:33:53,567 --> 01:33:55,102
Oh, they will go extinct.

744
01:33:55,202 --> 01:33:57,171
<i>-Hundreds of years of research.</i>

745
01:33:57,271 --> 01:33:59,373
<i>This is the will</i>
<i>of the apportioners.</i>

746
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,041
<i>Let her go.</i>

747
01:34:01,575 --> 01:34:03,444
You don't know
what you're doing!
