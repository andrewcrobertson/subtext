Yeah, that's the problem.

166

we could all retire!

167
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,762

168
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:24,899

I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

it's relevant to the modern

my friend.

If you'll come help me

182
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,258
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

183
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:55,666
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

184
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,129
I have my own problems.

185
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,999
What problems?

186
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,495
Internal.

187
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,068
- Internal?
- Yes.

188
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,773
I don't know
how else to put it.

189
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,039
Problems with
what I feel internally.

190
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,942
How can you have
internal problems?

191
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,944
You got your ass all bricked up.

192
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:13,112
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

193
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:17,149
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

194
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,954
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

195
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:23,155
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

196
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,894
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

197
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,028
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

198
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,766
Please don't eat those peas.

199
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,362
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

200
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,969
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

201
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,674
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

202
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:37,741
Where are you going?

203
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,336
Tallahassee, Florida.

204
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,646
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

205
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,307
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

206
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:44,946
Can't she move?

207
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,014
Tallahassee is very nice.

208
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:49,016
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

209
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,545
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

210
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:53,790
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

211
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,023
There's good birding.

212
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,695
Birding?

213
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,422
How have I missed out on this?

214
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,028
It's very pleasant.

215
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,031
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

216
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,132
I've been unhappy,

217
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,365
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

218
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,806
and it's not fair to them.

219
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm only impatient with myself.

220
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,305
Well, we can fix that.

221
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,142
We'll have you running right
in no time.

222
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,177
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

223
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,015
We get our shit together, together.

224
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,786
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

225
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,316
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

226
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,691
Now you can come with me,

227
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,693
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

228
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,354
What's a drive-away?

229
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,696
Free one-way rental.

230
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,698
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

231
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,029
of the drive-away company
wants it,

232
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,130
if they got one going
near your destination.

233
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,836
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

234
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,201
Are you kidding? A birder?

235
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:45,204
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

236
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,174
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

237
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,011
You know how
parents and such love me.

238
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,782
They think I got charisma.

239
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,213
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

240
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,720
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

241
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,787
Isn't she something?"

242
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,217
I'm not sure.

243
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,757
Don't go finding a problem here.

244
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:01,583
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

245
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,091
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

246
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,654
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

247
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,161
SUKIE: <i>Oh, God!</i>

248
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,833
- (sobbing): Take it! Oh, God!
- (power drill whirring)

249
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,066
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

250
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,431
- I don't want it anymore.
- (dog barking)

251
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,433
(hushed): You said
she wouldn't be here.

252
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,876
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

253
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,405
That was a gift.

254
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:22,978
I wanted you to have it.

255
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:27,543
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

256
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,919
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

257
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,481
No, no, no, no.

258
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,252
And take Alice, too.

259
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:34,924
I never liked her.

260
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,618
And she won't stop barking!

261
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,060
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

262
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,556
Remember, you kicked me out?

263
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:41,689
(continues sobbing)

264
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,593
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

265
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,738
It's your dildo,
Susanne.

266
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,631
(Alice barks, growls)

267
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,138
Curlie's Drive-Away,

268
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,206
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

269
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,570
Curlie speaking.

270
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,912
MAN (on phone): <i>Okay,
it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

271
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,639
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

272
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,509
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

273
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,710
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>- To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

274
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,788
Right.
<i>- Tallahassee.</i>

275
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,954
Sure.
<i>- You got it?</i>

276
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,582
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

277
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,892
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

278
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,685
By tomorrow.
<i>- No later.</i>

279
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,192
Uh-huh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

280
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,293
Okay.
<i>- Over and out.</i>

281
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:18,198
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

282
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,267
$250 deposit and a reference.

283
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,664
A reference?

284
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,501
Somebody local
I can break his balls

285
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,701
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

286
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,406
His balls.

287
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,244
Can the reference
be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

288
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,444
No kidding.

289
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,117
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

290
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,087
Tallahassee?

291
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,386
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

292
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,058
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

293
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,191
I think Curlie here...

294
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,929
Don't call me Curlie.

295
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,866
Isn't your name Curlie?

296
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,032
My name is Curlie.

297
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,836
We just met. It's too familiar.

298
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,904
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

299
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,202
No, I got good sense.

300
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,974
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

301
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,504
Okay. Is that a good car?

302
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,077
Not really.

303
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,707
You sell those shirts?

304
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,742
JAMIE: There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

305
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,711
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

306
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:11,922
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

307
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,781
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

308
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,991
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

309
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:16,289
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

310
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,455
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

311
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,720
Down and across.

312
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,227
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

313
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,789
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

314
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,527
MARIAN:
Direct route, down and across.

315
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:26,200
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

316
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,005
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

317
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,370
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

318
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,878
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

319
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,308
The interstate is not life.

320
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,244
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

321
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,180
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

322
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,544
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

323
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,546
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

324
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,020
He said it was a rush job.

325
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,153
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

326
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,517
Tomorrow can wait a day.

327
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,024
We could even go to Miami.

328
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,289
Bikinis and high heels.

329
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,357
(engine revs, tires squeal)

330
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:53,029
A medical doctor?

331
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,624
Or a reverend?

332
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,793
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

333
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,971
No, not for medical doctors, either.

334
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,665
Make up your mind--
which are you?

335
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,470
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

336
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,913
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

337
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,278
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

338
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,919
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

339
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,483
Well, we're here.

340
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,024
Okay. Who are you?

341
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,654
- The car.
- The car?

342
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,326
The Dodge Aries.

343
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,592
The Dodge Aries?

344
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:29,934
What are you, a mynah bird?

345
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm Curlie.

346
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,970
I understand that.

347
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,631
You're not the Dodge.

348
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,701
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

349
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,604
♪ ♪

350
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:45,015
(doors open and close)

351
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,578
(engine starts, tires squeal)

352
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,713
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

353
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,254
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

354
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,488
And once we get to Tallahassee,
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

355
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,688
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

356
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,327
- soap and water.
- It won't.

357
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,296
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

358
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,760
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

359
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,828
Marian, it's art.

360
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:08,170
Stop saying it's art.

361
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,831
That doesn't end all discussion.

362
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,041
We're gonna be driving through

363
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,109
some conservative towns--
the South.

364
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,902
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

365
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,871
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

366
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,642
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

367
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,908
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

368
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,350
That's "Peck-us,"
honey darling.

369
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,957
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

370
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,189
My project.

371
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,224
What's your project?

372
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,931
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

373
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,329
How long's it been?

374
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,102
Weeks?

375
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,303
Months?

376
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:44,569
Oh, my God, Marian.

377
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,934
Don't tell me it's been years.

378
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,870
H-How many years? Who was it?

379
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,213
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

380
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,808
Donna.

381
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,315
Yeah, Donna.

382
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,056
Oh, my God.

383
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,718
Oh, my God. Donna?

384
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,886
(sighs)
She work for Al Gore now?

385
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,261
Nader.

386
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,593
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

387
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,332
CURLIE:
Wait a minute.

388
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,270
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

389
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,933
Yes, I did.

390
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,277
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

391
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,773
and then these broads come in

392
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,248
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

393
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,283
You gave them the car.

394
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,087
You don't know who they were?

395
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,781
CURLIE:
I told you their names.

396
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,222
Their names, yes, but...

397
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,059
This place is a dump.

398
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,160
They drive the car
instead of you.

399
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,326
Is that bad?

400
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,888
Bad if they find the goods.

401
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,363
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

402
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,958
CURLIE:
I like clutter.

403
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,300
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

404
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,532
Sterile doesn't work for me.

405
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:48,204
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

406
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,766
- Dick-yank?
- CHIEF: Flint.

407
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:50,998
I'm a dick-yank?

408
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,406
Don't antagonize.

409
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,001
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

410
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,937
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

411
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:57,543
And you would?

412
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,908
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

413
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,580
(footsteps approaching)

414
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,779
Not per se.

415
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,253
"Per se"?!

416
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,717
They left a local number.

417
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,852
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

418
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,623
Someone whose balls I can break.

419
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,130
(grunts)

420
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,858
(groaning)

421
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,036
Now you've gone and done it.

422
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,073
(grunting)

423
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:26,000
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,805
- (thumping)
- (grunting and groaning)

425
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,511
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

426
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,283
Tomorrow.

427
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:36,549
(grunting and groaning continue)

428
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,189
(sighs) This is great.

429
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,554
This is so slutty.
I love this.

430
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,260
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

431
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,163
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

432
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,362
The Butter Churn awaits.

433
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,759
Jamie,
I think I'd prefer to...

434
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,728
No. No, don't even.

435
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:51,993
You come with me.

436
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,764
I'll show you how this is done.

437
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,901
(chatter in foreign language,
audience laughter over TV)

438
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,574
(door opens, closes)

439
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,709
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

440
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,315
It's a dyke bar.

441
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,549
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

442
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,486
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

443
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,488
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

444
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:17,623
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

445
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,626
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

446
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,302
Hello?

447
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:29,635
(engine idling)

448
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:31,835
- (engine shuts off)
- (muffled music playing inside)

449
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,507
JAMIE: Confidence.

450
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,070
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

451
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,446
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

452
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,415
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

453
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,153
Jamie, I have done this before.

454
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,748
It's just like this.

455
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,255
One message.

456
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,818
You dig the female body.

457
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,160
Your body.

458
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,195
You're like this.

459
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,989
Not like this.

460
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,058
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

461
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,125
I have done this before.

462
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,533
I am not a schoolmarm.

463
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,095
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

464
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,031
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

465
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:04,736
Three years.

466
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,574
(hushed):
And four months and 14 days.

467
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:09,609

Fine?

478
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,664
Like, "You'll do"?

479
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,534
"Please, please

"You seem totally okay.

Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

482
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,341
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

483
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:39,705
I said they all looked fine.

484
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,477
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

485
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,315
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

486
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,218
Why are you jousting with me?

487
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,616
I'm not jousting.

488
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:50,848
I'm asking which of these women

489
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,586
you want to throw up
against the wall

490
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,148
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

491
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,392
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

492
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,262
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

493
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,758
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

494
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:02,024
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

495
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,190
They sense it,

496
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,532
whether you want to fuck them

497
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,995
or you think they're just fine.

498
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,469
I have to be me.

499
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,504
It has to be done
with authenticity.

500
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,506
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

501
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,201
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

502
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,708
You don't know
what our life was like.

503
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,446
You know nothing
about its worth.

504
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,876
Then why didn't
the two of you move

505
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,878
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

506
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,044
That didn't happen.

507
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,145
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

508
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,487
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

509
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,884
No, I'm not.

510
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:28,820
This is not me.

511
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,953
You're right.
I can't do this.

No, Marian.

00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,728
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

You can do this.

515
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,270
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

516
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,568
Your best self.

517
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:41,833
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

518
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,538
but this really isn't
right for me.

519
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,475

00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:41,148
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

1059
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:42,710
(chuckles) Jamie, that is about

1060
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,416
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

1061
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,418
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

1062
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:48,991
I guarantee you someone's there.

1063
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:51,587
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

1064
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:54,029
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

1065
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,855
I'll take Alice.

1066
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,461
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

1067
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,694
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

1068
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:02,466
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

1069
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,568
CHIEF (over phone):
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

1070
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,603
Wetumpka, Alabama.

1071
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:09,242
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

1072
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:10,507
They hadn't been there,

1073
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:13,939
but a very personable
music lover

1074
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,611
told us of another juke joint

1075
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,514
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

1076
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:18,713
Stop!

1077
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:20,484
Called Ike's.

1078
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:23,355
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

1079
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,093
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

1080
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:27,260
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

1081
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,130
I think the soccer team
was just confused

1082
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,132
about which joint
these girls were going to,

1083
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:32,694
so we're gonna drive...

1084
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:35,400
Stop saying words.

1085
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,073
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

1086
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,635
They arrived in Tallahassee

1087
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:43,177
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

1088
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:45,377
Tallahassee.

1089
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,016
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

1090
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,117
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

1091
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:50,613
Not a juke joint.

1092
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,252
You should arrive
by early morning.

1093
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,385
I'll meet you there.

1094
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:55,651
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

1095
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:57,620
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

1096
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,556
We have not slept
since the night before last,

1097
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,657
- and we...
- (click, dial tone)

1098
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:03,263
Hello?

1099
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:06,695
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

1100
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:09,170
DESK CLERK:
Certainly.

1101
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,106
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

1102
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:12,536
or right here at the hotel,

1103
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:15,077
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

1104
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,705
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

1105
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:19,741
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

1106
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,183
Maybe we should stay here.

1107
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,712
Replenish the ice.

1108
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,222
(piano playing
"Fly Me to the Moon")

1109
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,323
This is great, but how...

1110
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:32,721
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

1111
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,395
(softly):
Rainbow.

1112
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:37,528
Yes.

1113
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:39,992
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

1114
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:41,730
Like, a really, really good one?

1115
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,797
WAITER: Of course.

1116
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,834
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

1117
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,440
Theoretically.

1118
00:50:50,576 --> 00:50:52,345
(Jamie sighs)

1119
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,120
So...

1120
00:51:00,014 --> 00:51:03,158
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1121
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:08,020
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

1122
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,727
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

1123
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,631
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1124
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:17,634
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1125
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,570
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1126
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,408
but I usually have stuff to do.

1127
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,213
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1128
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,743
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1129
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,286
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1130
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,288
- (cork pops)
- Something I decided

1131
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,784
last night
while I was lying in bed

1132
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:38,787
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1133
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:43,055
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1134
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:44,529
Especially since, with you,

1135
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,564
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1136
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:47,632
Am I right?

1137
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:51,140
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1138
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,209
- Thank you.
- WAITER: My pleasure. Madame?

1139
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:55,738
Yes, please.

1140
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,938
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1141
00:51:57,938 --> 00:51:59,544
I mean, we're good friends,

1142
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:01,546
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1143
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:02,976
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1144
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:06,584
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1145
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,554
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1146
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:11,754
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1147
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,723
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1148
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:16,330
She was always saying
that this or that

1149
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,200
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1150
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,466
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1151
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,403
the sex was great.

1152
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:25,273
Ladies, have we decided?

1153
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,673
Don't rush us, buddy.

1154
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:33,710
First, we'll dance.

1155
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,318
("You Belong to Me"
by Diana Krall playing)

1156
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:48,527
Maybe I do overthink things.

1157
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,530
Yeah.

1158
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:55,534

I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1161

Ah, you know Debbie.

1162
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,139
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1163

on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1164
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:11,880

01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,992
Oh, my God.

1233
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:35,323
Marian.

1234
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,227
CHAUFFEUR: Sir?

1235
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:39,833
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1236
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,836
Tallahassee, sir.

1237
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,597
- Where to, exactly?
- (sighs)

1238
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:47,808
Yes, um...

1239
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:49,744
The track.

1240
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,812
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1241
01:00:51,812 --> 01:00:53,605
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1242
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:55,079
JAMIE:
Oh, come on now.

1243
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,917
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1244
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,853
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1245
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:02,152
No. I like this one.

1246
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:05,727
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1247
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:07,553
Last night was beautiful,

1248
01:01:07,553 --> 01:01:09,225
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1249
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:10,831
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1250
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:12,657
- Okay! -All right!
- (Jamie and Marian screaming)

1251
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:15,066
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1252
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:17,002
We're here for two things.

1253
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:18,333
- (screaming continues)
- (grunts)

1254
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,137
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1255
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,842
- Screw you!
- (screaming)

1256
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,668
We're here for two items.

1257
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:25,076
Whoa. She's naked.

1258
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:27,474
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1259
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:28,849
We're here for two items.

1260
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,983
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1261
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,084
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1262
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:34,888
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1263
01:01:34,888 --> 01:01:36,956
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1264
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,991
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1265
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,620
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1266
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,864
Let's get this show on the road.

1267
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,558
(screaming continues)

1268
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:47,802
Yeah, baby.

1269
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:55,040
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1270
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:58,846
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1271
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:02,344
Whoa.

1272
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,753
This is so groovy.

1273
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,756
Now I can love you forever.

1274
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,384
Whoa.

1275
01:02:09,384 --> 01:02:10,792
And ever

1276
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:15,357
and ever and ever

1277
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:20,494
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1278
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:24,971
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1279
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:29,074
BOTH: Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1280
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:33,705
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1281
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:38,017
(echoing): Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1282
01:02:38,017 --> 01:02:41,746
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1283
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:45,420
Never to wilt...

1284
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,751
(bell rings)

1285
01:02:46,751 --> 01:02:49,226
(snarling)

1286
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:50,964
Took 'em straight here.

1287
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:52,130
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1288
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,132
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1289
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,434
This is all they had?

1290
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,172
What's all they had?

1291
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:06,848
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1292
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,883
GOON:
What are you talking about?

1293
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:11,116
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1294
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:13,613
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1295
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:15,285
Come on, girls.

1296
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:16,990
Where's the last phallus?

1297
01:03:17,817 --> 01:03:20,191
(muffled chattering)

1298
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,490
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1299
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,459
I-I...

1300
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,098
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1301
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,001
What have you done, jerk-off?

1302
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,871
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1303
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,334
They gave you the combination,

1304
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:33,336
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1305
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:35,041
- FLINT: I never slip up.
- GOON: Right, left,

1306
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,845
- past the first number.
- (yells)

1307
01:03:37,672 --> 01:03:39,914
(snarling)

1308
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,224
The senator is a good man.

1309
01:03:54,095 --> 01:03:56,997
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1310
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,361
Many of us did.

1311
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:00,869
- It was a different time.
- (muffled muttering)

1312
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:03,938
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1313
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:06,468
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1314
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:13,915
Housekeeping.

1315
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:15,840
(snarling)

1316
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,185
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1317
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:23,221
...thing.

1318
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:28,523
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1319
01:04:28,523 --> 01:04:30,063
(beeping)

1320
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:33,660
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1321
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,905
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1322
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:39,534
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1323
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,834
He was just a kid.

1324
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:46,145
(humming an upbeat tune)

1325
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:50,149
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1326
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:52,283
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1327
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:55,187
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1328
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,586
(hushed):
You saw him, sort of.

1329
01:05:02,856 --> 01:05:05,098
(continues humming)

1330
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:08,563
(stops humming)

1331
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:13,502
(housekeeper screaming)

1332
01:05:13,502 --> 01:05:16,802
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1333
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:19,442
Think of it: eBay,

1334
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,743
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1335
01:05:23,743 --> 01:05:26,218
Comments, reviews.

1336
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,616
Think of what
it would do to him.

1337
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:32,994
His children, his family,
his career.

1338
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,260
(gasps)

1339
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:39,198
- (goons yelling in distance)
- We're not unreasonable.

1340
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,969
We'll gladly pay for it.

1341
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:42,927
We just...

1342
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:44,896
Will you please shut up!

1343
01:05:44,896 --> 01:05:46,106
That wasn't my idea!

1344
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:47,734
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1345
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:48,801
I was experimenting.

1346
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:50,077
But you liked it.

1347
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,375
- FLINT: No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1348
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,113
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1349
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,543
Drunk on cock.

1350
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:56,347
- FLINT: No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1351
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,019
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1352
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,911
- To understand life.
- No!

1353
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,518
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1354
01:06:02,518 --> 01:06:03,783
(groaning)

1355
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:05,092
(screaming)

1356
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:08,029
CHIEF: God, man,
what are you doing?!

1357
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:10,196
- (both screaming)
- (Flint yelling)

1358
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,200
(Marian and Jamie whimpering)

1359
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:27,345
(Marian and Jamie
whimpering loudly)

1360
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:33,087
(gun clicks)

1361
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,520
(clicking)

1362
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:42,525
Mommy.

1363
01:06:44,727 --> 01:06:46,760
(crying)

1364
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:55,934
(door opens, closes)

1365
01:06:55,934 --> 01:06:58,475
(dogs barking, yelping
in distance)

1366
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:02,644
(dogs barking in distance)

1367
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,186
MARIAN: All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1368
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:07,682
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1369
01:07:07,682 --> 01:07:08,947
Then we switch hotels.

1370
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:11,059
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1371
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:12,489
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1372
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,887
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1373
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,131
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1374
01:07:22,468 --> 01:07:24,303
(barking)

1375
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,470
WOMAN:
Next customer, please.

1376
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:29,275
SUKIE: Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1377
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:31,002
Don't ask me why.

1378
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:33,807
(line ringing)

1379
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:35,578
MAN (over phone):
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1380
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:37,415
JAMIE:
I need to speak to the senator.

1381
01:07:37,415 --> 01:07:40,946
MAN: <i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1382
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:43,355
Someone who has his...

1383
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,062
...personal effects.

1384
01:08:00,737 --> 01:08:03,177
- (airplane engine whirring)
- (barking)

1385
01:08:17,985 --> 01:08:20,491
- (line clicks)
- GARY (over phone): <i>Who is this?</i>

1386
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:21,822
Senator?

1387
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,297
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1388
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:27,168
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1389
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:30,765
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1390
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,404
Everybody's things.

1391
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:35,176
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1392
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,178
If you're not alone,

1393
01:08:37,178 --> 01:08:39,213
believe me, I'll know it.

(Alice barking)

1395
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,455
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1396
01:08:50,455 --> 01:08:52,050
made a phone call
from here last night.

1397
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,326
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1398
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,824
Well, this is for her.

1399
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,265
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1400
01:08:58,265 --> 01:08:59,530
You've missed them.

1401
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:02,269
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1402
01:09:16,747 --> 01:09:18,780
♪ ♪

1403
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,851
JAMIE: Done.

1404
01:09:25,855 --> 01:09:26,887
With what?

1405
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:29,230
Tell you later.
