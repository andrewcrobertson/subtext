[SOUND]

2
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,997
I am no god of the
void, slicer of worlds.

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,085
Long ago, when light invaded my kingdom,

4
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,967
my symbiote children
betrayed me and imprisoned me here.

5
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,308
At last a codex is being created.

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,228
It is the key to my freedom.

7
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,606
It will unlock this prison.

8
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:54,656
I order you to search the corners
of the universe until you find this key.

9
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,201
Find me the codex.

10
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,963
And when I escape and
annihilate every living planet and

11
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:17,971
destroy my symbiote
offspring, I will reward you with your lives.

12
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,844
So you're saying in this
universe there's the superhero people.

13
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:05,268
Hi, so tell me again about your
purple alien friend who really loves stones.

14
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:11,858
I'll tell you what, man,
aliens, they do not love stones.

15
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,526
They don't start.

16
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,320
Do not love stones.

17
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,572
Do you know what they love?

18
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,869
They love eating brains
because that's what they do.

19
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,999
Señor, he made my
family disappear for five years.

20
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,169
Five years.

21
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,757
See, that is a long time.

22
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,009
All right.

23
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,304
We are drunk.

24
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,973
[SOUND]

25
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,152
We're home.

26
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm so done with the multiverse shit
that I like our version of the barman better.

27
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
My head hurts.

28
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,330
I feel like I'm drunk, but
I'm also hungover at the same time.

29
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,167
You want a bloody marina?

30
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:17,382
I don't want to drink.

31
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,009
Why, gross milk.

32
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,388
You are destroying this man's bar.

33
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,314
I'm having a time of my life today.

34
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,026
I'd rather have a glass of water.

35
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,277
Be a man, Eddie.

36
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,739
We should have been a bartender.

37
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,286
Tequila!

38
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,496
I did it.

39
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,747
I did it.

40
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:50,331
Señor?

41
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,377
What the hell were those things?

42
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,838
I was born with them.

43
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,341
Freaking bar, I'm done with this shit.

44
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,889
This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.

45
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:12,687
Police are still trying to locate
former reporter Eddie Brock for questioning after

46
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,648
the tragic death of
Detective Patrick Mulligan.

47
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,274
No.

48
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,652
Detective Mulligan
was found in Pail and that's a

49
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,947
series of bizarre
happenings at the city's cathedral.

50
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,699
They think that I killed him.

51
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,534
How long can he evade authorities?

52
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,327
Only time will tell.

53
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:33,291
If we are on the news
here, we are on the news everywhere.

54
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,254
We can't go back to San
Francisco and I'm not staying down

55
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,049
here hiding for the rest of
my life in Mexico, that's for sure.

56
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,675
Where will we go?

57
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,093
I don't know. I don't know.

58
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,726
That could work.

59
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,271
This church got me
kicked out of New York.

60
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,230
What a dick.

61
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,357
I still got a ton of shit on him too.

62
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,652
I've always wanted to
see the Statue of Liberty.

63
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,822
Maybe we could blackmail him.

64
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,699
Clear my name.

65
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,576
Let's go.

66
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,036
Road trip.

67
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,788
Let's get the hell out of here.

68
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,165
Take the change.

69
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:22,340
We keep our heads
down and we keep moving.

70
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,678
We are shooting him.

71
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,264
We are on the run.

72
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,558
Yes, we are in the shit.

73
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:37,647
Yes, but I will eat
every bad guy that gets in our way.

74
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,815
I need a title.

75
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,329
You did that?

76
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,129
Yes.

77
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,595
Someone's in trouble
and I need fuel for the road.

78
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,346
Yeah, okay.

79
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:33,327
That way.

80
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:50,011
Batman, Eddie, are we
the lethal protector or not?

81
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,308
Do you think?

82
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,601
It's a busy.

83
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:14,702
Jesus.

84
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,125
Cute.

85
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,880
I promised not to eat it.

86
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,674
They're fighting dogs.

87
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,011
I draw the line at fighting dogs, pal.

88
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,225
Just a few.

89
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:40,102
Oh, yo, what?

90
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,479
You're in the wrong place.

91
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,023
Oh, hello.

92
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,399
This is our territory.

93
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,322
Well, I assume by the
threatening look on your faces that I, uh...

94
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,491
I ought to be scared, right?

95
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,912
We should take the wrong path, Batman.

96
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,289
We can let you leave.

97
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,708
I have a headache.

98
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,963
On account of the
fact that I was drinking a lot.

99
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,381
I'm going to be honest.

100
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,927
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

101
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,637
We all have monsters inside us.

102
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,097
Not like this.

103
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:23,437
So dark that it is highly likely to
tear your head off and feed it to your asshole.

104
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,815
I'm here. You can feed it to me.

105
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,024
Yeah, I can feed it to him.

106
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,069
All right, look.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.

107
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:30,945
I got a suggestion.

108
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:31,904
No, stop speaking.

109
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,115
I'm not going to stop
speaking. This is for you.

110
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,367
I'm doing this for
your benefit, all right?

111
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,410
I don't have to.

112
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,828
Okay? Just pay attention.

113
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
We're going to find
all of these dogs loving

114
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,124
forever homes, because
what you're doing is reprehensible.

115
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,334
And what does your
mother think of you, man?

116
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,129
My mother's dead, Colero.

117
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,380
You made it awkward.

118
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,674
I'm sorry to hear that.

119
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,091
Great.

120
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:53,426
Huh?

121
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,344
Part of the matter.

122
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,014
Huh?

123
00:09:59,390 --> 00:09:59,807
Thank you.

124
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,892
I'm giving you a chance.

125
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,439
Sweetie, I'm really, I'm giving
you a chance. You should probably take it.

126
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:08,316
See?

127
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:09,608
See.

128
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:11,944
Okay.

129
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,196
See when.

130
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:14,989
When?

131
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,034
Whoa.

132
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,703
Call the line.

133
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,001
Hola, bitches.

134
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:54,403
Who's a bad boy?

135
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:03,371
I'll get some sturdy footwear.

136
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,124
You going?

137
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,262
What?

138
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,057
Are you?

139
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,977
We are.

140
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,520
We are.

141
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,731
We are.

142
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:31,524
No.

143
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,776
Yeah, we.

144
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,486
We are.

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,529
Venom.

146
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:38,739
What?

147
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,535
We're totally going
to need to work on that.

148
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,327
Come on.

149
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,621
Come on.

150
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,587
Mmm, that was delicious.

151
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,713
You're welcome.

152
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,757
Thank you.

153
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,969
You take me to all the finest places.

154
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,846
Let's get the hell out of here.

155
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,222
Where's my shoe?

156
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,474
Oh, hey, buddy.

157
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,642
There's my shoe.

158
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,560
There's my shoe.

159
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,102
There's my shoe.

160
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,570
These will fit.

161
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,199
Now we are on the run
for something we actually did do.

162
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,326
And I got stuck with
the superhero who can't fly.

163
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:53,314
One a bit. There you are.

164
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,526
Get me General Strickland.

165
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:18,672
What the...

166
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,098
Viral shedding.

167
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,894
These things want to live.

168
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,316
Hola.

169
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:38,317
Hola.

170
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,321
Tell me about the man who was just here.

171
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:50,746
He was acting like
crazy talking to himself.

172
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:52,706
What was he saying?

173
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,334
He had these big, massive, wide arms.

174
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:21,610
They were bubbling like
this. Bring him. [MUSIC PLAYING]

175

You think they're another
brother and sister on one of those stars?

176
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,076
Looking at the same sky?

177
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,829
I'll be able to tell you one day.

178
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,792
My twin brother.

179
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,919
A future NASA scientist.

180
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,088
One day.

181
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,344
When thunder roars, head indoors.

Get him to emergency symbiosis now.

369
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,322
Asses.

370
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,158
[Laughing]

371
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:49,417
Kicked up some gravel there.

372
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,418
In tight, family.

373
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,252
You good?

374
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,504
That was wild.

375
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,297
Did the dog vomit?

376
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:54,923
Yeah.

377
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:08,478
Okay.

378
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,522
We've got this.

379
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:11,898
Soft landing.

380
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,066
Bend your knees.

381
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,317
Engage your core.

382
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,276
Engage your core.

383
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,612
Yes, yes, that's it.

384
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,322
Yes, that's it.

385
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,450
Whoa.

386
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,284
Well done.

387
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,245
That was terrifying.

388
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,832
This is not New York.

389
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,708
No, this is a wasteland.

390
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,877
I'm detecting passive aggression.

391
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:33,545
Are you?

392
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:33,920
Yeah.

393
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,587
Oh, I'm sorry.

394
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,922
How about some active aggression?

395
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,468
You just threw me
off a 757 without even the

396
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,721
slightest
consideration from my chronic vertical.

397
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,390
It was an Airbus A320.

398
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,307
Was it?

399
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:46,933
I am sorry.

400
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:47,976
Hooray.

401
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,520
And what was that thing?

402
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,398
That thing that we
just juiced back there.

403
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,816
Well, that's going to be like this.

404
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,609
No, I can absolutely guarantee that.

405
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,026
I'm not gonna.

406
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,780
What are you doing?

407
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,489
Why are you doing that?

408
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,699
That's a pretty weird.

409
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:02,991
That's creepy.

410
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,325
That was a xenophage.

411
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:05,577
What?

412
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,454
A xenophage.

413
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,581
A symbiote cantella.

414
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,039
Of course.

415
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,711
Problem is, if she has found
her way here, others will soon follow.

416
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,170
Others?

417
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,215
The xenophage's
maker also created a symbiote.

418
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,592
So that's your sister.

419
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,802
Oh, the symbiote's turned on him.

420
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
Locked him up on Kinta.

421
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,430
Your planet.

422
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,973
No, not your planet.

423
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,432
Not your planet.

424
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,726
The prison we built for him to sleep.

425
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,059
Of course.

426
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:30,727
Fraternity.

427
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,313
What's his name then?

428
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,649
I didn't hear what he said.

429
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:37,817
No!

430
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:38,693
No!

431
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,949
This is serious, Eddie.

432
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,284
This is not talk.

433
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:48,953
Quiet.

434
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,627
What is this, Isilom?

435
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,713
This zen thingy, the
symbiote hundred want with you anyway.

436
00:29:59,422 --> 00:29:59,839
It doesn't?

437
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:00,924
It wants us.

438
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,509
We have something indeed.

439
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,343
We only have this shitty shit.

440
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,970
You got one vote.

441
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,138
Someone.

442
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,556
The codex.

443
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,099
What now?

444
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:11,518
I'll show you.

445
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:12,685
Damn it!

446
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,230
What are you doing?

447
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,106
Let's say you died.

448
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,025
I could bring you back to life.

449
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,817
Well, I like that.

450
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,904
But if I did, our separate life forces

451
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:27,659
would become one
single force called a codex.

452
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,327
What the hell is a codex?

453
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,620
It's a key.

454
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,956
A key that unlocks a cage.

455
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,667
The prison on Klyntar.

456
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,377
It would free our creator.

457
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,462
Well, thank God we haven't died.

458
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,089
Yeah, except that one time.

459
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,676
Oh no.

460
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:45,760
No.

461
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,513
So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing?

462
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,390
That's why this enophage is hunting us.

463
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,350
What do we do?

464
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,354
She can only see the codex when
a symbiote is in its full true form.

465
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,275
Right.

466
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,318
You mean you can't come out.

467
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,736
I can do this.

468
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,029
I can do this.

469
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:10,159
But if I fully transform, the
codex sends her a tracking signal.

470
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,206
She'll find us, rip it out of
our spine, and free Nal from Klyntar.

471
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708
So how do we get rid of this codex?

472
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,878
As long as you and I
both live, the codex exists.

473
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,799
If one of us should
die, the codex will die.

474
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,967
That's not gonna work for me.

475
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,342
Or me.

476
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,303
That enophage was fast.

477
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,556
It will take long
for the feds to tie us to

478
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,017
those four headless
bodies we left in Mexico.

479
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,518
We gotta get outta here.

480
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,561
Yeah, we better go.

481
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,943
Four legs are better than one.

482
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,486
Be honest with me, buddy.

483
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,618
How fast do you think you can
get that thing to go without killing it?

484
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,952
Only one way to find out.

485
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,121
Shh, shh. Don't scare him.

486
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,332
Don't scare her. She was yours.

487
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,586
Nice horse, he.

488
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,755
Nice horse, he.

489
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,550
Surprise, horse, he!

490
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,345
I love horse, he!

491
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,907
Ride me cowboy!

492
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,700
You are an asshole!

493
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,244
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

494
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,330
I'm gonna kick
your ass, you motherfucker!

495
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,048
Now, that's horse power!

496
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,481
Safe Haven?

497
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,651
No. They're not here for a safe haven.

498
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,862
How about a new home
to make the current tenants?

499
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,157
I think you've watched too
many alien invasion movies, Rex.

500
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,828
Have I?

501
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,837
They were running. That's what he said.

502
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:26,295
Don't kid yourself.

503
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,798
They were always migrating.

504
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:34,637
A meteor carrying symbiote life,
crashes on Earth, and they all survive.

505
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,014
Coincidence? Give me a break.

506
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:39,559
Alright.

507
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,603
Let's go get them.

508
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,400
You're so desperate to believe
that they're here for altruistic reasons.

509
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,319
Makes you dangerous.

510
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,662
[tense music]

511
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,750
We just intercepted an
emergency call from an airbus out

512
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,419
of Mexico, saying a man
jumped off the plane over Sequoia.

513
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,629
We'll take the osmore.

514
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,840
Eyes wide, Payne.

Now...

520
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,315
That was horrible.

There's something
else out here. Something else?

He said this would
happen. I just lost three people.

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,334
Can you collect any samples?

Those were some special forces shit.

They were trying to
kill us. Yeah. Yeah, great.

613
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,993
Great. So now we have the cops.

614
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:55,499
The United States Army and
some creature from hell hunting us.

615
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,713
Oh, God, I just saw blood in a
spray out of the back of an alien's face.

616
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,724
They killed someone.

617
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,893
They didn't give you a choice.

618
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,314
You didn't give me a
choice. I couldn't get to you.

619
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,984
It's a year ago when you stole my life.

620
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,944
We've been together for a whole year.

621
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,490
A year too long. Just stay hidden
while we get to New York without getting killed.

The thing you
talked about, the creature...

626
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:48,928
It's here.

627
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,307
It killed some people.

What does he seek?

641
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,302
The Black One.

642
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,179
The Black One?

643
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:14,805
Voxymbia?

644
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,558
He's the only one who carries a Codex.

645
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,520
The end...

646
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:23,856
is now.

648
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,115
You need your suit.

649
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,285
Still worried about
giving this thing a cold?

650
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,331
Venom carries the key to Nolce's freedom.

651
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,083
Never obtain it.

652
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,668
Or your race will be killed.

653
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:46,879
You...

654
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,882
and you...

655
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,051
and...

656
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:53,844
you...

657
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,350
everyone, everything.

658
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,144
How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?

659
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,771
You can't.

660
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,732
He's older than the universe.

661
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,318
He means the key.

662
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,990
Then everything will end.

663
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,454
How do we stop him from getting it?

664
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,792
If the symbiote and the host are alive,

665
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,712
then the Codex is alive.

666
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,341
And if one of them dies?

667
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,301
The Codex dies?

668
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,303
The Codex dies.

669
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,429
The Codex dies.

670
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,391
Rex, you can't be serious.

671
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:40,849
Oh, I'm game.

672
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,561
Destroying the Codex is the
only way it remains unobtainable.

673
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,271
Right?

674
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,274
Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.

675
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,941
Destroying it?

676
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,610
We have barely
even scratched the surface.

677
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,444
My people are dead.

678
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,116
Something is
coming that cannot be beaten.

679
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,202
I'm stopping all this shit right now.

680
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,203
Science is sacrifice.

681
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:01,620
Teddy.

682
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,333
Is serious. Listen to her.

683
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,200
[door opens]

684
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:53,922
Have you spoken to your family recently?

685
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,885
Is everything okay?

686
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,057
Yeah.

687
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,313
I smell wet dog and sauce emerges.

688
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,441
Hey, friendo. You okay there?

689
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:19,073
No, I'm not okay.
It's pretty wild out there.

690
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,992
I know. You hungry?

691
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:23,369
Yes.

692
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:24,870
Come over.

693
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:26,914
Thank you.

694
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,291
Well, this is my wife, Nova Moon.

695
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,125
Hi.

696
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,670
And these are my kids, Echo and Leaf.

697
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,963
A lifetime in therapy.

698
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:35,839
Don't.

699
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,842
Don't you dare.

700
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,678
Wow, how beautiful are your children?

701
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,223
And that's Blue.

702
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,434
Who is a dog?

703
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,144
And I'm Martin.

704
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,187
Hey, Martin.

705
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:50,771
Hey.

706
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,564
I'm Eddie.

707
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,524
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

708
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,274
You too. Pleasure.

709
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,317
Come sit, please.

710
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,402
Okay.

711
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,444
Come on, thank you.

712
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,114
Jesus Christ.

713
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,158
So, right.

714
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,996
Oh, so nothing died
on that plate namaste, man?

715
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,705
Thank you.

716
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:09,998
Help, Tash!

717
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,251
Oh, dear.

718
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,378
Eddie, where are you headed?

719
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:15,754
New York.

720
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:16,630
Oh, wow.

721
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:17,714
Yeah, all right.

722
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,801
Long way to New
York. We're naked shrimps, man.

723
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,219
Yeah.

724
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,804
We could ride you out to Vegas.

725
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:25,556
Yeah.

726
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,891
These people are weird. I'm telling you.

727
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,893
That would be so kind. Thank you.

728
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,310
You're welcome.

729
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,312
Of course. Life's one big adventure.

730
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,480
Who doesn't love making new friends?

731
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,106
Right?

732
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,901
This guy is so one of
those serial killer hitchhikers

733
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,445
from my favorite murder podcast.

734
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,156
Baby, not now.

735
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,658
That was social
services not taking us away yet.

736
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,911
She's joking.

737
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:48,871
I'm not.

738
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,289
Please, honey.

739
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,293
So we're riding the
extraterrestrial highway.

740
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:54,877
Yep.

741
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,627
Watch me. Who is it?

742
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,880
It's the road that leads to Area 51.

743
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:02,509
See if we can spot as an alien before
they shut the place down forever, you know?

744
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,678
It's my lifelong dream.

745
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,430
We can show him right now.

746
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:06,972
Not a believer?

747
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,562
Actually, Martin, how do I put this?

748
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:16,982
I am.

749
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:17,566
Oh.

750
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,903
That's the I am I big, big believer.

751
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,196
You're not that big.

752
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,071
Oh, and you can be enough.

753
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,449
And actually, I was in I.T.

754
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:25,866
Were you?

755
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:26,492
Yeah.

756
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,784
That's so cool.

757
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,243
Thanks.

758
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,289
I hope you don't
get disappointed, you know?

759
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:40,005
And I hope that if you do find
one, I hope you meet a really good alien.

760
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:46,678
Not a bad one.

761
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,055
Yeah.

762
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:48,305
Yeah.

763
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,352
I know a dark
force when I see one, Eddie.

764
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,280
It's kind of hot in here.

765
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,615
You get used to it.

766
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,951
A.C. is really bad
for your health, you know.

767
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:11,328
All right.

768
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:12,538
Family ready?

769
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:13,413
Yep.

770
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:14,957
Guest ready.

771
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,334
Let's rock this camper.

772
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,964
Ground control to Major Tom.

773
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,050
Oh, I love a sing-along.

774
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,220
Ground control to Major Tom.

775
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,389
Shoot me in the face.

776
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,601
Take your protein
pills and put your helmet on.

777
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,102
Oh, yeah.

778
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,937
This is my jam.

779
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:37,729
Nine.

780
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:38,939
Eight.

781
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,482
Seven.

782
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:41,817
Six.

783
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,028
Commencing compound engines on.

784
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,238
Three.

785
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,322
Two.

786
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,074
Check it out.

787
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:49,283
One.

788
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,119
And make God's love be in the rafter.

789
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,497
Come on, Eddie, sing along.

790
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,123
I'm good.

791
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,291
Are you in the world?

792
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,501
No. Just think of this as the tour bus.

793
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,211
We're the band, and
you could be the groupie.

794
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:01,878
Come on.

795
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,088
Don't be square.

796
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,172
Don't get me started.

797
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,718
This is Major Tom's ground control.

798
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,846
I'm stepping through the door.

799
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:17,144
And I'm floating
in the most peculiar way.

800
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:22,065
Care up, and the
stars look very different today.

801
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:23,567
Why?

802
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,572
For he is my city in a tin can.

803
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,948
Can make a tin!

804
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,368
Far above the world.

805
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:34,953
Like a bath, already.

806
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,334
Planet Earth is blue,
and there's nothing I can do.

807
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:42,836
No.

808
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,589
This is ground control to Major Tom.

809
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:50,135
Sometimes I think we would
have been happier with a life like this.

810
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:54,181
And the players want to know, shall we?

811
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,016
Yeah.

812
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,811
Now the signs lead
to cash for a few days.

813
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,022
My love.

814
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,400
This is Major Tom to ground control.

815
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,111
I'm stepping through the door.

816
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:14,326
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way.

817
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,790
And the stars look very different today.

818
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,796
For he is my city in a tin can.

819
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,967
Far above the world.

820
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,790
(crunching)

821
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,209
You like chocolate?

822
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,213
Shh, they don't let us eat sugar.

823
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,007
They don't?

824
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,720
I have a friend who loves chocolate.

825
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:15,971
Thank you.

826
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:17,931
It's very kind of you.

827
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,894
I don't wanna see an onion.

828
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:24,771
You don't?

829
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:27,274
Scary.

830
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:31,528
Okay.

831
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,865
Well, you know, it's okay to be scared.

832
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:37,743
I'm scared.

833
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,746
Like, I go all the time.

834
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,582
Promise I won't see anyone?

835
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:48,837
Buddy.

836
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,634
Aliens are not real, okay?

837
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,052
Promise.

838
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:58,972
Okay.

839
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,982
You said the right thing.

840
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,193
You would make a good dad.

841
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,251
We've come a long way, you and me.

842
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,005
We have many more roads to travel, Buddy.

843
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,590
Wouldn't that be nice?

844
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,424
You say something?

845
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,931
No, just dream in, I guess.

846
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,982
That's the near Rika.

847
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,109
Near Rika?

848
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,069
Yeah.

849
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,905
There's a doorway in our minds

850
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,449
that usually remains hidden in secret

851
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,326
until the time of death.

852
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,914
Crazy things in this world, Eddie.

853
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,793
You can see them if you're open.

854
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:12,963
Oh, I seen them.

855
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,136
I'm glad we didn't eat this fine, family.

856
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:48,790
(upbeat music)

857
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,959
Welcome to the city of Second chances.

858
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:53,253
Whoa.

859
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,508
(upbeat music)

860
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,145
Thank you.

861
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:10,520
Thank you.

862
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:11,563
Here, buddy.

863
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,606
Thank you.

864
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,732
Stay blue, stay.

865
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:14,274
Thank you.

866
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,191
Okay, blue.

867
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:15,817
Vegas.

868
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,741
Listen, I just want you to have this.

869
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:24,534
Please.

870
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,411
Thank you.

871
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,747
Quality support, cushioning.

872
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,917
Plus, they come with
an anti-microbial footbed.

873
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,168
No, reject them.

874
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,085
Wasp the trucks.

875
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:35,420
Thank you.

876
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,133
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world

877
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,260
But I'll always remember you

878
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:47,432
Goodbye, Martin.

879
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,310
It's goodbye for now.

880
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,145
That's what I like to think, Eddie.

881
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:54,648
Okay, bye.

882
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:56,650
Hey, Martin.

883
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,696
That doorway, the near Rika?

884
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,949
Yeah, it's open.

885
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,450
Do I?

886
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,078
Just be safe.

887
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,206
Okay.

888
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,041
Thanks.

889
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:21,591
Oh, Jesus.

890
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,092
What?

891
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,553
Well, this is an all-time low.

892
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,188
You have chocolate.

893
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,066
Yum!

894
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,194
Oh, oh, oh.

895
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:52,163
I would like to see her
where we get to New York, Eddie.

896
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,208
You know, she was
built to welcome visitors

897
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,251
to America, buddy.

898
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:57,794
That's you.

899
00:54:58,753 --> 00:54:59,796
You think so, Eddie?

900
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,548
Oh yeah, I know so.

901
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,926
When we get out of this
mess, we're gonna go see her.

902
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,052
We're gonna say, "Hi, Lady Liberty."

903
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,138
And see her Broadway show!

904
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:09,973
Yeah, sure.

905
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,141
Wow!

906
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,477
I know how much you hate musicals.

907
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,230
Yeah, it's gonna look great.

908
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,497
What's next, Thelma?

909
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,376
Well, Louise, I'm not sure $20

910
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,046
is gonna get us much
in the way of motor transport.

911
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,009
But I'm not ever
riding an alien horse again.

912
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,304
So I guess it looks
like we're stealing cars.

913
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,473
No, I've watched Rain Man

914
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,726
and in my infinite
wisdom as a celestial being,

915
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,895
working the system is easy.

916
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,940
You hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette,

917
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:05,028
bingo, bango, luxury
ride, Bluetooth sound system,

918
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,239
racing, and the top down.

919
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,742
Because that's how we roll.

920
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,702
Harris Casino has a strict dress code.

921
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,705
No, you know what?

922
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,623
It's a hotel.

923
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,875
These are my vacation clothes.

924
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,085
You're better ones.

925
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,419
He's not wrong.

926
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,462
Look at you.

927
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,632
No, don't push it, all right, buddy?

928
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:27,675
Want a hand?

929
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:28,218
Yes.

930
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,639
That did me, knock him out.

931
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,515
What are you doing?

932
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,849
He was being a dick.

933
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:35,600
Yeah, I was.

934
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,643
Oh, look.

935
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,815
We need a disguise.

936
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,193
What are we doing?

937
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,445
Hey, hey man.

938
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:48,321
Hi.

939
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,408
Oh, God.

940
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,368
Whoa.

941
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,918
Why do you keep rocking people out?

942
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,961
What is wrong with you?

943
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:04,212
What?

944
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:06,965
So sorry, buddy.

945
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,676
I am so, so sorry.

946
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,428
Hey there, you're my baby.

947
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,473
Now no one will recognize us.

948
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:16,474
Seriously.

949
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,312
You could get voted
people's sexiest man of the year.

950
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,941
If anyone cared who you are anymore.

951
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,985
I've won sexy man awards before.

952
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:27,902
Of course you have.

953
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:30,321
Hey, hey.

954
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,823
The guy that did that,

955
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,701
sorry, he's in the arched over there.

956
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,410
He shitfaced.

957
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,788
You're bad people.

958
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,331
Yeah, we are.

959
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,667
We're keeping his shoes, by the way.

960
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,380
We are so money and we know it.

961
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,631
Welcome to the Paris.

962
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:49,757
Thank you.

963
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:50,466
No, thank you.

964
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,054
Baby, here I am

965
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,848
I'm a man on the scene

966
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,809
I can give you what you want

967
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,728
But you got to go home with me

968
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,023
I forgot some good old lovin'

969
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,566
And I got some sun and gold

970
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,568
Oh, yes!

971
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,029
Let me multiply the 20.

972
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,989
Let me quadruple-fire it.

973
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,489
What are you doing?

974
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,951
No, this is all the money that we have.

975
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,370
Look for your lady tonight!

976
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,083
Snazzy jacket!

977
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,002
Let's eat up and steal it.

978
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,759
I know Lady Luck is on our side tonight!

979
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,302
No, I would say that Lady Luck

980
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,471
is definitely not on your side tonight.

981
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,182
But I would even go
so far to say that Lady Luck

982
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,642
hates you, buddy.

983
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,893
I can't stop now!

984
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,186
Of course you can't stop.

985
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,479
What is this feeling?

986
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,355
It's like-- This feeling?

987
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:45,563
Ha!

988
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,149
It's like all of my
problems have gone away!

989
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,192
Do this all the time.

990
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,783
Errol, I need more money.

991
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,205
But we don't have any more money, buddy.

992
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:02,789
God!

993
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,040
God bless!

994
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,626
You are a sore loser.

995
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,002
Yes, sir, it is!

996
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:08,753
Oh!

997
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,923
I think you broke my foot.

998
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,634
God, Lady Luck is a fickle slut!

999
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:15,551
Oh.

1000
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,470
We should have played that machine!

1001
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,638
Yes, yes, yes!

1002
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,266
No, F-ing, wait!

1003
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:24,811
Eddie, bro!

1004
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,312
Mrs. Chen!

1005
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:27,939
Oh, no, no, no!

1006
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,899
Mr. Chen, it's Mrs. Chen!

1007
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,484
Oh, Mrs. Chen!

1008
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,735
Eddie, please!

1009
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,363
Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Chen!

1010
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,447
I'm gonna cry!

1011
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:37,240
Me too.

1012
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,077
Wow, what happened to you?

1013
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,161
You look hot!

1014
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:43,246
So do you.

1015
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:43,871
Really hot.

1016
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,123
I always look hot.

1017
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:45,415
Yeah.

1018
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,874
Is a big guy in there?

1019
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:47,417
Yeah.

1020
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,084
Do you like my dress?

1021
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,919
I've been wearing so big,

1022
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,713
they gave me a credit
line at the clothes store,

1023
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,548
and then the penthouse suite.

1024
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:55,591
Wow, you know I stole this suit

1025
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,051
of a guy who pissed on me.

1026
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,429
I knocked him out, I left him in a bush.

1027
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,556
Well, that explained a stink.

1028
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,725
You could use my room to clean up,

1029
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,225
and then we--

1030
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,226
Heartache.

1031
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,728
Oh, that would be so good.

1032
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,229
And room service.

1033
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:09,897
(woman screams)

1034
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,744
We got him.

1035
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:27,206
Positive ID on Brock's
CCTV hit the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

1036
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,584
Have we reconstituted the six?

1037
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:30,460
Yes, sir.

1038
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:31,961
Put him in.

1039
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:47,810
The six are on route.

1040
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,271
They'll bring him in.

1041
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,316
But this time I'm requesting control

1042
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,525
of the Imperium program.

1043
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,489
You have my permission, General.

1044
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,167
When thunder roars,

1045
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:12,960
and it roars,

1046
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:14,504
and it roars,

1047
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,214
and it roars.

1048
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,353
(ominous music)

1049
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,564
Let's dance, baby.

1050
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,359
Yeah, I love dances.

1051
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,778
Please eat that thing will find us.

1052
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,904
Don't be a party pooper.

1053
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,365
No, do not encourage him.

1054
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,409
You know what, Mr.
Chen, we are fugitives.

1055
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,203
We are on the run,
so thank you for having us.

1056
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:48,454
We gotta go.

1057
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,288
You're no fun.

1058
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,125
One last dance before you go.

1059
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,210
We never do anything I want to do.

1060
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,003
Just a little dance.

1061
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,797
And you gave up.

1062
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,507
Away my chickens.

1063
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,227
Let's cut around, Mrs. Chen.

1064
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,687
I give up.

1065
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:24,490
Oh no, I cannot unsee that.

1066
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,367
I cannot unsee that.

1067
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,246
(upbeat music)

1068
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,039
You can dance.

1069
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,250
You can dance.

1070
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,045
Having the time of your life.

1071
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,722
When did you two practice this?

1072
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:51,851
(sighs)

1073
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:01,110
(upbeat music)

1074
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,830
God damn it!

1075
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,208
I told you this would happen.

1076
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,543
(screams)

1077
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:19,837
Don't panic, she can't see the kudex.

1078
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,422
What the hell is that?

1079
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,174
Wow, so ugly.

1080
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,302
Stay where you can.

1081
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,015
She can't see the
thing she's looking for.

1082
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,893
(screams)

1083
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:42,527
Oh!

1084
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,451
You live anyhow!

1085
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:53,871
I choose.

1086
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,758
(suspenseful music)

1087
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,026
Wow.

1088
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,238
(laughs)

1089
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,824
Area 51.

1090
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:30,616
Yeah.

1091
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:31,534
Huh?

1092
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:32,451
Yeah.

1093
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,872
We made it.

1094
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,710
You finally got to see it, Den.

1095
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,462
It's kind of cool.

1096
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:44,088
Huh.

1097
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,131
I guess.

1098
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:47,341
Yeah.

1099
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:51,554
Leaf.

1100
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,307
Where you going, hon?

1101
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,311
Well, let's see if we
can't find us something cooler.

1102
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,061
Come on.

1103
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,438
Come on, guys.

1104
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:01,230
Okay, babe.

1105
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:02,565
Life's long dream.

1106
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,191
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

1107
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,277
I smell alien.

1108
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,198
(laughs) (suspenseful music)

1109
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,660
He's deteriorating without his host.

1110
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:16,412
Poor thing.

1111
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,165
Put him below with the others.

1112
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:20,791
I'm safer there.

1113
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:24,879
(suspenseful music)

1114
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,658
(grunts)

1115
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,495
Down, down.

1116
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,038
Come on, come on.

1117
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:08,673
All right.

1118
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,467
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1119
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:15,054
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

1120
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,349
Follow me, guys, and come on.

1121
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:20,267
This is so exciting.

1122
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:26,899
I can't believe we're here.

1123
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:36,867
Wow.

1124
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,039
Whoa.

1125
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:43,916
Oh, well.

1126
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,585
What is this?

1127
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,845
(suspenseful music)

1128
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,473
It's all broken.

1129
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,435
So sad.

1130
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,823
Oh, buddy.

1131
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:18,492
Hey, buddy.

1132
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,247
Oh, no.

1133
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:26,542
No.

1134
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,132
Oh, no, how many
hours can you have in one day?

1135
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:35,926
Eddie?

1136
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:41,932
Hello?

1137
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,854
They did this to me.

1138
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,565
(suspenseful music)

1139
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:50,274
Morgan?

1140
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:52,193
What?

1141
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:53,694
You're alive?

1142
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:56,614
What are you doing here?

1143
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,868
We're being hunted, Eddie.

1144
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,496
You have what he needs.

1145
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,293
Protect the Codex from dark hands.

1146
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,255
A symbiote army waits here.

1147
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:15,174
Free them.

1148
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:17,927
Protected, Eddie.

1149
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:24,350
Now must stay locked away.

1150
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,148
Eddie, I'm Dr. Payne.

1151
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:34,568
Where's my friend?

1152
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:35,611
He's safe for now.

1153
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:38,239
Great news.

1154
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,491
We're all done here.

1155
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:42,910
All of this is out of your hands.

1156
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,370
This is my lab.

1157
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,663
No, no, no, not yours.

1158
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,455
You just work here.

1159
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,373
Or you did.

1160
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,583
You, Christmas, you're going home.

1161
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:50,876
And what about them?

1162
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,336
You heard what it said.

1163
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,839
The Codex only
exists if they're both alive.

1164
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:55,965
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

1165
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,384
You killed one of my people.

1166
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,427
I'm returning the favor personally.

1167
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,679
Please escort Dr. Payne out here.

1168
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,347
Christmas, time to go.

1169
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:04,348
Hey!

1170
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,855
(growling)

1171
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,526
Big mistake.

1172
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,029
(grunting)

1173
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,448
(growling)

1174
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:22,992
Fire!

1175
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,076
Run!

1176
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:24,994
Fire!

1177
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:29,498
Fire!

1178
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,250
(growling) (yelling) (gunshots)

1179
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,087
(growling)

1180
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,755
(gunshots)

1181
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,383
Venom, run, go!

1182
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,552
(yelling)

1183
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,058
(yelling)

1184
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,148
Release the symbiotes.

1185
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,445
(yelling)

1186
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,991
(yelling)

1187
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:08,287
(gunshots)

1188
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,415
(yelling)

1189
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:11,707
(grunting)

1190
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:12,333
(growling)

1191
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,251
(yelling)

1192
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:20,591
(gunshots) (yelling) (yelling)

1193
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:22,551
Jim!

1194
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,598
(growling)

1195
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,267
Turn her down!

1196
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:30,893
Get her!

1197
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,188
(growling)

1198
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:38,525
Let's go, boy.

1199
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,610
Take her down!

1200
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:41,987
(growling)

1201
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,240
(yelling)

1202
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,742
I'm gonna fall down!

1203
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,747
(yelling)

1204
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:55,459
Help!

1205
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,390
(growling)

1206
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,143
Come on!

1207
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,230
(growling)

1208
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:19,817
Leave her!

1209
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:20,359
Leave her!

1210
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,194
Get the clonax outta here!

1211
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,031
(growling)

1212
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:30,536
That's our way out.

1213
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,329
(growling)

1214
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,709
(gunshots)

1215
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,173
You break us out of here!

1216
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:45,300
(growling)

1217
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,179
There's no aliens here, kids.

1218
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:55,644
Best shoes ever!

1219
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,229
Whoa!

1220
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:58,564
What was that?

1221
01:11:59,148 --> 01:11:59,481
(gunshots)

1222
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,237
We gotta go, move it!

1223
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:11,368
(growling)

1224
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:14,580
We are leaving!

1225
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:15,664
Move!

1226
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:17,833
Move, move!

1227
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,212
It's all right, it's all right, kids.

1228
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:28,552
Aliens!

1229
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,387
Alien invasion!

1230
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,473
Alien attack!

1231
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,317
Motherfucker!

1232
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,113
(growling)

1233
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,324
You two, get out, Lord!

1234
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:51,575
Hey, wait, sir, hold me!

1235
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,077
You're high on the airborne!

1236
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,203
Move, move, move!

1237
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:55,412
In the harbor's gulf!

1238
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,623
We got to get the
codex as far away as possible.

1239
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:58,582
(growling)

1240
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:01,210
It's Eddie?

1241
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:01,960
It's Eddie.

1242
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:02,336
It's Eddie.

1243
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:03,212
Eddie!

1244
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,004
Eddie!

1245
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,090
Oh no, Eddie, Eddie!

1246
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,136
Martin, I'm family!

1247
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,393
Can't be here, Martin.

1248
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,894
Dark forces, man!

1249
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,780
(growling)

1250
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,539
Ricky, can you help us?

1251
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:39,873
I lied.

1252
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:41,667
Aliens are real.

1253
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:44,128
My best friend in the whole world is one.

1254
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,546
He's gonna get you out of here, okay?

1255
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:50,300
Don't be scared.

1256
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:52,010
Hi.

1257
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,806
Pleasure to meet you.

1258
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:56,098
Huh?

1259
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:57,975
It's for the chocolate.

1260
01:13:59,309 --> 01:13:59,810
You're welcome.

1261
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,991
(growling)

1262
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:15,534
No!

1263
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,006
(screaming)

1264
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,217
Hold on, Kari!

1265
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,555
Hold on, Kari!

1266
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:43,145
(screaming)

1267
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:55,824
He was trying to protect you.

1268
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,827
We are not the bad guys!

1269
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:02,873
Ethel!

1270
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:04,625
My baby, my baby.

1271
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,210
Thank you, Eddie.

1272
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:06,877
You're welcome.

1273
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,509
You gotta be kidding me.

1274
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,894
Get in!

1275
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:24,937
Whoa, whoa!

1276
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:25,896
Get out!

1277
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:26,647
Stop!

1278
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:29,066
Hey!

1279
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:31,735
Come on.

1280
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:45,791
Call, bring me that Codex.

1281
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:51,213
What's that noise?

1282
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,340
She found home.

1283
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,887
(growling)

1284
01:15:58,929 --> 01:15:59,554
Oh, shit.

1285
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:09,273
(screaming)

1286
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:23,203
Get out!

1287
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:24,413
Get out of here!

1288
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:25,455
Get out of here!

1289
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:25,914
Take cover!

1290
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:26,832
Take cover!

1291
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:30,544
I got you.

1292
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:35,173
(screaming)

1293
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,678
She saved us.

1294
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,098
I saw no one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1295
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:43,932
Copy.

1296
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,104
Get back to their van!

1297
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:50,480
Come on!

1298
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:51,481
Kari, Kari!

1299
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,068
I'm gonna round them up.

1300
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,278
Have the chopper follow me.

1301
01:16:58,989 --> 01:16:59,781
Go, go, go!

1302
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:00,407
Go!

1303
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,871
(growling)

1304
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:08,123
Go!

1305
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,051
He's leading them to a kill box.

1306
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,344
When you get a lock, vaporize them!

1307
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:29,227
(gunfire)

1308
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:31,730
Shit!

1309
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:37,486
(screaming)

1310
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:46,870
We're back.

1311
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,914
Okay, okay, hold it.

1312
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:49,790
Come on, kids.

1313
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:50,874
Go, come on!

1314
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:51,875
Kari, honey.

1315
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:53,710
Thank you.

1316
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:57,089
Aliens suck!

1317
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:06,473
(growling)

1318
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,265
(growling)

1319
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:14,106
(growling)

1320
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:21,822
Light them up!

1321
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:22,781
Copy that.

1322
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:35,585
Torque eliminate.

1323
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,170
(growling)

1324
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:42,634
Thompson down!

1325
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,386
It's coming down, go!

1326
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,350
(growling)

1327
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,896
(screaming)

1328
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:55,605
(growling)

1329
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,577
Close!

1330
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,454
I'll do it!

1331
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:20,964
Let's finish this.

1332
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,174
With pleasure.

1333
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,015
The chopper blades.

1334
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,689
(growling)

1335
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:54,122
I got you.

1336
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,129
Get him somewhere safe.

1337
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:04,508
Oh boy.

1338
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:11,640
(growling)

1339
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:30,784
I'm so sorry.

1340
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:32,035
I'm sorry.

1341
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,329
Okay, okay.

1342
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:43,046
(growling)

1343
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:45,840
No.

1344
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,018
Go on.

1345
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:59,688
Okay, okay.

1346
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,151
Still living your brother's dream.

1347
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:12,742
(growling)

1348
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:19,249
I'm coming.

1349
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:20,500
I'm coming.

1350
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,752
Get over here!

1351
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:23,378
Get over here!

1352
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:23,670
Get over here!

1353
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:24,170
Go, go!

1354
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,631
(growling)

1355
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:47,110
(growling)

1356
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:52,782
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

1357
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,451
You did it all yourself.

1358
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:57,829
Well, some of it.

1359
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,832
(growling)

1360
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:10,425
(growling)

1361
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,349
I really would
have liked to have seen her.

1362
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:23,063
Who?

1363
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:24,898
Lady Liberty.

1364
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:27,525
Oh yeah.

1365
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:30,070
Oh yeah.

1366
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,405
Yeah, well, we're going.

1367
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,994
We're gonna go just as
soon as we get out of here.

1368
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,706
They're just going to keep coming.

1369
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,376
We'll never leave this place, friend.

1370
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:46,211
Oh God.

1371
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:57,597
We were alive.

1372
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,769
I thought we were
gonna be the lethal protector.

1373
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,316
We are.

1374
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,361
That's what this is.

1375
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:46,229
Yeah. (dramatic music)

1376
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:49,232
All right.

1377
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:54,821
All right.

1378
01:24:02,078 --> 01:24:05,915
(growling)

1379
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,625
Come again, us.

1380
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:17,135

01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:12,649
Go.

1388
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:14,359
Go.

1389
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:21,950
Oh my God.

1390
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,287
(growling)

1391
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:31,042
(growling)

1392
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,836
(growling)

1393
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,381
What are you doing?

1394
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,427
I'll never forget you.

1395
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,184
Don't forget me, either, Eddie.

1396
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,686
No.

1397
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:51,062
Time to go.

1398
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:55,233
Strickland.

1399
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:56,526
Strickland authorized.

1400
01:25:59,070 --> 01:25:59,529
No.

1401
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,079

01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:34,397
Oh.

1407
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:36,274
Huh?

1408
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:37,984
Huh?

1409
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,241
It's just by for now.

1410
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,661
(growling)

1411
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:54,667

1422
01:27:54,686 --> 01:28:06,948
(growling)

1423

01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,575
(growling)

1425
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:13,955
No, Eddie.

1426
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:16,749
(crying)

1427
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,926
(growling)

1428
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,092
(crying)

1429
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:08,885
Nureka.

1430
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:28,988
(growling)

1431
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:34,911
Hey, buddy.

1432
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,123
I just had a crazy dream.

1433
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:47,381
Buddy.

1434
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:49,050
He's not coming back.

1435
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:58,142
He's coming back.

1436
01:29:58,142 --> 01:29:58,976
But I need him back.

1437
01:30:00,269 --> 01:30:01,562
He wasn't meant for this place.

1438
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:03,648
You couldn't have kept him.

1439
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:06,442
And he couldn't have kept you.

1440
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:11,864
For your bravery, you
both have the heartfelt thanks

1441
01:30:11,864 --> 01:30:12,907
of a grateful nation.

1442
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:17,745
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1443
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,790
Everything that happened in San Francisco

1444
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,250
and in the last few days,

1445
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:24,877
you'll be considered expunged.

1446
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,177
Just so you're clear, of course,

1447
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,639
you have a breath of
word of this to any living soul,

1448
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:39,308
you will spend the rest of that life

1449
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:42,353
in the coldest, darkest hole imaginable.

1450
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:45,857
Good luck, Eddie.

1451
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,367
(upbeat music)

1452
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:26,355
(upbeat music)

1453
01:31:53,799 --> 01:32:21,035
(upbeat music)

1454
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,703
I won't forget you, buddy.

1455
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:29,585
(upbeat music)

1456
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:32,129
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

1457
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:37,969
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

1458
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,682
Memories bring back
memories bring back y'all

1459
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:49,397
Give me one last
dance before we hit the ground

1460
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:51,148
(upbeat music)

1461

01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:59,824
Push me into
overdrive what a lovely way to go

1463
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,286
If you're with me by
my side I'm in for the ride

1464
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:05,871
(upbeat music)

1465
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,335
There's no running no
escape all the venom never waits

1466
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,630
Once you feel it
hits your veins it's too late

1467
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:15,506
You're gone

1468
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:18,301
(upbeat music)

1469
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:26,892
There's no stopping we're slowing down

1470
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:31,355
Give me one last
dance before we hit the ground

1471
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,234
Before we hit the ground

Push me up against the
wall it's the final curtain call

1473
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:46,120
About to be a ballroom bro oh come on

(upbeat music)

1475
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,423
There's no stopping we're slowing down

1476
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:01,135
There won't be a next time now

1477
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,930
But I'll be fine if you're around

1478
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:09,518
Give me one last
dance before we hit the ground

1479
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,356
Before we hit the ground

1480
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:16,609

(wind blowing)

1492
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:59,026
Your champion has fallen.

1493
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:03,489
The planets will be mine.

1494
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:07,118
The king in black is awake.

1495
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:10,079
I will kill your world.

1496
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,249
Everyone will burn.

1497
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:15,710
And you will watch.
