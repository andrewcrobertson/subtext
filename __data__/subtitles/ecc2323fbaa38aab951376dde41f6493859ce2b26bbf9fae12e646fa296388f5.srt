1
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,780
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,300
You're free Wednesday.

3
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Listen, it's not even a word.

4
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,060
Not really.

5
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,840
Okay, sure.

6
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Free for dinner Wednesday?

7
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,580
There's a new place near me, Montana's.

8
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
It's very good.

9
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

10
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,620
No, I have an engagement Wednesday.

11
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Okay, huh.

12
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Wednesday too.

13
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,940
People don't really call them engagements.

14
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,691
Do I tell you how to speak?

15
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Yes.

16
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,520
The fact remains.

17
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,840
The engagement? That's right.

18
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520


19
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Huh?

20
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,120
Oh, oh my God!

21
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,730
Jesus, Mary Ann, don't call me nerd sex.

22
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,310
Yes, I am going tonight.

23
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,670
Very sex.

24
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Hi, Sukey.

25
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,370
Who?

26
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,090
Here? Yes, there.

27
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,130
Oh, no one's here babe.

28
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,270
I was just masturbating.

29
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,770
Uh-huh.

30
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,050
Me-me time.

31
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,710
Let me turn the video down.

32
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
No.

33
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,360
What?

34
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
No.

35
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,320
No what, Carla?

36
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
You're not wearing that.

37
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,380
I just came from work.
I came from Toledo. I don't dress like it.

38
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Is Jamie here?

39
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Okay, like, keep the coat on,
take the shirt off underneath.

40
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
And pull out my breasts.

41
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,820
I'm not here to puddle my breasts.

42
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:25,200
Why else would you
leave? To socialize.

43
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800


44
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,100
Oh, girls!

45
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,660
All I'm here lately is Y2K.

46
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Y2K!

47
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,430
But Jamie does a
nine-shot competition of $19.

48
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,910
99 here at Sugar and Spice.

49
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,510
And Jamie is the last one
to put herself in for himself.

50
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,481
So, firstly... You.

51
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,530
It's okay.

52
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:10,891
Don't put that woman in front
of a crowd like a microphone.

53
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,370
She likes to entertain.

54
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,570
She gets this reinforcement.

55
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,830
Do you know when she's fucking?

56
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,190
I don't know that she's seeing anyone.

57
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,550
She's seeing you, of course.

58
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,790
She's a free spirit. I admire her.

59
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,410
Freak.

60
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
It's not fair to see you.

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,660
I've had it with love.

62
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,840
I know bars and troubadours are high on it,

63
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,780
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the

64
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,620
modern 20 and soon-to-be
21st century lesbian.

65
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,951
Just here, it's with a piece of blood.

66
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:10,746
Just right here is when he gets ya.

67
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,260
Mm-hmm.

68
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,681
I've got your plan, my friend.

69
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:15,996
Gilphum helped me move
my shit out of Sydney tomorrow.

70
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,596
I'm not getting a middle of that.
I have my own problems.

71
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
What problems? Internal.

72
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780


73
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,996
Yes. I don't know how else to put it.

74
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,700
Problems with what they feel internally.

75
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,221
How can you have internal problems?

76
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,660
You know, giraffe-hole broke dope.

77
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,160
I'm not certain, honey-darling, that you
have ever reached deep inside any orifice

78
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,780
to scoop out your soul

79
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,580
and fling it shamelessly
in a fellow human being

80
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,300
and humiliate yourself

81
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,500
and grubble and weep and feel your ego

82
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:48,440
completely disintegrate,
otherwise known as the Gloria of...

83
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,060
Please tell me about the key.

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Now, my plan is...

85
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
You come help me back, and then...

86
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,150
I can't even believe you tell.

87
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,380
What? I am too. That was my plan.

88
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Where are you going?

89
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Tallahassee, Florida.

90
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

91
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
They had Ella's sleep, Sarah.

92
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Can't shame them.

93
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,920
Tallahassee is very nice.

94
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,950
It's not glitzy and gross like Miami.

95
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,740
It has live oak and Spanish moss.

96
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,960
Me and Aunt Ella's go to the St.
Mark's Wildlife Preserve.

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
There's good birding.

98
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
Birding?

99
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,260
How have I missed out on this?

100
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
It's very pleasant.

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,661
So you just came up with
this wild hair in your ass to burr.

102
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:27,940
I've been happy, and I'm
starting to snap at people at work,

103
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,500
and it's not fair to them.

104
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm only impatient with myself.

105
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,860
Well, we can fix that.

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,880
We'll have you run around in no time.

107
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
That's why we take this
trip together, honey-babe.

108
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,760
We get our shit together, together.

109
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,030
See, I was going to take
some time off, get a drive away,

110
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
just go pop up anywhere.

111
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,720
Now, you can come with me, and
we can go to Tallahassee and burr.

112
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:57,744
<b><font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</font></b>

113
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
Ooh!

114
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah!

115
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
What's a drive away?

116
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Pretty well away, Riddle.

117
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,480
You'd live in the car to wherever someone
find that a drive away company wants it

118
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,241
if they got one going
near your destination.

119
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,580
I don't know what you'll like, NLS.

120
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:31,380
Are you kidding? A birder?

121
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,480
I don't wear my great big old straw hat,

122
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,860
and she is going to L-O-V-E. Love me.

123
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,336
You know how parents and social love me.

124
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I think I got charisma.

125
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Oh, Marianne, who's your lo-facious friend?

126
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,800
I just love that chatty little girl,
isn't she something? I'm not sure.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000


128
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I find no problem here.

129
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,120
This is going to be F-U-N-N fun, girl.

130
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,920
Just come help me move
my stuff out of the cookie store.

131
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,470
Don't worry, she's not
even going to be there.

132
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh, God, Jesus! Oh, God!

133
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,980
Don't! What are you doing?

134
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,780
I don't want it anymore!

135
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,480
Who essentially would it be?

136
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
Suki, I'm just taking my own stuff.

137
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,320
That was a gift. I wanted you to have it.

138
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't want it, and we're
not going to both use it.

139
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,820
Suki, it's your little dildo.

140
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,600
Oh, no, no, Noah.

141
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,680
Take that one still. I never liked her.

142
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,600
She won't stop working!

143
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,110
How can I take the dog, Suki?
I don't have a home.

144
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,500
Remember? You kicked me out.

145
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Take out and take the whole house out.

146
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,940
It's your door, Noah, Susanna.

147
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,660
Curly's Drive-Away, Pennsylvania's
most trusted name in car delivery.

148
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,340
Curly speaking.

149
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,320
Okay, it's going to Tallahassee.

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,100
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

151
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,326
Yeah, you have something
to write this down.

152
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,460
Yes, I'm writing it down.

153
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,460
Right.

154
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,260
Tallahassee.

155
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,261
Sorry.

156
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,440
Right, got it.

157
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,200
Get in your bus.

158
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,250
We'll be there by the end of day tomorrow.

159
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,960
By tomorrow? No later.

160
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,860
Uh-huh.

161
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,640
Okay.

162
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Over and out.

163
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440


164
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,400
Can you help us? We need a drive-away.

165
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,940
Two hundred and fifty
dollars deposit in the reference.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Revers.

167
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,236
It's what it'll look like
when he breaks his balls.

168
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,780
Don't show up when you're supposed to.

169
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
His balls.

170
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,640
Can the reference be a woman?

171
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
We don't know a woman.

172
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Okay.

173
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
What do you want to know?

174
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Tallahassee? Tallahassee.

175
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,080


176
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,440
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

177
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,980
There's Spanish law saying live over here.

178
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Don't call me Curly.

179
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,980
And your name, huh?

180
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,960
My name is Curly.
We just met. It's too familiar.

181
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,280
Have you ever been to Tallahassee?

182
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
No, I've got good sense.

183
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,460
Your car is a Dodge Airy's.

184
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,080
Oh.

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,140
Okay.

186
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
Is that a good car? Not really.

187
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,500


188
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
You still know the trips?

189
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,980
There's also a place here in Wellington.

190
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
Fantastic, that part. The Butterchurn.

191
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
And this place, Levi's
Barbecue in Charleston.

192
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,096
Memphis-style barbecue. Really good.

193
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,200
Everyone goes to Tullyburg.

194
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,260
What do you mean?

195
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
It's a straight shot to Tallahassee.

196
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Down and across.

197
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,196
Right. Here's the world's largest
Dixie Cup outside of Mission, Georgia.

198
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,200
Direct route. Down and across.

199
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,540
We don't need to see the
world's largest Dixie Cup.

200
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,940
We don't need to enjoy life.

201
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,180
But as long as we're here, the
world's largest Dixie Cup is not life.

202
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,480
It's a straight shot.

203
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,240
On the interstate.

204
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,080
Down and across.

205
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,240
Interstate is not life.

206
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,200
It is more than the
world's largest Dixie Cup.

207
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,436
You're the one that went into a bargain.

208
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,880
That's nature.

209
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,810
What's a die car? That's not nature?

210
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,576
You better Dixie Cup.
You can make an argument.

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,386
He said it was a rush job. We're
supposed to have the car there tomorrow.

212
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,410
Tomorrow can be a day.

213
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,020
We can't even go to Lincoln.

214
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,340
But he needs a high heels.

215
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,920
Little doctor or a reverend.

216
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,820
Yeah, no, we don't have a
discount for Medi-God, no.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,860
No, not for medical doctors either.

218
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,340
Make every mind which are you.

219
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,660
It doesn't matter. We have no discounts.

220
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,120
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

221
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,260
Thank you for calling Curly's.

222
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,840
Welcome to Curly's driveway.

223
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,541
Well... We're here.

224
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

225
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:07,780
Who are you? The car.

226
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,781
The car.

227
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
The Dodge Aries.

228
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
The Dodge Aries.

229
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,980
What are you, a minor bird?

230
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,500
Curly, I understand that.

231
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You are not the Dodge.

232
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
What do you mean?

233
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
We're not the Dodge.

234
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
What's the big deal?

235
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,900
The car isn't ours.

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,680
But it's ours.

237
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
And the car is ours.

238
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,800
Don't tell Hassey.

239
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,880
Once we get to Tallahassee, it stops
being art and starts being vandalism.

240
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,516
Okay, for sake, Mary, it'll come
off with a little soap and water.

241
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:44,940
It won't.

242
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:45,941
Well, what?

243
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,480
Come off with soap and water.

244
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Well, how do you know? I tried.

245
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
Mary, it's art.

246
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920


247
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Stop saying it's art.

248
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
That doesn't end all discussion.

249
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,236
We're going to be driving
through some conservative towns.

250
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,620
The South?

251
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,800
The Bible Belt?

252
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
Oh, don't I know it.

253
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,420
Honey, I grew up where the Bible Belt
means the ass crack of the Pecos River.

254
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,780
Fort Worth is nowhere near the Pecos River.

255
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,000
That's Pecos.

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Honey, darling.

257
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,720
The car art is just a part
of a larger undertaking.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
My project.

259
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,680
What's your project?

260
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,420
Loosening you up so we
can get you late, sure, sweetie.

261
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
How long's it been? Wait.

262
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520


263
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Once?

264
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,600
Oh, my God, Mary, and
don't tell me it's been years.

265
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
How many years?

266
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,480
Who was it?

267
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,000
You've had sex since what's
your name, haven't you? Donna.

268
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Yeah, Donna.

269
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Oh, my God.

270
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,860
Oh, my God, Donna?

271
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
She wouldn't have forgotten Gornium.

272
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Neither.

273
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,140
That's right.

274
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
She just looks like Gornium.

275
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Wait a minute.

276
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,180
You said people of
yours would come in for it.

277
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Yes, I did.

278
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,220
You call with the drop-off in Tallahassee.

279
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,100
And then these broads come in and
say they're ready to go to Tallahassee.

280
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,620
You gave them the car.

281
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,690
You don't know who they were?

282
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I told you their names.

283
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,040
Their names, yes.

284
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
The places have come.

285
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,360
They drive the car instead of you.

286
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Is that bad?

287
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,340
Bad, if they find the goods.

288
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,416
What's the pigsty? Why don't
you get a girl away? I like clutter.

289
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440


290
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,380
They didn't have a cellular film.

291
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,580
The girl doesn't work for me.

292
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,240
He asked you a question, dick-enk.

293
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,000
Dick-enk? Flint.

294
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm a dick-enk.

295
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,060
Don't antagonize.

296
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,786
We're talking to a book that would cement.

297
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,096
You wouldn't know what
cemented would beat you in the ass.

298
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
And you would?

299
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,720
So, there's no way to get in
contact with them? Not per se.

300
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540


301
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Per se?

302
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,880
They left a local number.

303
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Everybody's got to leave a local number.

304
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,060
Someone who's bald is afraid.

305
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,960
Now you've got to do it.

306
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Ah!

307
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,680
Suzanne Shachel now, 2431, with Garnet.

308
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,640
You better hope your
friends deliver that car.

309
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,650
This is great.

310
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,790
This is so slutty.

311
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,150
I don't love this.

312
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,431
Don't they have postcards?

313
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,730
Jamie?

314
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,750
Alright, let's put on our war
paint and the butter turn away.

315
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,250
Jamie, I think I prefer to-

316
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,710
Nope, don't even come with me.

317
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,490
I'll show you how this is done.

318
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,960
Hiya.

319
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,640
Do you know where the butter turn is?

320
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
That car?

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,900
Or do you have like a timeout Wellington?

322
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,760
I mean, is there one
with gay lesbian lesbians?

323
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,060
You wouldn't have one.

324
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,760
But do you know if there's a newsstand

325
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,460
or a lesbian bookstore?

326
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,220
You know, it's at the
corner or something like that.

327
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,450
Hello? Confidence.

328
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740


329
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,260
You've got so big of a
comfortable and physical.

330
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,140
It's kind of like meeting
somebody at a now convention

331
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,216
when you're talking about
just making a little picture of me.

332
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,400
Jamie?

333
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I have done this before.

334
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
It's just like this.

335
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
One message.

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,920
You stay in a female body.

337
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Your body.

338
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
You're like this.

339
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,260
Not like this.

340
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,080
Let's just make a little picture of me.

341
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
I have done this before.

342
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,640
I am not a school lawyer.

343
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,440
You fuck people that work for Ralph Nade.

344
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,260
Not only.

345
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,480
Only in the last four years.

346
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Three years.

347
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,560
What do you feel in
your body? Very much so.

348
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I got you.

349
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,180


350
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,840
Good weeks, good day.

351
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,490
Like you'll do?

352
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,730
Please, please, come hold me, baby.

353
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,690
You seem totally okay.

354
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,930
Are there any other
mediocre ones like you at all?

355
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,450
I didn't say they all
tweedy or curse about fine.

356
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,430
Yeah, but not in the sense of super fine.

357
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,090
In the sense of fine.

358
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,930
Why are you jousting with me?

359
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,090
I'm not jousting.

360
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,550
I'm asking which of these women
you are not throwing against the wall.

361
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,310
You fuck black ladies, don't worry.

362
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,230
Look, gentlemen.

363
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:40,386
I'm not a throw-up against the wall and
fuck the daylights out of a kind of person.

364
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,766
Stop trying to make me something I'm not.

365
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,630
I'm just trying to eat
you late, you're sweet.

366
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,790
They sense it.

367
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,730
Whether you want to fuck
them or he's either a spy or not.

368
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,310
It has to be me.

369
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,830
It has to be done with authenticity.

370
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,090
You mean with a board?

371
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,230
I mean with authenticity.

372
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,850
Authenticity is somebody
that works for her out there.

373
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,486
You don't know what her life was like.

374
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,010
You know nothing about its worth.

375
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,710
Then why didn't the two of you move to Santa
Fe and synchronize her Mitchell cycles?

376
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:03,750
That didn't happen.

377
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,830
That's why you're here.

378
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,070
In the back bar, looking
for a cheap, sleazy sex.

379
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,270
No, I'm not.

380
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,150
This is not me.

381
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,470
You're right, I can't do this.

382
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,150
No, Mary.

383
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,490
I'm sorry, honey girl.

384
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,650
I'm saying you can do this.

385
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,350
You can do this.

386
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,350
You can beat you.

387
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,470
I promise, honey girl.

388
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,430
You're best still.

389
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,630
Jamie, I know you're well intentioned,
but this really isn't right for me.

390
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,970
You should stay and
enjoy your night on the town.

391
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
Hello.

392
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Good evening.

393
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I'm Amber.

394
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Marion.

395
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
What'd you read in?

396
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,140
Europeans by Henry James.

397
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,940
Wow, thick one.

398
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Hello, Marion.

399
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,380
Hello.

400
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,280
So, is this gonna be
a threesome? Nope.

401
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,740
No, no.

402
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Oh, okay, rats.

403
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,540


404
00:21:51,250 --> 00:22:06,090
Wow.

405
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Bouncy.

406
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
How's your book?

407
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,520
It's about two free spirits who visit
a repressed family in New England.

408
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,260
Ah, hello.

409
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,380
They are all repressed in New England.

410
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,460
That is why we are going the other way.

411
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,960
Although there was this one chick
I screamed once on her page here.

412
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
She got her tongue so far in me, I
swore it was gonna wriggle out my asshole.

413
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,760
No, I'm not kidding.

414
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,500
They say that there's advanced
yoga people in India supposedly.

415
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
You can do that.

416
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,040
Black dots and cunnilingus.

417
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,240
They can even cunniling themselves.

418
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,060
They got pictures of
it in like medical texts.

419
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,620
They got an ass librarian
that'll keep me in stacks.

420
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Who wrote your
book? Henry James.

421
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Henry James.

422
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600


423
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
American writer.

424
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,860
His family, his brother, kid.

425
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Great.

426
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
No, kid.

427
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,080
Hello, who Henry James is.

428
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,820
White and uptight.

429
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,840
I had his read Portrait
of a Lady in School.

430
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,420
Boy, that was a great read.

431
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,840
Somebody dragging the
day-old spaghetti across my tits.

432
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Very absolutely.

433
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,100
His prose is a different thing.

434
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
Yeah, put me on the whole book thing.

435
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,220
Henry James is in fact
the reason that I don't read.

436
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,740
Uh-huh.

437
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,480
Several times.

438
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,660
Uh-huh, yeah, I don't think you should
have brought one back to the room.

439
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,300
I mean, this one's coming.

440
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
How do you think I felt?

441
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,820
You told me to have a night on the table.

442
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,760
Yeah, people say things.

443
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
It's not always what they feel.

444
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,200
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.

445
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,980
We don't read minds.

446
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,616
We all wear it on a handshake basis.

447
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,060
What does that mean?

448
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,200
Hiya, how you doing?

449
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,560
How much for that Cali court?

450
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,160
How'd you like to have
one of your sex? Okay.

451
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:45,920


452
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,040
Where are you
from, girl? Not Texas.

453
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,780
Oh, no way.

454
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,420


455
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,320
Why'd you ask? I don't know.

456
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,180
Sorry.

457
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840


458
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,290
No.

459
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,370
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,470
Why are you sorry? You're good.

461
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:12,670
I'm a little.

462
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,090
..

463
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,430
I'm a big baby sometimes.

464
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,610
Uncle G knows!

465
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,610
You are not going to believe this.

466
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,490
It's your parent.

467
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,990
You and G soccer team.

468
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:26,870
Uh-huh.

469
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,250
I was in line next to Doreen, the captain.

470
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,170
Uh-huh.

471
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,699
They're very committed to lesbians,
and they're on their way to marry Dr.

472
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:35,010
Woodrow, which is
practically along our way.

473
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,870
Not exactly.

474
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,810
We were supposed to leave the car today.

475
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,526
Should we look at the map and see how long?

476
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:39,870
Look at the map.

477
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,230
After today's game, these girls
are going to have a basement army.

478
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,950
And excuse me about it.

479
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,030
Sure you are.

480
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,410
Nuh-uh.

481
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,370
Us.

482
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,610
You see, the shit happens
when you and Uncle G knows.

483
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,330
Go!

484
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,470
Go!

485
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,000
That's all right.

486
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,260
We've got a plan B.

487
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Yes, sir.

488
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,990
Yes, sir.

489
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,090
I understand that, sir.

490
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,710
You've got my word on it.

491
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,670
You're just...

492
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,530
Rotate, right?

493
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,980
Can't we, um, see?

494
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,340
Actually, we're just friends.

495
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,590
Cool, Mary.

496
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
It's no big deal.

497
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:08,770
Suzanne Schinkelman?

498
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,110
Suzanne Schinkelman.

499
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,830
Who the fuck are you?

500
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,530
I was wondering why they curse like that.

501
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,030
You know Jamie Dobbs?

502
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,310
You know Jamie Dobbs?

503
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,350
No, it was about that.

504
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,550
And Mary Bellamy?

505
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,370
You shouldn't do that.

506
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,410
He can't fight back.

507
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,230
He can't hit a girl.

508
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,530
He's old school.

509
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,390
You just want to locate your friends.

510
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,990
They inadvertently took
something that belongs to us.

511
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:37,550
We don't want to hurt anyone.

512
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,970
They're not like friends
for as much as you would.

513
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,470
Okay.

514
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,890
It would be helpful if you had a picture.

515
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,270
Picture? Picture, yeah.

516
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:48,271


517
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,890
Got a picture of one of them.

518
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,120
You find them? Give it to her.

519
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,860
Okay.

520
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
We'll do.

521
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,001
Oh.

522
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,140
If you bring someone back, just...

523
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,540
I'll take my book to you, please.

524
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,200
There's still a couple of chapters left.

525
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Mary!

526
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,600
We don't yet know exactly where they are,
they've got a picture of one of the girls.

527
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,160
We're all set.

528
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,960
And we will find them in the package.

529
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:45,800
Under control.

530
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,860
I understand that you're an happy sir.

531
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,240
I've got my two best men on.

532
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Alright.

533
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Get some coffee.

534
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,480
You two are going to be driving all night.

535
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:05,481
Fuck.

536
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,140
Where are you
headed, miss? Home.

537
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100


538
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
And where's that?

539
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,350
It's a motel, I don't know.

540
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
You don't know?

541
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:05,600
I can't remember the name.

542
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,540
A motel, on the highway.

543
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
And where are you
coming from? A house.

544
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720


545
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Whose house?

546
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,700
I don't know, it was a slumber party.

547
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
A little old for slumber parties,
aren't you miss? Look, mister.

548
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,960


549
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,130
You know what?

550
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,130
I'm going to drop you off at home.

551
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,550
Boo!

552
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,990
Yeah!

553
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:54,380
Yeah!

554
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,950
Boo!

555
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,690
Where the fuck?

556
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
Boo!

557
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:17,920
Boo! Boo! Hands up.

558
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:18,921


559
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,100
Want to get plaster?

560
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,560
I'll drive when it's my turn.

561
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,400
At the end of three hours, I have
no sympathy for you, my friend.

562
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,370
You could have just asked
her and you'd be fine right now.

563
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,060
I just asked, she answered.

564
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,268
But you cannot relate
to the public, which in a

565
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,180
service profession is a
big fucking hand again.

566
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,640
And that sound is
beginning to get irritating.

567
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,520
Well your lectures are getting irritating.

568
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,920
I don't lecture, my friend.

569
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,660
That's my point.

570
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I take people in.

571
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,620
I react.

572
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,340
I read people to get what I want.

573
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,320
You, though, you think life is this orderly
series of people to beat the shit out of.

574
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,460
Well, real life is not like that.

575
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,940
You only see it that way because
you're not nourished by human contact.

576
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,300
The human being give
and take, and so forth.

577
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,760
Uh-uh.

578
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,560
You want me to take it.

579
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,816
That's what you're comfortable with.

580
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
You hate man shit.

581
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
You don't engage the whole person.

582
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,100
You did a great job helping
me engage that very agile party.

583
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,700
Didn't have to.

584
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,653
No need whatsoever for the
physical approach, which you

585
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:23,480
couldn't see because you
don't savor the stuff of life.

586
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,480
I'm not a sissy, boy. That's what you mean.

587
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,960
Kiss my ass. I...

588
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Hello?

589
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,190
Okay, we're on track.

590
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,600
Marion Polavi was picked
up for a personal appointment.

591
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
On it.

592
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Thank you.

593
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
For what?

594
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,080
Just picking me up.

595
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,000
Am I not gonna pick
you up? Or not to.

596
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,300
Ma'am, your friend here is in the
new scout here to come get her.

597
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,396
I'm gonna get you all day every day.

598
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,840
I will not let a friend of mine rot in
prison longer than is absolutely necessary.

599
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,960
And so I say thank you.

600
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,270
Of course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison.

601
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:26,350
I've been careful not to
ask, but damn, Marion.

602
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,530
Lending yourself in prison
is a very hopeful sign for you.

603
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,090
I think it was jail, not prison.

604
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

605
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,310
You ain't told me how
you come to be in jail.

606
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,150
It wasn't hell raising.
Sorry to disappoint.

607
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,230
A police man didn't like my tone.

608
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,050
Oh?

609
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,110
You cop some attitude.

610
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,550
I don't have attitude.

611
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:54,655
Marion, if I may, there are
certain things in life which

612
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,690
you've got to sense and
understand in order to live life.

613
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,010
And one of the things that
you've got to understand is...

614
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:05,374
Well, all these funny
little creatures that you

615
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,610
probably noticed walking
around on two legs,

616
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,210
what you call them human beings,

617
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,581
you've got to understand
what makes them tick.

618
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,630
And your whole social situation,
you've got to understand what that is.

619
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,250
Uh-huh.

620
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,510
You know what that means?

621
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,730
Social situation.

622
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,630
I know what social situation means.

623
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,930
Okay, good.

624
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:26,090
So, the whole thing with a cop is, and you
should remember this with each reference,

625
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,730
when you're in a social
situation with a cop,

626
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,950
there ain't no social situation.

627
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,041
There's a keep your
fucking mouth shut situation.

628
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,330
There's a yes sir
situation is what there is.

629
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,625
Believe me, I've been
dating a cop for two years

630
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:41,850
now, and I ain't coming
through my bowl all year.

631
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,730
Thank you, I understand.

632
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:48,871
But if authority is being abused,
there's an obligation to... Holy shit.

633
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,010
Florida.

634
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,011
Florida.

635
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:02,400
Lesbian, don't let the
sun go down on you here.

636
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
You okay? Spare tired.

637
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,820


638
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
What?

639
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,080
Something burning?

640
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,540
Jamie, it's cold.

641
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Don't touch it.

642
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,660
I saw this movie once where they come
across this box, the people in the movie,

643
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,520
and they opened the box,
and it was like really, really bad.

644
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,040
Your traffic accident, fast
stop, his face hit the wheel.

645
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,011
Looking at a pretty
girl, weren't you Flint?

646
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,741
No more looking at pretty
girls for you, right? That's right.

647
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,300


648
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,740
So, are they like wanted
or something? Oh no, no.

649
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,620
No, they're not
in trouble at all.

650
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,580
Just drove off with something we
need, didn't even know they had it.

651
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,480
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

652
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,580
Just making out.

653
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,580
Oh yeah? With who?

654
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,660
No kiss and tell, huh?

655
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,100
Anyway, we need to find those
girls to get our sample case back.

656
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,200
And when we heard Doreen
here, paid Marion's fine.

657
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,446
We thought, well, you girls
might know where they're headed.

658
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,391
How do you know about
it's being Doreen's check?

659
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,580
We have contacts on law enforcement.

660
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,170
No, no. We should just call the cops.

661
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:55,430
We will, Jamie.
First, we should see what's in here.

662
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,450
Why? I don't want to look. Why
do I have to look? Jamie, listen.

663
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,930
Whoever sliced that head
off knows who we are.

664
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,910
This might tell us who they are,
so we won't be at a disadvantage.

665
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,870
The police can buy now,
and the police can protect us.

666
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,450
Protect us? They're not the Secret
Service, and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

667
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,870
What do we lose by looking?

668
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,791
Look, I just want to know what's going on.

669
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,590
This might tell us.

670
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,030
I bet it's locked.

671
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,860
We ought to call the cops.

672
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,820
Why? That was awful.

673
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,900
You just said not to call the cops.

674
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
In ignorance.

675
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,800
No. What is it was true?

676
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,056
The cops could think you're involved.

677
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,240
You just banned that in jail.

678
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
From bankruptcy.

679
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,480
We wouldn't have anything to do with that.

680
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,360
Okay, honey, cool your jets.
Here's what we do.

681
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,200
First, we get to tell a hasty.

682
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,911
How about next time you
let me do all the talking? Sure.

683
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,296
Yes, that's what you're good at.

684
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,036
Well, it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

685
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,600
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

686
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,416
Uh-huh. You think you would have
gotten the address where they're headed?

687
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,900
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

688
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,640
We've got some hard driving to do.

689
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,220
Bye!

690
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,081
Welcome to Okan education order.

691
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,080
Yeah, hi.
We have a room for two right away.

692
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,340
Uh, we do have one available, yes.

693
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,580
How many nights?

694
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,660
Well, tonight and
then we'll play it by ear.

695
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
Take the rainbow
car? Um, sure we do.

696
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,420


697
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,980
Yes, actually, that's
just a Visa specialty card.

698
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,846
Yeah, but they give a
percentage of each purchase

699
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:50,576
to gay, lesbian, black,
transgender, and charity.

700
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
You do that right.

701
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,460
Well, the issue would
be the one to take that.

702
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:55,901
Do you have a super-reinforced
safe with sensitive materials?

703
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,920
We do have in-room safes for
any valuables that you may have.

704
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,580
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right? Uh, yes.

705
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,420
Well, sure. We're friendly
to anyone who wants to stay.

706
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
You have ice.

707
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,570
This is it.

708
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,690
It's at farm road 80.

709
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:22,070
What's the matter?

710
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,710
Afraid of this stuff alive?

711
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,870
It's at farm road 80.

712
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,230
Is this, um, slappies?

713
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,930
Guys, you out?

714
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,410
Have you seen two, um,
non-local women come in here?

715
00:45:58,810 --> 00:45:59,450
That's one of them.

716
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:04,370
I don't see any lessons you'll
kill from a company here about it.

717
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,490
One girl come in here.

718
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,070
She'll be the main high upmost.

719
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,190
I'm ready to let you come
in here and tell her Visa.

720
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,950
Now, that's two.

721
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,570
You know a little bit about your wife.

722
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,410
Oh, I can send Zippy.

723
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,180
Why would these people just be
waiting there in the driveway office?

724
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,576
Well, clearly this was not your
garden variety decapitation.

725
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,178
This was some kind
of a, well, I don't know

726
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,900
what it was, but they
know we have this thus.

727
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
Yeah?

728
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,380
Look, Mary, they can't find us.

729
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,760
Maybe they're waiting for us to find them.

730
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:50,976
That's the only place we know to call.

731
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,880
But why would we get in touch with them?

732
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,240
Set it back, shake them down, which,
incidentally, is not such a bad idea.

733
00:46:58,241 --> 00:46:59,241
Jamie.

734
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,360
Look, I didn't admit extortion.

735
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,700
Jamie, why would Suzanne
help us? She hates you.

736
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960


737
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,500
Oh, she's had two days to cool off.

738
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,800
Get the fuck back in that locker.

739
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,291
Officer Krasig said I
could speak to my attorney.

740
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,800
Attorney, are you a college boy?

741
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,120
Officer Krasig said I
could speak to my lawyer.

742
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,320
Officer Krasig ain't running booking.

743
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,120
I'm running booking, jackass.

744
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,680
You say... You want me to
walk over there with a kid?

745
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:28,640
You're never running ass back
into the Delaware fucking river.

746
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,180
Who's running booking? You are.

747
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,240


748
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:32,800
Who is? You are.

749
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,460


750
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,720
No fucking shit! Shane.

751
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah? Elbow.

752
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,720


753
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300


754
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,220
Sergeant Shinkleman.

755
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,520
Hey, it's me.

756
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,600
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

757
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,040
Cynthia, come on now.

758
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,800
Let's be friends.

759
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,260
Did the two creeps find you?

760
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,860
What?

761
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:51,340
Two weirdos looking for you.

762
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,660
I tried to be helpful.

763
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,820
But who were they?

764
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:55,600
How should I know?

765
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,200
Bill collectors, herpes patients.

766
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,400
Two more people you fucked over somehow.

767
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,460
George and Lenny?

768
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,020
George and Lenny.

769
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,220
A licensee?

770
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,680
Have you read any books?

771
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Books, maybe not.

772
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,876
But, sweetie, I'm going to help
you break a big murder case.

773
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,940
Break a big murder case?

774
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Curly's pregnant?

775
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

776
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,180
Turn that around.

777
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,840
Ask him about the what
and he's how she feels?

778
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,820
Jamie, that is about the
dumbest thing I've ever heard.

779
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,180
And I'm a cop.

780
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,020
Why would I make it up?

781
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,336
Just go to Curly's driveway.

782
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,640
I guarantee you someone's there.

783
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,020
You guarantee I'm supposed to believe you.

784
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,040
Fine, you know what?

785
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,460
If no one's there, take Alice.

786
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,020
Really?

787
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:42,760
Swear? Yes, I swear.

788
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,140


789
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,860
A pussy bromance.

790
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,560
I'll take the dog.

791
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,340
You'll never have to be over there again.

792
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,600
That juke joint, where?

793
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,620
Wetunka, Alabama.

794
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,840
Well, outside of Wetunka,
they hadn't been there,

795
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,480
but a very personable music
lover told us of another juke joint,

796
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,600
fairly close by, called
this... Ah! Called Ikes.

797
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,520


798
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,520
Maybe it's Ikes? It might crash.

799
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900


800
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,540
But whatever, I think the
soccer team was just confused

801
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,480
about which joint
these girls were going to.

802
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,520
So we're going to
draw... Stop saying words.

803
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,040
One of the girls finally
used a credit card.

804
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,980
They arrived in Tallahassee and checked
into a hotel called Elk and Keystone Door.

805
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,860
Tallahassee, I want you
to get your asses over there

806
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,880
and take care of it, right away.

807
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,440
Not a juke joint.

808
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:37,425
You should arrive there early morning.

809
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
I'll meet you there.

810
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,820
Um, a level with you, Chief.

811
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,860
Flint and me could use a little shut-eye.

812
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,100
We have not slouched since
the night before last and we...

813
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Hello? Chief.

814
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:49,880


815
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,400
Who's in Tallahassee? Certainly.

816
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,300
There are a number of places I can recommend
locally or right here at the hotel.

817
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,780
We have espadrilles for casual dining

818
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,460
or we have Baxter's by the pool,

819
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:03,980
which is our more elegant
venue down in the lower level.

820
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,160
Maybe we should stay here.

821
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,000
I wonder if the ice...

822
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,095
This is great, but...

823
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,221
Ladies, sir, are we enjoying
the beverage this evening?

824
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yes.

825
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,860
Uh, can we get some champagne, please?

826
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,131
Like a really, really
good one? Of course.

827
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440


828
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,280
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

829
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah, right away.

830
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,900
So...

831
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:50,480
I've been thinking about it
and... finally dawned on me that

832
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:55,540
you are not the kind of person that a girl
brings to her roadside motel for a quiz.

833
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Now, I have heard of a more soulful sex

834
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,020
where you have a nice
dinner and conversation

835
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,621
first so it all comes out
of someplace deeper,

836
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,060
but I usually have stuff to do.

837
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,740
There is with Billipope 95.

838
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,620
You mean, you want to sleep with me?

839
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,311
Marion, you've got to
have a good, skinny look.

840
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,760
Something I decided last
night while I was lying in bed

841
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:24,100
before I started masturbating,
and I figure if it's more than me,

842
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,081
I should take care of it myself.

843
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:28,456
Especially since with you,

844
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,440
it's got to be with
somebody who cares for you.

845
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,700
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your Clinton adios.

846
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,660
Thank you.

847
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,120
My pleasure.

848
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
Yes, please.

849
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,716
But... is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

850
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,336
I mean, we're good friends, and maybe
it's not supposed to be more than that.

851
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
Maybe we shouldn't have screwed on yet.

852
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,310
Look... you can always
find reasons to not have sex.

853
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Hey, if you think about
them too much, guess what?

854
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
You never have sex.

855
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,120
Exactly.

856
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,501
Like, my high school dad was counseling.

857
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,820
She was always saying that
this or that would be inappropriate.

858
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,500
But when I finally got her to relax...

859
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
the sexual was great.

860
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,060
The ladies will be decided.

861
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,910
Don't rush us, buddy.

862
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,821
First... we'll dance.

863
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,070
Maybe I do...

864
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,490
overthink things.

865
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,350
Yeah.

866
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,771
If I keep that friendly,
I just let that mind fly.

867
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,960
There's this one time I was with Debbie.

868
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,160
I was like,

869
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,680
you know Debbie.

870
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,700
She's got this humongous dildo.

871
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,860
She's got the mountain mountain on
the Black and Acres circular sanders.

872
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,580
And... she had me going.

873
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,396
Like, my brains were going to
come out of the top of my friggin' skull.

874
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,580
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfucker.

875
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,741
Like... One accomplishment.

876
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Name me one.

877
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,600
At least how many are
in a dealing with people?

878
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,560
Those girls wound you up like they tap.

879
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
Flint!

880
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,280
Have you ever fucked a woman?

881
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,960
On a creaking porch swing?

882
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,220
On a warm summer evening?

883
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,660
Crickets?

884
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,240
So forth?

885
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:05,920
I mean, just fuck turn
like there's no tomorrow.

886
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,800
Trousers are on your ankles,

887
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:08,880
belt jangling,

888
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,900
yelling to beat the band, slamming
away like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

889
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,960
Yes, people might stroll by,

890
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,900
so you look at foolish up there,
slapping ham on the veranda.

891
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,480
But that is the price
you pay for interaction.

892
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,620
If this is too messy for you,

893
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,920
then you will spend the rest
of your miserable fucking life

894
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:28,860
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pod.

895
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,280
Can't wait to tell a chief.

896
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah?

897
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,081
And why don't you also tell him
that you're a social fucking imbecile

898
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,360
that I've been carrying on my back all
the way from Philadelphia? Big piece.

899
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,540


900
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,060
Why would anybody
say it clearly? Yes, sir.

901
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,660


902
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,690
Do you have any? I have.

903
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,240
I didn't have it.

904
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,940
Are you... ? No.

905
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Is that good?

906
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,320
Jamie, no!

907
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,600
Jamie, why?

908
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
Oh!

909
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:05,840
Oh!

910
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh, my God!

911
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,740
Mary!

912
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Sir?

913
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
Sir?

914
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
Tell Hassey, sir.

915
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,940
Where to exactly? Ah, yes, um.

916
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,760
..

917
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:22,761
The track.

918
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,280
The boat track? Yes, sir.

919
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,500
Those penises were trouble, Jamie.

920
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Oh, come on.

921
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,300
I thought you were going to loosen up.

922
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,466
You're going to work your
way through all of them?

923
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,380
No. I like this one.

924
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,160
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

925
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,220
Last night was beautiful, but

926
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,856
you fell asleep and I didn't
get my turn on the water slide.

927
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,240
You know what I'm saying?

928
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,240
Okay! Alright!

929
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,640
Hey, Mom!

930
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,000
We're number two!

931
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:50,001
Good thing!

932
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,320
We're going that thing
fucking more off from you!

933
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,480
We're here for two items.

934
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,180
Whoa. She's noticed.

935
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,500
Alright, no big deal. Just mini-lady.

936
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,060
We're here for two items? Yeah.

937
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,380
This, please, and thank you.

938
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,280
And the heads up.

939
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,920
Fuck you! Don't you fucking let her in.

940
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,140
Alright, ladies. Okay, hold on.

941
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
Leave it back to you.

942
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,380
Come on. Go, man.

943
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,040
Okay? Let's get this show on the road.

944
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:26,520
You're such a big, bouncy, beautiful baby.

945
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,020
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

946
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,040
Whoa.

947
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,400
This is so pretty.

948
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,360
Yeah?

949
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,400
I can love you forever.

950
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:40,480
Whoa.

951
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,240
And ever.

952
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:55,241
And ever.

953
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,920
Get straight here.

954
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,060
I haven't debriefed it, Chief.

955
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,780
Figured you wanted to do the talking.

956
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,240
This is all they had.

957
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
What's all they had? Ladies.

958
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,820


959
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,740
You're a day late.

960
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,000
And a dick short.

961
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,740
What are you talking about?

962
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,900
This senator's penis is not in the case.

963
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:43,280
Nothing. Well, it just figures.

964
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,040
Come on, girls.

965
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,720
Where's the last phallus?

966
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,480
You didn't check the case before you left.

967
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,986
I... He's been stepping on his
feet the whole week down, Chief.

968
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,080
What have you
done? Sure, come on.

969
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,896
The guy just ran this
guy's head putting stuff in.

970
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,200
Then gave me the combination
and it still took you 15 minutes.

971
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:06,220
You didn't have the first number.

972
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,150
The senator is a good man.

973
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,290
He spoke marijuana once in college.

974
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:27,790
And he was dead.

975
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,130
It was a different time.

976
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,570
He went to a party and met a hippie chick.

977
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,430
Tiffany Blastercaster.

978
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:42,610
How do you mean?

979
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,670
She took a plaster cast of his excited...

980
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,350
She made one model of each of her.

981
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,610
Old men.

982
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,830
At the time, the senator didn't know that

983
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:04,310
someday he'd be called
on to serve his community,

984
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,670
his state, and perhaps someday...

985
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,770
his nation.

986
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,440
He was just a kid.

987
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,960
His penis... passed
from hand to hand,

988
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:23,500
finally ended up with an international
collector named Alejandro Santos Yolandor.

989
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,780
You saw him.

990
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,620
Sort of.

991
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,180
This penis cannot be of
a piece of merchandise.

992
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
Think of it.

993
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:50,160
eBay, Senator Kerry channels
ding-dong, lightly used.

994
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,740


995
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,700
Comments, reviews.

996
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,200
Think of what it would do to him.

997
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:00,700
His children, his friends, his career.

998
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,280
We're not unreasonable.

999
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,680
We'll gladly pay for it.

1000
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,340
We just... No, you mean that!

1001
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,160
That wasn't my idea!

1002
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,800
I was just trying to keep us awake.

1003
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,040
I was experimenting.

1004
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,140
But you liked it.

1005
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:19,141
I did.

1006
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,520
It was the Irish copy.

1007
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:21,820
I was drunk.

1008
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,180
Drunk, I can't.

1009
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:22,760
No!

1010
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,460
It's not my thing.

1011
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,540
I was just trying to help you
be a man to understand the light.

1012
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:27,980
No!

1013
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:28,740
The stuff!

1014
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,960
No, no!

1015
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
No!

1016
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,780
What are you doing?

1017
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:34,401
Alright, we have to get back to the
hotel and grab the penis out of bed.

1018
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,700
Then, we switch hotels.

1019
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,200
You grab the penis,
I'll meet you in the hotel.

1020
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Okay, Malala and Turner.

1021
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,640
I'll check in under the name, Abzug.

1022
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,180
Where are you going? Our store.

1023
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360


1024
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,630
Thanks, customer, please.

1025
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,070
Shinkleman, we're going to Tallahassee.

1026
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:57,730
Don't ask my line.

1027
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:03,840
I need to speak to the Senator.

1028
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,860
Well, who should I say is calling?

1029
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:13,281
Someone who has
his... personal effects.

1030
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Yes.

1031
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,440
Who is this?

1032
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,840
Somebody who wants a million dollars.

1033
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,181
You can get it by tonight.

1034
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,900
You can have your thing back.

1035
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,300
Everybody's thanks.

1036
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,431
I'll tell you where to bring the money.

1037
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,640
Come alone.

1038
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,740
If you're not alone,

1039
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,760
believe me, I'll know it.

1040
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,161
Someone named Jamie Dolls
made a phone call from here last night.

1041
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,340
Oh, yes.

1042
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,040
Well, this is for her.

1043
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1044
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,560
You missed them.

1045
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,840
Her friend just checked them out.

1046
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,030
Done.

1047
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,250
With what? Tell you later.

1048
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,210


1049
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,450
I'm going to clean up.

1050
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,210
Want to join me? Jamie? I want.

1051
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,440


1052
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,140
..

1053
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,400
I...

1054
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,520
I want...

1055
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,061
What do you want, Shirley?

1056
01:09:40,985 --> 01:09:42,900
I want to make love
with the Senator's penis.

1057
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,660
Who are you?

1058
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,520
Mind if we sit down?

1059
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,230
We didn't deserve this.

1060
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,010
This commodification.

1061
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:49,390
These are all good people.

1062
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,010
Important people, too.

1063
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:52,210
Some of them.

1064
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:56,870
There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.

1065
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:01,050
The owner of a large market football team.

1066
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:03,990
The Supreme Court Justice.

1067
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,840
You, little people,

1068
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,240
didn't make yourselves something
that was never meant for you.

1069
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,750
Trafficking in other
people's attainments.

1070
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,520
Senator, save the safety money.

1071
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,560
And hand over the million smackers.

1072
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,320
I used to believe in the
unfettered free market.

1073
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,230
Who's head, Senator?

1074
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,630
Don't get lofty with me.

1075
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,330
Women.

1076
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,750
Did we do the wrong thing?

1077
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,771
What if he's the next president?

1078
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,370
You girls are cute.

1079
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:00,031
My friends and me are having
a little basement party later.

1080
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,310
You want a joint? Not tonight.

1081
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,950


1082
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,250
Sookie? There you are.

1083
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:17,570


1084
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:19,710
Someone's got crackhead phone call now.

1085
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,050
What? What do you mean?

1086
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,170
How'd you know I'd be here?

1087
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,230
Tell me Dyckbar's out there in Tallahassee.

1088
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,570
What, are you an executive now?

1089
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,551
Did they make you the president
of Little Miss Lyre Band's name?

1090
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:34,850
Oh, this? No, I just...

1091
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:47,530
We thought they didn't know where
we were, but somehow they did,

1092
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,810
and this morning they put us
in the back of a Toyota Tercel

1093
01:13:49,811 --> 01:13:52,930
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure they were gonna kill

1094
01:13:52,931 --> 01:13:54,890
us, but lucky for us, they left
the most important penis behind.

1095
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,750
Wow.

1096
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,010
You had a full day.

1097
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,470
She's yours now.

1098
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,430
Hang on.

1099
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,190
This doesn't look good.

1100
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,640
What's she chasing? Yeah.

1101
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160


1102
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:41,720
We forgot to tell you about the
small guy's head in the hat box.

1103
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,240
Boy, I think I could win against him.

1104
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,960
But now we get to just keep on going.

1105
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,380
Who's gonna complain when we leave the car?

1106
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,740
Things could not have worked out better.

1107
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,880
Well, I guess.

1108
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What's wrong?

1109
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,620
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1110
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:09,440
but I have to
admit, I'll miss us.

1111
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,640


1112
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,100
Don't worry, girl.

1113
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,980
I'm a guest.

1114
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,860
And two puppies.

1115
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,260
Great, but why
two? For each other.

1116
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,460


1117
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,180
Ladies and visitors here.

1118
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,900
Can we get our car? You know.

1119
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:28,960
Hers and hers.

1120
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,220
And Ellis.

1121
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000


1122
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,740
Oh, hello, darling.

1123
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,480
She's your eighth, Anna.

1124
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,020
And we've done better in church.

1125
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,741
Watch what she sees. She's very religious.

1126
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,380
So good to see you.

1127
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,370
This is my friend Jamie.

1128
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,520
Hi, you young lady.

1129
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,476
Is this your first time in
Tallahassee? Yes, ma'am.

1130
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,500


1131
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:53,920
And what a beautiful city.

1132
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,460
Not like Miami.

1133
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,620
Oh, no, no.

1134
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,160
Not like Miami.

1135
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,860
You able to stay with us long?

1136
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,080
No, unfortunately I am.

1137
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,700
We're off to Massachusetts.

1138
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,420
Just decided last night.

1139
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,720
But where do they have in
Massachusetts that we don't have right now?

1140
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,820
Miami and North Florida.

1141
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,960
Women can get married there.

1142
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,960
To each other.

1143
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:25,810
That's an innovation.
