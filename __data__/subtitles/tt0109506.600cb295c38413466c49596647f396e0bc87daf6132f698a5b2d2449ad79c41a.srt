1
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,228
People once believed
that when someone dies,

2
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,981
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,027
But sometimes, something so bad happens

4
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,615
that a terrible sadness is
carried with it, and the soul can't rest.

5
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,452
Then, sometimes, just sometimes,

6
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:21,082
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

7
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,398
I got one here.

8
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,043
Over here.

9
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,092
Hey, Sarge.

10
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,386
Yeah?

11
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,347
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.

12
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,683
Wedding was tomorrow night.

13
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,894
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

14
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,022
Nobody.

15
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,569
-Sir, we gotta move her.
-Do it.

16
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,779
All right, guys. Let's do it.

17
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:37,241
Devil's fucking Night.
What's the count so far?

18
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,659
143 fires.

19
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,536
They're slacking off from last year.

20
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,414
Three hours to go.
Maybe they're just slow starters.

21
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,623
Coming through.

22
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,463
Yeah, I realize that,

23
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,798
but you can't come in here
and take her away like this.

24
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,342
There are procedures to stick by.

25
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,761
You guys should have cleared this
with me first.

26
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,512
Is this the victim?

27
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,847
No, it's Amelia Earhart.

28
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,557
We found her, Detective,
and you missed it.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,810
I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.

30
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,147
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see why
they took away your gold shield.

31
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,524
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

32
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,278
All right. Clear out of here.

33
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,698
-Shelly?
-Stand back, kid.

34
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,329
-Where's Eric?
-Just don't worry about him.

35
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,583
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,003
Look, I will. You just lie back.
Come on. Come on.

37
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,557
-Are you Sarah?
-Yeah.

38
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:47,686
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

39
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,772
She's not my sister.

40
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,066
Shelly just takes care of me.

41
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,692
She's my friend.

42
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,111
Her and Eric.

43
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,949
You lied to her about Eric.

44
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,617
Look, I had to.

45
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,328
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

46
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,832
She's gonna die, isn't she?

47
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,086
Hey.

48
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,801
Now, come on. Come on. It's--

49
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,220
I promise. It's okay.

50
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,058
She's gonna be fine.

51
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:49,457
A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.

52
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,792
I used to think
that was true about everything.

53
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,796
Families, friends, feelings.

54
00:04:56,505 --> 00:05:00,384
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real,

55
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,930
two people who are meant to be together--
nothing can keep them apart.

56
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,792
Later.

57
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,137
What are you, like the night watchman?

58
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:13,082
You know, what this place needs
is a good, natural catastrophe.

59
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,544
Earthquake, tornado-- you know?

60
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,046
No, no. Mickey, come on, man.

61
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,090
You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

62
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,467
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

63
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,469
Hey, come on. Let me do it.

64
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,265
There we go. All right.

65
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,724
How about some onions?

66
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,268
Come on. Come on, man.

67
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,019
Don't cheap out on me. Lots of onions.

68
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,229
All right. Here you go.

69
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,690
All right.

70
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,941
Now we're talking.

71
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,654
Hey, it's a Sarah monster.

72
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,699
How do you steer that thing
on a wet street?

73
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,867
Pure talent. Hi.

74
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,371
See, now, Sarah,
she's a genuine hotdogger. You hungry?

75
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,748
-You buying?
-I'm buying.

76
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,335
-No onions though, okay?
-No onions?

77
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,170
They make you fart big-time.

78
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,723
You know,
Lake Erie actually caught on fire once

79
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,975
from all the crap floating around in it.

80
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,520
I wish I could have seen that.

81
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:23,253
-Fire it up!
-Yeah! Yeah!

82
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,212
All right. We busted that machine.

83
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,296
Boom!

84
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,656
Oh, shit, guys. T-Bird. Cop car. Cop car.

85
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,499
Bad people out on the street tonight.

86
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,923
-Damn it.
-Oh, my God!

87
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,008
What was that?

88
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,010
-You wait right here.
-Be careful.

89
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,720
Mickey, call it in for me.

90
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,388
Gabriel.

91
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,483
Eric?

92
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,569
Department of Housing.

93
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,573
Code violations? Safety hazards?

94
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,284
Place looks fine to me.

95
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,451
Let's redecorate.

96
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,629
"Abashed the Devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is."

97
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,049
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely--"

98
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,676
It's pornography.

99
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,761
Virtue?

100
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,683
Shelly?

101
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,770
-No! Eric!
-See ya!

102
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,691
No, no, no, no. Me first.

103
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,653
Please.

104
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,949
-Shelly.
-Eric.

105
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,241
-Hey, that's good.
-That's good.

106
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,207
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

107
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,502
Look at that. Look at that.

108
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:19,174
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favorite holiday.

109
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,342
To Devil's Night.

110
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,972
Baby, you need to go over there
and talk to your pals.

111
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,141
You sick fuck.

112
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,895
Are you out of
your motherfucking mind, man?

113
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,027
And look at that!

114
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,823
Pussies drink last, man.

115
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,034
Fuck you, Tin Tin.

116
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,452
Hey.

117
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,580
That shit ain't even loaded, man.

118
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,541
This one is.

119
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:59,631
Which of you Motor City motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

120
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,300
Hey!

121
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,970
-Fire it up!
-Fire it up!

122
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,055
-Fire it up!
-Fire it up!

123
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,266
-Fire it up!
-Fire it up!

124
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,018
Fire it up!

125
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,104
Here's your shooters.

126
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,231
-Put your guns away, guys.
-How you doing?

127
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,649
Pussycat.

128
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,298
Boo.

129
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,936
- I love you.
-Say that again.

130
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,396
I love you.

131
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,066
Oh, boy.

132
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,194
Restaurant.

133
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,285
Wow, you look great.

134
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,875
Yeah.

135
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,671
-Come here.
-No! No! No!

136
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,813
Couple more rings. That's 24K.

137
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,357
24K, huh? It's 18K.

138
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,443
It's crap. It's probably fake.

139
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,862
Leather purse. Leather.

140
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,448
Geez.

141
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,951
What is this, Tin Tin?
A bloodstain that's on here?

142
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,624
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

143
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,918
Now, you can take it or leave it.

144
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,962
Right there for you.

145
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,425
Decisions, decisions. Yes, right.

146
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,722
Cheap-ass, chrome-dome,

147
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,142
child-molesting, saprophyte motherfucker.

148
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,602
Close the gate when you go out!

149
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,939
I close this up for you real good, massa.

150
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,649
Fuck you.

151
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,070
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

152
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,202
You're lucky I didn't stab your fat ass.

153
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,644
What the fuck you all painted up for,
crackhead. Huh?

154
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,818
Halloween ain't till manana.

155
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,698
Come on.

156
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,988
Fuck! You murderer!

157
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,492
I didn't murder nobody, man.
I don't even fucking know you, man.

158
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,496
-What the fuck you want, man?
-I want you to tell me a story.

159
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,790
A man and a woman in a loft a year ago.

160
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,502
-You're out of your motherfucking mind--
-Listen!

161
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:57,549
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them on Halloween.

162
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,759
Yeah, yeah. Right. Halloween, yeah.

163
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,053
Some dude, some bitch-- Whatever, man.

164
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,389
Her name was Shelly.

165
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,017
You cut her. You raped her.

166
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,686
Shelly, yeah. Yeah.

167
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,273
I shanked her pink ass, and she loved it!

168
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,576
Murder, man.

169
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,036
Murder? Let me tell you about murder.

170
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,246
It's fun.

171
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,123
It's easy.

172
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,959
You gonna learn all about it.

173
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,216
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

174
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,553
We never miss.

175
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,023
Try harder. Try again.

176
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,281
Victims.

177
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,074
Aren't we all?

178
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:21,883
Sometimes it rains inside my head

179
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,970
All the words run dry

180
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:30,225
Walls are breathing, hands are reaching up

181
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,353
Look at this mess.
What's the world coming to?

182
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,604
Yeah, it's a mess.

183
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,857
To touch my thigh

184
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,487
No, they don't have to take you away

185
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,739
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

186
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:49,410
No, they don't have to take you away

187
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,996
Get out of my way, you worms!

188
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,374
No, they don't have to take you away

189
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,875
Give me some of that over there.

190
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,755
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

191
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,466
Hey, guess what?

192
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,637
-Arcade Games fell down, went boom.
-Boom.

193
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,557
Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

194
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:15,395
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

195
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,147
-Is the man in?
-He's taking a meeting.

196
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,430
You're thinking about the past.

197
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,853
Dad gave me this.

198
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,397
Fifth birthday.

199
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:05,737
He said, "Childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die."

200
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,628
Is she asleep?

201
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,637
I think we broke her.

202
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,518
I love her eyes.

203
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,646
Pretty.

204
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,490
No, they don't have to take you away

205
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,581
Hey, kid, get the hell out of the road!

206
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,273
I told you to stay out of here.

207
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:28,152
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

208
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,445
She's busy.

209
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,240
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

210
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,658
I don't have any dolls.

211
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,079
Get some food.

212
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,081
Somebody already bought me dinner.

213
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,165
The police.

214
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,716
"Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."

215
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,984
Who the fuck is this now?

216
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:12,238
Hey! Piss off! We're closed!

217
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,656
Cerrado!

218
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,870
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dust head,
unless you want to get mutilated.

219
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,626
I'm gonna blow this guy's dick off.

220
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,714
Goddamn creatures of the night.
They never learn.

221
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:33,968
Hey! Hey!

222
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,726
"Suddenly I heard a tapping,

223
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,772
as if someone gently rapping--
rapping at my chamber door."

224
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,109
What the fuck are you talking about?

225
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,820
You heard me rapping, right?

226
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:54,906
You're trespassing,

227
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,034
and you owe me a fucking new door!

228
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,456
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

229
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,540
-Yeah?
-Gold.

230
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,210
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

231
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,673
Oh, shit.

232
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,426
Shit on me!

233
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,305
Shit on me. Shit on me!

234
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,689
Mr. Gideon, you're not paying attention.

235
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,112
No! My hand!

236
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:40,743
I repeat: A gold engagement ring, yes?

237
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,581
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

238
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,879
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

239
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,970
So who's this sack of shit?

240
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:02,306
That's Tin Tin,
one of T-Bird's little helpers.

241
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,809
I think you can rule out accidental death.

242
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,312
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

243
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,147
This could be a turf hit,

244
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,316
but it doesn't look like
your usual gang crap.

245
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,193
Come on, Albrecht. Spare me.

246
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,363
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

247
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,365
I'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

248
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:23,202
Word to the wise:
Watch your fucking mouth.

249
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,205
What the hell do you call that?

250
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,459
I call it blood, Detective.

251
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,796
I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.

252
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,133
You can leave my crime scene now, okay?

253
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,809
-Warmer?
-What are you doing?

254
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,520
-Don't you know this game?
-What game are you talking about?

255
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,481
All right, the rings!
I'll tell you about the rings!

256
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,610
They're in that metal box.
It's under the shelf there.

257
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,405
Take them. Take the fucking rings!

258
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,742
You can chew them, and you can choke
on them, you son of a bitch!

259
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,748
-Look, it goes up to the attic.
-Okay.

260
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,593
No, no, no.

261
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,929
No, no.

262
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,644
It's beautiful. I don't believe it.

263
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,107
Shelly.

264
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,660
I love you.

265
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,629
-You have one chance to live.
-Look, man, take anything you want.

266
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,089
-Thank you.
-Take anything!

267
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,929
Now you're gonna tell me where to find
the rest of Tin Tin's little party pals.

268
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,931
The Pit. They all hang out at The Pit.

269
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,725
All of T-Bird's little potato heads
hang out there.

270
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,061
Funboy, he lives there--
upstairs, all right?

271
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,188
Funboy.

272
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,148
Oh, baby.

273
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,860
A whole jolly club...

274
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,822
-Stop! Jesus, stop.
-...with jolly pirate nicknames.

275
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,533
-Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
-Hold still!

276
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:30,621
Each one of these is a life.

277
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,207
A life you helped destroy.

278
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,876
I'm begging you, all right. Don't kill me.

279
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,838
I'm not gonna kill you.

280
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:43,884
Your job will be to tell the rest of them
that death is coming for them.

281
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,302
Tonight.

282
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,979
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

283
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:02,153
You walk out of here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

284
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,572
You're nothing but street grease,
you hear?

285
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,866
Street grease, you motherfucker!

286
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,659
Is that gasoline I smell?

287
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,744
No, man.

288
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,496
No! No! No!

289
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,207
No!

290
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,517
On the house, kiddo. You know that.

291
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,686
Root beer.

292
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,816
I can't do anything.

293
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,988
Your mom, technically,
she's off right now.

294
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,115
Yeah, way off.

295
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,832
Police! Don't move. I said don't move.

296
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,795
I thought the police
always said, "freeze."

297
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,547
Well, I am the police,
and I say don't move, Snow White.

298
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,799
You move, you're dead.

299
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:10,054
And I say I'm dead and I move.

300
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,432
Not one more step. I'm serious.

301
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,853
Then shoot, if you will, Officer Albrecht.

302
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,065
What are you, nuts? Walking into a gun?

303
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:22,858
You high?

304
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,485
You don't remember me?

305
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,028
What are you talking about?

306
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,199
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

307
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,827
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

308
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,829
I want you to move over to the curb there.

309
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,539
Come on, real nice and easy.

310
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,623
Come on. Move it!

311
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,044
We're gonna wait here for backup.

312
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,880
It's getting too frigging weird for me.

313
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,049
It gets better.

314
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,468
Do you know someone named T-Bird?

315
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:52,388
He had a friend
who shouldn't have played with knives.

316
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,223
Like the coat?

317
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,891
You're the guy that murdered Tin Tin.

318
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,434
Check it out.

319
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,062
He was already dead.

320
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,150
He died a year ago,
the moment he touched her.

321
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,655
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

322
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,158
Get away from there!

323
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,827
-Cops!
-Come on. Get out of here!

324
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,997
Leave it. Leave it. Run!

325
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,379
Oh, great.

326
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,339
Great.

327
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,718
Guy shows up
looking like a mime from hell,

328
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,095
and you lose him right out in the open.

329
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,139
Well,

330
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,434
at least he didn't do
that walking-against-the-wind shit.

331
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,518
I hate that.

332
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,103
Little early for Devil's Night.

333
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,522
What the hell is going on here?

334
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,318
You are very restless.

335
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,404
I just wish I was a little hungry again,
that's all.

336
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,658
-Be careful what you ask for.
-Yeah, you may get it. I know.

337
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,924
There are energies aligning against you.

338
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,051
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

339
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,481
Yummy.

340
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,491
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.

341
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,077
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

342
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,079
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

343
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,623
I'm sure you must be awful disappointed.

344
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,877
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.

345
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,255
-Yeah? And who might that be?
-Tin Tin.

346
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,966
Somebody stuck his blades
in all his major organs

347
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,884
in alphabetical order.

348
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,511
Well, gentlemen, by all means,

349
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,431
I think we ought to have an introspective
moment of silence for poor old Tin Tin.

350
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,020
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

351
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:09,984
-Whatever you say, I can do.
-Good. That's very reassuring.

352
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,612
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

353
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:19,368
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

354
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,328
Call it my need to know.

355
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,238
Let me go, you creep!

356
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,619
Yeah.

357
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,080
You didn't slow down, dickhead!

358
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,710
He couldn't have stopped.

359
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,004
He was a butt face. I could have made it.

360
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,717
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

361
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,969
Sometimes.

362
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,640
It's more like surfing than skating.

363
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,768
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

364
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,812
It can't rain all the time.

365
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,856
Eric?

366
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,333
Don't thank me.

367
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,419
Are we fighting the good fight?

368
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:56,215
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

369
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,676
Annie, look at that.

370
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:05,474
"We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 Caulderon Court apartments--"

371
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,767
What is this, a petition?

372
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,728
A big kick-me sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause,

373
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,230
and a cause that got her killed.

374
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,899
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

375
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:19,196
Shelly Webster and her
nice rock-and-roll boyfriend Eric Draven.

376
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,782
You know, the last time
you went snooping around on a case

377
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,492
is when you got put back on the beat.

378
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,579
-Yeah, I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
-I bet he does.

379
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,298
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

380
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,010
-I'm cool.
-You didn't get that file from me, okay?

381
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,680
And don't tell me you owe me one.

382
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,393
-I owe you one.
-Yeah, right.

383
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,478
Damn.

384
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:21,383
Tomorrow night, we can-- we can get high

385
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:25,304
and watch this whole fucking city burn
from that window.

386
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,789
There's a big fucking bird over there.

387
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,170
It's a squab.

388
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,381
Come here, bird.

389
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,759
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

390
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,178
Bird. Birdie.

391
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,847
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie.

392
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,892
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie.

393
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,813
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

394
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,942
Here, Funboy.

395
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,696
What the fuck?

396
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,120
No, man! Don't do that!

397
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,082
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

398
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,211
Don't sweat it.

399
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,092
It's time for you to take your bird
and leave, freako.

400
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,061
Take your shot, Funboy.

401
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,854
You got me dead bang.

402
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,193
You are seriously fucked-up.

403
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,237
Did you look in the mirror?

404
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,407
I mean, you need professional help.

405
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,995
Bingo!

406
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,914
He shoots! He scores!

407
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:30,721
-Jesus Christ.
-Jesus Christ.

408
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,556
Stop me if you heard this one.

409
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,850
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

410
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,734
He hands the innkeeper three nails
and he asks...

411
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,362
Don't you ever fucking die?

412
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,239
"Can you put me up for the night?"

413
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,289
-Does that hurt?
-Fuck.

414
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,374
Yes, it fucking hurt.

415
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,918
Oh, God.

416
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:06,006
Look what you've done to my sheets.

417
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,282
I've got a gun in my pocket.

418
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,953
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

419
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:59,685
Stay away! Stay away from me!

420
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,397
No!

421
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,652
Look.

422
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:15,909
"Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.”

423
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,327
Do you understand?

424
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,747
Morphine is bad for you.

425
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,637
Your daughter is out there on the streets
waiting for you.

426
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,172
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

427
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,339
Now fill it up!

428
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,219
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

429
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,554
I really need this.

430
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,481
All right.

431
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,485
You burn yourself playing with matches?

432
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,653
-Fuck off.
-You have an appointment.

433
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,698
-Well, shit on me.
-Drink up.

434
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,701
This is a first. Do I bow or do I curtsy?

435
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:42,579
Now, get my friend here a glass of blood.

436
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:44,915
Hey. Hey, hon.

437
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,626
Hey, good night, Darla.

438
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,175
You stay put. Right there.

439
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:06,311
Get away, steam head.

440
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:42,806
As you can see, I'm here on the corner
of 27th street and East Washington Place,

441
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,142
the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

442
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,561
It was exactly one year ago

443
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,896
that the building you see
across the street from me

444
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,023
was totally demolished by fire--

445
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,943
A fire that was fought
by seven fire companies.

446
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,945
We lost the lives of two firefighters.

447
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,073
In fact, if it weren't for
the constant surveillance

448
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,700
by the local police precinct...

449
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:02,784
Freeze!

450
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,872
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

451
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,375
Fuck.

452
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,546
Good likeness.

453
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,300
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

454
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,635
You still have your hat on.

455
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:25,390
I gotta sit down.

456
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:28,810
Shit.

457
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,146
Holy shit.

458
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,441
Say...

459
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:40,780
are you some kind of ghost?

460
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,240
Boo!

461
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,334
I don't know what I am.

462
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,961
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

463
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,300
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

464
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:04,220
She was beaten and raped.

465
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,680
Died at the hospital.

466
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,892
Hey, you asked, man.

467
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,685
I mean, come on. Read the file.

468
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:16,024
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours
in intensive care,

469
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,485
and her body finally just gave it up.

470
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,988
I saw it, man. I couldn't do jack for her.

471
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,043
-Hey.
-Don't touch me!

472
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,130
Hey.

473
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:44,761
-You okay?
-I saw her.

474
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,683
I saw her through your eyes.

475
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,727
You stayed with her the whole time.

476
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:57,607
Yeah, well, you got to understand
something, all right?

477
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,029
I was-- I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.

478
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,698
Give me something I could work with.

479
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:07,826
Yeah.

480
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,371
Look, I--

481
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,957
Why didn't you do something about it?

482
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,875
You think any of those people
in that building,

483
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,170
even the ones who signed the petition,
would talk after what happened to you?

484
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:22,882
I kept asking questions

485
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,928
and finally got busted for
sticking my nose where it wasn't wanted.

486
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,225
This your wife?

487
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,979
Yeah, we-- Well, not anymore.

488
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,480
We're getting a divorce.

489
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,442
It's funny.

490
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:45,655
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

491
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,408
I used to think they were kind of trivial.

492
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,661
Believe me. Nothing is trivial.

493
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:06,051
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

494
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,976
Are you gonna vanish into thin air again?

495
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:20,774
I thought I'd use your front door.

496
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,653
Look, man,

497
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:30,200
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

498
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:32,660
Yeah.

499
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,627
Yeah.

500
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,173
I got stabbed. I shot the son of a bitch.

501
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,509
I watched the bullet hole close by itself.

502
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,428
And then I heard that my business
gets blown up real good.

503
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,224
-Other than that, my day sucked.
-Yeah.

504
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:57,060
I saw him too. He had a guitar.

505
00:48:57,143 --> 00:49:01,564
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

506
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,108
He winked at you?

507
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,360
Musicians.

508
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,029
What else did you see?

509
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:11,157
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're going to do about all this crap.

510
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,742
I mean, what do I get?

511
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:16,162
My livelihood--
it got flushed away and went swirling.

512
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,208
You ain't lost everything.

513
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,545
Yeah, and maybe
you're not such a big shot either!

514
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,380
Jesus!

515
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,507
Fair enough.

516
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,634
Catch.

517
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,595
Jesus.

518
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:35,098
Say hello to the last fella
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

519
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,058
What, are you telling me
this thing is real?

520
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:40,645
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

521
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,731
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

522
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,444
You know, you're directly
out of your fucking mind! You know that?

523
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:51,865
Yeah.

524
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,449
Eyes see.

525
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,120
It's one of the most important things
I learned from my sister.

526
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,830
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?

527
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,959
My father's daughter. That's right.

528
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:05,670
What's the matter?
You don't see the resemblance?

529
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:11,593
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.
In a lot of detail.

530
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:12,969
What do you say?

531
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,472
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

532
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:20,101
He told me to tell T-Bird
that death was on its way.

533
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,395
Whatever the fuck that means. And--

534
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:26,232
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

535
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:28,776
Want to relax that thing now?

536
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,822
And this bird man--
He just happened to let you live, huh?

537
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,744
You sure you ain't making all of this up
just to save your own ass?

538
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,663
I ain't making all this up.

539
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,584
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

540
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,005
All right.

541
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:55,803
A boy and his bird.

542
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,848
Awful touching.

543
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:00,642
Yeah.

544
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,694
For fuck's sake, die, will you?

545
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:12,779
Give me that thing.

546
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:20,703
Thanks.

547
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,831
Funboy said he saw a black bird too.

548
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,708
A big one.

549
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:29,170
Then he choked to death on his own blood.

550
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,549
I'll have the janitor come on up.

551
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,157
You again.

552
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,993
Are you lost or hungry?

553
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:43,578
Hi.

554
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:05,475
I don't know how many times
I gotta tell you. We're in this together.

555
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,227
If we ain't, and one part falls,
it all falls.

556
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,481
You know how long it took us
to put this together.

557
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,565
Yeah, a long time.

558
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,234
That piece of rat shit made Tin Tin
into a fucking voodoo doll!

559
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,694
Tin Tin was a dick.

560
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,738
Tin Tin...

561
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,492
-Fire it up!
-Fire it up!

562
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,744
-Fire it up!
-Fire it up!

563
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,120
Fire it up!

564
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,376
No Funboy.

565
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:35,380
Probably still banging away on Darla.

566
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,429
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.

567
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:45,932
I'm on it.

568
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:20,174
What the fuck are you supposed to be, man?

569
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,137
I'm your passenger.

570
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,271
Drive.

571
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,820
What's all this happy horseshit?

572
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,030
Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!

573
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:51,706
-Oh, shit!
-What the fuck's the matter with you?

574
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,168
Stupid ass hair! You hit my car!

575
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:07,180
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

576
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,684
We could use you. You did Tin Tin.

577
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,019
That's business, right?

578
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:14,854
Faster.

579
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,150
You got that cream stuff?

580
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,489
I hate this.
You can't even call it cream legally.

581
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:26,699
What in the crap?

582
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:35,249
Look. You're making us popular.

583
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,127
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

584
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:46,719
This is vehicle 48.
We got us a big, old, red hot rod.

585
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:50,389
T-Bird?

586
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:56,062
If you got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out, right?

587
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:03,945
Damn! Dead end!

588
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,368
Look out!

589
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,749
Get out of the way!

590
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,682
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

591
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,437
Shit!

592
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,699
I hate this. This ain't good.

593
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:53,536
T-Bird! I got you, man. I'm coming.

594
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,913
Shit!

595
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,379
Oh, man!

596
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:05,464
Help me--

597
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:12,972
Remember? Yeah, I remember everything.
But I don't know--

598
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,557
What? What?

599
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:19,103
What? What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no.

600
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,188
You mean that place downtown?

601
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,273
Yeah, I remember her.

602
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,275
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

603
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,653
She wasn't going along with
our tenant relocation program.

604
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,363
And her idiot boyfriend shows up

605
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,576
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear
into a total clusterfuck!

606
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,537
Who gives a shit? It's ancient history.

607
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:38,414
Why? What do you want?

608
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:42,043
What is it? What? Speak to me. Speak!

609
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,589
Did you send us these complaints?

610
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,594
Come here. "Abashed the Devil stood--"

611
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,512
Does it get you sweaty?

612
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:55,890
I know you.

613
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:00,811
I know you. I knew I knew you.
I knew I knew you.

614
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,439
But you ain't you.

615
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,900
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.

616
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,902
There ain't no coming back.

617
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,113
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

618
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:13,532
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

619
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:17,578
T-Bird--

620
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:21,123
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

621
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,675
"Abashed the Devil stood

622
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,969
and felt how awful goodness is."

623
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:37,264
"And felt how awful goodness is."

624
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:53,906
T-Bird.

625
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,542
This is the 7:00 a.m. edition
of Action News.

626
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,336
For over a decade,
the night before Halloween

627
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,382
has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city, "Devil's Night--"

628
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:56,927
The name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.

629
00:59:57,011 --> 01:00:00,222
Last year, 200 individual blazes
were reported,

630
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,349
and 11 people lost their lives.

631
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,976
Tonight, on the eve

632
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,688
of what may become the biggest
and deadliest Devil's Night ever,

633
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:11,275
the mayor has firefighters
from all surrounding counties...

634
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,154
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

635
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,992
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

636
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,536
Wait. You loved eggs.

637
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,289
Yeah, when I was five.

638
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,209
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

639
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,046
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

640
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:37,718
It wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

641
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:38,886
Who?

642
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,057
It was nuts.

643
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:45,810
You're acting weird.

644
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:48,229
Did you win the lottery
or something, Darla?

645
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:52,525
Forget it.

646
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,653
I never was too good at this mommy shit.

647
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:57,947
Over easy.

648
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:04,161
I like them over easy, Mom.

649
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:16,757
Hey, Albrecht.

650
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,514
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

651
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,600
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.

652
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,853
We're gonna have to ID his teeth.

653
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,896
His name is T-Bird.

654
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,231
Arson was his specialty.

655
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,984
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

656
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,487
-Case closed.
-Bull-fucking-shit.

657
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,656
Come here.

658
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,996
You're holding out on me.

659
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,875
I got a goddamn vigilante Killer
knocking off scumbags left and right,

660
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,376
and you're covering up for somebody.

661
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,422
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

662
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:59,174
Hey, you're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?

663
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:02,678
Okay. Gideon's blows all to hell, and
you're having a chitchat with some weirdo

664
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,556
who winds up in T-Bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

665
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,017
Then you steal one of my case files
from homicide,

666
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,603
and you're saying this is just
a fucking automobile accident?

667
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:13,147
-Come on!
-Yeah. Good speech though.

668
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,065
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

669
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,650
You gotta write that shit down.

670
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,111
All right, smart-ass.

671
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,239
The captain's got
a little love note waiting for you.

672
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,950
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.

673
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:26,243
Suspension?

674
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,455
-For what?
-Misconduct.

675
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,126
Yeah, give me the lab.

676
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,554
One for sorrow, two for joy.

677
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,391
-Come here.
-Three for a girl and four for a boy.

678
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,522
Dancing--

679
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,765
Eric?

680
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,646
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

681
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,691
Gabriel.

682
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:24,069
I thought you were dead.

683
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,239
You're not dead, are you?

684
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,975
I knew it was you.

685
01:04:58,437 --> 01:04:59,813
Even with the makeup.

686
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,780
I remembered your song.

687
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:11,450
You said, "Can't rain all the time."

688
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,036
That is from your song, right?

689
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,008
Come on, Eric. I know you're here.

690
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,056
I miss you. And Shelly.

691
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,771
I get so lonely all by myself.

692
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:47,653
To hell with you. I thought you cared.

693
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,281
Sarah, I do care.

694
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,711
That's him. That's him.

695
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,046
But he looked different.

696
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,340
He was all painted up white
like some kind of dead whore.

697
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,593
I seen him. T-Bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

698
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:14,096
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

699
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,099
And he flash fried T-Bird
to his fucking car!

700
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,561
T-Bird! Here's to you, buddy.

701
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,606
Maybe we ought to just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.

702
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,777
Fire it up! Fire it up!

703
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:30,487
-You see the grave?
-Fire it up!

704
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,739
-Empty.
-Fire it--

705
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,159
Grave? What grave?

706
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,452
What about my fucking grave?

707
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,538
Three out of the four.

708
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:42,207
He's working his way
back to this speed freak right here.

709
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:46,170
It's not fair. It's Funboy's fault.
That boy was out of control.

710
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:49,381
T-Bird, he came in.
He says, "Waste them both."

711
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:51,550
And now this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

712
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,765
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

713
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,643
<i>-This ghost gonna kill--
Hey.</i>

714
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,563
It ain't no ghost.

715
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,233
They have all arrived.

716
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:09,443
Watch him.

717
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,695
We might need him.

718
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,781
Ghost gonna kill my...

719
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,923
He like his plain or with onions?

720
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:35,135
Fine. Don't talk to me.

721
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:39,348
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

722
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:42,351
That's what I thought.

723
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:45,479
Are you referring to anyone in particular?

724
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,231
You'll just think I'm nuts.

725
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,192
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

726
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:52,945
You see him too?

727
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:56,949
I saw somebody.

728
01:07:57,866 --> 01:07:59,785
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

729
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,789
Eric didn't come back for me.

730
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:07,751
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

731
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,255
You want a friend to walk you home?

732
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,516
You things, things, things of the flesh

733
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,269
Do it slow

734
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:11,648
Down avenues, cut me

735
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:14,651
Lust my eyes

736
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:21,742
Licking lips, encouraging Mr. Careworn

737
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:25,996
To gaze upon a screen

738
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:30,083
Bask on after the flesh

739
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:46,850
Boys.

740
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:52,272
It seems our friend T-Bird
won't be joining us this evening

741
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:54,649
on account of a slight case of death.

742
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,360
You wanna sit down?

743
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:01,782
Well, well, well.

744
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,159
Devil's Night is upon us again.

745
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,870
I thought we'd throw a little party,

746
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,290
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

747
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:12,584
I like the pretty lights.

748
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,466
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

749
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,176
That's no reason to quit.

750
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:24,763
Wrong. Best reason to quit.

751
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,224
Only reason to quit.

752
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:31,436
A man has an idea.

753
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:36,650
The idea attracts others, like-minded.

754
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,528
The idea expands.

755
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:43,198
The idea becomes an institution.

756
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:45,951
What was the idea?

757
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,788
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.

758
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,666
And I'll tell you. When I used to think
about the idea itself,

759
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,043
it put a big old smile on my face.

760
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,088
You see, gentlemen,

761
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:02,217
greed is for amateurs.

762
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:08,223
Disorder, chaos, anarchy--

763
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,350
Now, that's fun!

764
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:13,478
-What about Devil's Night?
-What about it?

765
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:16,940
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

766
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:20,110
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit heel was imitating me.

767
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,654
Do you know what they got now?

768
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,700
Devil's Night greeting cards.

769
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,995
Isn't that precious?

770
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,038
Yeah.

771
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:37,627
The idea has become the institution, boys.

772
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:40,046
Time to move along.

773
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,549
You don't want us to do
light-my-fire time for the whole city?

774
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:43,925
No.

775
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,971
No, I want you to set a fire
so goddamn big

776
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,639
the gods will notice us again.

777
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:51,266
-That's what I'm saying.
-Right.

778
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:54,561
I want all of you boys to be able to
look me straight in the eye one more time

779
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,440
and say, "Are we having fun or what?"

780
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:02,319
Hey, you! What's your name?
Skank! You don't feel that?

781
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,279
I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook.

782
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,283
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fucking hook."

783
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:11,953
Well, boy, your mama must be
damn proud of you!

784
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:17,751
How the hell did that thing get in here?

785
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,504
Gentlemen.

786
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:26,384
Let me go. Let me go. I gotta go.

787
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:34,726
Well, you're him, huh? The avenger.

788
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,270
The killer of killers.

789
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:38,980
Nice outfit.

790
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,317
I'm not sure about the face though.

791
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,486
I just want him.

792
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,948
Well, you can't have him.

793
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,658
Well...

794
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:55,247
I see you have made your decision.

795
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,792
Now let's see you enforce it.

796
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,378
This is already boring the shit out of me.
Kill him!

797
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:02,546
-All right.
-Go!

798
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,304
That had to hurt.

799
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,225
Well, that's that.

800
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,019
That guy was crazy.

801
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:26,111
He's gone.

802
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:36,121
Get him!

803
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,725
Here. Help me.
He's coming to try to kill me.

804
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:02,772
Jesus Christ!

805
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,165
Hey!

806
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,992
You're all going to die here.

807
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,717
Get the fuck out of here!

808
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,549
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?

809
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:55,885
I'm not Skank. There's Skank right there.

810
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,304
Skank's dead.

811
01:15:58,388 --> 01:15:59,806
That's right.

812
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:00,849
No!

813
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:09,983
What in the crap?

814
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,069
-Don't move!
-Hold it!

815
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,656
That's all she wrote. Move and we shoot.

816
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:29,419
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

817
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:34,758
Stop running immediately.

818
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:35,842
Holy shit!

819
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,469
...and spread your arms and legs...

820
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:45,602
Repeat. Stop immediately.

821
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,188
Lie down and spread your arms and legs...

822
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:33,900
Come on! Move it!

823
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,866
My advice: Next time, duck.

824
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,246
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.

825
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:50,792
Shit!

826
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,633
I knew you were gonna do that.

827
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,302
Look at that out there.

828
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,180
The whole city ought to be
in flames by now.

829
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,975
The sky ought to be red.

830
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:11,855
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

831
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:17,193
He has power,
but it is power you can take from him.

832
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,487
I like him already.

833
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:22,240
The crow is his link

834
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:27,620
between the land of the living
and the realm of the dead.

835
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:32,250
So, kill the crow and destroy the man.

836
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:00,069
I'm coming home, Shelly.

837
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,496
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery

838
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,039
in the middle of the night, right?

839
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,874
Safest place in the world to be.

840
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,460
It's 'cause everybody's dead.

841
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,712
I knew you'd come here.

842
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,049
It's really late, Sarah.

843
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,385
You didn't say goodbye.

844
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:09,555
You're just gonna have to
forgive me for that.

845
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:13,184
And you're never coming back.

846
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,820
I gave this to Shelly once.

847
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,035
I think she'd like you to have it.

848
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,750
This way, you'll always remember her.

849
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,420
I'll never take it off.

850
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,274
I better go sneak back in the house.

851
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,491
Bye.

852
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,602
Take it easy, sweetheart.

853
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,527
Come on. Come on.

854
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,420
What is that? Some sort of souvenir there
from your pal, huh?

855
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:09,133
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

856
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:18,893
Her eyes are so innocent.

857
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,405
Eric!

858
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,699
Eric, help! Eric!

859
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,411
Quick impression for you.

860
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,914
Caw! Caw! Bang! Fuck, I'm dead!

861
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:26,043
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

862
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:29,297
Well, well.

863
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,008
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that, huh?

864
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,269
Nah. Fuck it.

865
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,863
Oh, fuck.

866
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:02,830
Well, well, well.

867
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:06,834
It does seem to me that our little life
has undergone a rather significant change

868
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:08,169
in the past few minutes now.

869
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,587
Wouldn't you agree?

870
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:17,303
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

871
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,100
-It's still alive.
-Well, then Kill it!

872
01:24:25,353 --> 01:24:26,646
Bye-bye, birdie.

873
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,651
Oh, shit.

874
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,487
Well, I just came by to pay my respects

875
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,406
and here you are
getting all shot up again.

876
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:21,075
-They've taken Sarah.
-How many?

877
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,326
Two more.

878
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,204
I can handle it. Don't worry.

879
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:26,706
I'm not worried.

880
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:27,873
Look, here's the plan.

881
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,835
You stay in front, and when
they run out of ammo, I'll arrest them.

882
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:34,463
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

883
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:38,259
Oh, shit.

884
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:40,136
You're bleeding all over the place.

885
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,763
I thought, you know, you were invincible.

886
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:46,309
I was. I'm not anymore.

887
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:50,604
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

888
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:51,689
Come on.

889
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,778
You take that.

890
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,977
You were supposed to stay behind me.

891
01:26:30,061 --> 01:26:31,854
I think I messed up.

892
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:58,881
This is all the power you ever had.

893
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,342
Now it is mine.

894
01:27:02,093 --> 01:27:05,012
Pity there's not more time

895
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,848
for us.

896
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:28,411
Help, Eric! I'm scared!

897
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,706
Let me go!

898
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:44,510
Let her go!

899
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:50,808
You can have me. I won't fight you.

900
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:52,852
All right.

901
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:54,979
No!

902
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,026
Eric!

903
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:03,172
Sarah?

904
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:04,798
Look out!

905
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:11,889
Eric!

906
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:22,066
You know, my daddy used to say,

907
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,610
"Every man's got a devil,

908
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,862
and you can't rest till you find him."

909
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,448
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend,

910
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:31,992
I cleared that building.

911
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,496
Hell, nothing in this town happens
without my say-so.

912
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:38,749
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans there, friend.

913
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,710
But if it's any consolation to you,

914
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,339
you have put a smile on my face.

915
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,050
You got a lot of spirit, son.

916
01:29:48,926 --> 01:29:50,719
I am going to miss you.

917
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,305
I have something to give you.

918
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:55,391
I don't want it anymore.

919
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:02,189
Thirty hours of pain.

920
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,319
All at once!

921
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,615
All for you.

922
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,142
Yeah.

923
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:48,527
Go help him.

924
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,075
Are you alive?

925
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:01,206
God, I need a cigarette.

926
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:08,964
Everybody else dead?

927
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:10,716
You helped me.

928
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:14,386
What you kept in here saved me.

929
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:17,222
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

930
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:19,683
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

931
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,274
Oh, yuck.

932
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:33,530
I'm quitting as of now. If I live.

933
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:45,417
Stay with him until help comes.

934
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:48,087
He'll be okay, right?

935
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:50,839
Eric?

936
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,803
He does that a lot.

937
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,071
Shelly.

938
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:28,377
All right.

939
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,170
I saw the ambulance.

940
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:32,089
-Night turn ugly?
-Multiple homicides.

941
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:34,883
At least it stopped raining, huh?

942
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:36,176
It can't rain all the time.

943
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,803
No, I don't believe it.

944
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,763
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

945
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:41,724
Look, you go on home.

946
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:43,559
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

947
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:46,979
-Want to tell me what's going on?
-Your vigilante's up on the roof.

948
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,482
You missed it.

949
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:52,651
Get him out of here.

950
01:33:57,883 --> 01:33:58,967
Thanks.

951
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,726
If the people we love are stolen from us,

952
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:12,523
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

953
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:18,278
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.
