1
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:34,201
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,745
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,748
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,292
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,796
You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me
forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,965
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,133
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,262
I sound like a sensible
fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,848
Quack, quack, quack.
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,352
Since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna have to
hear me quack.

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,148
After tonight?
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,110
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes!

13
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,489
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,659
I mean,
the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,537
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,664
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,750
Federal banks ain't supposed
to stop you in any way
during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,046
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,592
Heard about this one bloke,
he walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,636
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,265
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,143
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:47,024
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,737
Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,532
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,577
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,622
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,124
I'm illustrating if we did,
it'd be easier than what
we've been doing.

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,337
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,423
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,425
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,844
You tell 'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,804
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,142
We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,521
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us in
a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,523
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,234
it's these old fuckin' Jews
who've owned the store
for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,739
You got Grandpa Irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,741
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,701
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,704
We're out of it.
Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,873
Not in this life.
What then?

43
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,211
<i>Garcon,</i> coffee!

44
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,588

46
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,057
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,102
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,855
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,234
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,029
gas stations;
you get your head blown off
stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,783
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,495
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,125
I bet you could cut down
on the hero factor in a place like this.
Correct.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,461
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,880
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,800
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,846
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

paid $ 1.50 an hour...

stealin' from the owner?

someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:59,489
See, I got the idea
the last liquor store
we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,242
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,163
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,583
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

66
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,002
Yes, we did.
A lot of people
come to restaurants.

67
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,714
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,841
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,345
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70

Come on.
All right. Same as
last time, remember?

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,811
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

It's legal to own it.

a quarter-pounder is.

I'd have seen?

126

was she starred in a pilot.

the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.

128
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,907
Yeah, but you are aware
that there is an invention
called television,

129
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,118
and on this invention
they show shows, right?
Yeah.

130
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:41,581
The way they pick TV shows
is they make one show.
That show's called a pilot.

131
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,584
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

132
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,587
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,217
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some don't, become nothin'.

This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

631
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,236
Well, well, I do. I do.

632
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,407
[Inhales] But you have to
promise not to be offended.
No, no.

633
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:23,744
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're
gonna ask me.

634
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:28,666
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.

635
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,085
Then through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

636
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,880
Let's just forget it.
That's an impossibility.

637
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:38,009
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

638
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,261
Is that a fact?
And besides,

639
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:45,391
isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?
All right, all right.

640
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,269
Well, here goes.

641
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,355
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

642
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,859
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

643
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,154
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

644
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,950
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

645
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,162
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

646
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:11,375
Yet, even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

647
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,878
Is that a fact?
No.

648
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,048
No, it's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.
That's just what I heard.

649
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,051
Who told you?
They.

650
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,595

don't they?

652
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,433

They certainly do.

653
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:31,896
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm... I'm not shy.

654
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,523
- Um...
- Did it involve the "F" word?

655
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,611
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

656
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,740
- And?
- And... And nothin'.

657
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,701
That's it.

658
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,828
You heard Marsellus...

659
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:52,208
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

660
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,252
Mm-hmm.
And you believe that?

661
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:58,881
[Chuckles]
Well, at the time I was told
it sounded reasonable.

662
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,051
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

663
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,179
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

664
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,724
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

665
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,435
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

666
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,148
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

667
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,944
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

668
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,571
But did it happen?

669
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:28,536
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

670
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,997
Really?

671
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,417
Truth is, nobody knows
why Marsellus threw Tony
out that window...

672
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,419
except Marsellus and Tony.

673
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,464

I do believe Marsellus,
my husband, your boss,

683

told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,264
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

950
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,517
It was bought by
Private Doughboy
Erine Coolidge...

951
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,520
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

952
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,022
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

953
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,443
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

954
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,071
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your
great-grandmother,

955
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:54,576
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

956
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:59,080
until your granddad,
Dane Coolidge, was called
upon by his country...

957
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,876
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

958
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,421
This time they called it
World War II.

959
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:11,468
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch to your
granddad for good luck.

960
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,554
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's.

961
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,557
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed,

962
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,644
along with all
the other Marines at
the battle of Wake Island.

963
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,647
Your granddad
was facing death.

964
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,649
He knew it.

965
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,653
None of those boys had
any illusions about ever
leaving that island alive,

966
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,948
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,

967
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:39,245
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki...

968
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,248
a man he'd never met before
in his life...

969
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,293
to deliver to his infant son,

970
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,964
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

971
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:54,385
Three days later,
your granddad was dead,
but Winocki kept his word.

972
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:58,681
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

973
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,019
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

974
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,021
This watch.

975
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:16,324
This watch was on your
daddy's wrist when he was
shot down over Hanoi.

976
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:19,827
He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

977
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,957
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

978
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,544
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

979
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:31,339
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

980
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,343
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

981
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:39,347
so he hid it in one place
he knew he could hide
something... his ass.

982
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,850
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

983
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:47,105
Then he died of dysentery...
He give me the watch.

984
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,025
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass
two years.

985
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,027
Then...

986
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:57,198
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

987
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,200
now...

988
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,581

I give the watch to you.

feels like to kill a man.

'til you told me he was dead.

1065
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:30,031
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1066
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:37,204
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1067
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,593

Huh?

01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,167
I wish I had a pot.

1111
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,881
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror
and you wish you had some pot?

1112
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,884
A pot. [Giggles]
A pot belly.

1113
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,095
Pot bellies are sexy.

1114
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,472
Well, you should be happy...
[Grunts]

1115
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,474
'Cause you have one.

1116

Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1117
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,940
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did
"Lucky Star."

1118
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,942
It's not the same thing.

1119
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,946
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1120
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,948
The difference is huge.

1121

[Kissing]
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1122
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,453
No.

1123
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,958
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1124
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:12,128
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1125
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:17,633
The rest of you is normal...
normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1126
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,762
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1127
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,765
If I had one,
I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1128
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,767
to accentuate it.

1129
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,270
You think men
would find that attractive?

1130
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,523
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1131
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,068
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1132
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,070

If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1135
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,080
You'd punch me in the belly?
Right in the belly.

1136
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,040
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1137
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,086
I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!
[Laughing]

1138
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,088
You'd do that?
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes, I did.
Good job, sugar pop.

1147
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,611

01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,827
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1151
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,163
I won, all right.

1152
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:32,249
Are you still retiring?
Sure am.

1153
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,710
So it all worked out
in the finish.

won't they?

But they won't find us,
will they?

1159

to go with you?

"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid."

I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

we could go down someplace

you didn't dig that,
we could go someplace else.

02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:32,554
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1752
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:36,266
It sure is.
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

1753
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:39,310
Good. We got one.
So I heard.
May I come in?

1754
02:02:39,394 --> 02:02:41,271
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1755
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:45,024
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1756
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:47,527
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1757
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:50,530
If I was informed correctly,
the clock is ticking.
Is that right, Jimmie?

1758
02:02:50,613 --> 02:02:52,490
Uh, one hundred percent.

1759
02:02:52,615 --> 02:02:56,536
Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
Uh-huh.

1760
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:01,082
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1761
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:05,461
She wouldn't at that.
That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1762
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:09,007
which, if you do
what I say, when I say it,
should be plenty.

1763
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:13,428
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1764
02:03:17,432 --> 02:03:19,392
[Sighs]

1765
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:23,062
Jimmie.
Uh-huh.

1766
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:26,524
Do me a favor, will ya?
Thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

1767
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,111
Would you make me a cup?
Uh, yeah, sure.

1768
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:34,490
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1769
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,118
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1770
02:03:39,203 --> 02:03:42,624
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1771
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:46,085
Does it smoke? Does it
make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?

1772
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:49,631
Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
Positive?

1773
02:03:49,714 --> 02:03:53,092
Don't get me on the road
and I find out the brake
lights don't work.

1774
02:03:53,217 --> 02:03:57,263
As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
Good enough.

1775
02:03:57,347 --> 02:03:59,349
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1776
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:04,896
[Exhales]

1777
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,982
Here you go,
Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, Jimmie.

1778
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:14,739
Mmm.

1779
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:17,909
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1780
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:20,912
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1781
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:23,665
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1782
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:27,752
That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
Yeah. Under the sink.

1783
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:31,255
Good. What I need you
two fellas to do is take
those cleaning products...

1784
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:35,343
and clean the inside
of the car... I'm talkin'
fast, fast, fast.

1785
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:39,347
Go in the back seat,
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

1786
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:42,350
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1787
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:45,353
It don't need
to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1788
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:49,774
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1789
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:53,945
The pools of blood
that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1790
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:56,447
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1791
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:59,450
I need blankets,
I need comforters,
quilts, bedspreads.

1792
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:03,162
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1793
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:08,543
We'll need to camouflage
the front seat and back seat
and floorboards...

1794
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:10,545
with quilts and blankets,

1795
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:14,549
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1796
02:05:14,632 --> 02:05:17,468
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1797
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:19,595
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1798
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,431
"Please" would be nice.

1799
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:25,893
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1800
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:31,607
Get it straight, Buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1801
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:36,320
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1802
02:05:36,404 --> 02:05:38,823
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1803
02:05:38,906 --> 02:05:42,785
I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated,
lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1804
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:46,164
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't
like that; your help
is definitely appreciated.

1805
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:49,167
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay?
I respect you.

1806
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:52,086
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1807
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:55,173
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1808
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:59,886
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1809
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:03,431
So pretty please,
with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1810
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:11,606
Don't be lookin' at me
like that, all right?
I can feel your look.

1811
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,986
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1812
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,988
[Sipping]

1813
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:20,990
Green.

1814
02:06:22,617 --> 02:06:25,536
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1815
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:30,166
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1816
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:33,628
Nobody who'll be missed.

1817
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,633
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1818
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:41,636
How we comin',
Jimmie?
Pretty good.

1819
02:06:41,719 --> 02:06:44,847
I got it all here, but, uh,
[Sighs]

1820
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:48,392
Mr. Wolf, you gotta
understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1821
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:51,979
Okay. You gotta
understand something,
uh, Winston.

1822
02:06:52,063 --> 02:06:53,981
Uh... Uh, no,
thank you.

1823
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:57,193
Uh, this is our
best linen here,

1824
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:00,196
and it's, uh...
it was a wedding present...

1825
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,657
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1826
02:07:02,782 --> 02:07:07,203
They're not with us
anymore. I wanna help...
Let me ask you a question.

1827
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:10,206
If you don't mind.
No, no, please.
Go ahead.

1828
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:16,671
Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt ginny,
were they millionaires?

1829
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:19,757
No.

1830
02:07:19,841 --> 02:07:22,260
Well, your
Uncle Marsellus is.

1831
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:25,721
And I'm positive
that if Uncle Conrad
and Aunt...

1832
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:28,266
Ginny.
Ginny were here,

1833
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:32,603
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1834
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:35,857
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1835
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,739
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1836
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,826
How about you, Jimmie?

1837
02:07:48,035 --> 02:07:49,996
You an oak man?

1838
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,040
Oak's nice.

1839
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,717
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass
for this shit.

1840
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,219
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1841
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,723
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy that once
a man admits that he is wrong,

1842
02:08:08,806 --> 02:08:11,726
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1843
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:14,729
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1844
02:08:14,812 --> 02:08:17,607
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1845
02:08:17,732 --> 02:08:21,485
on account of your dumb ass.
I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1846
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:25,156
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1847
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:28,659
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1848
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,620
That's all. I could blow.

1849
02:08:30,745 --> 02:08:32,663
Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah.

1850
02:08:32,747 --> 02:08:35,666
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1851
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:38,669
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1852
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,671
I'm the Guns
of the Navarone.

1853
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:43,674
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1854
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:47,011
You're the motherfucker
should be on brain detail!
We're fuckin' switchin'!

1855
02:08:47,094 --> 02:08:49,555
I'm washin' windows,
you're pickin' up
this nigger's skull!

1856
02:08:59,273 --> 02:09:01,234
Fine job, gentlemen.

1857
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,987
You may get out
of this yet.

1858
02:09:05,071 --> 02:09:07,490
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1859
02:09:07,573 --> 02:09:10,993
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1860
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:14,497
Phase one is complete...
clean the car... which moves
us right along to phase two:

1861
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,499
clean you two.

1862
02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:19,919
Strip.

1863
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:23,798
All the way?
[Wolf]
To your bare ass.

1864
02:09:23,881 --> 02:09:26,926
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1865
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:29,929
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1866
02:09:30,012 --> 02:09:32,515
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1867
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,517
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1868
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,019
You know what you two
look like?
[Vincent] What?

1869
02:09:37,103 --> 02:09:40,523
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off
somebody's head.

1870
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,985
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1871
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:50,741
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.

1872
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:55,246
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1873
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:59,542
Don't worry,
we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1874
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:02,920
Vincent.
[Wolf]
Okay, gentlemen.

1875
02:10:03,004 --> 02:10:06,465
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1876
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:09,468
Goddamn!
The water's fuckin' cold!
Yo! Yo! Yo!

1877
02:10:09,552 --> 02:10:12,722
Better you than me,
gentlemen.
[Chuckling]

1878
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:15,766
Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.
[Yelling Continues]

1879
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:18,728
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1880
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:21,689
- Come on, do it,
goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um...

1881
02:10:22,773 --> 02:10:24,692
Towel.

1882
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:38,372
[Wolf]
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1883
02:10:38,456 --> 02:10:41,751
[Wolf Laughing]
Perfect.

1884
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:45,254
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1885
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:47,256
You guys look like...

1886
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,717
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1887
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:53,429
Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.
[Laughing]

1888
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:57,016
- [Both Laughing]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1889
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:59,810
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1890
02:10:59,894 --> 02:11:01,854
Don't make me beg.

1891
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:08,319
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get our rules
of the road straight.

1892
02:11:08,402 --> 02:11:11,947
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's
Truck and Tow.

1893
02:11:12,031 --> 02:11:14,950
Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic
to our dilemma.

1894
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:16,911
The place is North Hollywood,

1895
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:20,998
so a few twists and turns
aside, we'll be goin' up
Hollywood Way.

1896
02:11:21,082 --> 02:11:24,418
Now, I'll drive
the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1897
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:27,755
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1898
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:31,675
Now, if we come
across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1899
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:34,887
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
Right.

1900
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,848
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless.

1901
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:40,267
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.

1902
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,728

I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

Personality goes a long way.
Ah, so, by that rationale,

1952
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:31,897
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

what we experienced...

to walk the earth?

where he wants me to be.

- Shoot him in the face!

2056
02:21:01,078 --> 02:21:04,790
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2057
02:21:04,873 --> 02:21:08,251
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

2058
02:21:08,335 --> 02:21:11,129
You'll get us all killed!
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em outta here!

2059
02:21:11,213 --> 02:21:15,425
Shut the fuck up, fat man!
This ain't none of your
goddamn business!

2060
02:21:15,509 --> 02:21:17,761
Be cool, honey bunny,
be cool.

2061
02:21:17,844 --> 02:21:19,888
No problem.
I got it under control.

2062
02:21:21,515 --> 02:21:23,517
Now, I'm gonna
count to three.

2063
02:21:25,102 --> 02:21:29,022
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload
in your fucking face.

2064
02:21:33,443 --> 02:21:35,362
We clear?

2065
02:21:38,532 --> 02:21:40,450
One.

2066
02:21:42,285 --> 02:21:44,788
Two.

2067
02:21:44,871 --> 02:21:46,915
Three.
Okay, Ringo.

2068
02:21:46,999 --> 02:21:49,084
You win.

2069
02:21:49,167 --> 02:21:51,086
It's yours.

2070
02:21:55,132 --> 02:21:57,884
Open it.
[Latches Springing]

2071
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:03,932
[Honey Bunny]
Hey, what is it?

2072
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:06,351
What is it?

2073
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:09,021
Is that what I think it is?

2074
02:22:09,104 --> 02:22:11,815
Mm-hmm.

2075
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,485
It's beautiful.

2076
02:22:15,569 --> 02:22:18,113
[Giggling]
Goddamn it, what is it?

2077
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:22,534
You let him go!
You let him go!

2078
02:22:22,617 --> 02:22:25,537
- Let go of him,
or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2079
02:22:25,662 --> 02:22:28,582
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
Be cool! Be cool!

2080
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:31,334
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

2081
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:34,337
Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
Chill out, honey bunny!

2082
02:22:34,421 --> 02:22:36,173
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, honey bunny!

2083
02:22:36,298 --> 02:22:39,176
Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right!
I promise!

2084
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:41,136
Tell her to chill!
Chill out, honey bunny!

2085
02:22:41,261 --> 02:22:43,180
Now tell me her name.
Yolanda.

2086
02:22:43,263 --> 02:22:46,683
All right, now, Yolanda,
we're not gonna do
anything stupid, are we?

2087
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:49,686
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2088
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:53,231
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.
And what's Fonzie like?

2089
02:22:53,356 --> 02:22:56,985
Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
He's cool.

2090
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:58,987
What?
Cool.

2091
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,907
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2092
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,909
We're gonna be cool.

2093
02:23:03,992 --> 02:23:08,872
Now, Ringo,
<i>I'm</i> gonna count to three.

2094
02:23:08,955 --> 02:23:11,041
And when I count three,

2095
02:23:11,124 --> 02:23:14,044
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2096
02:23:14,127 --> 02:23:17,631
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2097
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:20,717
And when you do it,

2098
02:23:20,801 --> 02:23:22,886
you do it cool.

2099
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:25,263
You ready?

2100
02:23:25,347 --> 02:23:27,432
One,

2101
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:29,726
two,

2102
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,728
three.

2103
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:41,822
[Panting]
Okay, now you let him go!
Yolanda!

2104
02:23:41,905 --> 02:23:45,492
I thought you were gonna be cool.
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2105
02:23:45,575 --> 02:23:47,661
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2106
02:23:47,744 --> 02:23:51,540
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2107
02:23:53,208 --> 02:23:56,837
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2108
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,298
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2109
02:24:00,382 --> 02:24:02,300
But I don't want that.

2110
02:24:02,384 --> 02:24:04,302
And you don't want that.

2111
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,097
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2112
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,307
So let's see what we can do.

2113
02:24:11,685 --> 02:24:14,938
Now...
here's the situation.

2114
02:24:15,021 --> 02:24:18,859
Normally both your asses
would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken,

2115
02:24:18,942 --> 02:24:22,362
but you happened to
pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period,

2116
02:24:22,445 --> 02:24:25,365
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2117
02:24:25,448 --> 02:24:29,369
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2118
02:24:29,452 --> 02:24:32,372
Besides, I been
through too much shit over
this case this morning...

2119
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:35,375
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2120
02:24:35,458 --> 02:24:37,252
- Vincent!
- [Yells]

2121
02:24:37,377 --> 02:24:40,297
Be cool!
Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
Get back!

2122
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,049
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2123
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:46,595
Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me.
[Yolanda Whimpering]

2124
02:24:46,678 --> 02:24:49,472
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2125
02:24:49,556 --> 02:24:51,474
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2126
02:24:51,558 --> 02:24:53,435
Tell her it's still cool.

2127
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:56,438
It's still cool,
honey bunny.
How we doin', baby?

2128
02:24:57,898 --> 02:25:00,525
I... I gotta go pee.

2129
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,527
I wanna go home.

2130
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:06,198
Hang in there, baby.
I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2131
02:25:06,281 --> 02:25:09,201
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2132
02:25:09,284 --> 02:25:12,579
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

2133
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:15,874
I love you too, honey bunny.
Now,

2134
02:25:15,957 --> 02:25:19,920
I want you to go in that
bag and find my wallet.

2135
02:25:22,422 --> 02:25:26,384
Which one is it?
It's the one that says
"bad motherfucker."

2136
02:25:40,649 --> 02:25:43,193
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.

2137
02:25:43,276 --> 02:25:46,404
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2138
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:53,620
[Jules]
Count it.

2139
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:02,462
How much is there?

2140
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:06,258
About 1,500 dollars.

2141
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:09,511
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2142
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:12,806
Now, with the rest
of those wallets
and the register,

2143
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:14,975
that makes this
a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2144
02:26:15,058 --> 02:26:18,937
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

2145
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:22,440
No, Yolanda! Yolanda!
He ain't gonna do a goddamn,
motherfuckin' thing!

2146
02:26:22,524 --> 02:26:24,567
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2147
02:26:24,693 --> 02:26:28,571
Shut up!
Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.

2148
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:31,574
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2149
02:26:31,658 --> 02:26:33,535
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2150
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:37,998
Wanna know what
I'm buyin', Ringo?
What?

2151
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:42,794
Your life. I'm givin' you
that money so I don't
have to kill your ass.

2152
02:26:42,877 --> 02:26:45,547
You read the Bible,
Ringo?

2153
02:26:46,673 --> 02:26:48,591
Not regularly, no.

2154
02:26:48,675 --> 02:26:51,052
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2155
02:26:51,136 --> 02:26:54,681
Ezekiel 25:17.

2156
02:26:54,764 --> 02:26:57,600
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2157
02:26:57,684 --> 02:26:59,602
"by the inequities of the selfish...

2158
02:26:59,686 --> 02:27:01,563
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2159
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:05,025
"Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will,

2160
02:27:05,108 --> 02:27:07,527
"shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2161
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:11,698
"for he is truly his
brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children.

2162
02:27:11,781 --> 02:27:16,077
"And I will strike down upon
thee with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2163
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:19,205
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2164
02:27:19,289 --> 02:27:22,292
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

2165
02:27:22,375 --> 02:27:25,920
when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

2166
02:27:27,047 --> 02:27:29,466
I been sayin' that shit
for years,

2167
02:27:29,549 --> 02:27:32,677
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2168
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:35,680
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2169
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:38,683
I just thought it was some
coldblooded shit to say
to a motherfucker...

2170
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:41,186
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2171
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,689
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2172
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:47,692
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2173
02:27:47,776 --> 02:27:52,655
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2174
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:55,658
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2175
02:27:55,742 --> 02:27:59,287
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2176
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,289
Or it could mean...

2177
02:28:01,373 --> 02:28:04,793
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2178
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:08,797
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2179
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,132
Yeah, I'd like that.

2180
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:14,094
But that shit ain't the truth.

2181
02:28:14,177 --> 02:28:16,054
The truth is,

2182
02:28:17,097 --> 02:28:19,057
you're the weak...

2183
02:28:20,433 --> 02:28:23,812
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2184
02:28:25,271 --> 02:28:27,190
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2185
02:28:28,441 --> 02:28:31,361
I'm tryin' real hard...

2186
02:28:31,444 --> 02:28:33,738
to be the shepherd.

2187
02:28:49,045 --> 02:28:50,964
Go.

2188
02:29:08,648 --> 02:29:11,025
