17337 19999 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.

32652 33676 How can we help you?
33753 37814 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
37891 41122 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
41194 43628 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
43697 46530 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
46599 49659 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?<br />- What you really need
49736 53797 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
53873 55568 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
55642 58839 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
58912 62245 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.

82936 86804 And if you need tires,<br />stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
86873 89341 home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
89409 92742 - We're trying to find the Interstate.<br />- But you do need a paint job.
92812 95975 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
96049 98347 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...
98418 99749 Maybe ghost flames!
99819 102379 You like old school pinstripin'?<br />Von Dutch style?
102455 106357 - [Both gasp]<br />- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

126279 129373 Psst! Psst!<br />Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
129449 131610 - I know how to get to the Interstate!<br />- Do ya?
131684 134346 - Minny, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
134420 135887 No, not really. But listen.
135955 139584 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
139659 142184 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
142262 146096 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
147066 149330 - [Locks beeping]<br />- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
149402 153270 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
153339 156502 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
156576 158669 I'm becoming one of them!
158745 160474 - [Lightning echoes]<br />- [Sighing]
160547 162674 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
162749 164512 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
164584 167451 [Male DJ] We'll be back<br />for our Hank Williams marathon...
167520 170250 - That's good.<br />...after a Piston Cup update.
170323 174225 [Kori] Still no sign of Lightning<br />McQueen. Chick arrived in California
174294 177752 and today became the first car<br />to spend practice time on the track.
177831 180994 [Chick] It's nice to get out here<br />before the other competitors.
181067 184833 You know, get a head start.<br />Gives me an edge.
184904 186371 [Electronic music]
186439 188202 [Laughing]
188274 190071 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
195148 196137 Ha-ha!
199986 200975 Yeah!
202255 204348 [Crowd shouting and cheering]
209262 212527 [Girls chattering and giggling]
212599 214931 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
215401 217232 [Gasping] Oh!
217303 218668 Let me get this straight.
218738 221673 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
221741 225472 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
225545 226637 I got a road to finish.
227947 230347 [Grunting and revving]
238491 240891 - He's done!<br />- Done?
240960 243326 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
245265 248598 - [Bessie groans]<br />- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
248668 251535 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
252138 255801 [Mater] Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
256376 257968 Oh!
259312 262008 [Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.
262248 265706 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
265818 269310 - Oh!<br />- [Blubbering]
269689 271680 Red.
274294 275625 Who do you think you are?
275695 278994 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
279065 282501 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
282568 285036 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
285104 288733 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
288808 290298 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
290376 294608 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
294681 298481 - What?<br />- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?
298551 300917 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
300987 303683 If I win, you do the road my way.
303756 305280 Doc, what're you doin'?
305658 307489 I don't mean to be rude here,
307560 311291 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
311364 313889 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
313967 318631 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
320373 322898 [Sheriff] Gentlemen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
322976 327470 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
327547 330482 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
330550 333075 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
333152 338283 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
338358 340121 and no lollygaggin'.
340193 341751 Speed. I'm speed.
341828 344388 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
344464 345488 [Luigi laughs]
345631 350432 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
350503 353028 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh... [chuckles]
353106 355973 The race is only one lap, guys.
356042 358533 Uno lappo! Don't need any help.
358611 362445 - I work solo mio.<br />- Fine. Race your way.
363750 367618 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
367720 369711 Gentlemen...
370356 373189 ...start your engines!
375328 376989 [Engine sputters]
377430 379898 [Revving furiously]
379966 382332 - IHijole! Check that out!<br />- Whoa.
382402 385496 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
385872 387169 Luigi?
387240 390437 [Chuckling] On your mark, get set...
390510 392740 Uno for the money,<br />due for the show,
392812 398512 tre to get ready, and quattro<br />to... I can't believe it. Go!
399852 400944 [Giggling]
402555 404455 [Cheering]
406993 408324 Huh?
408961 411486 Doc... the flag means go.
411564 414897 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
414967 417697 Doc, what are you doing, man?
417770 421331 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
421407 424535 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
424610 427374 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
429082 430515 You got your tow cable?
430583 432778 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
432852 435150 [Doc] Oh, just in case.
443696 445891 [Yelling] Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
445965 447694 No, no, no, no, no!
447834 450234 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
450970 453268 - Ow!<br />- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.
453339 454772 [Revving]
456442 462438 Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
462515 464881 - I'm confused.<br />- [Chuckling]
464951 467044 [Doc] You drive like you fix roads.
467120 470317 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
474127 475958 [Gasps] Ah!
476696 479665 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
479732 482860 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
485972 487906 I can make a little turn on dirt.
487974 489407 You think?
489475 493935 No. And now I'm a day behind.<br />I'm never gonna get outta here!
494013 496481 Hey, ese!<br />You need a new paint job, man!
496549 499518 - [Lightning] No, thank you.<br />- How 'bout some organic fuel?
499585 501951 - That freak juice?<br />- [Lightning] Pass.
502021 506481 Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.<br />Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
506559 508151 Nah, not me, Flo.
508227 510695 I'm on one of them there special diets.
510763 515359 I'm a precisional instrument<br />of speed and aero-matics.
515935 518199 "You race like you fix roads."
518271 523038 [Grunting] I'll show him.<br />[Grunting] I will show him!
531384 535718 - [Tar splattering]<br />- Oh, great! I hate it!
535788 539417 - Hate, hate, hate, hate it!<br />- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.
540626 543186 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
543262 545992 [Lightning]<br />Radiator Springs, a happy place!
546065 549091 OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
551637 555437 Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!<br />I'm talking to Bessie!
568487 569545 Wow.
569889 571584 [Mater] Mornin', Sally!
571657 576856 Hey, look at this here fancy new road<br />that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
576929 578954 Yes! Uh, amazing!
579432 583061 Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]
583135 587333 Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't<br />seen you that low in years.
587406 589966 I haven't seen a road like this<br />in years.
590042 594172 - Well, then let's cruise, baby.<br />- Low and slow.
594247 596442 [Italian] E bellissima! It's beautiful!
596515 600246 Guido, look, it's-a like<br />it was paved by angels.
601187 602484 Boy, I tell you what.
602555 605388 I bet even the roads on the moon<br />ain't this smooth.
605458 607119 Doc, look at this!
607260 610127 Shoulda tossed him into<br />the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
610196 613688 Well, he ain't finished yet.<br />Still got a long way to go.
613766 616735 Guido, look at Luigi!
617336 619065 This is fantastico!
619138 622596 That looks like fun!<br />Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
622675 626975 Hey, Luigi, this new road<br />makes your place look like a dump.
627647 630343 That crazy old devil woman.
630816 634217 [Sighs] Oh!
634287 636118 She's right!
636188 637746 - Ah!<br />- Guido!
637823 641589 Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
642862 646662 Well, now... where the heck is he?
653005 655735 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
655808 659175 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
659245 661611 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
661681 664081 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
664150 666983 [Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
667453 669978 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
672191 676150 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
676228 677627 I'll keep an eye on him.
677697 681599 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
683269 686067 [Engine revving]
689442 691433 [Screaming]
693045 695240 [Spitting]
695981 698449 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
698517 701247 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
701320 704653 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
704724 708216 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
708294 711354 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
711430 714524 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
714600 716261 I'll put it simple.
716335 720499 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
721574 726978 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
727046 728843 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
728914 732509 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
735321 738722 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
739959 741790 [Groans]
746365 748299 [Lightning] Turn right to go left.
749568 751559 Hmm...
751637 752695 Whoa!
754073 756507 - Oh!<br />- [Car crashing]
756976 760935 - Ow! Oh, that...<br />- [cactus crashing]
762515 765882 [Screaming] Ow!
767319 770584 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
770656 773750 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
773826 777227 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
777296 781232 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
788107 791668 - Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!<br />- Che cosa?
791744 796113 - It looks great! This is great!<br />- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
797116 798640 [Grunts, passes gas]
798717 800708 Oh, Lord.
800786 802413 - [Chuckles]<br />- [Sheriff] Mater!
802488 804649 I need you<br />to watch the prisoner tonight.
804723 808022 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
808093 810926 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
810996 813464 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
814567 816228 [Groaning] Oh...
816302 818964 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
819038 821598 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
821674 824939 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
825010 827308 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
827379 829404 You make-a such a nice new road.
829482 832144 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
832218 833810 Even though you not a Ferrari.
833886 837982 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
838057 841925 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
841994 845521 [Chuckling] I like your style, eh?
845598 849159 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
849235 852693 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
852771 854432 [Flo] Oh, would you look at that?
854507 856634 Ramone, Ramone!
856709 858802 [Luigi] Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
858878 861870 [Lightning] No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
861947 865576 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
865651 870350 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
870422 873289 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
873359 874621 [Exhales deeply]
874693 875853 Ah!
875928 878055 Stop! Let me...
879465 882298 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
882368 884393 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
884470 887803 Stop, stop! That's cold!
887873 890364 Help! Please! Stop!
890442 893809 - [Coughing, sputtering]<br />- Thanks, Red.
895047 896309 What was that for?
896382 898509 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
898584 900074 If you do, you gotta be clean.
900152 902677 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
902755 904484 What, I? I don't get it.
904557 907151 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
907226 910457 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
910529 915159 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
915234 919102 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
919171 921571 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
921640 924905 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
924977 928174 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.
928247 931705 [Lightning chuckles] Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
931784 935914 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
935988 939355 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
940859 943089 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
944063 946531 Cone number one, if you want.
947633 949999 Oh...
951136 954867 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
954940 958034 Oh... [chuckles]<br />That's just a... Oh!
958110 960271 [Both chuckle]
960613 963946 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.

971390 973984 - You know, I knew this girl Doreen.<br />- [Gasps]
974059 975549 Good-lookin' girl.
975628 978927 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
978998 982490 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
983602 986070 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
986138 990268 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
990342 994506 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
994580 998141 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
998217 1000515 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
1000586 1002349 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
1002421 1005413 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
1005491 1007823 I can handle anything.
1007893 1012728 - [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]
1012998 1016525 - [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.
1016602 1019036 - [Tractors snore]<br />- [Mater] All right, listen.
1019104 1023097 When I say go, we go.<br />But don't let Frank catch you. Go!
1023175 1025006 Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?
1026011 1027979 [Lightning whispering] Mater!
1028047 1029480 Wait, Mater!
1031250 1032615 OK, here's what you do.
1032685 1036086 You just sneak up in front of 'em,<br />and then honk.
1036155 1038646 And they do the rest. Watch this.
1045698 1047529 - [Honking loudly]<br />- Oh!
1047599 1052798 Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]
1052871 1056671 [Gas sloshing, backfiring]

1075027 1078622 Oh! Oh... [mooing]
1078697 1081598 [Gas sloshing, backfiring]
1081667 1085660 [Laughing] I don't care who you are,<br />that's funny right there.
1085738 1087501 Oh, your turn, bud.
1087573 1089973 Mater, I can't.<br />I don't even have a horn.
1090042 1092272 - Baby.<br />- I'm not a baby.
1092344 1093333 [Clucking]
1093412 1096813 Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?<br />All right. I'll do something.
1147700 1149099 That's Frank.
1151670 1154195 - [Bellowing angrily]<br />- [Shouting]
1155475 1158967 - [Mooing]<br />- [Engine revving]
1164251 1168585 [Mater laughing]

1222852 1224786 Oh, yeah... yeah.
1224854 1227948 Well, we better get you<br />back to the impound lot.
1228025 1231222 You know, actually,<br />Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.
1231295 1232284 Oh...
1232363 1237630 - Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?<br />- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?
1237702 1241968 Besides, she can't stand me.<br />And I don't like her, to be honest.
1242041 1245943 Yeah, you probably right.<br />Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
1246012 1248742 - Where, where?<br />- [Laughing]
1248816 1251410 - You're in love with Miss Sally.<br />- No, I'm not.
1251485 1253646 - [Mater] Yes, you do.<br />- [Lightning] No way.
1253721 1254915 - Way.<br />- Come on, look...

1263232 1264756 All right. OK. Mater, enough!
1264834 1266825 - Will you stop that?<br />- Stop what?
1266903 1270202 Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.<br />You're gonna wreck.
1270273 1275176 Wreck? Shoot!<br />I'm the world's best backwards driver!
1275246 1278374 You just watch this right here,<br />lover boy. Wee-hee!
1278449 1281111 [Lightning] What are you doing?<br />Watch out! Look out!

1313257 1314952 No need to watch where I'm goin'.
1317761 1319490 Just need to know where I've been.
1319564 1322692 Whoa, that was incredible!<br />How'd you do that?
1322767 1326760 Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,<br />and I'll teach you if you want.
1326839 1330070 [Chuckling] Yeah,<br />maybe I'll use it in my big race.
1330142 1333669 What's so important<br />about this race of yours, anyway?
1335181 1338912 It's not just a race.<br />We're talking about the Piston Cup!
1338986 1341318 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life!
1341389 1344415 I'll be the first rookie in history<br />ever to win it.
1344492 1348053 And when I do,<br />we're talkin' big new sponsor,
1348130 1349791 with private helicopters.
1349865 1353130 No more medicated bumper ointment.<br />No more rusty old cars.
1353202 1355329 What's wrong with rusty old cars?
1357140 1360769 Well, I don't mean you, Mater.<br />I mean other old cars. You know?
1360844 1364007 - Not like you. I like you.<br />- It's OK, buddy.
1364348 1369047 Hey, you think maybe one day I can<br />get a ride in one of them helicopters?
1369120 1373716 I mean, I've always wanted to ride<br />in one of them fancy helicopters.
1373793 1376591 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.<br />- You mean it?

1431326 1434056 When? Just now?<br />What, what did, what did you hear?
1434129 1436120 Something about a helicopter ride.
1436598 1439362 Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got<br />a kick out of that, didn't he?
1439435 1441335 - Did you mean it?<br />- What?
1441404 1443429 - That you'll get him a ride.<br />- Who knows?
1443506 1446532 First things first. I gotta<br />get outta here and make the race.
1446610 1448601 Uh-huh.
1448678 1451875 You know... Mater trusts you.
1453251 1455617 Yeah, OK.
1455686 1458382 - Did you mean that?<br />- What?
1458457 1464089 Was it just a "Yeah, OK",<br />or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?
1464164 1466826 Look, I'm exhausted.<br />It's kinda been a long day.
1467567 1470400 Yeah, OK. G'night.

1548523 1551822 - No! [gasping]<br />- [Alarm beeping]
1552194 1553627 I gotta get outta here!
1554096 1557031 Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?<br />Oh! Oh, my gosh.
1557100 1560365 - Hey, what are you doin'?<br />- Get a good peek, city boy?
1560437 1563929 [Stuttering] I just need my<br />daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
1564008 1566135 Wait for him at Flo's.<br />Get outta here.
1566210 1568872 I've been trying<br />to get outta here for three days!
1568946 1571437 [Sheriff] Hope you enjoyed the show!
1576923 1578823 [Groaning]
1585032 1586829 Whoa, Doc.
1586900 1590631 Time to clean out the garage, buddy,<br />come on.

1636792 1638783 - [Doc] Sign says stay out.<br />- [Gasps]
1639628 1642222 You have three Piston Cups.<br />How could you have...
1642298 1645392 I knew you couldn't drive.<br />I didn't know you couldn't read.
1645468 1648494 - You're the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
1648572 1651097 Of course. I can't believe<br />I didn't see it before.
1651175 1652904 You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
1652976 1656639 You used to hold the record for most<br />wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
1656714 1659444 - You gotta show me your tricks. Please.<br />- I tried that.
1659517 1662247 You won three times!<br />Look at those trophies!
1662321 1665757 You look.<br />All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
1668495 1669963 [Country music]
1669963 1670930 [Country music]
1670997 1676299 You know, some automotive yoga<br />could really lower your RPM's, man.

1685347 1686405 There he is.
1686482 1689474 Oh, my gosh!<br />Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
1692722 1695486 - Doc? Our Doc?<br />- Not Doc Hudson.
1695559 1698153 No, no, no, no, it's true!<br />He's a real racing legend.
1698229 1700493 He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
1700564 1703863 Fabulous? I never seen Doc<br />drive more than 20 miles an hour.
1703935 1705994 I mean, have you ever seen him race?
1706071 1709666 No, but I wish I could have.<br />They say he was amazing!
1709742 1713610 - He won three Piston Cups!<br />- He did what in his cup?
1713679 1716011 I think the heat's<br />startin' to get to the boy!
1716083 1718210 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
1718285 1720685 [Ramone] I think he needs<br />a new coat of poly, man.
1720755 1723519 - [Mater] Are you sick, buddy?<br />- You are lookin' peaked.
1723591 1725354 He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
1726594 1727583 [Gas bell rings]
1727663 1731190 - [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?<br />- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
1731267 1733963 I trust you, all right.<br />It's him I'm worried about.
1734905 1737237 Hmm... I trust him.
1738208 1740506 - Come on, let's take a drive.<br />- A drive?
1740578 1741875 Yeah, a drive.
1741946 1745074 Don't you big city racecars<br />ever just take a drive?
1745149 1747845 Ah... No. No, we don't.
1747920 1749046 [Gas pump stops]
1770345 1774179 Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
1779990 1781184 [Flo] Mm-hm!
1781258 1784716 - And you thought he was gonna run.<br />- Hey, can you believe it, man?
1784795 1787229 He actually thought<br />Doc was a famous racecar!
1788266 1790234 That's so too much!
1792270 1794738 OK, you got me out here.<br />Where are we goin'?
1794807 1796798 I don't know.
1801681 1803672 Whoa! Yes.
1816565 1819557 - [Sputtering]<br />- [Laughing]
1820503 1822130 Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
1822205 1825868 - Bleah!<br />- [Chuckling]
1827378 1829403 - [Grunts]<br />- [Laughs]
1829480 1830708 [Sputtering]
1887780 1889509 [Laughing]
1889816 1891875 [Chuckles] Oh!
1891952 1893214 [Spitting]
1912142 1915873 [Lightning] Wow. What is this place?
1916580 1917945 Wheel Well.
1918014 1921279 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
1925924 1927653 This place?
1927726 1929717 [Horns beeping]
1931263 1933322 [Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.
1935001 1937731 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.
1940074 1941632 You know, I don't get you.
1941709 1944940 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
1945013 1947208 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...
1947282 1951446 ...an attorney in LA<br />livin' life in the fast lane, and...
1951521 1955082 Oh, you were, were you?<br />Were you rich?
1955158 1958559 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
1959329 1961957 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
1962032 1963795 And you know what?
1963867 1967496 It never felt... happy.
1969140 1972234 Yeah. I mean... really?
1972311 1974040 Yeah. So I left California.
1974113 1977412 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
1978151 1980949 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
1981021 1984013 Well, they all did. And I never left.
1985293 1986988 Yeah. You know, I understand.
1987061 1989894 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
1989964 1993695 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
1994670 1998128 [Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.
1998208 2001871 - Oh.<br />- Yep.
2002712 2005510 - Corvette?<br />- No.
2011056 2013820 I fell in love with this.
2025839 2029570 Whoa. Look at that.
2030445 2032777 Look, they're drivin' right by.
2032847 2035042 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
2036050 2038382 [Sally] Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
2039855 2041186 Oh, yeah?
2041257 2045159 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
2046296 2047285 Really?
2047364 2050060 [Sally] Yeah. Back then,
2050134 2053001 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
2054272 2055603 How do you mean?
2055673 2059074 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
2059144 2063342 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
2064851 2066842 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
