37700 39531 [Inhaling and exhaling deeply]
39602 42730 [Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.
42805 46172 Speed. I am speed.
46242 47800 [Cars whizzing past]
47877 50607 One winner, 42 losers.
50679 53239 I eat losers for breakfast.
53315 55283 [Car accelerating]
55351 56784 Breakfast.
56852 58945 Wait, maybe I<br />should have had breakfast.
59021 62718 A little breck-y could be good for me.<br />No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
62791 64349 [Cars whizzing]
64426 66656 I'm faster than fast.<br />Quicker than quick.
66729 68321 I am lightning!
68397 69386 [Pounding on door]
69465 71763 [Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?
71834 73324 [~ Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]
73402 76565 Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
76639 79107 [engine revving]
94189 96589 [Engine revs]
96659 98024 [Crowd cheers]
114843 115935 Ka-chow!
116011 117239 [Cars zooming]
137199 138632 [Cars whooshing]
157486 158919 [Both scream]
158988 163049 [All cheer]
163125 165116 Get your antenna balls here!
171700 173861 Go, Lightnin'!
173936 177929 - Whoo!<br />- You got that right, slick. [whistles]
178007 179269 [Air wrench whirring]
191453 193444 Uh! [screams]
199528 200790 [Engine revs]
203932 206765 - [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.<br />- [Crowd cheers]
206835 210464 I'm Bob Cutlass, here<br />with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.
210539 213531 We're midway through what may<br />be an historic day for racing.
213609 215634 Bob, my oil pressure's<br />through the roof.
215711 219306 If this gets more exciting, they're<br />gonna have to tow me outta the booth!
219381 220439 Right, Darrell.
220516 223144 [Bob] Three cars are tied<br />for the season points lead,
223218 225311 heading into the final race<br />of the season.
225387 230154 And the winner of this race will win<br />the season title and the Piston Cup.
230225 231920 Does The King, Strip Weathers,
231994 234394 have one more victory in him<br />before retirement?
234463 237057 [Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy<br />for years!
237132 239327 Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
239401 242768 [Bob] And, as always, in the<br />second place spot we find Chick Hicks.
242838 245363 He's been chasing<br />that tailfin his entire career.
245441 247602 [Darrell] Chick thought<br />this was his year.
247676 250440 His chance to finally emerge<br />from The King's shadow.
250512 254573 But the last thing he expected was...<br />Lightning McQueen!
254650 257278 [Bob] You know, I don't think<br />anybody expected this.
257352 259980 The rookie sensation<br />came into the season unknown.
260055 261545 But everyone knows him now.
261623 265684 [Darrell] Will he be the first rookie<br />to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
265794 268354 [Bob] The legend, the runner-up,<br />and the rookie!
268430 271297 Three cars, one champion!
274970 276301 [Breaks screeching]
283479 284969 No you don't.
287683 289674 - [Chuckling]<br />- Hey!
292688 295680 - [Tires squealing]<br />- [Crowd booing]
296658 298558 What a ride!
298627 299889 [Chuckling]
299962 302157 Go get 'em, McQueen!<br />Go get 'em!
305968 307799 [Female] I love you, Lightning!
307870 310532 - Dinoco is all mine.<br />- [Screaming]
310606 312540 [Darrell] Trouble, turn three!
312608 315839 - Get through that, McQueen.<br />- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!
315911 316900 [Crowd gasps]
318280 321579 [Screaming]
326688 327712 [Giggling]
327790 330315 - [Grunts]<br />- [Gasps]
332194 334458 [Both screaming]
337733 340600 [Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.<br />McQueen is in the wreckage.
340669 343502 [Darrell] There's no way the rookie<br />can make it through!
343572 344800 Not in one piece, that is.
354349 356476 [Exhaling]
359421 361116 Yeah!
361190 363158 Lightning! Oh!
365060 367528 [Darrell] Look at that!<br />McQueen made it through!
367596 370064 [Bob] A spectacular move<br />by Lightning McQueen!
370132 372259 Yeah! Ka-chow!
372334 375599 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!<br />McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
375671 378640 Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]
378707 380937 [Bob] While everyone<br />heads into the pits,
381009 382772 McQueen stays out to take the lead!
382845 385837 Don't take me out, coach.<br />I can still race!
385914 388644 [Air wrench whirring]
390586 393054 [Chuckling] What do you think?<br />A thing of beauty.
393121 395055 - McQueen made it!<br />- [Chick] What?
395123 396181 He's not pitting!
396258 399386 You gotta get me out there!<br />Let's go! Get me back out there!
399461 401224 McQueen's not going into the pits!
401296 404857 [Darrell] The rookie fired his<br />crew chief. The third this season!
404933 407231 - [Bob] Says he likes working alone.<br />- Go, go!
407302 409532 Looks like Chick<br />got caught up in the pits.
409605 413006 Yeah, after a stop like that,<br />he's got a lot of ground to make up.
413075 415475 Get ready, boys,<br />we're coming to the restart!
418280 421272 [Crowd cheers]
433729 435458 Come on, come on, come on!
443839 445932 We need tires now!<br />Come on, let's go!
446008 448704 - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!<br />- [Male] What?
448844 450903 You need tires, you idiot!
451246 454215 [Darrell] Looks like it's<br />gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
454283 455716 [Bob] Right. No tires again.
455784 458480 [Darrell] That's a short-term gain,<br />long-term loss,
458553 462216 but it's workin' for him. He obviously<br />knows somethin' we don't know.
465928 468829 [Cars whizzing]
470332 474564 [Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go<br />and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
474636 477503 He's got it in the bag.<br />Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
477572 479870 We're gonna crown us a new champion!
479942 482137 [Crowd cheers and whistles]
482210 484440 [Screaming]
486348 488578 - Checkered flag, here I come!<br />- [Tire blows]
488650 490641 [Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!
490719 493449 [Bob] And with only one turn to go!<br />Can he make it?
493522 496082 - You fool!<br />- [Grunts]
497459 499927 [Male] McQueen's blown a tire!<br />He's blown a tire!
499995 501485 Go, go, go!
509137 510604 - [Grunting]<br />- [Tire blows]
510672 512401 [Darrell] He's lost another tire!
512474 515705 - King and Chick come up fast!<br />- [Bob] They're entering turn three!
515777 517642 Come on. [grunting]
519514 521744 I don't believe<br />what I'm watching, Bob!
521817 525344 Lightning McQueen<br />is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
526388 527719 [Gasping]
529291 530451 [Growling]
531093 533687 [Bob] The King and Chick<br />rounding turn four.
536565 539830 [Darrell] Down the stretch they come!<br />And it's, and it's...
539901 542699 - It's too close to call! Too close!<br />- I don't believe it!
542771 544136 Lightning!
544439 547431 - The most spectacular, amazing...<br />- I don't believe it!
547509 550967 ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending<br />in the history of the world!
551046 553071 - And we don't know who won!<br />- Look at that!
554549 556346 [Tape jittering]
559621 561418 [Slow motion drone]
563759 566785 - That's very close to call.<br />- Can we play that again?
566862 569057 Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
569131 569197 We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.
569197 571665 We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.
571733 574201 McQueen, that was a risky move,<br />not taking tires.
574269 575258 Tell me about it!
575337 577999 Are you sorry you didn't have<br />a crew chief out there?
578073 581509 Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing<br />than just winning.
581576 585478 I mean, taking the race by a full lap...<br />Where's the entertainment in that?
585547 587481 I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
587549 589676 - Sizzle?<br />- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
589751 591912 No, I'm not.<br />'Cause I'm a one-man show.
591987 593420 What? Oh, yeah, right.
593488 595547 That was a confident<br />Lightning McQueen.
595624 598252 Live from Victory Lane,<br />I'm Kori Turbowitz.
598326 600021 - Get outta the shot.<br />- Yo, Chuck.
600095 601790 Chuck, what are you doing?<br />You're blockin' the camera!
601863 603854 - Everyone wants to see the bolt.<br />- What?
603932 607527 - Now, back away.<br />- That's it! Come on, guys.
607602 611663 - Whoa, team! Where are you going?<br />- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
611740 613435 Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
613508 617274 How will I ever find anyone else<br />who knows how to fill me up with gas?
617345 618334 [Crowd laughs]
618413 621314 - Adios, Chuck!<br />- And my name is not Chuck!
621383 623044 Oh, whatever.
623118 625143 Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
625220 628519 Seriously, that was some<br />pretty darn nice racin' out there.
628590 630820 - By me!<br />- Oh, yeah.
630892 633417 - Zinger!<br />- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
633495 636157 The Piston Cup...<br />It's mine, dude. It's mine.
636231 640793 Hey, fellas, how do you think<br />I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
640869 642700 In your dreams, Thunder.
642771 645865 Yeah, right. Thunder?<br />What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
645941 648774 You know, 'cause thunder<br />always comes after lightning.
648844 650641 Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
650712 653146 - Who knew about the thunder thing?<br />- I didn't.
653215 654910 - Give us the bolt!<br />- That's right.
654983 656450 Right in the lens.
656618 658779 - Show me the bolt, baby!<br />- Smile, McQueen!
658854 662153 - Show me the bolt, McQueen!<br />- That's it!
662224 664624 [Electronic music]
664693 667389 [Crowd chattering]
667462 671922 That was one close finish.<br />You sure made Dinoco proud.
672000 672989 Thank you, King.
673068 675832 Well, Tex, you've been<br />good to me all these years.
675904 677269 It's the least I could do.
677339 680570 Whatever happens, you're a winner<br />to me, you old daddy rabbit.
680642 683440 Thanks, dear.<br />Wouldn't be nothing without you.
683512 685207 Kch-i-ka-chow!
686281 687942 - I'm Mia.<br />- I'm Tia.
688016 691281 [Both] We're, like, your biggest fans!<br />Ka-chow!
691353 693844 I love being me.
693922 697016 - [Police] OK, girls, that's it.<br />- We love you, Lightning!
697092 698923 [Chuckles]
698994 701827 Hey, buddy.<br />You're one gutsy racer.
701897 703455 Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
703532 705329 You got more talent in one lug nut
705400 707960 than a lot of cars has got<br />in their whole body.
708036 710630 - Really? Oh, that...<br />- But you're stupid.
710705 713265 - Excuse me?<br />- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.
713341 716435 You need to wise up and get<br />a good crew chief and a good team.
716511 719537 You ain't gonna win<br />unless you got good folks behind you,
719614 722913 [voice dwindling] and you let them<br />do their job, like they should.
722984 725714 - Like I tell the boys at the shop...<br />- A good team.
725787 727687 - Yeah...<br />- [electronic music]
735463 736987 Ka-chow! Ka-pow!
738266 740257 [Crowd cheering]
743338 744965 [Screaming]
753215 754739 [Cheering]
756785 758776 Oh, Lightning!
760222 763055 If you figure that out<br />you just gonna be OK.
763124 766753 Oh, yeah, that...<br />That is spectacular advice.
766828 768261 Thank you, Mr. The King.
768330 770423 - [Fanfare]<br />- [Bob] Ladies and gentlemen,
770498 772728 for the first time<br />in Piston Cup history...
772801 776498 [revving] A rookie<br />has won the Piston Cup.
776905 777963 Yes!
778039 780974 [Bob]... we have a three-way tie.
781042 782873 - [Crowd cheers]<br />- [Cameras flash]
787816 790683 [Chuckling] Hey,<br />that must be really embarrassing.
790752 793414 But I wouldn't worry about it.<br />Because I didn't do it!
794489 797890 [Bob] Piston Cup officials<br />have determined that a tiebreaker race
797959 802191 between the three leaders<br />will be held in California in one week.
802430 805695 Well, thank you! Thanks to<br />all of you out there! Thank you!
805767 809464 [Whispering] Hey, first one to<br />California gets Dinoco all to himself.
809537 812506 No, not me!<br />No, you rock, and you know that!
816711 819009 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
820949 822211 Yep! All right! Got it!
822284 825742 "First one to California<br />gets Dinoco all to himself."
825820 828448 Oh, we'll see<br />who gets there first, Chick.
828523 829615 Huh?
829691 833024 - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.<br />- I don't want to talk about it.
833094 835961 Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.<br />What'd you do with my trailer?
836031 838226 - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.<br />- What?
838300 840291 Gotta make your personal appearance.
840368 842928 No. No! No, no, no, no!
843071 845471 Yes, yes, yes!<br />Lightning McQueen here.
845540 849169 And I use Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!
849244 852941 Nothing soothes a rusty bumper<br />like Rust-eze.
853348 855782 Wow! Look at that shine!
855850 859581 Use Rust-eze and you too<br />can look like me!
859654 860916 Ka-chow!
860989 863583 [Both laughing]
863658 866183 I met this car from Swampscott.
866261 869321 He was so rusty<br />he didn't even cast a shadow.
869397 872264 - You could see his dirty undercarriage.<br />- [Crowd laughs]
872334 876566 [Groaning] I hate rusty cars.<br />This is not good for my image.
876638 880039 They did give you your big break.<br />Besides, it's in your contract.
880108 883009 Oh, will you stop, please?<br />Just go get hooked up.
883078 887037 - Winter is a grand old time.<br />- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
887115 889549 [Male 1] But remember,<br />all that salt and grime...
889617 891585 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
891653 893621 Hey, look! There he is!
893688 895656 Our almost champ!
895724 897385 [Male 1] Get your rear end in here.
897459 899484 Lightning McQueen,<br />you are wicked fast!
899561 901722 - That race was a pisser!<br />- You were booking!
901796 903855 - Give me a little room.<br />- You're my hero!
903932 905763 Yes, I know. [chuckles]
905834 907392 "Fred." Fred, thank you.
907535 910060 He knows my name.<br />He knows my name!
910905 912099 Looking good, Freddie!
912173 914641 Thanks to you, Lightning,<br />we had a banner year!
914709 917234 We might clear enough<br />to buy you some headlights.
917312 919337 You saying he doesn't have headlights?
919414 921746 That's what I'm telling ya.<br />They're stickers!
921816 924808 Well, you know,<br />racecars don't need headlights,
924886 926877 because the track is always lit.
926955 930152 Yeah, well, so is my brother,<br />but he still needs headlights.
930225 931886 [Laughing]
932794 934989 [Forced laughter]
935063 938829 - Ladies and gentlemen,<br />- [both] Lightning McQueen!
939734 941725 [Crickets chirping]
941803 943737 Free Bird!
943805 947138 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment team
947208 949073 ran a great race today.
949477 951809 And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
951913 954074 [whispering] And an insane<br />amount of luck,
954149 958677 ...you too, can look like me.<br />Ka-chow.
961322 962789 - Hey, kid.<br />- We love ya.
962857 965325 And we're looking forward<br />to another great year.
965393 966690 Just like this year!
968096 970564 Not on your life.
970799 974360 - Don't drive like my brother!<br />- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
974436 977428 California, here we come!
977539 980201 Dinoco, here we come!
980275 982266 [~ Rascal Flatts: Life is a Highway]
1065760 1067352 [Birds chirping]
1084412 1088314 [Phone ringing]
1088416 1093945 [Moaning] Oh... oh... uh,<br />I needed this. Hello?
1094022 1097617 [Male] Is this Lightning McQueen,<br />the world's fastest racing machine?
1097692 1099819 Is this Harv,<br />the world's greatest agent?
1099894 1102658 And it is such an honor<br />to be your agent
1102730 1105756 that it almost hurts me to take<br />ten percent of your winnings.
1105833 1110930 Merchandising. And ancillary rights in<br />perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!
1111005 1113496 I didn't see it,<br />but I heard you were great.

1634929 1636920 [Sighing]
1638299 1641029 We're live at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway
1641102 1643627 as the first competitor,<br />Lightning McQueen,
1643704 1646002 is arriving at the track.
1646073 1648007 Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
1648075 1649235 What's your strategy?
1649310 1651210 - [Crowd gasps]<br />- [Cameras clicking]
1651278 1653974 What? Did I forget<br />to wipe my mud flaps?
1655516 1658883 McQueen's driver arrived in California,<br />but McQueen was missing.
1658953 1662912 - McQueen was reported missing.<br />...to race an unprecedented...
1662990 1665550 [male] Sponsor stated<br />they have no idea where he is.
1668496 1671988 I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate<br />to see anything bad happen to him.
1672066 1676264 I don't know what's harder to find,<br />McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!
1676337 1679431 [German accent] Lightning McQueen<br />must be found at all costs!
1679507 1683466 They're all asking the same question:<br />Where is McQueen?
1684445 1686606 [Groaning] Oh, boy.
1687615 1689742 Where am I?
1689884 1692409 - Mornin', sleepin' beauty!<br />- Ah!
1693120 1695611 Boy, I was wonderin'<br />when you was gonna wake up.
1695689 1698385 Take whatever you want!<br />Just don't hurt me!
1698659 1701355 A parking boot?<br />Why do I have a parking boot on?
1701428 1706388 - What's going on here? Please!<br />- [Chuckling] You're funny.
1706467 1709527 I like you already. My name's Mater.
1711038 1712027 Mater?
1712106 1715041 Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"<br />but without the "tuh".
1715109 1718374 - What's your name?<br />- You don't know my name?
1718445 1719434 Uh...
1719513 1722914 No, I know your name.<br />Is your name Mater too?
1722983 1724007 What?
1724084 1728851 Look, I need to get to California<br />as fast as possible. Where am I?
1728923 1731187 Where are you? Shoot!
1731258 1732816 You're in Radiator Springs.
1732893 1736294 The cutest little town<br />in Carburetor County.
1736363 1739230 Oh, great. Just great!
1739300 1743828 Well, if you think that's great,<br />you should see the rest of the town.
1743904 1747704 You know,<br />I'd love to see the rest of the town!
1747908 1750741 So if you could just open the gate,<br />take this boot off,

1755916 1757440 - Cool!<br />- Mater!
1757518 1760385 What did I tell you<br />about talkin' to the accused?
1760454 1761944 To not to.
1762022 1766459 Well, quit your yappin' and tow this<br />delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
1766527 1768620 Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
1768696 1771563 [Chuckling] "Later, Mater."<br />That's funny!

1786614 1788377 I gotta get to California, pronto.
1788449 1789609 Where's your lawyer?
1789683 1792948 I don't know. Tahiti maybe.<br />He's got a timeshare there.
1793020 1798151 When a defendant has no lawyer,<br />the court will assign one to him. Hey!
1798225 1800216 Anyone want to be his lawyer?
1801595 1803927 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
1803998 1807764 All rise! The Honorable<br />Doc Hudson presiding.

1812706 1813900 - [Gasping]<br />- All right,
1813974 1817102 I wanna know who's responsible<br />for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
1817177 1819077 I want his hood on a platter!
1819146 1821808 I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!<br />No, check that.
1821882 1825648 I'm gonna put him in jail till<br />the jail rots on top of him,
1825719 1829382 and then I'm gonna move him<br />to a new jail and let that jail rot.
1829456 1830980 I'm...
1832960 1834894 Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
1834962 1838329 I want him out of my courtroom.<br />I want him out of our town!
1838465 1840057 - Case dismissed.<br />- Yes!
1840134 1842398 Boy, I'm purty good<br />at this lawyerin' stuff.
1842469 1843936 Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

1849043 1851511 Hey, thanks for comin',<br />but we're all set.
1851578 1854012 - He's letting me go.<br />- He's letting you go?
1854081 1856015 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
1856083 1859246 All you have to do now is stand there<br />and let me look at you.

1863290 1864917 - What the? Ow! Oh!<br />- Ka-chow!
1864992 1868052 - Please!<br />- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
1868195 1871722 I create feelings in others that<br />they themselves don't understand.
1871799 1873460 - [Revving]<br />- Agh! Ow!
1873534 1875934 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
1876003 1878028 A little bit, but I'll be all right.
1878105 1881871 OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
1881942 1884536 Do what you gotta do, baby.<br />But listen. Be careful.
1884611 1888308 Folks around here are not firing on<br />all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
1888415 1890383 Ka-ching!
1890451 1891543 Ah!
1891685 1893619 I'll keep that in mind.
1893787 1896187 - Hey there, Mater.<br />- Howdy, Sally.
1896557 1898855 - Hi, folks!<br />- Good morning!
1899593 1900582 You know her?

1903697 1904686 What?
1904765 1908861 Nah, I'm just kiddin'.<br />She just likes me for my body.
1908936 1912770 You look great. You do something<br />different with your side view mirrors?
1912840 1914501 What do you want, Sally?
1914575 1917942 [Sighing] Come on, make this guy<br />fix the road. The town needs this.
1918011 1921174 No. I know his type. Racecar.
1921248 1923307 That's the last thing this town needs.
1923384 1927878 OK, I didn't want to have to do this,<br />Doc, but you leave me no choice.
1927955 1931891 Fellow citizens, you're all aware<br />of our town's proud history.
1931959 1933392 Here she goes again.
1933460 1936156 Radiator Springs,<br />the glorious jewel
1936230 1939859 strung on the necklace<br />of Route 66, the mother road!
1939933 1943733 It is our job and our pleasure<br />to take care of the travelers
1943804 1946796 - on our stretch of that road.<br />- Travelers? What travelers?
1946874 1948034 Ignore him.
1948108 1951475 But how, I ask you,<br />are we to care for those travelers
1951545 1953877 if there is no road<br />for them to drive on?
1953947 1956745 - Luigi, what do you have at your store?<br />- Tires.
1956817 1958307 And if no one can get to you?
1958385 1962719 I won't sell any... tires.<br />I will lose everything!
1962790 1965623 - Flo, what do you have at your store?<br />- I have gas.
1965692 1969093 - Lotsa gas!<br />- OK boys, stay with me.
1969163 1972690 And, Flo, what'll happen if no one<br />can come to your station to buy gas?
1972766 1976258 I'll go outta business and...<br />we'll have to leave town.
1976336 1979464 What's gonna happen if Flo<br />leaves town and closes her station?
1979540 1982100 - [All] Without gas, we're done for!<br />- What?
1982176 1985009 Don't you think the car responsible<br />should fix our road?
1985078 1988309 The only guy strong enough<br />to fix that road is Big Al!
1988382 1990612 Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
1990684 1992709 Then why are you bringing<br />him up, you lemon?
1992786 1993775 Oh, he can do it.
1993854 1996652 He's got the horsepower.<br />So, what do you want him to do?
1996723 1998190 [All] Fix the road!
1998258 2001819 - Because we are a town worth fixing!<br />- Yeah!
2001895 2003157 [All cheer]
2003230 2006427 [Honking] Order in the court!
2007201 2009965 Seems like my mind<br />has been changed for me.
2010037 2012028 - [All] Yeah!<br />- No!
2012105 2013436 [VW van] Nice ruling.
2014174 2017666 Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
2017744 2021612 [Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.<br />You can take Bessie.
2021815 2023510 Man, you get to work with Bessie!
2023584 2026212 I'd give my left two lug nuts<br />for somethin' like that.
2026286 2028948 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
2029022 2030717 [Gurgling]
2031158 2035117 This here is Bessie,<br />finest road-pavin' machine ever built.
2035195 2038255 I'm hereby sentencing you<br />to community service.
2038332 2041062 You're gonna fix the road<br />under my supervision.
2041134 2043466 What? This place is crazy!
2043537 2045698 I know this may be<br />a bad time right now,
2045772 2048764 but you owe me $32,000<br />in legal fees.
2048842 2049831 What?
2049910 2053471 We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,<br />and you're gonna pull her nice.
2053547 2055139 You gotta be kidding me.
2055215 2057877 You start there where the road begins.
2058252 2061244 You finish down there<br />where the road ends.
2063223 2065487 [Mater] Holy shoot!
2066026 2068426 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />How long is this gonna take?
2068495 2072056 Well, fella does it right,<br />should take him about five days.
2072132 2073292 Five days?
2073367 2076302 But I should be in California<br />schmoozing Dinoco right now!
2076370 2079339 Then if I were you,<br />I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
2079406 2081897 - Hook him up, Mater.<br />- Okay-dokey.
2083544 2086104 [Grunting]

2089983 2092213 [Lightning] Freedom!
2097524 2101051 Maybe I should've<br />hooked him up to Bessie...
2101828 2105127 ...and then...<br />then took the boot off.
2106600 2109000 Whoo-hoo!
2109736 2113729 Goodbye, Radiator Springs,<br />and goodbye, Bessie!

2124151 2125175 [Sputtering]
2125252 2127277 No. No, no, no.
2127588 2129886 No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
2129957 2131948 How can I be outta gas?
2132025 2135984 [Chuckling] Boy, we ain't<br />as dumb as you think we are.
2136063 2138395 [Stuttering] But how did,<br />how did... you?
2138465 2140797 We siphoned your gas<br />while you were passed out.
2140867 2143768 - Ka-chow.<br />- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
2152179 2154579 - Gentlemen.<br />- Sheriff.
2154648 2155740 Hey, Sheriff.
2155816 2158080 - Why here?<br />- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.
2158151 2160642 - They were better before.<br />- Stai sempre a parlare.
2160721 2162586 - Guido!<br />- Red, can you move over?
2162656 2165489 I want to get a look<br />at that sexy hot rod.
2165559 2168392 You know, I used to be<br />a purty good whistler.
2168462 2171192 I can't do it now, of course,<br />on account of sometimes
2171264 2174165 I get fluid built up<br />in my engine block,
2174234 2177601 but Doc said he's gonna fix it.<br />He can fix about anything.
2177671 2179901 That's why we made him the judge.
2180073 2184237 Boy, you shoulda heard me on<br />Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.
2184311 2185676 Now, I'm not one to brag
2185746 2189045 but people come purty far<br />to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
2189516 2190540 Oh!
2190617 2193450 - Aw, man, that's just great!<br />- Hey, what's wrong?
2193520 2195317 My lucky sticker's all dirty.
2195389 2197653 Ah, that ain't nothin'.<br />I'll clean it for ya.
2197724 2202423 - [Snorting, hacking]<br />- No, no, no!
2202496 2204828 That won't be necessary.
2205899 2209198 Hey! Hey, big fella!<br />Yeah, you in the red!
2209269 2211897 I could use a little hose down.<br />Help me wash this off.
2214341 2215330 Where's he goin'?
2215409 2218845 Oh, he's a little bit shy, and<br />he hates you for killin' his flowers.
2218912 2220436 I shouldn't put up with this.
2220514 2223381 I'm a precision instrument<br />of speed and aerodynamics.
2223450 2226476 - You hurt your what?<br />- I'm a very famous racecar!
2226753 2229950 You are a famous racecar?<br />A real racecar?
2230023 2232651 Yes, I'm a real racecar.<br />What do you think? Look at me.
2232726 2236719 I have followed racing my entire life.<br />My whole life!
2236797 2239095 Then you know who I am.<br />I'm Lightning McQueen.
2239166 2241259 - Lightning McQueen?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2241334 2243325 I must scream it to the world!
2243403 2247635 My excitement from the top<br />of someplace very high!
2247708 2250199 - Do you know many Ferraris?<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2250277 2253246 They race on the European circuit.<br />I'm in the Piston Cup!
2254014 2256949 - [Lightning] What?<br />- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
2261822 2264382 Is that what I think it is?
