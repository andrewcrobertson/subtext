37671 38405 [Inhaling and exhaling deeply]
38672 41675 [Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.
41941 45178 Speed. I am speed.
45278 46780 [Cars whizzing past]
47147 49783 One winner, 42 losers.
49783 52218 I eat losers for breakfast.
52218 54870 [Car accelerating]
54587 55955 Breakfast.
56220 61428 Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast.<br />No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
61728 63229 [Cars whizzing]
63530 65665 I'm faster than fast.<br />Quicker than quick.
65865 67330 I am lightning!
67100 68340 [Pounding on door]
68134 70337 [Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?
70403 71838 [~ Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]
72172 75208 Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
75742 77744 [engine revving]
82649 84951 [Engine revs]
96329 97664 [Crowd cheers]
113646 114681 Ka-chow!
114781 115949 [Cars zooming]
123723 125910 [Cars whooshing]
156656 158240 [Both scream]
158910 161995 [All cheer]
162620 163963 Get your antenna balls here!
181214 183116 - [Chuckling]<br />- Hey!
185885 188755 - [Tires squealing]<br />- [Crowd booing]
189756 191558 What a ride!
191558 192792 [Chuckling]
200934 203503 - Dinoco is all mine.<br />- [Screaming]
204104 205939 [Darrell] Trouble, turn three!
206600 209109 - Get through that, McQueen.<br />- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!
209109 210760 [Crowd gasps]
213513 216683 [Screaming]
220787 221755 [Giggling]
221855 224257 - [Grunts]<br />- [Gasps]
226590 228228 [Both screaming]
231364 234134 [Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.<br />McQueen is in the wreckage.
234134 237804 [Darrell] There's no way the rookie<br />can make it through!
248815 250850 [Exhaling]
252152 253787 Yeah!
253853 255722 Lightning! Oh!
257691 260600 [Darrell] Look at that!<br />McQueen made it through!
260126 263363 [Bob] A spectacular move<br />by Lightning McQueen!
263363 265398 Yeah! Ka-chow!
265465 268601 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!<br />McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
268668 271504 Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]
271571 273707 [Bob] While everyone<br />heads into the pits,
273773 275475 McQueen stays out to take the lead!
275542 278411 Don't take me out, coach.<br />I can still race!
278478 281114 [Air wrench whirring]
284517 285885 [Chuckling] What do you think?<br />A thing of beauty.
285885 287754 - McQueen made it!<br />- [Chick] What?
287887 288888 He's not pitting!
289890 292920 You gotta get me out there!<br />Let's go! Get me back out there!
292292 294294 McQueen's not going into the pits!
294461 297997 [Darrell] The rookie fired his<br />crew chief. The third this season!
298198 300400 - [Bob] Says he likes working alone.<br />- Go, go!
300467 302602 Looks like Chick<br />got caught up in the pits.
302669 305939 Yeah, after a stop like that,<br />he's got a lot of ground to make up.
306600 308308 Get ready, boys,<br />we're coming to the restart!
311110 313880 [Crowd cheers]
320787 322422 Come on, come on, come on!
336803 338805 We need tires now!<br />Come on, let's go!
339105 341675 - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!<br />- [Male] What?
342242 344210 You need tires, you idiot!
344210 346513 [Darrell] Looks like it's<br />gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
346646 348480 [Bob] Right. No tires again.
348480 350383 [Darrell] That's a short-term gain,<br />long-term loss,
350383 354521 but it's workin' for him. He obviously<br />knows somethin' we don't know.
355221 357991 [Cars whizzing]
363763 367801 [Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go<br />and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
367867 370337 He's got it in the bag.<br />Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
370537 372739 We're gonna crown us a new champion!
372972 375750 [Crowd cheers and whistles]
375141 377277 [Screaming]
379112 381247 - Checkered flag, here I come!<br />- [Tire blows]
381614 383516 [Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!
383616 386219 [Bob] And with only one turn to go!<br />Can he make it?
386920 389389 - You fool!<br />- [Grunts]
390623 392258 [Male] McQueen's blown a tire!<br />He's blown a tire!
392425 393860 Go, go, go!
402569 403970 - [Grunting]<br />- [Tire blows]
404104 405672 [Darrell] He's lost another tire!
405705 408808 - King and Chick come up fast!<br />- [Bob] They're entering turn three!
409342 411111 Come on. [grunting]
412445 414581 I don't believe<br />what I'm watching, Bob!
415115 418518 Lightning McQueen<br />is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
419519 420787 [Gasping]
422288 423423 [Growling]
424657 427160 [Bob] The King and Chick<br />rounding turn four.
429496 432632 [Darrell] Down the stretch they come!<br />And it's, and it's...
433266 435168 - It's too close to call! Too close!<br />- I don't believe it!
435669 436970 Lightning!
438380 440907 - The most spectacular, amazing...<br />- I don't believe it!
440974 444277 ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending<br />in the history of the world!
444377 446312 - And we don't know who won!<br />- Look at that!
447714 449449 [Tape jittering]
451384 453119 [Slow motion drone]
456690 459592 - That's very close to call.<br />- Can we play that again?
459826 461928 Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
461995 462620 We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.
462620 464431 We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.
464497 467400 McQueen, that was a risky move,<br />not taking tires.
467467 468134 Tell me about it!
468234 470303 Are you sorry you didn't have<br />a crew chief out there?
470970 474207 Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing<br />than just winning.
474541 478411 I mean, taking the race by a full lap...<br />Where's the entertainment in that?
478745 480680 I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
480880 482615 - Sizzle?<br />- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
482682 485218 No, I'm not.<br />'Cause I'm a one-man show.
485285 485885 What?
486520 488521 That was a confident<br />Lightning McQueen.
488855 490990 Live from Victory Lane,
491157 492926 - Get outta the shot.<br />- Yo, Chuck.
492992 495295 Chuck, what are you doing?<br />You're blockin' the camera!
495395 499766 - Everyone wants to see the bolt.  - What?  - Now, back away.<br />- That's it! Come on, guys.
500767 505105 - Whoa, team! Where are you going?<br />- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
505305 506940 Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
507574 511770 How will I ever find anyone else<br />who knows how to fill me up with gas?
511144 511544 [Crowd laughs]
511644 514547 - Adios, Chuck!<br />- And my name is not Chuck!
514614 518510 Whatever, I knew that.<br />- Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
518485 521654 Seriously, that was some<br />pretty darn nice racin' out there.
521888 522856 - By me!<br />- Oh, yeah.
524391 526359 - Zinger!<br />- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
526593 529162 The Piston Cup...<br />It's mine, dude. It's mine.
529996 534367 Hey, fellas, how do you think<br />I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
534434 536202 In your dreams, Thunder.
536269 539239 Yeah, right. Thunder?<br />What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
539305 542800 You know, 'cause thunder<br />always comes after lightning.
542750 543810 Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
543877 546212 - Who knew about the thunder thing?<br />- I didn't.
546279 547914 - Give us the bolt!<br />- That's right.
547981 549382 Right in the lens.
549549 551618 - Show me the bolt, baby!<br />- Smile, McQueen!
551685 554854 - Show me the bolt, McQueen!<br />- That's it!
555622 558240 for the first time<br />in Piston Cup history...
558291 561861 [revving] A rookie<br />has won the Piston Cup.
561861 562896 Yes!
563863 566666 [Bob]... we have a three-way tie.
566733 568501 - [Crowd cheers]<br />- [Cameras flash]
572372 575775 [Chuckling] Hey,<br />that must be really embarrassing.
575975 578545 But I wouldn't worry about it.<br />Because I didn't do it!
579446 582682 [Bob] Piston Cup officials<br />have determined that a tiebreaker race
582749 587253 between the three leaders<br />will be held in California in one week.
587554 590690 Well, thank you! Thanks to<br />all of you out there! Thank you!
590757 594294 [Whispering] Hey, first one to<br />California gets Dinoco all to himself.
594594 597464 No, not me!<br />No, you rock, and you know that!
602769 604604 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
606973 610276 "First one to California<br />gets Dinoco all to himself."
610343 612879 Oh, we'll see<br />who gets there first, Chick.
613513 614547 Huh?
614614 619319 - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.<br />- I don't want to talk about it.
619319 621855 Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.<br />What'd you do with my trailer?
622880 624257 - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.<br />- What?
624657 626559 Gotta make your personal appearance.
626893 628595 No. No! No, no, no, no!
628862 631164 Yes, yes, yes!<br />Lightning McQueen here.
631531 635335 And I use Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!
635635 638905 Nothing soothes a rusty bumper<br />like Rust-eze.
639339 641641 Wow! Look at that shine!
641641 645679 Use Rust-eze and you too<br />can look like me!
645912 647113 Ka-chow!
647447 649949 [Both laughing]
650160 652419 I met this car from Swampscott.
652519 655455 He was so rusty<br />he didn't even cast a shadow.
655522 658258 - You could see his dirty undercarriage.<br />- [Crowd laughs]
658258 662862 [Groaning] I hate rusty cars.<br />This is not good for my image.
663960 666366 They did give you your big break.<br />Besides, it's in your contract.
666366 668868 Oh, will you stop, please?<br />Just go get hooked up.
669135 672939 - Winter is a grand old time.<br />- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
673406 675742 [Male 1] But remember,<br />all that salt and grime...
675809 677711 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
677744 679646 Hey, look! There he is!
679713 681614 Our almost champ!
681648 683249 [Male 1] Get your rear end in here.
683316 685285 Lightning McQueen,<br />you are wicked fast!
685352 687420 - That race was a pisser!<br />- You were booking!
687487 689456 - Give me a little room.<br />- You're my hero!
689522 691291 Yes, I know. [chuckles]
691358 692859 "Fred." Fred, thank you.
692992 695428 He knows my name.<br />He knows my name!
696229 697364 Looking good, Freddie!
697430 699799 Thanks to you, Lightning,<br />we had a banner year!
700934 703370 We might clear enough<br />to buy you some headlights.
703670 705605 You saying he doesn't have headlights?
705839 708740 That's what I'm telling ya.<br />They're stickers!
708408 711277 Well, you know,<br />racecars don't need headlights,
711544 713446 because the track is always lit.
713680 716216 Yeah, well, so is my brother,<br />but he still needs headlights.
716216 717817 [Laughing]
718785 720887 [Forced laughter]
721354 724958 - Ladies and gentlemen,<br />- [both] Lightning McQueen!
725592 727527 [Crickets chirping]
729596 732799 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment team
733199 735100 ran a great race today.
735435 737671 And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
737904 740600 [whispering] And an insane<br />amount of luck,
740600 744344 ...you too, can look like me.<br />Ka-chow.
746880 748281 - Hey, kid.<br />- We love ya.
748348 750717 And we're looking forward<br />to another great year.
750784 752180 Just like this year!
754487 756856 Not on your life.
757570 760493 - Don't drive like my brother!<br />- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
760560 763430 California, here we come!
763530 766990 Dinoco, here we come!
770236 771971 [Phone ringing]
772405 778345 [Moaning] Oh... oh... uh,<br />I needed this. Hello?
778345 781281 [Male] Is this Lightning McQueen,<br />the world's fastest racing machine?
781281 783350 Is this Harv,<br />the world's greatest agent?
783650 785385 And it is such an honor<br />to be your agent
785385 788455 that it almost hurts me to take<br />ten percent of your winnings.
788455 793560 Merchandising. And ancillary rights in<br />perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!
793893 796296 I didn't see it,<br />but I heard you were great.
796696 797764 Thanks, Harv.
797864 801368 Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets<br />for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.
801434 804400 I'll pass 'em on to your friends.<br />Shoot me the names.
804104 807730 - You let Harv rock it for you, baby.<br />- Right. Friends.
807640 809476 Yes, there's...
811678 814147 OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.
814147 816883 So many you can't even narrow it down.<br />Hey, when you get to town,
816950 819190 you better make time<br />for your best friend!
819850 820620 Break bread<br />with your mishpocheh here!
820854 823230 That'd be great!<br />We should totally...

830630 831998 [Lightning] What? A minivan?
832298 834768 Come on, you're in the slow lane.
834968 836569 This is Lightning McQueen<br />you're hauling here.
836569 838738 Just stopping off<br />for a quick breather, kid.
839720 841908 - Old Mack needs a rest.<br />- Absolutely not.
841908 845478 We're driving all night till we<br />get to California. We agreed to it.
845478 849482 All night? May I remind you<br />federal DOT regs state...
849683 852786 Come on, I need to get there<br />before Chick and hang with Dinoco.
852986 854454 [Mack groans]<br />All those sleeping trucks.
854954 857557 Hey, kid,<br />I don't know if I can make it.
857757 859125 Oh, sure you can, Mack.
859325 861561 Look, it'll be easy.<br />I'll stay up with you.
861795 864330 - All night?<br />- All night long.

1135969 1138705 [Grunting] I'm gonna<br />blow a gasket or somethin'.
1138772 1141700 Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

1217350 1219190 [Car backfires]
1220720 1222155 [Sirens blasting]
1224290 1227327 What? That's not the Interstate!

1312445 1315749 Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.
1315815 1317717 [Sighing]
1319520 1321654 We're live at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway
1321721 1324157 as the first competitor,<br />Lightning McQueen,
1324224 1326426 is arriving at the track.
1326493 1328361 Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
1328428 1329529 What's your strategy?
1330597 1332432 - [Crowd gasps]<br />- [Cameras clicking]
1332499 1335680 What? Did I forget<br />to wipe my mud flaps?
1336360 1339572 McQueen's driver arrived in California,<br />but McQueen was missing.
1339572 1343977 - McQueen was reported missing.<br />...to race an unprecedented...
1343977 1346413 [male] Sponsor stated<br />they have no idea where he is.
1346413 1349282 I received information that we don't<br />know where her is now.
1349349 1352519 I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate<br />to see anything bad happen to him.
1352719 1356923 I don't know what's harder to find,<br />McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!
1357900 1359893 [German accent] Lightning McQueen<br />must be found at all costs!
1360600 1363296 They're all asking the same question:<br />Where is McQueen?
1365498 1368134 [Groaning] Oh, boy.
1368702 1369836 Where am I?
1370503 1372572 - Mornin', sleepin' beauty!<br />- Ah!
1374107 1376676 Boy, I was wonderin'<br />when you was gonna wake up.
1376676 1379450 Take whatever you want!<br />Just don't hurt me!
1379379 1382248 A parking boot?<br />Why do I have a parking boot on?
1382482 1387153 - What's going on here?<br />- [Chuckling] You're funny.
1387354 1390230 I like you already. My name's Mater.
1391825 1392759 Mater?
1393260 1395595 Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"<br />but without the "tuh".
1395862 1398732 - What's your name?<br />- You don't know my name?
1398998 1399532 Uh...
1399699 1403536 No, I know your name.<br />Is your name Mater too?
1403737 1404704 What?
1404904 1409142 Look, I need to get to California<br />as fast as possible. Where am I?
1409542 1411711 Where are you? Shoot!
1411878 1413380 You're in Radiator Springs.
1414140 1417283 The cutest little town<br />in Carburetor County.
1417650 1420387 Oh, great. Just great!
1420653 1424157 Well, if you think that's great,<br />you should see the rest of the town.
1424724 1428361 You know,<br />I'd love to see the rest of the town!
1428561 1431297 So if you could just open the gate,<br />take this boot off,
1431364 1433967 you and me, we go cruisin',<br />check out the local scene...
1434667 1436803 - Dad-gum!<br />- How'd that be, Tuhmater?
1436870 1438338 - Cool!<br />- Mater!
1438438 1441174 What did I tell you<br />about talkin' to the accused?
1441241 1442676 To not to.
1442742 1447130 Well, quit your yappin' and tow this<br />delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
1447470 1449820 Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
1449149 1451885 [Chuckling] "Later, Mater."<br />That's funny!
1452152 1453860 Ah!
1453186 1456723 [Sheriff] The Radiator Springs<br />Traffic Court will come to order!
1457624 1460994 Hey, you scratched my paint!<br />I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
1461940 1463396 You broke-a the road!<br />You a very bad car!
1463463 1464431 - Fascist!<br />- Commie!
1464497 1467100 Officer, talk to me, babe.<br />How long is this gonna take?
1467167 1468868 I gotta get to California, pronto.
1468935 1470360 Where's your lawyer?
1470103 1473239 I don't know. Tahiti maybe.<br />He's got a timeshare there.
1473306 1478211 When a defendant has no lawyer,<br />the court will assign one to him. Hey!
1478311 1480213 Anyone want to be his lawyer?
1482349 1484584 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
1484684 1488288 All rise! The Honorable<br />Doc Hudson presiding.
1488922 1490230 Show-off.
1490230 1493460 - May Doc have mercy on your soul.<br />- [Door banging]
1493460 1494160 - [Gasping]<br />- All right,
1494227 1497230 I wanna know who's responsible<br />for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
1497764 1499599 I want his hood on a platter!
1499666 1502202 I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!<br />No, check that.
1502302 1505905 I'm gonna put him in jail till<br />the jail rots on top of him,
1505972 1509476 and then I'm gonna move him<br />to a new jail and let that jail rot.
1509542 1511110 I'm...
1513446 1515315 Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
1515348 1518585 I want him out of my courtroom.<br />I want him out of our town!
1518718 1520253 - Case dismissed.<br />- Yes!
1520320 1522489 Boy, I'm purty good<br />at this lawyerin' stuff.
1522555 1523957 Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!
1525658 1529496 Holy Porsche! She's gotta be<br />from my attorney's office.
1529796 1533400 Hey, thanks for comin',<br />but we're all set.
1533400 1534334 - He's letting me go.<br />- He's letting you go?
1534401 1536469 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
1536703 1539606 All you have to do now is stand there<br />and let me look at you.
1539839 1544100 Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.<br />Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!
1544177 1545645 - What the? Ow! Oh!<br />- Ka-chow!
1545812 1548882 - Please!<br />- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
1549150 1551985 I create feelings in others that<br />they themselves don't understand.
1552850 1554870 - [Revving]<br />- Agh! Ow!
1554220 1556423 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
1556523 1558658 A little bit, but I'll be all right.
1561127 1562529 OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
1562629 1565398 Do what you gotta do, baby.<br />But listen. Be careful.
1565532 1569169 Folks around here are not firing on<br />all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
1569302 1570670 Ka-ching!
1571710 1572238 Ah!
1572572 1573406 I'll keep that in mind.
1574374 1576843 - Hey there, Mater.<br />- Howdy, Sally.
1577177 1579713 - Hi, folks!<br />- Good morning!
1580280 1581140 You know her?
1581314 1583717 She's the town attorney and my fiancee.
1584284 1585251 What?
1585385 1589356 Nah, I'm just kiddin'.<br />She just likes me for my body.
1589723 1593259 You look great. You do something<br />different with your side view mirrors?
1593426 1594861 What do you want, Sally?
1595362 1598465 [Sighing] Come on, make this guy<br />fix the road. The town needs this.
1598631 1601735 No. I know his type. Racecar.
1602268 1603903 That's the last thing this town needs.
1604437 1608541 OK, I didn't want to have to do this,<br />Doc, but you leave me no choice.
1609142 1612445 Fellow citizens, you're all aware<br />of our town's proud history.
1612645 1614470 Here she goes again.
1614180 1616750 Radiator Springs,<br />the glorious jewel
1616750 1620353 strung on the necklace<br />of Route 66, the mother road!
1620854 1624491 It is our job and our pleasure<br />to take care of the travelers
1624858 1626693 - on our stretch of that road.<br />- Travelers? What travelers?
1627293 1628395 Ignore him.
1628695 1631965 But how, I ask you,<br />are we to care for those travelers
1632165 1634401 if there is no road<br />for them to drive on?
1634401 1637837 - Luigi, what do you have at your store?<br />- Tires.
1637837 1639272 And if no one can get to you?
1639339 1643510 I won't sell any... tires.<br />I will lose everything!
1643576 1646279 - Flo, what do you have at your store?<br />- I have gas.
1646346 1649616 - Lotsa gas!<br />- OK boys, stay with me.
1649683 1653530 And, Flo, what'll happen if no one<br />can come to your station to buy gas?
1653119 1656489 I'll go outta business and...<br />we'll have to leave town.
1656923 1660293 What's gonna happen if Flo<br />leaves town and closes her station?
1660660 1662595 - [All] Without gas, we're done for!<br />- What?
1662595 1665699 Don't you think the car responsible<br />should fix our road?
1665699 1668802 The only guy strong enough<br />to fix that road is Big Al!
1669202 1671438 Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
1671604 1673540 Then why are you bringing<br />him up, you lemon?
1673973 1674908 Oh, he can do it.
1674974 1677677 He's got the horsepower.<br />So, what do you want him to do?
1677744 1679145 [All] Fix the road!
1679212 1682615 - Because we are a town worth fixing!<br />- Yeah!
1682716 1683917 [All cheer]
1683983 1687530 [Honking] Order in the court!
1687787 1690423 Seems like my mind<br />has been changed for me.
1690523 1693293 - [All] Yeah!<br />- No!
1693526 1694794 [VW van] Nice ruling.
1695280 1698164 Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
1698431 1702102 [Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.<br />You can take Bessie.
1702435 1704337 Man, you get to work with Bessie!
1704571 1707730 I'd give my left two lug nuts<br />for somethin' like that.
1707730 1708975 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
1709242 1712479 Customers!  We have customers!  Customers!
1712712 1716783 Comeon,  Everyone, I know it's been a long time,<br />but we're all ready.
1717317 1720854 Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out.<br />You all know what to do.
1720854 1723189 Clear?  All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
1723356 1725558 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.
1725925 1731231 - Minny, I know exactly where we are.<br />- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
1731431 1732699 - Honey, please.<br />- Hello.
1733660 1735568 Welcome to Radiator Springs,<br />gateway to Ornament Valley.
1735769 1738405 Legendary for<br />its service and hospitality.
1738638 1739172 How can we help you?
1739372 1743877 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
1743877 1746546 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
1746713 1749282 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
1749416 1752318 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
1752719 1756122 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, Thanks.<br />- What you really need
1756256 1759693 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
1760930 1761428 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
1761428 1764431 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
1764564 1767600 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.
1767701 1769836 - Honey, surplus!<br />- We have too much surplus.
1769836 1772872 I do have a map<br />over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
1772872 1775909 And if you stay, we offer a free<br />Lincoln Continental breakfast.
1775909 1779913 - Honey, she's got a map.<br />- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.
1780146 1783283 - Never need a map again, thank you.<br />- How 'bout somethin' to drink?
1783516 1787854 Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe.<br />Finest fuel on Route 66.
1787854 1788988 No we just topped off.
1789550 1792759 And if you need tires,<br />stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
1792826 1795195 home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
1795261 1798465 - We're trying to find the Interstate.<br />- But you do need a paint job.
1798531 1801568 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
1801634 1803837 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...
1803903 1805171 Maybe ghost flames!
1805238 1807707 You like old school pinstripin'?<br />Von Dutch style?
1807774 1811511 - [Both gasp]<br />- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
1812450 1814948 [Chuckling] OK, no.<br />We're gonna be going now, Thank you.
1814948 1816383 Ow!
1816816 1819886 [Laughs] A little somethin'<br />to remember us by, OK?
1820220 1822222 - OK!<br />- Come back soon, OK?
1822655 1826260 I mean, you know where we are!<br />Tell your friends!
1827660 1829629 [Van] OK! Yes. You bet.
1829729 1831898 Thanks again, folks.<br />Bye-bye now.
1831965 1834934 Psst! Psst!<br />Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
1835100 1837700 - I know how to get to the Interstate!<br />- Do ya?
1837370 1839939 - Minny, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1840206 1841608 No, not really. But listen.
1841675 1845145 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
1845211 1847647 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
1847714 1851384 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
1854200 1856189 - [Locks beeping]<br />- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1856256 1858992 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
1859225 1862328 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
1862562 1864564 I'm becoming one of them!
1864798 1865799 - [Lightning echoes]<br />- [Sighing]
1866299 1868935 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
1868935 1870103 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
1870103 1873640 [Male DJ] We'll be back<br />for our Hank Williams marathon...
1873640 1875642 - That's good.<br />...after a Piston Cup update.
1876176 1881414 [Kori] Still no sign of Lightning<br />McQueen. Chick arrived in California
1881581 1883616 and today became the first car<br />to spend practice time on the track.
1883783 1886553 [Chick] It's nice to get out here<br />before the other competitors.
1886619 1890256 You know, get a head start.<br />Gives me an edge.
1890323 1891725 [Electronic music]
1891791 1893493 [Laughing]
1893560 1895261 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
1901234 1902202 Ha-ha!
1906390 1907700 Yeah!
1907540 1909576 [Crowd shouting and cheering]
1915415 1918118 [Girls chattering and giggling]
1918318 1920553 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
1922122 1922722 [Gasping] Oh!
1922922 1924224 Mater, let me get this straight.
1924224 1927360 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
1927627 1931398 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
1931865 1933333 I got a road to finish.
1933833 1936136 [Grunting and revving]
1944344 1946646 - He's done!<br />- Done?
1946713 1948982 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
1950850 1954200 - [Bessie groans]<br />- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
1954870 1956856 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
1957857 1961361 [Mater] Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
1962128 1963663 Oh!
1964297 1967801 [Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.
1968680 1971371 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
1971471 1974841 - Oh!<br />- [Blubbering]
1975208 1977110 Red.
1979913 1981181 Who do you think you are?
1981548 1984718 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
1984884 1988188 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
1988388 1990590 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
1990924 1994661 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
1994861 1995995 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
1996396 2000400 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
2000767 2004337 - What?<br />- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?
2004504 2006506 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
2006940 2009509 If I win, you do the road my way.
2009509 2011440 Doc, what're you doin'?
2011144 2012979 I don't mean to be rude Doc,
2013213 2016983 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
2017830 2019719 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
2019786 2023957 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
2026259 2028395 [Sheriff] Listen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
2028561 2033660 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
2033466 2036703 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
2036870 2039639 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
2039639 2044344 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
2044511 2046790 and no lollygaggin'.
2046146 2047914 Speed. I'm speed.
2047981 2050450 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
2050517 2051484 [Luigi laughs]
2051618 2056222 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
2056289 2058725 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh... [chuckles]
2058792 2062362 The race is only one lap, guys.
2062362 2064731 Uno lappo! Don't need any help.
2064731 2068401 - I work solo mio.<br />- Fine. Race your way.
2069569 2073273 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
2073973 2075442 Gentlemen...
2075909 2078645 ...start your engines!
2079450 2080647 [Engine sputters]
2083830 2085452 [Revving furiously]
2085452 2087721 - IHijole! Check that out!<br />- Whoa.
2088321 2091291 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
2091658 2092892 Luigi?
2092959 2096290 [Chuckling] On your mark, get set...
2096960 2098231 Uno for the money,<br />due for the show,
2098865 2104304 tre to get ready, and quattro<br />to... I can't believe it. Go!
2105472 2106506 [Giggling]
2108174 2109976 [Cheering]
2112879 2114147 Huh?
2114781 2117183 Doc... the flag means go.
2117250 2120453 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
2120520 2123156 Doc, what are you doing, man?
2123223 2127160 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
2127494 2130196 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
2130397 2133266 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
2134868 2136469 You got your tow cable?
2136469 2138571 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
2138571 2140774 [Doc] Oh, just in case.
2149616 2153530 [Yelling] Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
2153586 2155889 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
2156156 2158792 - Ow!<br />- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.
2158858 2160226 [Revving]
2161828 2168134 Kid! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
2168668 2170937 - I'm confused.<br />- [Chuckling]
2171400 2173600 [Doc] You drive like you fix roads.
2173730 2176142 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
2179212 2180947 [Gasps] Ah!
2182148 2184984 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
2185819 2188822 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
2194427 2197630 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
2197263 2200467 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
2200467 2202736 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
2202936 2205238 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
2205705 2208800 [Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
2208375 2212412 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
2213313 2217830 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
2217317 2218651 I'll keep an eye on him.
2218718 2223390 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
2224570 2226726 [Engine revving]
2230497 2232432 [Screaming]
2234167 2236269 [Spitting]
2237303 2239406 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
2239572 2242375 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
2242776 2245679 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
2245845 2249516 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
2249849 2252452 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
2252752 2255622 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
2255955 2257557 I'll put it simple.
2257691 2261594 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
2261828 2268201 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
2268435 2270170 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
2270470 2274274 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
2276643 2279913 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
2281348 2283116 [Groans]
2287287 2289122 [Lightning] Turn right to go left.
2290557 2292459 Hmm...
2292859 2293860 Whoa!
2294961 2297297 - Oh!<br />- [Car crashing]
2297764 2301534 - Ow! Oh, that...<br />- [cactus crashing]
2303370 2306239 [Screaming] Ow!
2308740 2311611 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
2311811 2314714 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
2314848 2318118 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
2318318 2322880 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
2329295 2332832 - Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!<br />- Che cosa?
2333166 2337604 - It looks great! This is great!<br />- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
2338271 2340940 [Grunts, passes gas]<br />Oh my!
2341241 2343276 - [Chuckles]<br />- [Sheriff] Mater!
2343643 2345612 You watch the prisoner tonight.
2345745 2349215 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
2349449 2351851 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
2352520 2354521 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
2355622 2356856 [Groaning] Oh...
2357524 2360160 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
2360326 2362862 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
2362996 2365965 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
2366166 2368334 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
2368535 2370837 You make-a such a nice new road.
2370937 2373540 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
2373640 2374941 Even though you not a Ferrari.
2375750 2377811 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
2378110 2383249 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
2383583 2386753 [Chuckling] I like your style, eh?
2386886 2390590 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
2390824 2393693 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
2393827 2395829 [Flo] Oh, would you look at that?
2396229 2397997 Ramone, Ramone!
2398298 2400500 [Luigi] Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
2400800 2403570 [Lightning] No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass.
2403570 2407700 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
2407700 2411611 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
2411878 2414981 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
2415181 2416383 [Exhales deeply]
2416649 2417751 Ah!
2417984 2420530 What are you doing?...
2420820 2423656 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
2423790 2424657 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
2425725 2428928 Stop, stop! That's cold!
2428995 2431364 Help! Please! Stop!
2431464 2434667 - [Coughing, sputtering]<br />- Thanks, Red.
2436403 2437270 What was that for?
2437437 2439873 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
2440600 2441241 If you do, you gotta be clean.
2441374 2443777 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
2443910 2445545 What, I? I don't get it.
2445679 2448181 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
2448314 2451418 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
2451685 2456122 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
2456489 2460193 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
2460193 2462495 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
2462829 2465965 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
2466990 2469169 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.
2469302 2472405 [Lightning chuckles] Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
2472539 2477143 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
2477310 2480547 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
2482148 2484284 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
2485452 2487821 Cone number one, if you want.
2489550 2491324 Oh...
2492392 2495962 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
2496196 2499165 Oh... [chuckles]<br />That's just a... Oh!
2499466 2500900 [Both chuckle]
2501670 2505138 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.
2505472 2508800 [chuckles] ... Yeah.
2512779 2515281 - You know, I knew this girl Doreen.<br />- [Gasps]
2515615 2517500 Good-lookin' girl.
2517117 2520286 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
2520353 2523690 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
2524758 2527127 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
2527193 2531297 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
2531498 2535602 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
2535668 2539439 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
2539606 2541741 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
2541808 2544770 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
2544210 2546746 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
2546946 2548581 I can handle anything.
2548848 2552819 - [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]
2554487 2558658 - [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.
2558992 2560360 - [Tractors snore]<br />- [Mater] All right, listen.
2560560 2564364 When I say go, we go.<br />But don't let Frank catch you. Go!
2564564 2566299 Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?
2567434 2568868 [Lightning whispering] Mater!
2568935 2570303 Wait, Mater!
2572772 2574740 OK, here's what you do.
2574140 2577100 You just sneak up in front of 'em,<br />and then honk.
2577110 2579846 And they do the rest. Watch this.
2586920 2588688 - [Honking loudly]<br />- Oh!
2589189 2594160 Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]
2594627 2597297 [Gas sloshing, backfiring]
2597464 2600233 [Laughing loudly]
2600433 2603436 I swear, tractors is so dumb!
2604700 2607707 I tell you what, buddy,<br />it don't get much better than this.
2608410 2610543 Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.
2614470 2616549 - [Honking]<br />- Oh!
2616783 2620220 Oh! Oh... [mooing]
2620420 2622489 [Gas sloshing, backfiring]
2622756 2627193 [Laughing] I don't care who you are,<br />that's funny right there.
2627394 2628495 Oh, your turn, bud.
2628728 2631310 Mater, I can't.<br />I don't even have a horn.
2631231 2633366 - Baby.<br />- I'm not a baby.
2633533 2634634 [Clucking]
2634834 2638104 Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?<br />All right. I'll do something.
2651785 2654587 [Snoring]
2655121 2657323 - [Revving engine]<br />- Oh!
2658958 2667701 [All exclaiming and mooing]
2669502 2672672 [All gurgling]
2673506 2677444 [All backfiring]
2683650 2685518 [Angry mooing]
2686586 2688254 [Mooing]
2688888 2690223 That's Frank.
2692250 2694427 - [Bellowing angrily]<br />- [Shouting]
2695161 2698498 - [Mooing]<br />- [Engine revving]
2705500 2707974 [Mater laughing]
2707974 2710543 Run!
2715382 2717283 - Here he comes, look out!<br />- [Bellowing]
2717817 2719386 [Laughing] Whoa!
2721354 2723560 Run! He's gonna get ya!
2729129 2731531 [Mater laughing]
2733566 2736102 [Reveille plays]
2740440 2742942 [~ Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]
2743443 2746346 Will you turn<br />that disrespectful junk off?
2746713 2750383 Respect the classics, man.<br />It's Hendrix!
2751618 2754120 [Groaning]
2754554 2757190 [Breathing rapidly]
2757257 2758725 [Muttering]
2758792 2761161 [Fast-paced electronic music]
2761227 2762662 Ah!
2765310 2767834 - [Mooing loudly]<br />- [Screaming]
2768802 2769869 No!
2772405 2773573 [Yelling loudly]
2774700 2775742 [Mooing]
2776142 2779312 - No! [gasping]<br />- [Alarm beeping]
2780460 2781414 I gotta get outta here!
2781848 2784684 Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?<br />Oh! Oh, my gosh.
2784751 2787887 - Hey, what are you doin'?<br />- Get a good peek, city boy?
2787954 2791291 [Stuttering] I just need my<br />daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
2791658 2793693 Wait for him at Flo's.<br />Get outta here.
2794294 2796830 I've been trying<br />to get outta here for three days!
2796830 2799232 [Sheriff] Hope you enjoyed the show!
2805380 2806840 [Groaning]
2812779 2814481 Whoa, Doc.
2814547 2818151 Time to clean out the garage, buddy,<br />come on.
2834234 2836200 What?
2837700 2839739 He has a Piston Cup?
2847414 2849820 Oh, my gosh.
2850350 2852285 Three Piston Cups?
2864264 2866199 - [Doc] Sign says stay out.<br />- [Gasps]
2868735 2870360 You have three Piston Cups.<br />How could you have...
2870103 2873340 I knew you couldn't drive.<br />I didn't know you couldn't read.
2873440 2876476 - You're the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
2876576 2879120 Of course. I can't believe<br />I didn't see it before.
2879179 2880847 You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
2880947 2884684 You used to hold the record for most<br />wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
2884818 2887153 - You gotta show me your tricks. Please.<br />- I tried that.
2887220 2890156 You won three times!<br />Look at those trophies!
2890156 2893626 You look.<br />All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
2896229 2898310 [Country music]
2898965 2904700 You know, some automotive yoga<br />could really lower your RPM's, man.
2904137 2905872 Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
2905939 2909420 Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!<br />Whoo! That's your color!
2909109 2913279 - [Ramone] Yellow, baby.<br />- Mmm. You smokin' hot!
2913513 2914514 There he is.
2915482 2917484 Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
2921121 2922989 - Doc? Our Doc?
2923490 2926260 No, no, no, no, it's true!<br />He's a real racing legend.
2926126 2927794 He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
2928895 2932232 Fabulous? I never seen Doc<br />drive more than 20 miles an hour.
2932365 2934167 I mean, have you ever seen him race?
2934267 2937937 No, but I wish I could have.<br />They say he was amazing!
2938104 2941841 - He won three Piston Cups!<br />- He did what in his cup?
2942108 2944544 I think the heat's<br />startin' to get to the boy!
2944611 2947514 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
2947614 2950316 [Ramone] I think he needs<br />a new coat of poly, man.
2950450 2951351 - You are lookin' peaked.
2951418 2953453 He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
2953553 2954521 [Gas bell rings]
2955321 2959125 - [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?<br />- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
2959259 2962262 I trust you, all right.<br />It's him I'm worried about.
2963630 2965498 Hmm... I trust him.
2966566 2968668 - Come on, let's take a drive.<br />- A drive?
2968668 2969936 Yeah, a drive.
2970170 2973173 Don't you big city racecars<br />ever just take a drive?
2973373 2975942 Ah... No. No, we don't.
2976142 2977243 [Gas pump stops]
2998698 3002369 Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
3007941 3009109 [Flo] Mm-hm!
3009175 3012479 - And you thought he was gonna run.<br />- Hey, can you believe it, man?
3012545 3014881 He actually thought<br />Doc was a famous racecar!
3016816 3017817 That's so too much!
3020520 3022889 OK, you got me out here.<br />Where are we goin'?
3023256 3024424 I don't know.
3029562 3031464 Whoa! Yes.
3044477 3047347 - [Sputtering]<br />- [Laughing]
3048281 3049816 Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
3049916 3053420 - Bleah!<br />- [Chuckling]
3054854 3056790 - [Grunts]<br />- [Laughs]
3056890 3058580 [Sputtering]
3115815 3117484 [Laughing]
3117784 3119753 [Chuckles] Oh!
3119819 3121540 [Spitting]
3140306 3143877 [Lightning] Wow. What is this place?
3144544 3145845 Wheel Well.
3146546 3149683 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
3153820 3155455 This place?
3155889 3157791 [Horns beeping]
3158925 3160894 [Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.
3163296 3165899 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.
3168268 3169769 You know, I don't get you.
3170170 3172839 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
3173106 3175208 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...
3175542 3179512 ...an attorney in LA<br />livin' life in the fast lane, and...
3179579 3183416 Oh, you were, were you?<br />Were you rich?
3183683 3186353 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
3187870 3190323 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
3190557 3191558 And you know what?
3192250 3195729 It never felt... happy.
3197230 3199899 Yeah. I mean... really?
3200300 3202469 Yeah. So I left California.
3202736 3205705 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
3206720 3208808 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
3209175 3212245 Well, they all did. And I never left.
3213380 3215150 Yeah. You know, I understand.
3215810 3217784 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
3217851 3221454 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
3222389 3225859 [Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.
3226426 3229295 - Oh.<br />- Yep.
3230960 3234200 - Corvette?<br />- No.
3239773 3242409 I fell in love with this.
3254254 3257857 Whoa. Look at that.
3260360 3261528 Look, they're drivin' right by.
3261795 3263296 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
3264464 3266700 [Sally] Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
3267867 3269169 Oh, yeah?
3269569 3273306 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
3274174 3275141 Really?
3276109 3278478 [Sally] Yeah. Back then,
3278478 3281214 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
3282349 3283616 How do you mean?
3283850 3287120 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
3287387 3291391 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
3293930 3294994 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
3297630 3299766 Cars didn't drive on it<br />to make great time.
3300567 3303200 They drove on it to have a great time.
3304571 3306606 [~ James Taylor: Our Town]
3337300 3338905 Well, what happened?
3339172 3342475 The town got bypassed<br />just to save ten minutes of driving.
3429229 3431531 [Lightning] How great would it have been<br />to see this place in its heyday!
3431831 3434768 Oh, I can't tell you how many times<br />I've dreamed of that.
3435101 3439105 But one of these days we'll<br />find a way to get it back on the map.
3439372 3442442 Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.
3442842 3443943 I had a great time.
3444678 3447147 It's kinda nice to slow down<br />every once in a while.
3447814 3449282 You're welcome.
3451317 3453186 If anybody asks you,<br />we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
3453386 3455422 [Chuckling] Wha... what?
3457924 3460260 [Rumbling]
3460193 3462729 [Mooing]
3471370 3473600 Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
3476843 3480480 - [Honking loudly]<br />- [Mooing]
3483249 3485180 No, no, no, no!<br />Get out of the store!
3485452 3488922 Hey! Don't eat the radial!<br />Here, take-a the snow tires.
3489122 3491324 - [Sheriff] Mater!<br />- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
3491491 3494394 Then where did all these<br />gol-durn tractors come from?
3494928 3498365 - Whoa, boy!<br />- Hey! Hey, guys!
3498531 3499833 There's one goin' this way.
3500330 3501101 I got it.
3506720 3508274 Come here, little tractor,<br />come here.
3508508 3510443 Yeah, that's a good tractor.
3510677 3511978 No, no, no, no, come here.
3513246 3514547 What are you doing?
3514914 3517830 You're not supposed to go<br />wandering off all...
3518180 3519452 ...alone.
3532665 3536703 What are you doin'<br />with those old racin' tires?
3539205 3542509 [Sighing heavily]
3543143 3545345 Come on, Doc, drive.
3553853 3556656 [Revs engine]
3621488 3623223 Ah... Yeah.
3623623 3625225 - Wow.<br />- Huh?
3625225 3626760 You're amazing!
3628495 3630663 [Coughing] What are you doin'?
3631197 3632832 Doc, wait!
3634801 3636469 [Trucks mooing]
3636536 3638872 Giddup right in there!<br />Come on, Rusty.
3642242 3645311 Doc, hold it!<br />Seriously, your driving's incredible!
3645412 3648548 - Wonderful. Now, go away.<br />- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
3649490 3650817 - I'm askin' you to leave.<br />- Come on.
3650884 3653586 I'm a racecar,<br />you're a much older racecar,
3653687 3655388 but under the hood<br />you and I are the same.
3655588 3658525 We are not the same!<br />Understand? Now, get out.
3658825 3661628 How could a car like you quit<br />at the top of your game?
3663430 3665799 You think I quit?
3678478 3680800 [Lightning] Right.
3681470 3683550 Your big wreck in '54.
3684284 3686486 They quit on me.
3687870 3690490 When I finally got put together,<br />I went back expecting a big welcome.
3690557 3693360 You know what they said?<br />"You're history."
3693927 3696863 Moved right on to<br />the next rookie standing in line.
3699650 3701234 There was a lot left in me.
3701935 3704804 I never got a chance to show 'em.
3706639 3710510 I keep that to remind me<br />never to go back.
3711644 3714681 I just never expected that<br />that world would...
3714748 3716850 ...would find me here.
3717917 3720954 - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.<br />- Oh, yeah?
3721221 3722155 No, I'm not.
3722222 3725925 When is the last time you cared about<br />something except yourself, hot rod?
3726359 3731531 You name me one time<br />and I will take it all back.
3732165 3735350 Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
3735402 3740400 These are good folk around here,<br />who care about one another.
3740440 3743443 I don't want 'em depending<br />on someone they can't count on.
3744477 3746413 Oh, like you?<br />You've been here how long
3746479 3748915 and your friends<br />don't even know who you are?
3749249 3751251 Who's caring about only himself?
3751317 3753987 Just finish that road<br />and get outta here!
3764640 3765999 [Reveille plays]
3766232 3768134 [~ Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]
3768334 3770670 [Sarge] Will you turn that<br />disrespectful junk off?
3770670 3773606 [Fillmore] Respect the classics, man.
3773807 3776676 [Snoring]
3776943 3779879 [Snorts, putters]
3780847 3784117 [Grunting]
3784184 3786853 [Smacking] Ah...
3799899 3801234 [Mater] He's done.
3801301 3804404 He must've finished it<br />while we was all sleepin'.
3805171 3807307 Good riddance.
3814714 3816820 He's gone?
3816149 3819520 Well, we wouldn't want him<br />to miss that race of his.
3821755 3823656 [Sniffing]
3823723 3829295 - Oh, dude, are you crying?<br />- No! I'm happy!
3829629 3832465 I don't have to watch him<br />every second of the day anymore!
3832532 3833666 I'm glad he's gone!
3834934 3839773 [Blubbering, sobbing]
3840440 3842175 What's wrong with Red?
3842242 3845512 Oh, he's just sad<br />'cause you left town
3845578 3849449 and went to your big race to win<br />the Piston Cup
3849449 3852218 that you've always dreamed about<br />your whole life
3852285 3857900 and get that big ol' sponsor and that<br />fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
3861227 3863430 [Gasping] Wait a minute!
3863496 3865980 [All laugh]
3865231 3868134 I knowed you wouldn't leave<br />without saying goodbye.
3868268 3870904 What are you doin' here?<br />You're gonna miss your race.
3871137 3874240 Don't worry. I'll give you<br />a police escort, and we'll make up time.
3874441 3875742 Thank you, Sheriff.
3875875 3877911 But you know I can't go just yet.
3878478 3879312 Well, why not?
3879579 3882482 - I'm not sure these tires...<br />- [Luigi gasps excitedly]
3882749 3885151 ...can get me to California.<br />- Peet stop?
3885352 3887587 Yeah, does anybody know<br />what time Luigi's opens?
3887721 3889923 [Laughing] I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
3890900 3891858 [Laughing] I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
3892580 3894527 Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!
3894594 3898531 - Would you look at that!<br />- [Luigi] Our first customer in years!
3898598 3902680 I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
3902135 3906239 for this is the most glorious day<br />of my life!
3906473 3910243 All right, Luigi, give me<br />the best set of blackwalls you've got.
3910710 3911878 No! No, no, no.
3911945 3915482 You don't-a know what you want.<br />Luigi know what you want.
3915815 3921187 Blackwall tires.<br />They blend into the pavement.
3921354 3922756 But-a this...
3923560 3924824 Whitewall tires!
3924891 3929829 They say, "Look at me!<br />Here I am! Love me."
3929896 3931631 All right, you're the expert.
3931698 3934501 - [Snarling]<br />- [Lightning] Don't forget the spare.
3934567 3937303 - Perfetto. Guido!<br />- Peet stop!
3939539 3941741 [~ Chuck Berry: Route 66]
3949482 3952285 [Laughing] What did Luigi tell you, eh?
3952352 3955689 Wow, you were right.<br />Better than a Ferrari, huh?
3956423 3957524 Eh... No.
3960627 3964431 Wow! This organic fuel is great!<br />Why haven't I heard about it before?
3964664 3966599 It's a conspiracy, man!
3966666 3969350 The oil companies got a grip<br />on the government!
3969102 3972205 They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
3972272 3974307 OK, I'll take a case.
3990900 3991491 Ow! Eh!
3991758 3992959 [Lightning yelps]
3996763 3999399 - [Chuckles]<br />- [Breathes in deeply]
4000867 4002435 [Ramone] Ah... Yeah.
4002969 4004404 [Lightning] Ka-chow.
4004771 4006706 - Here she comes!<br />- [Lightning] Places, everybody. Hurry!
4006706 4007974 - Hi, Sally.<br />- Buon giorno!
4008208 4009642 All right, what's goin' on?
4009843 4011911 Ladies and gentlecars,
4011978 4016349 please welcome<br />the new Lightning McQueen!
4016349 4018718 Pow! What do you think?
4019850 4021187 Radiator Springs<br />looks pretty good on me.
4021388 4023123 [Chuckling] I'll say.
4023189 4026259 [Purring] Ka-chow.
4026326 4029596 You're gonna fit right in<br />in California.
4030300 4032699 My goodness. It looks like<br />you've helped everybody in town.
4032999 4034734 Yeah, everybody except one.
4036690 4040840 - Hey, is it getting dark out?<br />- What? What'd he say?
4040840 4043743 Let me say that again.<br />Is it getting dark out?
4043977 4046790 Now, what was I<br />supposed to do after that?
4046546 4048748 [~ The Chords: Sh-Boom]
4070437 4073106 [Gasping] They fixed their neon!
4080480 4085285 - Low and slow?<br />- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]
4085352 4087854 [Flo laughs and shrieks]
4089422 4092625 Just like in its heyday, right?
4092692 4095929 It's even better than I pictured it.<br />Thank you.
4117117 4119386 [Chuckling]
4123256 4124958 Shall we cruise?
4124958 4127193 Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
4127193 4128595 - No, no, no.<br />- Lizzie!
4129620 4133233 I remember when Stanley<br />first asked me to take a drive with him.
4133700 4137700 Hey, Miss Sally.<br />May I have this cruise?
4138138 4140600 - Uh-uh-uh!
4142242 4145679 [Mooing]
4146146 4149150 ...and again and I said, "No."<br />He asked me again, and I said, "No."
4149150 4154854 But, oh, he was a persistent<br />little bugger for a two-cylinder.
4155355 4158591 Finally I said,<br />"All right, one little drive."
4160994 4163863 - Oh!<br />- [Mater chuckling]
4168368 4170403 - Hey!<br />- Thanks, Mater.
4170470 4172672 Good evenin', you two.
4175342 4180380 Oh, Stanley,<br />I wish you could see this.
4184784 4188621 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
4188788 4194270 I haven't had a chance to find out.<br />But I am going to find out. Hello.
4194160 4196396 Not that. That.
4196996 4199299 [Sally gasps] Customers?
4199499 4202435 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
4202535 4204404 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
4204804 4205538 [All gasp]
4205672 4208308 It's the ghostlight!
4208375 4210176 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
4210176 4211578 McQueen, over here!
4211644 4214280 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
4214381 4216416 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
4216483 4219850 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
4219953 4220887 [Sally] Stickers!
4221888 4224157 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
4224424 4226793 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
4226893 4229963 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
4230230 4231765 Sally! Sally!
4231865 4234100 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
4234200 4235835 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!
4235935 4238204 - [Horn honking]
4239773 4242842 You're here!<br />Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
4242976 4246279 - Mack?<br />- You're here! I can't believe it!
4246546 4250116 [Chuckling] You are a sight<br />for sore headlights!
4250250 4252852 I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.<br />I'll make it up to you!
4252919 4254721 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
4254788 4257290 [Harv] Is that the world's<br />fastest racing machine?
4257357 4259759 - Is that Harv?<br />- Yeah. He's in the back.
4261294 4264464 - Show us the bolt!<br />- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!
4264698 4267834 - Where's the old McQueen?<br />- Actually, this is my good side here.
4268340 4269969 - Harv! Harv!<br />- Give us the bolt!
4271710 4272500 - Harv?<br />- Come on!
4272205 4275750 - Kid, I'm over here!<br />- How you doin', buddy?
4275275 4277677 My star client disappears<br />off the face of the earth!
4277844 4280280 - How do you think I'm doing?<br />- Harv, I can explain.
4280347 4284451 I'm doing great! You're everywhere!<br />Radio, TV, the papers!
4284517 4287787 You can't buy this kind of publicity!<br />What do you need me for?
4287854 4290560 That's just a figure of speech,<br />by the way. You signed a contract.
4290156 4292592 Where are you?<br />I can't even find you on my GPS.
4292826 4294894 I'm in this little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
4295280 4297764 - You know Route 66? It's still here!<br />- Yeah, that's great, kid.
4297831 4298998 Playtime is over, pal.
4299650 4302869 While the world's been trying to<br />find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.
4302969 4305305 - Who are they gonna woo?<br />- Chick!
4305405 4308308 Bingo. In fact, check out<br />what's on the plasma right now.
4308541 4310310 - Show us the thunder!<br />- You want thunder?
4310410 4314814 You want thunder?<br />Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!
4314914 4318118 - Hey, that's my bit!<br />- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!
4318218 4322422 Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,<br />or Dinoco is history, you hear me?
4322622 4324324 Just give me a second here, Harv.
4325125 4326760 No, wait. Where are you goin'?
4326826 4329963 Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!<br />You want a bigger trailer?
4333233 4336369 Sally, I... I want you to...
4337300 4339973 Look, I wish... [sighs]
4341641 4344377 Thank you. Thanks for everything.
4344778 4346613 [Groans, chuckles]
4346713 4352850 - It was just a road.<br />- No. It was much more than that.
4355355 4358425 Hey, kid! We gotta go.<br />Harv's goin' crazy!
4358491 4361594 He's gonna have me fired if<br />I don't get you in the truck right now!
4361661 4364264 - Mack, just... hold it for...<br />- You should go.
4364330 4366466 - I know, but...<br />- Good luck in California.
4368768 4371671 I hope you find<br />what you're looking for.
4371738 4373740 - McQueen, come on!<br />- Sally...
4373807 4376910 - Sally!<br />- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!
4376976 4378978 Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!
4381581 4384517 [Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
4384684 4386886 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
4387320 4389622 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
4389622 4391691 [Darrell] There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
4391758 4393893 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
4394940 4398665 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
4398665 4401670 [Bob] The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
4401267 4404704 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
4404871 4408174 [Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
4408375 4411978 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
4412780 4414114 [Bob] In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
4414280 4418385 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century."
4418618 4421321 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
4421554 4424624 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
4425191 4428661 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
4428895 4431631 Wanna know the forecast?<br />I'll give you the forecast.
4431765 4435735 A 100 percent chance of thunder!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
4435869 4438638 Say it with me!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
4438838 4440974 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
4441174 4443910 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
4444770 4447447 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
4447681 4452152 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
4452385 4456790 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
4456890 4457691 [Guard] Sorry, pal.
4457691 4462762 [Lightning] OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
4463163 4465865 I am speed.
4465932 4467467 [Cars whizzing]
4467534 4468668 Victory.
4468735 4470570 One winner, two losers.
4470670 4472572 [Engine revving]
4472972 4478745 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
4479179 4481648 [birds singing]
4482649 4483616 [Knock on door]
4483683 4485218 [Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?
4485285 4488421 [Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
4491240 4493893 [Indistinct chatter]
4501334 4504700 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
4504137 4506606 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
4506673 4508975 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
4509420 4511311 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
4516483 4518385 [All shouting]
4519419 4521870 [Gulping]
4529329 4530697 Uh-oh
4534868 4537370 - [cheering, laughing]<br />- [Giggling]
4541141 4544100 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
4544310 4546179 [Bob] And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
4546379 4549549 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
4549716 4552180 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
4552285 4555221 [Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
4556322 4559325 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
4559392 4560493 [Chuckling]
4560560 4563430 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
4563563 4566366 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
4566366 4568968 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
4569102 4571705 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
4579779 4580780 Agh! Shoot!
4580847 4583850 [Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
4588121 4590523 [Crowd cheering]
4591257 4592759 Come on, you can do it!
4592826 4594794 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
4595962 4598998 [Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
4599990 4602168 [Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
4604604 4606673 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
4606873 4609175 [Bob] Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
4609242 4610910 [Darrell] He lost momentum,
4610977 4613179 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
4617751 4620620 - [Soft music]<br />- [Birds singing]
4621654 4622689 [Breaks squealing]
4622789 4624758 [Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!
4624824 4625792 [All gasp]
4628561 4631531 [Chuckling] Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
4631531 4634901 - McQueen just doesn't have it today.<br />- [All laugh]
4634901 4635869 [Groans]
4635935 4639439 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
4639706 4641740 I don't think I...
4641341 4644577 [Doc] I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
4644711 4645679 Doc?
4648915 4651584 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
4651685 4655255 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
4655555 4657570 You said you'd never come back.
4657190 4661610 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
4661161 4663797 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
4663963 4665432 [Chuckles]
4665732 4669102 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
4669636 4672205 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
4672472 4674374 Now, get back out there!
4676910 4679746 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
4679813 4681681 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
4681815 4684851 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
4685185 4687870 Kid, you can beat these guys.
4687320 4690590 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
4699632 4701935 [Murmuring]
4702100 4703837 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
4703903 4707507 Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
4707574 4710110 [Bob] Darrel, it appears McQueen<br />has got himself a new pit crew.
4710176 4712879 And look who he has for a crew chief!
4713279 4715882 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
4715949 4719652 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It's Hudson Hornet.
4721488 4723523 [Crowd cheering]
4723823 4725759 [Bob] Wow, this is history<br />in the making.
4725825 4728628 Nobody has seen the racing legend<br />in over 50 years!
4729262 4730597 Hey, Doc!
4730663 4734667 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
4739939 4743760 - [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.
4743410 4746179 [Bob] Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
4746346 4749149 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.
4749215 4750750 Vai! Vai, vai!
4751184 4753586 Hey, shrimpie,<br />where did McQueen find you, huh?
4753887 4757757 Those round things are called tires,<br />and they go under the car!
4757957 4758925 [All laugh]
4758992 4760360 Con chi credi di parlare?<br />Ma, con chi stai parlando?
4760527 4764300 No! No, no! You'll have your chance.<br />You will have your chance.
4779120 4781681 Oh, kid's just tryin'<br />to be a hero, huh?
4782882 4784117 What do you think of this?
4784250 4787187 - [Tires squealing]<br />- Yeah, that's it, kid.
4790423 4791191 What?
4791458 4794594 Whoa! Git-R-done!
4795562 4799666 - [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!<br />- Ah!
4799666 4802302 [Bob] What a move by McQueen!<br />He's caught up to the leaders.
4802402 4806740 A three-way battle for the lead,<br />with ten to go!
4811344 4814714 [Chortling]<br />Look at that boy go out there!
4820587 4822422 [Chick] Oh! [grunting]
4823423 4824591 No, you don't.
4824591 4826393 [Tire blows]
4828294 4829796 Doc, I'm flat!
4829996 4832699 - Can you get back to the pits?<br />- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
4833166 4836336 Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.<br />Don't tear yourself up, kid.
4839172 4841207 [Mack] We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
4841274 4843710 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!
4843910 4845979 Guido! It's time.
4850160 4852986 Hey, tiny,<br />you gonna clean his windshield?
4855188 4857590 [Air wrench whirring]
4862762 4864164 [Darrell] I don't believe it!
4864197 4865832 [Bob] That was<br />the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
4865899 4868368 [Darrell] It was a great stop,<br />but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
4868435 4870700 [Bob] It's gonna be close.
4871671 4874400 - Yeah, baby!<br />- [All hollering]
4874774 4876760 [Darrell] He's back in!
4877377 4878311 Peet stop.
4879713 4881548 - Guido, you did it!<br />- Way to go, Guido!
4896830 4899766 [Bob] This is it. We're heading into<br />the final lap and McQueen
4899833 4902435 is right behind the leaders.<br />What a comeback!
4902569 4905939 [Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!
4906600 4907240 This is it, kiddo.
4907440 4909809 You've got four turns left.<br />One at a time.
4909909 4912212 Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
4912312 4913646 - Go!<br />- [Revving]
4916216 4917317 We'll see about that!
4918752 4920253 [Bob] McQueen's going inside!
4923123 4926260 - Chick and King are loose!<br />- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!
4937404 4939773 - McQueen saved it!<br />- [Bob] He's back on the track!
4940573 4943143 - Float like a Cadillac...<br />- Sting like a Beemer!
4943743 4947213 - Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...<br />- [all cheer]
4950183 4953190 [Darrell] Lightning McQueen<br />is gonna win the Piston Cup!
4953119 4955121 Come on! You got it!<br />You got it, Stickers!
4957570 4960727 [Grunts] I am not comin' in<br />behind you again, old man.
4969200 4970837 - Oh, no!<br />- [Crowd gasps]
4980880 4982949 [Breaks screeching]
4986119 4987354 [Engine idling]
4990323 4992425 Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
4992492 4996960 I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
4997330 4999366 [Flo] What's he up to, Doc?
5008800 5009943 [Grunting, moaning]
5010744 5012450 What are you doin', kid?
5012112 5015215 I think The King<br />should finish his last race.
5018251 5021121 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
5021187 5024657 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
5024724 5026459 It's just an empty cup.
5028395 5030830 [Bob] Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?
5030930 5034434 He's not really pushin' him. He's<br />just givin' him a little bump draft.
5034968 5037170 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5037237 5039839 Hey. What? What's goin' on?
5040473 5042642 - That's what I call racin'.<br />- [Sobbing]
5042709 5044110 [Laughing]
5046460 5048915 [Crowd cheers wildly]
5058458 5061761 - Bravo il mio amico!<br />- Way to go, buddy!
5061761 5064230 There's a lotta love out there,<br />you know, man?
5064464 5069502 - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.<br />- That's my hot rod.
5071370 5074641 Come on, baby, bring it out!<br />Bring out the Piston Cup!
5074641 5075975 Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5076420 5078812 Yeah!<br />Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
5079145 5081981 Hey, how come the only one celebrating<br />is me, huh?
5082480 5084184 Where are the girls?<br />Bring on the confetti!
5084250 5088588 Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.<br />What's goin' on?
5088955 5092125 Come on, snap some pictures.<br />I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco! Ka-chicka!
5092192 5093593 Say it with me. Ka-chicka!
5093760 5095228 - Boo!<br />- Boo!
5095295 5098264 What's wrong with everybody?<br />Where's the happiness?
5098331 5100367 Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
5105839 5108208 - Thanks, Lightnin'.<br />- You're welcome.
5110744 5113790 - Way to go, King!<br />- You're still the car!
5113146 5115480 You're The King! Yeah!
5115515 5117717 [Crowd cheers]
5123256 5125959 [Laughing and cheering]
5126793 5130130 - You made us proud, kid!<br />- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
5132699 5135235 You got a lotta stuff, kid.
5135935 5137537 Thanks, Doc.
5138605 5139906 Hey, Lightnin'.
5139973 5142509 How 'bout comin' over here<br />and talk to me a minute?
5143376 5146279 Son, that was some<br />real racin' out there.
5146346 5149150 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
5153620 5155210 But I didn't win.
5155880 5158625 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.
5158992 5161561 [Clank] He was so rusty,<br />when he drove down the street
5161628 5165632 - buzzards used to circle the car!<br />- [All laugh]
5165699 5167367 Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
5167934 5171504 ...but these Rust-eze guys over there<br />gave me my big break.
5172505 5174374 I'm gonna stick with them.
5174574 5177444 Well, I sure can respect that.
5178110 5179512 Still, you know,
5179512 5183216 if there's ever anything<br />I can do for you, just let me know.
5183216 5185652 I sure appreciate that.<br />Thank you.
5187520 5190390 Actually, there is one thing.
5190824 5191791 Whoo-hoo!
5192580 5193226 Yeah!
5193293 5196996 Hey, look at me!<br />I'm flyin', I'm flyin!
5201334 5205472 I'm happier than a tornado<br />in a trailer park!
5208375 5210643 I think it's about-a time<br />we redecorate.
5214214 5218151 Hi. Lightning McQueen told me<br />this was the best place in the world to get tires.
5218385 5221254 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
5221421 5227794 Guido! There is a real<br />Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.
5228610 5229963 A real Ferrari!
5230163 5232198 Punch me, Guido.<br />Punch me in the face.
5232332 5236360 This is the most glorious day<br />of my life.
5236903 5240600 Wow. [Italian]<br />Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.
5240440 5242676 Mi dicono che siete fantastici.
5252719 5256322 - [Sighing]<br />- [Engine revving]
5256690 5258792 [Both chuckle]
5259225 5260694 Just passin' through?
5260827 5262595 Actually, I thought I'd stop<br />and stay awhile.
5262996 5265932 - I hear this place is back on the map.<br />- It is?
5266199 5270303 There's some rumor floating around<br />that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
5270470 5272839 is setting up his big<br />racing headquarters here.
