9132 10967 <i>Take a deep breath.</i>
13344 16932 <i>Good.<br />You're ready to dominate this day.</i>
18099 20601 <i>You've worked harder than everyone,</i>
20686 23897 <i>and that is why you're a champion.</i>
24397 27818 <i>You understand that greatness<br />takes sacrifice.</i>
28694 31488 <i>Visualize what you still want to achieve.</i>
32197 34783 <i>Stand atop the mountain of your success</i>
34866 37494 <i>and look down at everyone</i>
37578 39580 <i>who's ever doubted you.</i>
40581 42123 <i>Fuck those losers.</i>
42333 46670 <i>Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.</i>
56138 57639 Oh!
57723 58723 Oh, shit.
60267 61643 Hold the phone!
62061 63104 I'm comin'!
63980 65689 Oh, shit.
72571 74573 - What?<br />- What? Excuse me.
75199 76408 What?
76492 77576 What?
77660 78661 What?
78745 80496 - Missed ya!<br />- I missed you.
81122 82923 - I missed you so much.<br />- It's been one night.
85334 87211 - Are we gonna go to school, or...<br />- No.
88337 89378 I don't think we are.
89380 91966 No, we're just gonna stay... here.
104061 105772 - Move!<br />- Jeez!
111736 113571 Are you...
113655 115448 I swear to God.
116033 117113 What are you doing?
117117 119923 - Are you kidding me? Samantha!<br />- You couldn't have just gone around?
119953 122956 Where was this energy<br />at my inauguration assembly, folks?
123040 123874 True.
123957 127585 I hope I never have<br />to see any of you ever again, okay?
127669 128921 That's it. Signin' off.
129004 130505 Go, Crocketts!
133050 135552 - Principal Brown?<br />- Oh...
136219 138388 Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?
138471 140950 I want to make the transition<br />of next year's student government
140974 141975 as seamless as possible,
142017 145437 - so that when I'm up in New Haven...<br />- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.
145521 148231 Well, our class's official policy<br />is to not discuss
148315 149816 where anyone is attending next year.
149817 151735 We don't want them to feel insecure.
151819 152753 Very thoughtful.
152778 155197 I need to go over the end of the year<br />budget numbers we have.
156532 157532 Gosh.
158075 159075 Really?
159243 160243 Like, now?
160786 163206 I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?<br />You know, please?
163289 165250 I mean, he's... you know,<br />he's the vice president.
165291 166291 Nick?
168669 171505 We both know that Nick only ran for VP<br />because they plan the dances.
171589 172756 That position is...
173507 175593 It's basically a popularity contest.<br />He's useless.
175676 177971 Ladies, it's the last day, you know?
178637 179638 We did it, huh?
179680 181182 We got you through high school.
181265 183267 Can't we just graduate,<br />head off to college,
183351 185937 you know,<br />celebrate this wonderful achievement?
186020 188457 Let's get through the day<br />without anything horrible happening.
188481 191162 Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?<br />Not subtle. We will persist!
192526 194445 Nick's like the great equalizer.
195529 199618 Delegates from every group of girls<br />are casting their ballots for his penis.
199951 201620 Oh, Triple A takes the lead.
202203 203622 Don't call her that.
203705 205081 Everybody calls her that.
205164 207525 She gave roadside assistance<br />to three senior guys last year.
207834 209753 You hear them<br />getting degrading nicknames?
209836 211463 They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."
211796 214424 That's not derogatory,<br />it's a factual description.
214924 216968 - 7:20.<br />- Under eight minutes?
217051 218512 - You're joking!<br />- Aah!
218595 220430 Oh, my God. 9:43.
220514 222432 What am I gonna do<br />without you girls next year?
222516 224317 Nobody around here<br />even attempts the Thursday.
224393 227146 Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype<br />the puzzle every single week,
227229 228956 - so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i><br />- Yep.
228980 231141 You know what?<br />Why don't I just give you two my number?
231191 234236 That way, you guys can call or text me<br />if you need anything.
234653 236906 - Yeah! That would make our lives.<br />- Yeah. Cool.
236989 238198 - We'd love that.<br />- Definitely.
238282 240450 - I'll give you mine after.<br />- I'll share the contact.
240534 241719 - I can give...<br />- I'll share it.
241743 244621 Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were<br />no cell phones allowed in class.
244704 247207 - Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?<br />- Hey.
247707 248793 A dollar in the swear jar.
248876 251628 I'm so sorry.<br />These shorts, they don't have pockets.
251712 254548 - Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!<br />- Whoa, Triple A!
254632 255632 Oh, my God.
255675 258236 - No spatial awareness at this school.<br />- People just really don't.
258260 259512 - Hey, Amy?<br />- It's her!
260012 260846 Yeah?
260930 262932 Did you just score<br />your teacher's phone number?
263390 264390 Yeah.
264434 265601 Nice.
268979 270147 Hey, Miss Fine?
270230 271857 You should come party with us tonight.
271941 275152 Did you just ask Miss Fine<br />if she wants to party with you?
275236 277589 You think she wants to watch you<br />get drunk and break things?
277613 280658 Hold on. I was having a conversation<br />with her. You're not part of this.
280741 281741 - I'm...<br />- Sit down, Theo.
281784 284036 Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine?
284412 286456 Just a last day present<br />for my favorite teach.
286539 289334 - Jared, you are not my student.<br />- I've heard great things.
289417 292670 And, hey, everybody else<br />got their graduation gifts, right?
292963 293963 Come on.
294005 296132 Jare Bear coming at you<br />from all angles, right?
296216 297443 - Nobody asked for that.<br />- Uhh...
297467 300511 Big me, littler me,<br />little baby Jared at the bottom.
300595 302764 Baby Jared says,<br />"Happy graduation, everybody!"
302848 306017 Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt<br />with your face on it, Jared.
306101 307769 Like, not even ironically.
307853 310146 Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause...
310230 311522 Jared, just go.
311606 313859 I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.<br />See you, Molly.
314359 316027 - Bye, Molly.<br />- I'll see ya.
316111 317195 Bye, Molly.
317278 319906 - Why does he always do that?<br />- Fair townspeople!
319990 321492 Fair townspeople?
322117 323577 Fair townspeople, I swear to God!
323660 326413 - What?<br />- Mark thy calendars
326497 330501 and make thy plans to attend<br />the drama department's summer program,
330834 333254 Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.
334296 338425 We will be performing the Bard's comedies<br />as modern tragedies
338509 340552 outside Whole Foods across town.
340636 341996 Well, it's actually funny. It's...
342053 343847 It's what we did in my summer program
343930 345932 - last year in...<br />- Barcelona,
346016 347809 when I lived in Barcelona.
347893 349395 I will be directing,
349853 351313 and Alan...
351939 354400 may be starring, pending auditions.
354901 356568 I don't audition.
357194 358654 I'm offer only.
359363 362283 This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...<br />I'm not gonna be here.
362616 364368 Yeah, Amy's spending the summer<br />in Botswana,
364451 365995 helping women make their own tampons.
366078 367078 That's...
367371 368205 gross.
368289 371000 Well, blood attracts lions.<br />I'm saving lives.
371083 374796 Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.<br />I, too, have a fear of big cats.
374879 378633 And I can't because I'm working<br />all summer, and also, I don't want to.
378716 379634 You are a philistine.
379717 381761 Why would you do theater<br />when you could do debate?
381844 384305 Because some of us<br />enjoy working with others.
384389 385932 And some of us know how to win.
386015 387725 Nobody's winning in that outfit.
387809 389602 Sit down, y'all.<br />We got work to do.
389686 391479 - So, Molly...<br />- Mmm?
391563 393203 - Why don't you start us off?<br />- Thank you.
393273 394148 Kill it.
394232 396859 All right, well, as you might recall<br />from my analysis yesterday,
396943 398712 - we were talking about...<br />- It's our last day!
398736 400673 - Let us live! God!<br />- ...submitting to authority...
400697 401823 You've gotta open...
401906 404784 You've gotta open your mouth<br />a little bit more, all right?
404867 406748 - Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.<br />- Okay, chips!
406786 408621 - All right, this is it.<br />- I gotcha. Ready?
408705 410975 - Dude, how am I supposed to get there?<br />- That was my bad.
410999 412042 - Nick?<br />- You're wild.
412125 413926 - Nick.<br />- Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.
414002 416147 Nick, there's some student government<br />stuff to go over.
416171 417411 Come on, man, aim for my mouth!
417464 419859 We have to go over the end of year budget,<br />so if you could...
419883 422677 Yeah, just, we're playin' this game<br />where I've gotta catch it with...
422761 424881 It's complicated.<br />I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.
424930 426306 I'm sure it's complicated.
427307 431353 I cannot believe I lasted an entire year<br />with Nick as my vice president.
431729 434231 He's allergic to work.<br />All he wants to do is goof off.
434314 435315 It's infuriating.
448036 449288 Go talk to Ryan.
450248 451415 What? No.
452500 454918 Cool, cool, 'cause I'm...<br />I'm gonna go talk to Ryan.
455002 457045 - 'Cause I have so much to say...<br />- No, no, no.
461134 462301 - Yeah?<br />- Fine.
462510 464137 Just... I'm going.
464303 465888 - Just gonna...<br />- There she goes.
478609 480403 - Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.<br />- Oh, dude.
480486 481320 Amy.
481404 482947 - It's all good.<br />- Here you go.
483031 484198 Sharp elbows.
484282 486200 Not as sharp as your... chin.
486660 487660 What?
488036 490371 Um... so isn't it crazy<br />that it's... it's the last day?
490454 492456 I know, dude. I can barely believe it.
492541 494167 Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?
494250 496252 His aunt went on a cruise ship<br />that broke down,
496335 498087 so Nick's gonna throw a party<br />at her house.
498171 499589 That's... that's awesome.
500089 501215 It's... it's all right.
501299 503968 They're, you know, they're stuck<br />on a boat shitting in buckets.
504052 505512 Oh, that's not really what I meant.
506054 507431 Oh, Jesus.
507514 509266 - Come on, Tanner.<br />- All right, well...
509849 511518 All right, I'll see you later.
511893 512936 I'll just, um...
513520 514771 Fuck. Fuck, fuck.
514854 516575 - What are you doing? Go back.<br />- Fuck, fuck.
516606 518247 No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.
518275 519859 I don't even know if she's into girls.
519943 521361 She wore a polo shirt to prom.
521445 523822 Well, that's just her gender performance.
523905 525586 It's different from<br />her sexual orientation.
525657 527034 I'm sorry, but I don't get it.
527117 530829 - Well, gender is a construct of...<br />- No. Thank you. That much I understand.
530913 533123 It's just... it's a little bit shocking
533207 534875 that... that you're into Ryan.
535292 537962 First crush, the little white cat<br />from <i>The Aristocats.</i>
538045 539671 You go from that to Avril Lavigne.
539755 541841 It just... it's not...<br />it's not what I anticipated.
541924 543425 I just like that she's...
544301 547137 always in a good mood,<br />and she's got a really cute smile.
547638 550349 She just seems like<br />she'd be a really fun person
550432 552351 to have sleepovers and lie around with.
552434 555855 Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person<br />to have sleepovers and lie around with.
555938 557022 It's literally all we do.
557106 559233 Well, with her, there'd be more...
560776 561902 vagina involved.
562403 563403 That's fair.
563654 565281 She said Nick's having a party tonight.
565365 568409 Of course he would.<br />He's so fucking stupid.
568493 571371 Somebody always gets arrested<br />the night before graduation.
573123 576167 Amy, do you know how many girls<br />are gonna be up your vagina
576251 577502 at Columbia next year?
577585 579629 Are you aware of it?<br />'Cause I'm aware of it.
579712 583216 Every time I come to visit you, you're<br />just gonna be scissoring a different girl.
583299 584384 Dude?
584467 585760 Scissoring is not a thing.
585843 588471 - Don't knock it until you've tried it.<br />- It's not a thing.
588554 591714 - I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.<br />- Don't knock it until you've tried it.
598732 600191 Here comes the one percent.
609284 610911 That car belongs in a museum.
610994 613246 What the fuck, Jared?<br />I said door-to-door.
613329 616542 Museum of death,<br />'cause its smog is killing us all.
617668 619753 - Fuck!<br />- You all right?
619836 622464 They spend every minute together.<br />It's so weird.
622548 624132 We spend every minute together.
624215 625133 We are equals.
625216 627594 Gigi just keeps Jared around<br />for when she needs a liver.
627678 629989 - No, please don't get on my car.<br />- I'm fucking spent, Jared!
630013 631949 - At least take the heels off.<br />- I'm fucking spent!
631973 634369 - I just got it back from the shop.<br />- Okay, shh! I'm napping.
634393 638189 Do you think it's true that his dad got<br />him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?
638272 640691 It's too weird of a story to be made up.
640774 642443 There's so many specifics.
642526 644861 He sprained his ankle,<br />she had a hearing aid.
644946 646072 What up, <i>chicas?</i>
646155 647406 It's intolerable.
647489 648609 You guys... you guys hungry?
648657 650952 I got... I got some soup dumps.
651035 652744 Keep it down out there!
652829 654830 They're probably soggy now,<br />but they're great cold!
654872 655891 - Good Lord.<br />- S'all right.
655915 658101 I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.<br />Watch my stuff.
658125 661045 Until all of us can pee without genitals,<br />none of us can.
661796 663673 These motherfuckers.
664423 665423 "Your ugly" what?
666217 667885 How did you graduate sixth grade?
667969 669596 It's shocking to me.
669679 671848 So, okay, so, I win.
671931 674058 - Marry the sex doll, okay?<br />- Right.
674141 675810 - Fuck the soccer ball.<br />- Yep.
675893 677228 And then, kill Molly.
677311 678980 Dude, no!
679063 680189 There's no other way, dude.
680272 682066 Like, I can't fuck her,<br />you know, 'cause...
682149 684193 when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.
684277 686446 And then, like, I can't marry her,<br />'cause, well,
686529 688656 - I don't believe in the institution.<br />- Uh-huh.
688740 690408 So I have to kill Molly.
690492 692619 And I know it'll haunt me.<br />I'm a peaceful person.
692702 694662 That's very true.
694746 696748 Wait, are you guys talking<br />about Molly Davidson?
696831 697665 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
697749 700668 That girl is so weird.<br />She always acts like she's, like, 40.
700752 703796 I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.<br />Women in their forties know themselves.
703881 706758 Oh, she's cute,<br />you know, yeah, I give her that,
706842 710178 but she'd probably make you quiz her<br />on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.
710262 713724 Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed<br />with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?
713807 715768 That shit's like a filing cabinet<br />down there.
715851 718561 Well, I've got no problem<br />with a filing cabinet.
718646 721607 I would make passionate sex<br />to Molly Davidson.
721690 722733 Really?
722816 725152 Yeah, I'd just put a bag<br />over her personality.
725235 726904 - Yeah.<br />- That's it.
726987 730198 Molly's like a butterface for personality,<br />a butter personality.
730282 731992 Yeah!
733076 734703 - It's so bad.<br />- Yeah.
734787 737415 That's cool, man. What?
738791 739791 Shit.
744713 746882 Oh, please, do not stop on my account.
747841 751220 Do you know what?<br />My vag is stuffed with diplomas.
751720 754265 Soon it's gonna be stuffed<br />with job offers,
754348 758019 and glowing profiles,<br />and commendations from the governor.
758102 762023 So, while you guys<br />were all studying AP hand jobs,
762106 764275 I was kicking ass and busting curves.
764358 766986 And I'm gonna continue to do that<br />at Yale next year.
767070 768070 So...
768863 769863 I like my choices,
769906 772533 and wherever you three are next year,<br />I hope you do, too.
773743 774869 I'm going to Yale, too.
777956 778956 What?
778998 783169 I'm incredible at hand jobs,<br />but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.
784378 785463 No, you didn't.
785547 786798 I got in early.
786881 788257 - To Yale?<br />- Uh-huh.
788341 789509 Mm-hm.
790510 792887 Oh, um, Tanner,<br />where are you going to school?
793472 795807 Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.
795890 799018 Stanford University?<br />What are you guys talking about? That's...
799102 801813 - No, yes, Stanford.<br />- Mm-hm. Stanford University.
801896 803940 Hey, I'm not going to college.
804023 806109 I got recruited to go code for Google.
806193 807944 I mean, it's not Apple,
808027 810280 but the bennies are pretty tight, man,
810364 812407 and it's mid six-figures,<br />so I'm not complainin'.
812491 814212 - That's my boy.<br />- So proud of you. Amazing.
814243 816536 You failed the seventh grade twice.
816870 817870 Rule of threes.
820499 822084 - You guys are serious?<br />- Mm-hm.
822918 826380 Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend<br />like I don't know you next year.
826839 827839 No offense.
829633 831719 This... this isn't possible.
831802 833553 You guys don't even care about school.
834805 835805 No.
836181 838183 We just don't only care about school.
847026 848110 Well, I'm... I'm done.
848193 850112 After... After you. After you, man.
850195 851195 Okay.
852156 854158 Sorry, excuse me.
856411 861123 <i>You've worked harder<br />than everyone who's ever doubted you.</i>
861207 864294 <i>You've worked harder.</i>
864377 865420 <i>...doubted you.</i>
875805 877265 You okay?
877348 879434 Nick, where are you going<br />to school next year?
879517 881937 - I thought we weren't supposed to talk...<br />- Just tell me!
882020 883688 Georgetown. Jesus.
885315 888127 - Hope, where are you going next year?<br />- No, I couldn't be less interested
888151 890278 in, like, whatever this is.
890361 892698 Gigi, where the fuck<br />are you going to school next year?
892781 894741 Don't judge me, it was my fifth choice.
895116 896116 Harvard.
917389 919475 Seniors rule!
972737 973738 This is fucked!
974196 975196 Okay.
975615 977242 This is obviously not helping.
977325 981204 We chose. We didn't party<br />because we wanted to focus on school
981288 982789 and get into good colleges.
982872 983872 And it worked.
983915 986084 But the irresponsible people who partied
986168 988420 also got into those colleges,<br />they did both.
988503 989337 So?
989421 990713 So we messed up.
991173 992925 We didn't have to choose. They did both.
993008 994885 We are the only assholes who did one.
994968 997888 Hey, we are not assholes, okay?
997971 998847 Let's just...
998931 1001058 Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,
1001141 1002309 look at the memory box,
1002392 1005688 - celebrate the end...<br />- This is not a time to celebrate.
1006396 1007856 We have to go to a party tonight.
1008565 1010400 - What?<br />- Let's go to Nick's party.
1010483 1012194 No... Are you kidding? No. No way.
1012277 1014822 Amy, we only have one night left
1014905 1016740 to have studied and partied<br />in high school.
1016824 1019618 Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls<br />that missed out.
1019702 1020744 We haven't done anything.
1020828 1022413 We haven't broken any rules.
1022496 1025290 Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.
1025374 1026959 One, we have fake IDs.
1027042 1030003 Fake college IDs,<br />so we can get into their 24-hour library.
1030087 1032923 Name one person whose life<br />was so much better
1033006 1034967 - because they broke a couple of rules.<br />- Picasso.
1035008 1037470 Yes, he broke art rules.<br />Name a person who broke a real one.
1037553 1038762 - Rosa Parks.<br />- Name another.
1038846 1040598 - Susan B. Anthony.<br />- Goddamn it.
1040681 1043684 Amy, I'm so serious.<br />They think that we're robots.
1043767 1047105 They think all we care about is taking<br />a million APs, and getting into Yale,
1047188 1049023 and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,
1049107 1051587 and clerking for a federal judge<br />between junior and senior year
1051650 1054570 before eventually becoming<br />the youngest justice
1054653 1058532 ever nominated<br />to the Supreme Court of the United States.
1061535 1062535 In my case.
1063412 1064412 You get the point.
1064831 1067626 - Nobody knows that we are fun.<br />- We know.
1067709 1068584 They need to know.
1068668 1069502 Who's they?
1069585 1071504 We are not one-dimensional.
1071588 1073590 We are smart and fun.
1074633 1075967 We have to do this.
1076050 1077093 This is crazy.
1077176 1079471 We graduate tomorrow.
1079554 1081014 What if we get in trouble?
1081097 1083099 You know that we are too smart for that.
1083266 1085059 Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.
1085143 1088605 She wanted you to come.<br />You're finally gonna make your moves.
1088980 1090357 No, she's not...
1090440 1092835 You've been out for two years<br />and you've never kissed a girl.
1092859 1094653 I want you to experience this.
1095111 1097656 What will I be doing during that time,<br />you might ask?
1097739 1100867 I'm going to experience<br />a seminal fun anecdote,
1101535 1104038 and we are gonna change<br />our stories forever.
1107624 1109265 We were gonna watch that Ken Burns thing.
1109293 1111003 <i>The Dust Bowl </i>can wait, bitch!
1111378 1114006 What took them four years,<br />we are doing in one night!
1115174 1116383 Oh, Jesus!
1126894 1128103 - No!<br />- No!
1128187 1129479 - No. Not acceptable.<br />- Not okay.
1129564 1131044 Who allowed you to be this beautiful?
1131106 1135319 - Who allowed you to be this beautiful?<br />- Who allowed you to take my breath away?
1135402 1137380 - Call the paramedics, call the police.<br />- Who... No.
1137404 1139965 - 'Cause there has been an emergency.<br />- I can't look right at it.
1141409 1142409 Not today!
1143411 1144704 Grip escape move!
1146456 1148207 Oh. Work.
1148291 1149667 Get it? Tushy?
1149750 1150835 Hand sanitizer.
1150918 1151919 ChapStick.
1152002 1153128 College IDs.
1153213 1156341 Now, mace. Listen, it is very important<br />that you keep the safety...
1157675 1159219 - Ah! Amy!<br />- The safety's not on!
1159302 1160761 Don't touch your eyes!
1160845 1162805 You have the same parts she does.
1162888 1165641 You just take what you do to yourself,<br />flip it upside down.
1165725 1167518 Well, I don't... I don't really...
1167602 1169812 Just a down, but a flip.
1169896 1171314 - I don't...<br />- A down flip.
1171397 1173733 Well... what if I don't use my hands?
1173817 1176444 You can make yourself come<br />using only your mind?
1176527 1178446 - No.<br />- That's the one thing my mind can't do.
1178529 1181992 No! Well, I use just... other stuff.
1183159 1184369 - A book?<br />- No.
1184452 1186537 Very Freudian,<br />but I'd worry about paper cuts.
1186622 1188707 No. Can we just stop talking about this?
1188790 1191251 - That little elephant?<br />- No! Stop!
1191334 1192878 That weird crochet pig?
1192961 1194522 My grandma gave me that<br />before she died!
1194546 1196266 If you don't tell me what it is,<br />you know...
1196297 1198216 It's the panda! It's the panda, okay?
1198299 1200469 The panda. Whatever. Just...
1201553 1203054 Can we just stop talking about this?
1203138 1205557 Please, for the love of all things.
1205891 1206892 Quick question.
1207559 1208894 Just a quick Q.
1208977 1210437 What happened to her eye?
1212148 1214483 That fell off way before<br />anything happened between us.
1214566 1216735 - Does she talk dirty to you?<br />- Mm-mm.
1217403 1219905 - Tell you about how she's endangered?<br />- No!
1220614 1222616 - Stop!<br />- Do pandas roar?
1222699 1225452 - Stop!<br />- You sneaky little bitch.
1225536 1227371 I can't believe you didn't tell me
1227454 1229999 that you have been mounting<br />that tragic panda
1230082 1231708 every single night!
1231792 1233645 - Yeah.<br />- This is... Honestly, it's exhilarating.
1233669 1235504 I thought I knew everything about you.
1235587 1238841 I think it's healthy for a relationship<br />to have secrets, and now we have one.
1239425 1241510 Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.
1241593 1242593 Yeah.
1242845 1245139 - I once tried to masturbate...<br />- Mm.
1245472 1247474 With an electric toothbrush.
1248267 1250436 But I got a horrible UTI.
1251020 1251938 Horrible.
1252021 1253021 Like...
1253523 1254523 horrible.
1254816 1259236 I wish that would have been a secret,<br />but you've mentioned it many, many times.
1263283 1264742 I need you to do the talking.
1265243 1267454 Why don't you just tell them<br />we're going to a party?
1267662 1270540 Because they'll ask too many questions.<br />They'll try to call Nick's aunt.
1270623 1273126 I've never lied to my parents before.
1273210 1275628 You know when I lie,<br />I just add too many details.
1276129 1279924 Just make up a story, but don't say<br />we're having a date night or anything.
1280008 1282260 Why? It's funny<br />your parents think we're boning.
1282344 1283553 No, it's not,
1283636 1286473 because you're not the one<br />who has to deal with their creepy smiles
1286556 1288516 when I tell them<br />I'm meeting you at the library,
1288600 1290936 when I'm actually<br />meeting you at the library.
1291019 1293730 Honestly, it's surprising<br />that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,
1293814 1295273 considering their whole Jesus thing.
1295357 1296233 It's nice.
1296316 1297985 - Charmaine, get to the safe room.<br />- Hey!
1298068 1299671 - We're bein' robbed by supermodels.<br />- Hi!
1299695 1302030 Aw, you girls look fabulous.
1302114 1304116 - Oh...<br />- And smart, and also brave.
1304199 1305408 - Thank you.<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1305492 1306493 Are you guys cold?
1306577 1307620 - Oh, no.<br />- A little nippy.
1307703 1309872 I'll start a fire,<br />or I'll turn up the heat.
1309955 1312082 Just get the jackets off.<br />Dinner's about ready.
1312165 1313685 - Oh, you've gotta taste this.<br />- Well...
1313709 1316044 - Yeah.<br />- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."
1317295 1318376 - Sure.<br />- Don't engage them.
1318422 1320007 Oh, right, right, okay. Um...
1320090 1321592 Char-Char, Dougsicles,
1322134 1325638 would it be okay<br />if Amy stayed over at my house tonight?
1328599 1331685 - The... the night before graduation?<br />- Yeah.
1331769 1334272 You know, my mom can drive us<br />to the ceremony.
1334355 1338234 We just want as much time together<br />as we can before she leaves for Africa.
1338692 1339692 We made, uh...
1340611 1341737 mushroom cap and gowns.
1341820 1344615 - Yeah...<br />- We made special names for all this stuff.
1344698 1347201 - Great deal of care was taken.<br />- Well...
1347285 1348953 Every... I mean, look, uh...
1349412 1351289 Chips and sal-so long, high school.
1351372 1353041 You know, cheese and...

1357628 1359213 You know, e-everything has a name.
1359297 1361883 - O-love my baby girl. That's olives.<br />- Yeah.
1361966 1363843 - Doug.<br />- Do you know what? We get it.
1363927 1365261 - But...<br />- We get it.
1365887 1367406 - Yes, yes, yes.<br />- We understand, okay?
1367430 1369265 - What you two have...<br />- We do. I'm sorry.
1369348 1372852 - What they have is very, very special.<br />- I'm sorry.
1372936 1374103 Yeah.
1374187 1375897 Oh! It really is.
1376272 1379401 It is. You know, they say<br />you never forget your first...
1379484 1380484 Friend.
1381027 1383322 - Special friend.<br />- Normal friend.
1383405 1385824 - Yeah, my special friend.<br />- Mm. Yeah.
1385907 1388660 I'm just so thankful<br />we get to spend the whole night together
1388743 1390870 to really show each other
1390954 1393457 - how much we care about each other.<br />- Ah. Oh!
1393540 1395167 - That's great.<br />- Mmm, my girl.
1395250 1397586 We'll probably just do<br />a Korean face mask.
1397669 1399463 Well, I don't need to know all the words.
1400505 1401966 - Okay.<br />- Go, go, go!

1538020 1540022 <i>I got pregnant with my first child<br />in the summer...</i>
1540106 1542984 I'll get somethin' peppy going.<br />We'll get this party started, huh?
1553870 1555121 Sorry about that.
1555204 1557433 Jared, it's fine.<br />Isn't she your girlfriend or something?
1557457 1559000 What? No, she's...
1560126 1562587 No girlfriend for me. I can't pick faves.
1562670 1565715 Too many ladies wanna lock this down,<br />and they don't have the code.
1565798 1566841 Two-eight-three-one.
1567050 1569136 Well, that's my PIN number.
1569219 1570095 Uh... but...
1570178 1572555 Sorry, I'll just... What's up, Gig?
1572639 1574474 <i>Jared, where the fuck did you go?</i>
1574557 1577060 <i>I left my tin of special things<br />in your car and I need it!</i>
1577144 1578811 Okay, all right. Jeez, Louise!
1579396 1582858 Do I wanna know<br />what a tin of special things is?
1586153 1588071 Oh, my God. This is drugs.
1588613 1589907 - What?<br />- What?
1589990 1593744 Hey, Jare.<br />Jared, we're just gonna hop out here.
1593827 1595203 - Wait, what? Why?<br />- No.
1595287 1597247 - She's kidding.<br />- No, I'm not.
1597330 1599041 Our... Our friend, she just texted us.
1599124 1601669 And she said she... she...<br />She hit a possum with her car.
1601752 1604129 - No! You know what kind of possum?<br />- Yeah. It's bad.
1604212 1607340 But the possum didn't die.<br />Its adrenaline and... and rage
1607425 1610362 - just made it start chasing her...<br />- We are not hopping off. Keep driving.
1610386 1613448 What about the po... Is she gonna be okay?<br />Wanna text her and see if she's okay?
1613472 1615672 Enough about the possum!<br />Jared, you took Spanish, right?
1615724 1617351 <i>Ah, sí, sí, mi bonita mujer.</i>
1626444 1627484 I'm not gettin' any of it.
1637163 1639373 Came in a little hot there. That's my bad.
1639457 1641876 - But we are here.<br />- What do we do? What do we do?
1641960 1644378 - Don't move, don't inhale.<br />- All right.
1645797 1646840 Oh, shit.
1646923 1649342 There are drugs in my orifices.
1649425 1650259 Drugs.
1650343 1651343 Oh, no, that's...
1651552 1653387 It's not drugs.<br />That's just Gigi's vitamins.
1654764 1655599 Her... her what?
1655682 1659143 Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12. Gigi<br />likes to crush them up and snort them.
1659227 1661988 She says they work better that way.<br />We'll get you cleaned up on board.
1662814 1664649 What? What do you mean, "on board"?
1665066 1667986 Okay, now, you guys said<br />you wanted to go to the best party.
1668069 1671030 So... I brought you to the best party.
1671114 1672198 Which is my party!
1672782 1674409 Prepare to get bashed!
1675994 1677496 Not... Not in, like, a violent way.
1677579 1680165 Completely consensual bashing.<br />I don't know if that was clear.
1680249 1681769 "Prepared to get consensually bashed."
1681833 1683543 I'll have 'em change it.<br />What do you think?
1683627 1685504 You're serious, Jared? This is your party?
1685587 1688215 You don't wanna go<br />to Nick's lame house party. You don't.
1688298 1689924 A boat is international waters, right?
1690009 1692594 Maritime law.<br />Just come check it out for a little bit.
1692677 1693720 It's sick.
1693803 1696640 The catering company said it's<br />the coolest party they've ever been to.
1696723 1698142 And I'll tell you somethin'.
1698976 1700895 They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.
1702354 1704356 - Up to you.<br />- What are we thinking?
1704940 1706942 - We still don't have Nick's address.<br />- Mm.
1707276 1709528 Someone on board might know where it is.
1710112 1712865 And I'd like to meet someone<br />who met Sasha.
1713407 1715409 Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.
1715493 1716494 - Yeah?<br />- Mm-hm.
1716577 1717577 Let's go.
1718037 1719038 You guys excited?
1723125 1724168 Welcome to the club!
1724251 1725503 Oh, no.
1725586 1727630 Cool, huh? We're on a boat.<br />What's up with that?
1727922 1729340 There is not a soul here, Ames.
1729424 1730300 Ice tiger.
1730383 1732260 This is insane. You made gift bags?
1733052 1734804 There is an iPad in here.
1734887 1738474 Preloaded with photos of all of our best<br />high school memories, class of 2019.
1738558 1739934 Say what? Champagne?
1740017 1742270 There's a masseuse in the back,<br />male or female.
1742353 1744397 Gambling behind the bar. Do you guys tan?
1745773 1747567 I'm so happy you guys are here.
1748901 1751279 - I knew you guys partied. Didn't I?<br />- You did, she said it.
1751362 1753031 I told him. "Those guys seem quiet,
1753114 1755835 but they're probably spending<br />every weekend at, like, a sex dungeon."
1755909 1758536 - No.<br />- Here, try one of these strawberries.
1758619 1759619 Okay.
1759913 1760831 No.
1760914 1762749 - No, no, no...<br />- Mmm...
1765585 1767587 Mm. Mm-hmm.
1768714 1770298 - Not bad.<br />- That's pretty good.
1770381 1771381 Wait.
1778724 1780559 Oh, God, you taste like my vitamins.
1780642 1782603 - Uh...<br />- I think I'm in love with you.
1782686 1783729 I don't think you are.
1783812 1785481 - You're coming with me.<br />- What?
1785564 1787774 Dance party upstairs!
1787858 1789443 Yeah! Whoo!
1789526 1790944 - No, wait!<br />- Yes, yes, yes!
1791027 1793280 Amy? Amy? Amy? Ame, we're not...
1793364 1795824 Look what I found... with your name on it.
1795907 1797033 Come on, too cool.
1797118 1798869 How do you feel, huh? You look stoked.
1798952 1800579 - Chicken spring roll?<br />- No, thank you.
1801747 1802831 Oh, you, uh...
1804625 1805625 You want?
1806002 1807419 Oh, no thank you.
1807503 1808921 Not a drug person.
1809005 1811757 Not even pot?<br />I feel like it could help you relax.
1811924 1814301 - Nope. Doesn't work for me.<br />- Huh.
1814385 1816387 DJ Rod!
1816470 1818639 What the fuck?
1820432 1822309 Jared... stop.
1822894 1824812 Jared, wrap...
1824896 1827439 Take the helmet off! Take the helmet off!
1830735 1833488 This isn't working.<br />You can't buy people's affection.
1838242 1841413 No, I'm pretty sure you can.
1841496 1844582 'Cause I've seen it a lot.<br />My parents did it.
1845500 1847740 - Their parents did it.<br />- Just stop trying so hard, okay?
1847794 1849254 People sense it, it turns them off.
1849337 1850422 But you try hard.
1851631 1853911 You try hard and everything.<br />That's what I like about you.
1856052 1857970 - I didn't mean it like...<br />- I'm just gonna...
1858055 1859764 - I meant more like...<br />- I'm gonna go.
1859847 1862059 - Lamb meatball?<br />- Motherfucker! You're everywhere!
1862142 1865979 One time I ate a legal pot brownie<br />when Model UN went to Amsterdam.
1866771 1868892 And as soon as I got high,<br />I just cried about the fact
1868941 1871026 that one day my mom will die, so...
1871109 1873070 - I had the exact same thing.<br />- Really?
1873153 1875823 I lost my virginity<br />in what I thought was a park, but...
1875906 1879159 it turned out to be a graveyard, and now<br />the ghost spirits live inside my eggs
1879242 1880535 waiting to be reborn.
1880618 1881704 That's not at all the same.
1881787 1883246 I always felt like we were similar.
1883330 1884557 - God, I'm gonna miss you.<br />- Oof.
1884581 1885916 Hey. You can't smoke up here.
1885999 1887292 - Oh...<br />- What'd you say to her?
1887375 1889461 - I said it to you, you can't smoke.<br />- Um...
1889545 1891755 You do not speak to her that way.
1891839 1893674 Is... Is the her me? 'Cause I'm fine.
1893757 1896009 That is my best friend<br />in the fucking world!
1896093 1899054 - We're not, she's not...<br />- We'll fucking fight you to the death!
1900348 1901682 Okay, I'm calling security.
1901765 1905060 - Amy, we need to get the fuck outta here...<br />- Oh, my God!
1905143 1907730 - Light 'em up, Luanne! It's go time!<br />- Um...
1908356 1910983 There's only one thing left to do. Jump.
1911066 1913026 - No! Off the boat?<br />- Wait, what? No! No!
1913111 1914151 - No, seriously...<br />- You...
1914612 1917156 - What are you guys doin' up here?<br />- Swan dive into the future!
1917240 1918491 Grip escape move!
1918574 1920201 No, no, no!
1920284 1922453 Gege? Gege?
1922536 1923913 Holy fuck!
1923997 1925206 Gege, are you okay?
1925289 1927583 - She's okay. Bail, bail, bail, bail!<br />- Just bail.
1932005 1933006 Jesus!
1934423 1935633 Oh, my God!
1935717 1937761 I am so sweaty!
1937844 1939637 Oh, my God!
1939929 1942129 We need to figure something out<br />before we get to Nick's.
1942682 1944643 - You still want to go to Nick's?<br />- You don't?
1945101 1947061 Well, dude, we went to a party.
1947521 1948813 We did it. Let's go home.
1952484 1954444 - Amy...<br />- Don't do your lecture voice.
1954528 1956320 That was not a party.
1956405 1958239 Well, it definitely was a party.
1958323 1959908 That was a detour.
1959991 1962577 We are A-plus people,
1962661 1964746 and we are going to an A-plus party.
1964829 1965830 Like this.
1970835 1972379 Oh, my God, Alan responded.
1972462 1974714 We have the address!<br />Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.
1975049 1976466 Oh, my score is...
1976883 1977801 My score is very low.
1977884 1980071 I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.<br />You should call.
1980095 1981095 I'm gonna go home.
1981221 1984558 But if you wanna go to Nick's,<br />you should really go. Seriously, go.
1986268 1987269 Malala.
1992232 1994359 - I'm calling Malala.<br />- Wow.
1994443 1997655 You know you only get,<br />like, one Malala a year?
1997738 1998948 Yeah, I'm calling it.
1999448 2002534 Full support, no questions asked,<br />you are coming with me.
2006706 2007706 Malala.
2008541 2009541 All right.
2010710 2011710 Malala.
2017467 2020177 Um... okay. Jordan?
2020261 2021804 Yeah, and you're Am...
2024849 2026476 Shit.
2034317 2035318 You know, I-I, um...
2035401 2038654 this job's a good way to supplement<br />the, uh... the old income.
2039197 2041324 You know, teachers' salaries today<br />and all, so...
2041407 2043451 - It's terrible.<br />- Yeah, it's a disgrace.
2043534 2045703 Meet new people<br />and see new parts of the city,
2045786 2046997 and run into old friends.
2048248 2050666 - Friends?<br />- Plus, I'm writin' a book now.
2051667 2053479 - Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.<br />- Cool.
2053503 2057758 Nothing more exciting or daunting<br />than the blank page, you know?
2057841 2059968 One book I'm thinkin' about doin'<br />is a book of quotes.
2060051 2063680 Nothing more daunting or exciting<br />than the blank page.
2063972 2067017 But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'<br />about doin' a detective novel.
2067100 2069060 Actually, you know what?<br />You two will love...
2069310 2072313 Amy, you'll love this.<br />It's a, uh... a female detective.
2072398 2073732 - Oh, really?<br />- A lady detective.
2073815 2075295 - Yeah, how about that?<br />- Interesting.
2075526 2078111 Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.<br />Still workin'.
2078194 2081448 And, uh, you know, the baby,<br />whenever she's, like, close to a clue,
2081532 2084576 or, like, one of her hunches is,<br />like, uh, you know, close,
2084660 2085702 the baby kicks,
2085994 2088205 you know, and the harder it kicks,<br />the closer she is.
2088289 2089956 And, uh, that's where I'm at right now.
2090040 2091917 I... I... I don't know what to do<br />once, um...
2092334 2093960 you know, when she, um, gives birth.
2094045 2095254 - But, um...<br />- Hmm.
2095337 2098049 Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
2098424 2099550 Choose a lane!
2100467 2101302 That was nuts.
2101385 2103262 Don't know what that was.
2103345 2104345 Oh, this town.
2104889 2107141 Ah, the angry people in this town...
2109727 2110727 Yeah.
2116567 2117443 Want some music maybe?
2117526 2118861 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
2118945 2119945 Genius.
2123658 2125910 Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.
2125993 2128120 It's fine.<br />Everybody shows up to parties late.
2128204 2130247 It's like, it's cooler to be late.
2130331 2132041 We're gonna arrive right at the crest.
2132124 2134043 Before you know it,<br />you'll be neck deep in Ryan.
2134336 2136463 Neck deep in what direction?
2136546 2140007 - You tell me.<br />- I don't know. I don't know anything.
2140091 2143010 This is like your nightmare about<br />having to land a commercial airliner,
2143094 2144887 but much, much worse.
2146098 2148891 I mean, is it? Is it worse?
2148975 2150060 Well, yeah.
2150143 2151783 I had the lives of 100 people<br />in my hands.
2151811 2153855 My crew was counting on me.<br />I was their Sully.
2153938 2156774 - I'm really stressed about it.<br />- I-m... Okay, I know you are.
2156858 2158276 If only there was just...
2159319 2161321 a video of people hookin' up.
2163281 2165158 Sorry, are you talking about porn?
2165242 2166326 - All I'm saying...<br />- No.
2166409 2169955 No one would know<br />if you watched one porn one time.
2170622 2171957 Think of it as a documentary.
2172040 2174627 Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.
2174710 2177379 All of those women<br />are European trafficking victims.
2177462 2180108 Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging<br />other people's sexual preferences?
2180132 2183135 - 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.<br />- "Fuck a panda..." So fucking funny!
2183218 2186639 Are you about to say you're gonna judge me<br />for dabbling in pornography?
2186722 2189767 - Thought you were a sex-positive feminist.<br />- Are you insane?
2190308 2192561 Principal Brown is right there.
2192645 2194813 - I have headphones.<br />- He's four feet away from us.
2194897 2196774 I have headphones, madam.
2198191 2201237 All right, but once we get a sense<br />of the mechanics,
2201320 2204823 - I am shutting it off real quick.<br />- Of course.
2206575 2208036 It's for educational purposes.
2208119 2210829 Educational purposes.
2219005 2220714 Plug in. Your phone's gonna die.
2225887 2227346 - Principal Brown?<br />- Oh.
2227430 2228807 Principal Brown was my dad.
2229265 2230349 Just call me Jordan.
2231392 2232894 No, thank you. Principal Brown?
2232977 2233977 - Yes.<br />- I'm so...
2234020 2235605 Uh, do you have a phone charger?
2235689 2237231 - No, I don't.<br />- Oh.
2237315 2238357 Got like 13.
2238441 2240359 Yeah, here. Here you go. Catch.
2242821 2244698 Didn't know you could do that<br />from that angle.
2246240 2247784 Oh, wait, what did I miss?
2248159 2249720 - Go back, actually.<br />- Yeah, scroll back.
2249744 2251871 - The part... Wait, start right there.<br />- Oh, there.
2253081 2255922 If you guys want to listen to your music,<br />I can just plug it in up here.
2255959 2257961 - No! No! No!<br />- No! No!
2258044 2259504 No, fuck!
2259588 2262257 <i>That's fuckin' hot.</i>
2262341 2264218 <i>Yes!</i>
2265927 2267804 Come on! Come on!
2276146 2277146 Don't touch me.
2279859 2281110 Was that Cardi B?
2284989 2287449 - You... Oh, my God! You are the...<br />- I cannot believe it!
2287532 2289451 - You are the devil!<br />- I'm gonna die!
2289534 2291662 I'm literally gonna physically die!
2291746 2293538 Oh, Jesus Christ.
2296041 2297041 Come in.
2298335 2300045 He's dead!
2300129 2301506 What the fuck?
2301589 2302882 He's dead!
2303466 2305300 - Wh... Who's dead?<br />- My husband.
2306386 2307678 He's been killed!
2307762 2310390 Okay, Alan, you don't have<br />to do your entrance
2310473 2313183 every time somebody arrives, okay?
2315019 2317230 - What are you guys doing here?<br />- What is going on?
2317313 2319524 It's a murder mystery party.
2320316 2323319 - I've been planning it for months.<br />- Wait, this is your house? Alan?
2323653 2327365 Alan, I was so clear in my text<br />we are looking for Nick's party.
2327448 2330243 My husband, Robert,<br />was an esteemed Broadway director
2330326 2332120 and the love of my life.
2332495 2334039 And he's been killed.
2334580 2336332 Like a dog in the street.
2336416 2339085 - Was he stabbed?<br />- That sounds very tragic.
2339502 2342005 But there's been a mistake.<br />We're looking for Nick's party.
2342088 2344215 Do you have the address? We can't find it.
2344299 2345801 I don't know a Nick.
2346551 2348094 I only know sorrow...
2348970 2350096 and grief.
2350180 2351306 Okay, you're at a ten.
2351389 2352849 I need you at a two.
2355476 2357646 I have a wake to plan.
2357729 2359856 Okay, well, if you guys are here,
2359940 2361941 you might as well take<br />some of the extra characters
2361983 2364319 - since two people decided not to show up.<br />- No...
2364570 2365570 Okay.
2367864 2370302 - Adorable farmer new to the city.<br />- We don't need characters.
2370326 2373870 - We're not staying.<br />- Hideous barren orthodontist.
2373954 2375080 Why am I barren?
2375164 2377374 Am I here to farm<br />or have I given up that life?
2377458 2378834 This just says "orthodontist."
2378917 2381253 - Your backstories are in the packets.<br />- No, no.
2381337 2383714 We are not staying.<br />We're going to Nick's party.
2383797 2385091 - We can just stay for...<br />- No.
2385174 2387634 - The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?<br />- Yes.
2387718 2390804 Yeah, somebody here came from there,<br />I think. Maybe the mayor.
2391722 2394016 Go! Immerse yourselves.
2394100 2396894 Review your histories in the parlor.
2397394 2399832 Okay, if your characters aren't married,<br />hands off each other.
2399856 2400857 No!
2403400 2405111 Do not go gently.
2405194 2406194 Oh, she's really good.
2406904 2408114 Oh, my God! You guys are here.
2408197 2409633 - How'd you get here?<br />- What the fuck?
2409657 2410783 How did you get here?
2410867 2411868 And how are you dry?
2412243 2413661 How are you dry?
2413745 2415412 Aaron, I can see you breathing.
2415872 2417749 Gigi? Mm. Dig deeper.
2417832 2419208 - I don't know what...<br />- I don't...
2419291 2420126 She was like...
2420209 2421252 - I can't think about it.
2421586 2423129 Oh, is it over?
2423212 2426924 No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!<br />The house is mine till 11 p.m.
2427216 2430052 Cindy, I swear to fucking God!
2431929 2434891 - Jesus Christ! God.<br />- Gigi! What the fuck?
2434974 2436518 Guys, the re-election is coming up
2436601 2438561 and I need to know<br />if I have to buy your votes.
2438645 2439896 Wait, are you the mayor?
2439979 2441398 Do you know where Nick's party is?
2441481 2443402 Of course I do.<br />I know where all the parties are.
2443441 2444276 Where is it?
2444359 2446319 Come into my office, now.
2446403 2447612 Okay, thank you.
2448113 2450908 In, in, in. Go, go, go.<br />Come, come, come. Now, now, now!
2452700 2453869 Okay.
2454870 2455913 You can't tell anyone.
2456329 2457329 We won't.
2457497 2458540 Not even each other.
2459166 2460167 Okay.
2460709 2462085 Nick's party...
2466006 2467006 Is at...
2467966 2469009 his aunt's house.
2469718 2471469 We know it's at his au...
2471554 2474264 Amy, I swear to God,<br />I need to get out of here.
2474347 2476559 By the way, I am pretty impressed
2476642 2478852 with how well you guys<br />are holding it together.
2478936 2480563 You're doing fantastic.
2480896 2482981 What do you mean?
2483065 2485651 I thought the strawberries<br />would have hit by now.
2485734 2487110 Why would strawberries hit?
2487194 2491699 Because they were dipped<br />in an unbelievably potent drug.
2491782 2494743 It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.
2495828 2497371 Asian-huasca.
2498622 2499742 I told you guys that, right?
2499790 2502043 - No, no, no, no, no.<br />- I can't...
2502126 2504837 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2507173 2508382 Pull me back in.
2509050 2510509 Pull me back in.
2513972 2516640 Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.
2516724 2517724 Listen to me.
2518267 2519268 We're gonna be fine.
2519518 2520729 One time I threw up,
2520812 2524190 and my mom caught it in her hands,<br />'cause she loves me.
2524273 2525441 We are healthy,
2525692 2527443 nubile, young women,
2527819 2529779 and we just need to stay calm.
2530196 2531447 We are gonna be...
2552051 2553051 What?
2553345 2555013 What the fuck?
2555764 2558600 What the fuck? What is happening?
2561895 2563563 Why do you look like that?
2563647 2565690 Uh, Molly, y... you're a fucking doll.
2565774 2568443 - No, you're a fucking doll.<br />- What?
2569319 2571488 Ow! Fuck, that hurt.
2571571 2574241 And my boobs are too heavy.<br />I have no core.
2574324 2575910 Our legs don't bend.
2575993 2578037 They're twice as long as our torsos.
2578120 2580247 These proportions are insane!
2580330 2581581 Where's my chub?
2581666 2583125 Wait, where are you going?
2583668 2585419 - This is crazy.<br />- Wait for me.
2585502 2588923 I have to see for myself.
2589006 2591091 Well, I've never done the splits<br />in my life.
2592092 2593343 Amy!
2594178 2595930 Help! Molly, help me!
2596013 2598182 Oh, my God! Don't look down, Amy, no!
2598265 2599642 I... I can't reach!
2600100 2602102 You have to put my heel in your hole.
2602186 2604522 - My heel...? Your heel in my what?<br />- Your hole!
2604605 2607066 - What hole?<br />- The corn hole!
2607149 2608526 Oh. Fuck!
2608901 2609901 Molly!
2612780 2614240 Oh, my God.
2614324 2616076 Um, what the fuck am I wearing?
2618036 2619037 Where's my vag?
2619120 2620538 Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.
2620621 2622665 How do I pee? How do I shit?
2622748 2625793 I mean, I don't even have nipples.<br />These are just mounds.
2626002 2627963 My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.
2628379 2629422 Just... just...
2630048 2631716 Perfect, round.
2632133 2633969 - Huge mounds.<br />- Uh, what?
2634052 2636012 Look at my body. I am beautiful.
2636096 2637806 No, don't get sucked in.
2637889 2639850 This is our nightmare, Amy.
2639933 2642310 I know this is unrealistic<br />and bad for women,
2642393 2644145 but... is it bad?
2644229 2645772 Because I feel pretty good.
2645856 2647398 I mean, this ass won't quit.
2647483 2649442 Amy, use your brain!
2649526 2653739 I don't need to use my brain.<br />I just need to be smooth and flexible.
2653822 2655699 Look at you, you bad bitch.
2656492 2658827 Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.
2658910 2661121 My, my, my. Mm.
2662373 2665667 I think I might, like,<br />actually stay here for a while.
2665751 2668086 No, I won't let you do this.
2668420 2670381 Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!
2670464 2672799 You need to throw up.
2672883 2675802 Let me have this body!
2675886 2679015 Now that the amuse-bouche<br />of bacon-wrapped dates is over,
2679098 2682351 why don't we play a rousing round<br />of <i>J'accuse!</i>
2689984 2691736 Fuck you, George.
2693279 2694864 Who is she supposed to be?
2695948 2697366 The orthodontist.
2699118 2700578 We're okay.
2701245 2702245 We're okay.
2702747 2703873 We did it.
2703956 2706751 We went... we went to two parties,<br />we did drugs.
2707710 2708878 We can say we went out.
2709837 2711631 - Let's go home.<br />- What?
2711714 2713591 No, the plan is to go to Nick's.
2713675 2715677 We have to stick to the plan.
2716844 2719389 Dude, nothing has gone<br />according to plan tonight.
2719472 2722112 Which is why we have to stick to the plan.<br />Let's call another Lyft.
2722141 2723518 Why are you being so pushy?
2723601 2726396 Honestly, pushy is a compliment.<br />You know who else was pushy?
2726479 2728231 Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,
2728315 2730942 - Queen Noor of Jordan...<br />- I know where Queen Noor is from!
2731025 2733070 Once we get to Nick's,<br />all of this will be worth it.
2733153 2736031 Just forget about about Nick's!<br />No one will even tell us where it is.
2736114 2737907 Why are you being so obsessed<br />with his party?
2737991 2740202 - Because she loves him.<br />- Oh, my God.
2740285 2743038 Gigi, stop doing that!
2743121 2744957 - What did you say?<br />- Molly loves Nick.
2745040 2747250 Can you please stop<br />repeating that sentence?
2747334 2748752 Because it's not true.
2748836 2750295 - Molly hates Nick.<br />- Thank you.
2750378 2753048 She projects disgust<br />to cover up a deep desire.
2753131 2755508 No. No. N-O. Thanks.
2755592 2758273 Uh, you actually... You drugged us<br />and tried to throw us off a boat.
2758303 2759471 I did. I did.
2759555 2761640 So nothing you say is of any value to us.
2761724 2763601 So... Oh, you're...
2763684 2765204 Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off
2765268 2767229 because you should flip off,<br />so shut the fuck up.
2767312 2770232 Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?
2770315 2771859 George locked himself in the closet.
2771942 2772942 Fuck!
2773110 2774277 Dude.
2774695 2775695 No.
2778657 2779657 Dude?
2780701 2781701 No.
2782661 2783704 I don't like him.
2784788 2786582 Yes, maybe he is...
2787208 2790128 classically, traditionally handsome<br />and weirdly charming,
2790211 2793714 and maybe my innate biology<br />registers him as an ideal mate,
2793797 2797093 and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize<br />about him sweeping me off my feet.
2797176 2800138 And some weaker people<br />might call that a tiny crush,
2800221 2802223 but I can ignore it,<br />I can fight against it,
2802306 2804058 because we all have weird interests.
2804142 2806502 And the important thing is<br />that we just... we shove 'em down
2806560 2808229 and we never speak about them again.
2809647 2811524 You don't have to shove anything down.
2812275 2813442 Yeah.
2813526 2817155 Yeah. Yeah, I do,<br />because I can't like him.
2817238 2820992 Maybe my body can like him<br />but my mind knows that that's stupid,
2821075 2822744 because he's just... he's a jock,
2822827 2824867 and all he cares about<br />is being cool and having fun,
2824913 2827749 and he doesn't even look at girls<br />unless they look like Triple A.
2827832 2830752 And he definitely doesn't want me<br />because I'm a butter personality.
2832211 2835257 How dare you say that<br />about my best friend?
2835340 2836633 Amy, you fucking slapped me...
2836716 2838916 If you ever say anything like that<br />about yourself again,
2838968 2841846 I will fucking lay you out, okay?
2842055 2843848 You are the strongest, coolest,
2843932 2845934 smartest, most stunningly<br />gorgeous creature
2846017 2848062 this high school and this Earth
2848145 2849146 has ever seen.
2849229 2853733 And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky<br />to be a footnote in your story.
2854568 2855777 So we're going to his party.
2855860 2856946 Are you serious?
2857029 2858197 I am dead serious.
2859198 2861616 If Nick's what you want,<br />then that's what you deserve.
2862993 2866080 How? How are we gonna find out<br />where the party is?
2866663 2868040 By doing what we do best.
2868958 2870625 Motherfuckin' homework.
2891772 2893608 <i>- I will now be attempting...</i><br />- Wait. Look.
2893691 2895735 <i>...15 pizza boxes.</i>
2897403 2900615 How many orders that big do you think<br />Lido's could have filled tonight?
2901741 2902825 - Genius.<br />- Yeah.
2929269 2932022 Two half-cheese, half-sausage pizzas
2932313 2935108 are just one cheese and one sausage pizza,
2935400 2936985 you fucking morons.
2937068 2938068 Jesus.
2939279 2940279 Oh, God.
2948789 2951458 - Everybody down! 911! Stay down.<br />- Oh, my God! What the fuck?
2951542 2953001 Fuck! What the fuck is this?
2953084 2955337 - We ask the questions!<br />- Oh, my God.
2955421 2957423 Oh, shit, shit!<br />Is this some Manson family shit?
2957506 2958924 - What is this?<br />- No!
2959341 2961593 No! Everything is gonna be just fine!
2961677 2965181 You're just gonna give us the address to<br />where you delivered some pizzas tonight.
2967433 2970553 Oh, my God. Are you guys out of your<br />fucking mind? How old are you, by the way?
2970602 2972396 Does not matter!
2972479 2974440 Okay, that voice did not<br />make you sound older.
2974523 2976108 So you're basically children,
2976192 2978569 and you just willingly got in the car<br />of a strange man.
2978652 2980029 Do you guys have a weapon?
2980654 2981654 Yes?
2981781 2984408 If we claim to have a weapon,<br />this might be a felony.
2984909 2985743 Fuck.
2985827 2988746 - Yes.<br />- Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask
2988830 2990707 and trying to rob someone with no weapon.
2990790 2991958 'Cause the funny thing is,
2992041 2994376 - I actually have a weapon.<br />- Fuck!
2994460 2996170 - Dear God, no! You have a gun?<br />- Fuck! No!
2996253 2999215 I keep that to protect myself<br />from bad people,
2999298 3000819 something you guys should think about.
3000883 3004387 Did the... did the possibility<br />of sexual assault ever enter your minds?
3005221 3006055 Not really.
3006138 3007849 Yeah, not really, I can tell.
3007932 3010268 You were spendin' more time on,<br />like, the hair
3010352 3012562 and that... that whole part of it,<br />maybe, yeah.
3012645 3015273 'Cause... 'cause we're like...<br />right by the freeway.
3015357 3018067 I could have you across the state line<br />in, like, 40 minutes,
3018151 3020945 take you to some cabin,<br />hog tie your ankles,
3021028 3022947 leave you in a room<br />with, like, a saucer of milk
3023031 3024991 and videotape the whole thing<br />for a couple days.
3025075 3026159 - What?<br />- What?
3026243 3027160 - No.<br />- Think about that.
3027244 3029079 - What?<br />- No, I'm not gonna think about...
3029162 3030788 We just need you to give us the address
3030872 3033250 to where you delivered<br />this huge order tonight.
3034667 3036378 Oh, shit, that p...
3039965 3041759 Okay, you know what?
3042843 3044302 Let me give you the address.
3044386 3045638 I feel like if I don't...
3045721 3047472 ...you guys are so stupid,
3047555 3051393 some dog walker's gonna find<br />your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.
3051476 3053186 - Okay.<br />- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
3053270 3055164 - Don't show me your pass code!<br />- Oh, that's fair!
3055188 3057441 - Okay, sorry.<br />- That's the whole thing with pass codes.
3057525 3058984 I'm just copying the address.

3061194 3063822 - Thank you!<br />- Thank you so much!
3063906 3065198 Oh, my God!
3066534 3067576 Quick Q.
3067660 3071038 Now that we're already in your car,<br />would you mind driving us there?
3072748 3073582 Yeah, why not?
3073666 3075459 - Oh, great!<br />- I'm being sarcastic!
3075543 3077044 - Get the fuck out of my car!<br />- Oh!
3077128 3078421 - Okay!<br />- Thank you so much!

3084885 3088264 You were incredible! You were so scary.
3088347 3091517 If you were a criminal, you'd be<br />the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.
3092685 3095354 Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.
3098274 3101610 Fuck! I left my phone in his car!
3101695 3103780 Why did I have to use a visual aid?
3103863 3105073 - Wait!<br />- It's okay!
3105156 3108326 Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.<br />It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.
3109077 3111538 I'm at two percent?<br />Why the fuck am I at two percent?
3111621 3113164 Why is my battery so low?
3113707 3116918 The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.
3117335 3118753 Just... Just... Just call a Lyft.
3118837 3120296 No, I can't call a Lyft,
3120380 3124092 because if my phone dies and the driver<br />can't contact us, we are fucked!
3124593 3125719 Unless...
3129556 3131197 - Pick up, pick up.<br />- Who are you calling?
3131266 3133935 Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're<br />at Lido's Pizza on Victory Boulevard.
3134018 3136271 We are stranded.<br />Please pick us up, we need...
3138690 3139690 It died.
3144071 3146281 - We could hitchhike.<br />- Are you aching to be murdered?
3146365 3148575 Well, I'm just throwin' out<br />suggestions here.
3161881 3163007 You girls need a ride?
3166385 3167803 - Shotgun!<br />- I'll take the front!
3167887 3169597 So cool! Just gonna...
3169847 3171241 - Amy, what are you doing?<br />- No, I...
3171265 3173142 My... My legs are, like,<br />half an inch longer...
3173225 3175561 Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.<br />What... Oh!
3175645 3177438 - Just let me go!<br />- You're embarrassing me.
3177522 3179064 - Stop...<br />- You're embarrassing me!
3179148 3181734 Thank you so much, Miss Fine.<br />You totally saved us.
3181817 3184570 Please. You two saved me<br />from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
3184654 3186656 I've seen it, like, 50 times.
3187031 3189742 Okay, wait, so what is this address<br />I'm taking you to?
3189825 3191661 It's, uh...<br />it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.
3191744 3194079 It's... It's... It's a party, technically.
3194497 3197458 You two want me to drive you<br />to an unsupervised house party?
3197542 3199085 Oh... well...
3199169 3202255 Good. I'm glad you guys are having<br />some fun before graduation. Uh!
3203673 3204507 Really?
3204590 3208136 Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want<br />you guys to make the same mistake I did.
3208469 3209345 What do you mean?
3209429 3211306 I spent the majority of my 20s
3211389 3214225 overcompensating for the fact<br />that I never had fun in high school.
3214309 3217312 And, you know, the pendulum then swung<br />in a completely different direction.
3217395 3218689 I mean, I went crazy.
3218772 3221066 I had some really dark moments<br />there in my 20s,
3221149 3223359 like, some really dark moments.
3224194 3227155 Like, it was bad.<br />You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?
3227614 3230492 Like, not a single Jamba Juice,<br />like every Jamba Juice.
3230576 3231910 That came down from corporate.
3231993 3234496 Do you know how many Jamba Juices<br />there are in this country?
3234580 3235872 Like, a bajillion.
3236039 3238208 It's a national chain, it's a sensation.
3238291 3240794 I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go<br />ever again.
3240877 3242754 But, look, I don't want that for you.
3242838 3244715 Okay? You still have a chance.
3244798 3247277 I want you two to go to this party,<br />and I want you to have fun.
3247301 3249386 Because tonight is your night.
3249470 3250346 - Yes! Yes!<br />- Yes!
3250429 3251263 Okay.
3251347 3252181 - Yes.<br />- Yes.
3252264 3254933 So, what are you two wearing?
3255016 3256310 Uh, we were thinking...
3258020 3259105 Well, just this...
3259188 3260940 this... this, uh... this look.
3261023 3262816 You do know you guys are matching, right?
3262899 3266237 We added this embellishment here.
3266320 3269573 Well, lucky for you two,<br />I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,
3269656 3272034 so I got a lot of shit in this car.
3272118 3274161 Why don't y'all go through<br />some of those bags?
3274245 3275726 I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?
3275788 3277581 Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.
3277665 3279505 - Please get a change of clothes.<br />- This night!
3286966 3288175 - Um...<br />- Um...
3288259 3289260 - Oh...<br />- Mmm...
3291888 3292972 - I have no breath.<br />- What?
3293055 3293973 Excuse me?
3294056 3295868 - Sorry, what?<br />- I have nowhere to go with this.
3295892 3297977 - It's too perfect.<br />- You are literally glowing.
3298060 3300522 You've hit the level of perfection<br />and now I'm just...
3300605 3302666 - Be still my heart.<br />- You just came out of the water.
3302690 3304859 You're fresh from the water,<br />you're a mermaid here.
3304942 3306861 How are you so fucking shiny?
3306944 3308780 Can you fetch me an inhaler?<br />I can't breathe.
3308863 3311116 - Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!<br />- I'm physically unable...
3311199 3313410 Ow, my eyes hurt so bad<br />from your beauty.
3313493 3314994 - Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.<br />- Oh.
3315078 3317122 - Oh, sorry.<br />- There's a... a party to get to.
3318456 3321001 - All right.<br />- I will see you two inside, all right?
3321084 3322794 Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.
3322878 3324712 - Just kidding.<br />- Imagine if I just went in.
3324796 3325713 That'd be weird, right?
3325797 3327507 That'd be so fun.
3327590 3329802 - Anyway, see y'all later.<br />- Okay, bye.
3340520 3341605 Love you.
3341689 3342689 Love you.
3428943 3430737 Another?
3430820 3432447 - Here.<br />- Aaaah!

3434908 3435908 Yeah.
3436785 3438162 <i>¡El Presidente!</i>
3438245 3439704 - And the protest lady!<br />- Whoo!

3443500 3446003 Do you guys want to drink or smoke?<br />Nothing?
3446461 3448255 Let me know, okay? I'm your guy tonight.
3448338 3449965 I'll take care of you. You're the best.
3450049 3451633 You guys honestly freak me out.
3452509 3455220 But I'm gonna miss you guys.<br />Okay? It's all love.
3455930 3459516 Class of '19... for fuckin' ever! Whoo!
3462937 3463771 Ryan.

3466190 3467066 Oh, God.
3467149 3468943 - She's glowing.<br />- Go get her.
3469026 3470026 Hug me.
3471696 3472856 - Okay. Get her.<br />- Phew. Okay.
3472905 3474198 Get her. Flick the bean!
3475157 3477201 Molly, here's to you, gorgeous.
3477285 3478953 - Thank you.<br />- Of course, of course.
3479287 3481956 Tanner, where's the rubbing alcohol?<br />There's nothing strong enough.
3482039 3483208 - No.<br />- Yep.
3483291 3484792 - No.<br />- I'm here.
3484875 3485875 How?
3486127 3487337 I'm gonna go downstairs.
3489714 3490756 Well...
3490840 3491841 Bye, Gigi.
3505438 3508274 - I'm so stoked you're here, dude.<br />- Thanks.
3508984 3510652 I've always wanted you to come out.
3510736 3512237 Oh, I-I am out.
3513363 3515281 I came out in the tenth grade.
3516783 3520537 No. I meant, like, come out<br />and hang out on the weekend.
3522456 3524416 Oh, right, that... Hang out.
3524500 3527085 - Yeah, that's... that's what I meant also.<br />- You know,
3527168 3530005 you need to have a little bit of fun<br />before you go to Africa.
3530088 3531507 You remembered I'm going to Africa?
3531590 3534092 Of course. Aren't you gonna go to,<br />like, Uganda or something?
3534175 3536887 Botswana. They'd kill me in Uganda.
3536970 3537804 Why?
3537888 3540182 'Cause that's country's<br />not really a fan of gay people.
3540641 3542268 Oh, shit, that's crazy.
3542351 3544270 Would you be afraid to go to Uganda...
3544353 3546772 - Karaoke in the guest room!<br />- Jesus!
3546855 3549066 God, I've missed you. Fuck.
3549483 3552403 Do you wanna go do karaoke<br />in the guest room? I love that girl.
3552486 3553320 Yeah.
3553404 3554488 - Come on, let's go.<br />- Okay.
3559701 3561162 Uh, elbows.
3561328 3562955 Oh, fuck. Re-rack, please?
3563330 3564999 Holy shit!
3565374 3566918 Wait, Molly's here?
3567001 3569671 What a fuckin' compliment<br />to get Molly to roll.
3569754 3571463 Dude, are you actually here right now?
3571547 3574466 Is this some mirage?<br />Am I fucking losing my mind?
3574551 3577428 Or did I actually get President Molly<br />to come out on her weekend?
3577512 3579472 It's a purely ceremonial visit.
3579556 3582266 Okay, okay. Hey, why don't you sit here?
3582349 3583810 Yeah, right next to me, please.
3583893 3585437 Sit here and let's go.
3585520 3588606 I've been fuckin' waitin' for this<br />since, like, seventh grade.
3588773 3590191 - Please. It's for you.<br />- Oh.

3632442 3634152 You ever made love to a Mexican?
3638323 3639575 Hey, listen, this pong
3639658 3641378 - is actually supposed to be my thing.<br />- Hm?
3641410 3643954 So if you could just tone it down<br />for my sake, my self-esteem...
3644037 3646248 No, I think you just have<br />to step up your game.
3646332 3648751 You just have to rise to my level.
3648834 3651211 - It's not my fault.<br />- To her level.
3651295 3654590 It's crazy we haven't hung out<br />outside of school before, you know.
3654673 3656759 I used to think you were all work<br />and no play, but...
3657718 3659094 you're actually pretty fun.
3661305 3662306 I am fun.
3664850 3665851 Okay.

3729124 3730417 - No.<br />- Please.
3730500 3732752 - No.<br />- Come on. Please?
3733128 3734254 Do it for me. Come on, Amy.
3734338 3735798 For you, okay...
3756151 3759029 You can tell she's not supporting.<br />No breath control. But it's good.
3759113 3761115 - It's on pitch. Yeah.Yeah.<br />- I support you, okay?
3766078 3768956 Oh, my God! Oh!
3769707 3770875 - Ready?<br />- Mm-hmm.

3778299 3780093 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3780176 3781469 You need more of an arc.
3781927 3784014 Like... no, too much flick. Like, hoo.
3784097 3787100 See, well, that's easy for you to say<br />when you're, like, three feet tall.
3787183 3788768 I'm lookin' straight down at it.
3789144 3790186 How tall are you?
3792147 3793147 Well...

4092202 4093883 I'm being so mean to him,<br />but it's working.
4093912 4096057 We talked about <i>Harry Potter.</i><br />He knows I'm a Slytherin.
4096081 4098017 - He seems to like it.<br />- I think we should go home.

4124151 4127112 No, I'm not leaving just because<br />you're doing the thing that you always do.
4128905 4130324 What is that supposed to mean?
4130407 4131993 Just... You...
4132493 4135579 You talk a big game, and then you give up<br />just when things get uncomfortable.
4135662 4138540 Like you jumped in the pool, and now<br />you're sad that you're wet, like...
4138624 4140545 - That's bullshit, Moll, that's bullshit.<br />- No...
4140584 4142980 If I didn't drag you to do things,<br />you just wouldn't do them.
4143004 4144505 You... you... you don't drag me.
4144588 4147133 You force me to do<br />whatever you want to do.
4147842 4148885 What does that even mean?
4148968 4152054 You decide what we do and when we do it,
4152138 4153779 and then we always<br />have to do it together,
4153806 4155075 - all the time.<br />- I have to decide
4155099 4156809 because you literally decide nothing.
4156893 4158936 Like, I do all the heavy lifting<br />in our friendship.
4159020 4161397 - You never take charge.<br />- I take charge all the time!
4161481 4162940 You never take charge!
4163024 4166027 I always have to push you.<br />Without me, you wouldn't do anything.
4166110 4169614 - I'm going to Africa without you.<br />- Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.
4169697 4171783 I'm not going for the summer.
4172409 4174201 I'm going for the entire year.
4177121 4178121 What?
4180458 4181918 I'm taking a gap year.
4182627 4184587 I deferred Columbia until next fall.
4185505 4186673 When did you decide that?
4186756 4187757 When I applied.
4189759 4192304 In January? You've been lying to me<br />since January?
4192387 4195473 Yeah, because I knew if I told you,<br />you'd bully me into staying.
4195557 4197642 So all our schedules are gonna be off now.
4197725 4199102 We're not gonna graduate together,
4199186 4200947 not gonna go<br />on a post-college trip together,
4201021 4203190 we're not gonna move to DC together,<br />our whole plan...
4203273 4204775 That was your plan!
4204858 4205858 That was never my plan.
4205901 4207820 - It's always your plan!<br />- I can't believe you!
4207903 4209744 You think<br />that going to Africa makes you tough,
4209780 4212216 and you weren't even fucking brave enough<br />to tell me about it!
4212240 4213617 You're a fucking coward, Amy!
4213701 4214993 You're selfish and mean!
4215077 4216119 You're a bad friend!
4216203 4217746 You're a fucking bad friend...
4267130 4268130 What the fuck?
4270508 4271509 I locked that.
4276806 4278099 Well, I guess you didn't.
4279183 4280309 What's wrong with you?
4280769 4281853 Fight with your wife?
4281936 4283772 Can you please just...
4284439 4285439 leave me alone?
4285482 4286858 Why are you even at a party?
4287233 4290362 Shouldn't you be, like, marching<br />in some meaningless protest somewhere,
4290445 4292697 or, I don't know,<br />in your bed doing homework?
4293240 4294324 You don't even know me.
4294408 4296493 - Pretty sure I do.<br />- No.
4296576 4299329 You're just one of those people<br />who claims they're honest,
4299413 4300997 or calling people on their shit,
4301081 4302541 when you're really just mean.
4308380 4309589 Wow, I take it back.
4314261 4315261 You...
4315720 4317014 are a badass...
4317807 4319474 who takes no prisoners...
4321393 4324772 and cries in the bathroom at parties.
4330444 4331821 Why are you so cruel?
4333280 4334949 I just don't like meek people.
4336784 4337784 And you?
4338911 4341914 You're like Molly's little sidekick bitch.
4341997 4345042 Well, you're just a basic hot girl<br />who's gonna peak in high school.
4375073 4376116 When'd you get here?
4377492 4378493 A while ago.
4379244 4382663 See Amy? She fucking freaked out on me.<br />I don't know what's wrong with her.
4382748 4385250 Do people really think<br />I had sex with a prostitute?
4388211 4389295 You didn't?
4389630 4390630 No.
4391297 4392674 Of course not. I haven't...
4394635 4396261 I haven't slept with anybody.
4400223 4402225 No one in this entire school<br />knows me at all.
4406104 4406938 Except Gigi.
4407022 4409650 I'm a golden starfish!
4412068 4414112 Gigi, the girl who jumped off your boat
4414196 4416615 and gave you a prison tat<br />while you were sleeping?
4416698 4417991 Oh, that wasn't about me.
4419368 4421870 She's a sad person, you know?
4422246 4424373 And yeah, she may be a little nuts, but...
4426125 4428252 she's the most loyal person I've ever met.
4428920 4432464 I mean, she once tried to shiv our mailman<br />because she thought he laughed at me.
4433299 4435592 Turns out, he wasn't...<br />he wasn't laughing at me at all.
4435676 4437303 He was just lookin' at a meme...
4437762 4438762 on his phone.
4438930 4441808 Plus, not everyone's lucky enough<br />to find someone like you and Amy.
4442266 4444769 I'm just doin' my best<br />so I can get out of here and...
4445227 4447814 find some people<br />who are into the same weird shit I'm into.
4449148 4451233 Not like sex stuff.<br />I mean, like, you know...
4452735 4454195 airplanes and musicals.
4454654 4455697 What?
4456823 4458575 I wanna design fuckin' airplanes.
4459283 4462329 Yeah, get rich off that, and then use<br />the cash to produce some new musicals.
4462412 4464532 Enough with the revivals already.<br />It's total bullshit.
4464581 4466458 Audiences deserve something original.
4466666 4467666 I think.
4468710 4469836 I don't know.
4470462 4473840 I should probably go make sure<br />that's not an actual dead man's float.
4477552 4479304 Well, see you at graduation, Molly.
4501827 4503036 - Um...<br />- Are you okay?
4503328 4504913 Yeah, sorry, I just, uh...
4505914 4507675 I just got a little dizzy<br />for a second there.
4507708 4509793 - Um...<br />- We can stop if you want.
4509877 4512045 No, we are not stopping.
4512129 4513171 Okay.
4527603 4529397 I'm sorry.
4530648 4532316 Are you okay?
4532400 4533734 - Yeah.<br />- Oh, my God.
4549876 4551502 I should probably take off...
4552253 4553253 mine too.
4553462 4554462 Yeah.
4565099 4566100 It's a nice dress.
4566475 4568603 It's all she had.
4570271 4571105 Miss Fine.
4571189 4573191 Oh, my God. Of course.
4600802 4603055 How... How... How is that for you?
4603597 4605224 Um, it's okay.
4606183 4609770 Is... Is there, like, another way<br />you would prefer, or, like, is this...
4609854 4611396 I ju... um...
4612647 4614817 I don't think that's the hole<br />you think it is.
4616068 4617236 - Oh, my God.<br />- No, it's okay.
4617319 4619864 - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.<br />- No, it's okay.
4619947 4620948 Oh, my God.
4621031 4623367 I just... I'm not used<br />to approaching it from that angle,
4623450 4624785 and my... my geometry was off...
4624869 4627204 - Seriously, don't worry about it.<br />- I'm sorry.
4639008 4641427 - Wh...<br />- Are... are you good?
4643304 4645139 Aah! Oh, my God!
4645223 4647725 What the... what the fuck? Oh!
4648100 4650311 - I'm so sorry.<br />- What the fuck?
4650395 4653064 - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!<br />- Eww!
4654315 4655315 Are... Are you okay?
4655441 4656651 Amy, just go.
4658903 4659903 Please go.
4661281 4663199 Oh, sh... Please fucking leave.
4663283 4665785 - Sorry, I'm going as fast as I can.<br />- Go!
4707869 4709455 Hey, have you guys seen Amy?
4709538 4710538 - No.<br />- No.
4714293 4715169 What the...
4715252 4716252 Wait.
4718380 4720757 Amy! Amy! Amy!
4721133 4724720 We're fucking sitting ducks. They're gonna<br />come in here, they're gonna find us.
4724804 4726180 Shut the fuck up, Rob.
4734438 4735857 I am not a coward.
4739569 4740612 All right, focus up.
4741571 4744198 Wait for my signal.<br />I'm gonna create a diversion.
4748077 4749077 What?
4777524 4778524 No.
4779776 4780776 Really?
4807971 4811600 You know, this is why people say<br />I gave guys roadside assistance, right?
4813226 4815103 I gave them a ride home, that's all.
4820108 4821509 Okay, that's not true, I blew them.
4821569 4824410 But it's not like they ran out of gas<br />and I showed up to suck their dick
4824447 4825614 while they waited for help.
4825698 4828576 We hooked up in their car.<br />It makes sense to hook up in a car.
4828659 4830995 I'm not gonna, like,<br />suck a dick at my own home
4831079 4833206 where my father can walk in<br />at any moment.
4833456 4836084 Also, I wanna enjoy it. Fucking sue me.
4837501 4838837 That makes a lot of sense.
4847136 4848763 You know what the worst part is?
4850181 4852225 All the fucking girls call me that, too.
4855394 4859816 I knew, like, Ben and Max<br />and Dick Splinter would say stupid shit.
4864446 4865446 I just...
4865780 4869826 I didn't think the girls would, too.
4869909 4871286 Amy never called you that.
4874664 4876666 I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry.
4879419 4882589 Just, like, please don't call me Triple A<br />at Yale next year.
4882672 4886051 I just want people to know my real name.
4886426 4887469 Of course.
4888470 4889304 Annabel.
4889388 4891348 Fuck, dude, no, not right now.
4891431 4892766 I'm sorry. That was bad.
4892849 4894130 - That wasn't my best.<br />- Come on.
4894184 4895954 - Jesus Christ.<br />- That was embarrassing for me.
4895978 4897479 I'm sorry for that too.
4901066 4902860 Wait, where the fuck do you live?
4922672 4923673 [phone buzzes
4929720 4931180 Fuck!
4936852 4937852 What?
4942775 4943609 <i>All right.</i>
4943693 4946154 <i>- Well, just so you know, I know my rights.</i><br />- Oh, my God.
4946237 4948906 <i>There are more prisons than colleges<br />in the United States.</i>
4948990 4950342 <i>- Did you know that?<br />- You're right.</i>
4950366 4953536 <i>And it costs $71,000<br />to house an inmate in California.</i>
4953619 4955038 <i>That's more than Harvard.</i>
4955121 4956915 <i>- Yeah, really?<br />- Well, it seems excessive.</i>
4956998 4959500 <i>Shotgun. Just kidding. I don't have one.</i>
4984651 4987372 Oh, I'm actually... I'm actually here<br />for someone else. I'm so sorry.
4987446 4989490 - My mistake. My mistake. My mistake.<br />- Oh, my God!
4990824 4992326 Fuck you, dude.
4992409 4994203 Dude, you're in full-on jail.
4996079 4997331 Yeah, I know.
4997789 4999166 I'm so sorry.
5000126 5001752 I mean, it's okay.
5001835 5005131 I'm gonna have to pay a fine<br />and go before the judge,
5005214 5006757 - but we both...<br />- No, I'm sorry.
5007383 5009385 Uh... I know women apologize too much,
5009468 5011429 but, in this case,<br />I have so much to be sorry for.
5011470 5012471 I was so selfish.
5012554 5013805 I... I was being a coward.
5013890 5015057 You called Malala.
5015141 5016600 I lied to you, Moll.
5016683 5020229 You were trying to save me from seeing<br />Nick rub his boner all up against Ryan.
5020312 5022106 Oh, my God, can you believe that,<br />by the way?
5022189 5023733 No. Honestly, no.
5023816 5025777 I would have guessed<br />that Nick hooked up with Theo
5025860 5027180 before I would have guessed Ryan.
5027236 5029822 Nick and Theo do have great chemistry.
5029906 5031616 Divine. I mean, it's palpable.
5034410 5037163 I'm sorry I'm so controlling.
5038748 5041333 I just can't imagine my life without you.
5045046 5048383 You are the motherfucker who got arrested<br />the night before graduation.
5048466 5050176 Oh, my God, graduation.
5050260 5052637 Molly, what... what time is it?<br />You have to go.
5052720 5055014 Yeah, why do you think I'm here?<br />You're coming with me.
5055097 5057016 Dude, no, I am screwed. I can't leave.
5057100 5058435 - You have to go.<br />- Amy...
5058893 5060645 I am not graduating without you.
5060728 5064857 So either I get arrested<br />and I join you in there or we go together.
5065317 5066317 How?
5068987 5070948 We're gonna trade some information.
5071656 5073575 Because we have seen this man.
5073658 5074658 What?
5075118 5077245 - Is that Jared's car?<br />- I'll explain later.
5077329 5079122 - Am I driving?<br />- Of course you're driving!
5079206 5081416 - Need this. Go!<br />- Oh, that was my fault!
5081499 5083794 Okay, Waze says 19 minutes.<br />We're doing it in seven.
5084169 5085170 Let's fuckin' do this.
5105316 5106996 Hey, guys, let's go ahead and take a seat.
5108819 5110112 Stop!
5118121 5119121 Hey, Evelyn.
5121374 5122583 I just wanted to say...
5123334 5125003 Have a great summer.
5125086 5127213 That's what the kids are doin', right?
5127463 5128631 Have a great...
5129507 5131175 All right, cool.
5131259 5132927 Cool, cool, cool. Sickening.
5133011 5134345 Morning, my queen.
5134888 5135888 Hi.
5135930 5137849 So last night was amazing.
5138432 5140434 Can I see you again?
5145398 5147066 Good luck at Google next year, okay?
5147150 5148442 Okay.
5148818 5149818 Bye.
5150737 5151738 Bye.
5153948 5155324 Did you fuck Miss Fine?
5166378 5168046 Ha... Has anybody seen, uh, Molly?
5168129 5171216 'Cause we've gotta get started.<br />She kicks it off. Huh? Nobody?
5171508 5173635 'Cause I haven't seen her either<br />since yesterday
5173718 5175821 when we were at school, all of us,<br />at school together.
5175845 5177847 So, Molly warned me<br />she might be a little late
5177931 5179292 and tapped me to start her speech.
5179349 5181601 - Molly is gonna be late to graduation?<br />- Yeah.
5181685 5183562 - That doesn't sound like her.<br />- Right.
5183645 5187024 Well, uh, she also asked me<br />to remind you that... um...
5188818 5189818 I got it, uh...
5190194 5193113 This sort of thing happens all the time<br />on the Senate floor.
5193197 5195199 And if a senator isn't present for a vote,
5195282 5198160 - a proxy can call for a motion...<br />- Okay. That does sound like her.
5198243 5200597 - ...for the vote to take place...<br />- I got it. Thanks, Jared.
5200621 5201890 - ...in her absence.<br />- Okay, so...
5201914 5202915 So she tapped you?
5202998 5204374 - Tapped me.<br />- Okay.
5205209 5208045 Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.<br />You're gonna kick it off.
5208378 5210715 Okay, there he goes.
5210798 5212967 - Yeah, yeah, Shantay, you stay, honey!<br />- Oh, Jared!
5213050 5214301 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
5215470 5216470 Look at you.
5225688 5226772 Good morning.
5226856 5227940 Good morning.
5230693 5231944 I'm Molly Davidson.
5244165 5245666 I am a woman.
5245750 5247836 - I am a powerful woman.<br />- My boy!
5247919 5252007 And I'm ready to take the fists<br />of my femininity to the status quo.
5252090 5254217 Straight, white man,
5254300 5256427 your time is...
5256511 5257512 Okay.
5270025 5274195 Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.
5285332 5287959 All right, I'm gonna go take my seat.<br />I'm gonna go take my seat.
5288043 5291004 Come on. Come on! Look who made it!
5292798 5294466 - Amy!<br />- Amy!
5296635 5298887 Whooooo!
5315738 5317657 <i>♪ Feelin' all right</i>
5324497 5325540 Thank you.
5331838 5332964 Okay.
5333047 5335425 Looks like Jared did a pretty good job.
5335508 5336676 Yes, he did.
5336759 5338010 Yes, he did.
5338094 5339554 Yeah!
5346018 5347104 I was so...
5348062 5349439 scared of you.
5349522 5352192 I felt like I had to prove<br />that I was better than you.
5352775 5353775 But really...
5354652 5356863 I don't know any more than you guys.
5356947 5360617 All I know is that<br />we have a lot more to learn.
5365288 5366623 'Cause this part's over.
5367916 5369126 And that's so sad.
5370460 5372254 But it was great, wasn't it?
5374673 5378010 Things are never gonna be the same,<br />but... it was perfect.
5381471 5383516 And... And I may not have before, but...
5384057 5385392 I see you now.
5386810 5388937 And you're all pretty great.
5389522 5392107 Don't let college fuck it up.
5392190 5393025 Congratulations.
5393108 5394485 I... I see you.
5401492 5402493 Yes!
5405704 5407748 Okay. Okay.
5408874 5410876 That went over,
5410959 5413129 but I will not be cutting down<br />my allotted time.
5413212 5414338 Gigi, hit the track.
5419843 5421405 - That's pretty good.<br />- Know what's good?
5421429 5422555 If you roll these...
5422638 5424223 ...and then you'll have more room.
5424307 5426893 - Oh, probably not rolling them.<br />- Yeah, but...
5426976 5429353 - Well, why does it have to be...<br />- Oh! Look! Oh!
5429437 5431064 - God, you're bringing Lingling.<br />- Mm.
5431147 5433692 - Well...<br />- Oh, Lingling!
5433775 5434901 - Um...<br />- No.
5434984 5437236 - Please be good to my Amy.<br />- I've gotta pack up.
5437320 5439381 - Make her feel like she's not so lonely.<br />- Pack it up.
5439405 5440782 Make her feel good. Mm!
5440865 5443535 - Amy, make it stop.<br />- Gotta put that in the old suitcase.
5443618 5445829 Please don't put your face on the face.
5445912 5446912 Make it stop.
5446955 5449290 - On the head, on the neck.<br />- Not the nose.
5449374 5450500 - I got...<br />- Amy, there's...
5450584 5451626 Look who she's bringing.
5451710 5452586 Okay.
5452669 5453753 Lingling?
5453837 5455213 - No!<br />- Oh, let me get in there.
5455297 5456715 No, no...
5462929 5465056 Amy, there's, uh, someone here to see you.
5465349 5466391 Who?
5467434 5468434 What?
5469478 5471063 Why is she here?
5471146 5472146 Excuse me.
5473023 5475484 Amy, why is she here?
5489623 5491792 I figured I'd bring back your clothes.
5492042 5494003 Oh. Thanks so much.
5494837 5497548 I don't...<br />I don't usually leave my underwear
5497632 5498966 in... in places that are...
5499049 5500676 that aren't my room.
5501802 5502802 Yeah, I figured.
5504138 5505180 So, um...
5506849 5507850 How... how...
5508809 5510603 Are... Are you... Are you okay?
5511812 5512812 Yeah, I'm fine.
5514815 5515983 Are <i>you </i>okay?
5516401 5517401 Yeah.
5518528 5519528 You know...
5519904 5522490 - prison kind of changes you, but, uh...<br />- Mmm.
5524825 5525868 I'm fine.
5525951 5529830 I'm sorry, I just... I really don't know<br />what I'm doing with all that stuff yet.
5529914 5531666 Well, for...
5532292 5534710 someone who has no idea<br />what they're doing...
5537047 5538631 you kind of know what you're doing.
5542010 5543010 That's a...
5545096 5546890 Um, that's cool.
5548391 5549643 So, how... Uh...
5549935 5552270 How is your... How is...<br />How is your summer going?
5553479 5556900 I mean, wh... what are you doing for...<br />for the summertime?
5559695 5561697 I think I'm gonna backpack around<br />for a bit.
5562698 5563824 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
5563907 5564907 Where?
5565701 5568662 I don't know. Honestly, anywhere<br />I can find a couch to crash on.
5568745 5571540 I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff<br />before college.
5572249 5573709 That's... that's really cool.
5573792 5576253 Me too, that's...<br />that's why I'm taking a gap year.
5576753 5577753 Yeah?
5578004 5579005 Yeah.
5579089 5579923 Yeah.
5580006 5581258 All right, well...
5581550 5582759 have fun, nerd.
5591352 5594730 Um, well, if... if you ever end up in...<br />in Botswana...
5595731 5597691 you'd have a couch to crash on.
5597984 5599151 Okay.
5600236 5603906 Well, technically, it won't be my couch,<br />'cause I'll be staying with a family,
5603990 5606200 - but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.<br />- Okay.
5615668 5616668 Yes.
5617253 5618253 Yes.
5619464 5620632 Molly!
5620715 5623175 Amy, this thing drives like a cruise ship.
5623926 5626137 Well, it's yours now.
5626220 5627597 Take care of the old Volvo for me.
5627680 5629307 Oh, speaking of vulva,
5629391 5631309 remember when you missed Hope's,
5631393 5633270 and you just went straight<br />for that butt hole!
5633353 5635355 I said... I said, "once a day."
5635438 5637690 - Hey, I have to stock up.<br />- Once a day.
5637774 5641403 - You're gonna be on a flight for 28 hours.<br />- I said you could mention it once a day.
5641486 5642671 - So I have to stock up.<br />- Aah!
5642695 5644072 It's not my fault.
5654457 5656459 Yeah. It feels weird<br />to be on this side of the car.
5656543 5659129 It's like everything's... different.
5661298 5663508 Yeah, I can't believe<br />I'm not gonna see you tomorrow.
5664134 5666219 Call me on that weird<br />international flip phone, okay?
5666303 5667303 I will.
5668346 5669346 Okay.
5670182 5671391 - Bye. I love you.<br />- Bye.
5671474 5672726 Love you.
5674186 5675020 Bye.
5675103 5677565 - Go make those tampons, girl.<br />- I will. I...
5678691 5680275 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5687658 5688992 Oh, gotta get that bag.
5689076 5692079 Yep. Yeah, it's... it's a long trip.
5692162 5693162 Go get 'em.
5694832 5695832 What's a year?
5697543 5698543 Okay.
5747594 5749679 - Oh, fuck!<br />- Fuck!
5749763 5751890 What the fuck is wrong with you?
5751973 5754518 I was going through a thing!
5754601 5755745 - You weren't... You're...<br />- Aah!
5755769 5758438 I was going through a whole fucking thing!
5758522 5759564 What the fuck?
5759648 5762276 - I can be the last one on the plane.<br />- What's wrong with you?
5762359 5763360 You wanna get pancakes?
5763443 5765905 Fuck, yeah, I do! Fuck, yeah!
