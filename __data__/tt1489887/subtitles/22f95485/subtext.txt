145880 149297 - so that when I'm up in New Haven--<br />- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.
149380 152088 Well, our class's official policy<br />is to not discuss
152172 153671 where anyone is attending next year.
153672 155588 We don't want them to feel insecure.
155672 156605 Very thoughtful.
156630 159047 I need to go over the end of the year<br />budget numbers we have.

658213 659172 - Good Lord.<br />- S'all right.
659255 661380 I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.<br />Watch my stuff.
661463 664380 Until all of us can pee without genitals,<br />none of us can.
665130 667005 [Molly] These motherfuckers.
667755 668713 "Your ugly" what?
669547 671213 How did you graduate sixth grade?
671297 672922 - [door opens]<br />- It's shocking to me.
673005 675172 [Theo chuckles] So, okay, so, I win.
675255 677380 - Marry the sex doll, okay?<br />- [Tanner] Right.
677463 679130 - [Theo] Fuck the soccer ball.<br />- [Tanner] Yep.
679213 680547 [Theo] And then, kill Molly.
680630 682297 [Tanner] Dude, no!
682380 683505 There's no other way, dude.
683588 685380 Like, I can't fuck her,<br />you know, 'cause...
685463 687505 when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.
687588 689755 And then, like, I can't marry her,<br />'cause, well,
689838 691963 - I don't believe in the institution.<br />- Uh-huh.
692047 693713 [Theo] So I have to kill Molly.
693797 695922 And I know it'll haunt me.<br />I'm a peaceful person.
696005 697963 - That's very true.<br />- [laughs]
698047 700047 Wait, are you guys talking<br />about Molly Davidson?
700130 700963 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
701047 703963 [Triple A] That girl is so weird.<br />She always acts like she's, like, 40.
704047 707088 [Tanner] I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.<br />Women in their forties know themselves.
707172 710047 Oh, she's cute,<br />you know, yeah, I give her that,
710130 713463 but she'd probably make you quiz her<br />on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.
713547 717005 Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed<br />with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?
717088 719047 That shit's like a filing cabinet<br />down there.
719130 721838 Well, I've got no problem<br />with a filing cabinet.
721922 724880 I would make passionate sex<br />to Molly Davidson.
724963 726005 Really?
726088 728422 Yeah, I'd just put a bag<br />over her personality.
728505 730172 - [laughs] Yeah.<br />- [Tanner] That's it.
730255 733463 Molly's like a butterface for personality,<br />a butter personality.
733547 735255 - [laughter]<br />- [Theo] Yeah!
735338 736255 [laughing]
736338 737963 - [Triple A] It's so bad.<br />- [Theo] Yeah.
738047 740672 - [toilet flushes]<br />- That's cool, man. What?
740755 741963 [footsteps]
742047 742963 [Theo] Shit.
744755 745588 [stall door closes]
746547 747380 Oh.
747963 750130 Oh, please, do not stop on my account.
751088 754463 Do you know what?<br />My vag is stuffed with diplomas.
754963 757505 Soon it's gonna be stuffed<br />with job offers,
757588 761255 and glowing profiles,<br />and commendations from the governor.
761338 765255 So, while you guys<br />were all studying AP hand jobs,
765338 767505 I was kicking ass and busting curves.
767588 770213 And I'm gonna continue to do that<br />at Yale next year.
770297 771172 So...
772088 773047 I like my choices,
773130 775755 and wherever you three are next year,<br />I hope you do, too.
776963 778088 I'm going to Yale, too.
781172 782130 What?
782213 786380 I'm incredible at hand jobs,<br />but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.
787588 788672 No, you didn't.
788755 790005 I got in early.
790088 791463 - To Yale?<br />- Uh-huh.
791547 792713 - Mm-hm?<br />- [Triple A] Mm-hm.
792797 793630 Mm-hm.
793713 796088 Oh, um, Tanner,<br />where are you going to school?
796672 799005 Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.
799088 802213 Stanford University? [chuckles]<br />What are you guys talking about? That's--
802297 805005 - No, yes, Stanford.<br />- Mm-hm. Stanford University.
805088 807130 Hey, I'm not going to college.
807213 809297 I got recruited to go code for Google.
809380 811130 I mean, it's not Apple,
811213 813463 but the bennies are pretty tight, man,
813547 815588 and it's mid six-figures,<br />so I'm not complainin'.
815672 817338 - That's my boy.<br />- So proud of you. Amazing.
817422 819713 You failed the seventh grade twice.
820047 821005 Rule of threes.
823672 825255 - You guys are serious?<br />- [Triple A] Mm-hm.
826088 829547 Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend<br />like I don't know you next year.
830005 830838 No offense.
831797 832713 Hmm.
832797 834880 This... this isn't possible.
834963 836713 You guys don't even care about school.
837963 838797 No.
839338 841338 We just don't only care about school.
842505 843338 [scoffs]
849213 850088 [Theo clears throat]
850172 851255 Well, I'm... I'm done.

1236422 1238255 I thought I knew everything about you.
1238338 1241588 I think it's healthy for a relationship<br />to have secrets, and now we have one.
1242172 1244255 Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.
1244338 1245255 - Uh-huh.<br />- Yeah.

1264463 1265297 Hey. Hey!
1266005 1267463 I need you to do the talking.
1267963 1270172 Why don't you just tell them<br />we're going to a party?
1270380 1273255 Because they'll ask too many questions.<br />They'll try to call Nick's aunt.
1273338 1275838 I've never lied to my parents before.
1275922 1278338 You know when I lie,<br />I just add too many details.
1278838 1282630 Just make up a story, but don't say<br />we're having a date night or anything.
1282713 1284963 Why? It's funny<br />your parents think we're boning.
1285047 1286255 No, it's not,
1286338 1289172 because you're not the one<br />who has to deal with their creepy smiles
1289255 1291213 when I tell them<br />I'm meeting you at the library,
1291297 1293630 when I'm actually<br />meeting you at the library.
1293713 1296422 Honestly, it's surprising<br />that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,
1296505 1297963 considering their whole Jesus thing.
1298047 1298922 It's nice.
1299005 1300672 - Charmaine, get to the safe room.<br />- Hey!

1309255 1310297 - Oh, no.<br />- A little nippy.
1310380 1312547 I'll start a fire,<br />or I'll turn up the heat.
1312630 1314755 Just get the jackets off.<br />Dinner's about ready.
1314838 1316297 - Oh, you've gotta taste this.<br />- Well...
1316380 1318713 - Yeah.<br />- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."
1318797 1319880 [all laugh]

1954505 1956463 - Amy...<br />- Don't do your lecture voice.
1956547 1958338 That was not a party.
1958422 1960255 Well, it definitely was a party.
1960338 1961922 That was a detour.
1962005 1964588 We are A-plus people,
1964672 1966755 and we are going to an A-plus party.
1966838 1967838 Like this.

1971922 1972755 [phone vibrates]
1972838 1974380 Oh, my God, Alan responded.
1974463 1976713 We have the address!<br />Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.
1977047 1978463 Oh, my score is...
1978880 1979797 My score is very low.
1979880 1982005 I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.<br />You should call.
1982088 1983047 I'm gonna go home.
1983213 1986547 But if you wanna go to Nick's,<br />you should really go. Seriously, go.
1988255 1989255 Malala.
1992797 1993630 Whoa.
1994213 1996338 - I'm calling Malala.<br />- Wow.
1996422 1999630 You know you only get,<br />like, one Malala a year?
1999713 2000922 Yeah, I'm calling it.
2001422 2004505 Full support, no questions asked,<br />you are coming with me.
2004588 2005463 Hmm.

2008672 2009505 Malala.
2010505 2011338 All right.
2012672 2013505 Malala.

2016088 2017172 [Amy] Oh!
2017255 2018547 [Molly] Oh!

2022213 2023755 Yeah, and you're Am--
2026797 2028422 Shit.
2036255 2037255 You know, I-I, um...
2037338 2040588 this job's a good way to supplement<br />the, uh... the old income.
2041130 2043255 You know, teachers' salaries today<br />and all, so...
2043338 2045380 - It's terrible.<br />- Yeah, it's a disgrace.
2045463 2047630 Meet new people<br />and see new parts of the city,
2047713 2048922 and run into old friends.

2052672 2053505 [both] Oh.
2053588 2055338 - Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.<br />- Cool.
2055422 2059672 Nothing more exciting or daunting<br />than the blank page, you know?
2059755 2061880 One book I'm thinkin' about doin'<br />is a book of quotes.
2061963 2065588 Nothing more daunting or exciting<br />than the blank page.
2065880 2068922 But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'<br />about doin' a detective novel.
2069005 2070963 Actually, you know what?<br />You two will love...
2071213 2074213 Amy, you'll love this.<br />It's a, uh... a female detective.
2074297 2075630 - Oh, really?<br />- A lady detective.
2075713 2077088 - Yeah, how about that?<br />- Interesting.
2077422 2080005 Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.<br />Still workin'.
2080088 2083338 And, uh, you know, the baby,<br />whenever she's, like, close to a clue,
2083422 2086463 or, like, one of her hunches is,<br />like, uh, you know, close,
2086547 2087588 the baby kicks,
2087880 2090088 you know, and the harder it kicks,<br />the closer she is.
2090172 2091838 And, uh, that's where I'm at right now.
2091922 2093797 I-- I-- I don't know what to do<br />once, um...
2094213 2095838 you know, when she, um, gives birth.
2095922 2097130 - But, um...<br />- [Amy] Hmm.
2097213 2099922 - [horns blare]<br />- Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
2100297 2101422 Choose a lane!
2102338 2103172 That was nuts.
2103255 2105130 - Don't know what that was.<br />- [chuckling nervously]
2105213 2106047 Oh, this town.
2106755 2109005 Ah, the angry people in this town...
2111588 2112463 Yeah.
2118422 2119297 Want some music maybe?
2119380 2120713 - Yeah. [chuckles]<br />- Yeah.

2138380 2141838 - You tell me.<br />- I don't know. I don't know anything.
2141922 2144838 This is like your nightmare about<br />having to land a commercial airliner,
2144922 2146713 but much, much worse.
2147922 2150713 I mean, is it? Is it worse?

2185005 2188422 Are you about to say you're gonna judge me<br />for dabbling in pornography?

2318963 2321172 It's a murder mystery party.
2321963 2324963 - I've been planning it for months.<br />- Wait, this is your house? Alan?
2325297 2329005 Alan, I was so clear in my text<br />we are looking for Nick's party.
2329088 2331880 My husband, Robert,<br />was an esteemed Broadway director
2331963 2333755 and the love of my life.
2334130 2335672 And he's been killed.

2338047 2340713 - Was he stabbed?<br />- That sounds very tragic.
2341130 2343630 But there's been a mistake.<br />We're looking for Nick's party.
2343713 2345838 Do you have the address? We can't find it.
2345922 2347422 I don't know a Nick.
2348172 2349713 I only know sorrow...
2350588 2351713 and grief.
2351797 2352922 Okay, you're at a ten.
2353005 2354463 I need you at a two.
2357088 2359255 [Alan] I have a wake to plan.
2359338 2361463 Okay, well, if you guys are here,
2361547 2363505 you might as well take<br />some of the extra characters
2363588 2365922 - since two people decided not to show up.<br />- No--
2366172 2367088 Okay.

2371922 2375463 - We're not staying.<br />- Hideous barren orthodontist.
2375547 2376672 Why am I barren?
2376755 2378963 Am I here to farm<br />or have I given up that life?
2379047 2380422 This just says "orthodontist."
2380505 2382838 - Your backstories are in the packets.<br />- [Molly] No, no.
2382922 2385297 We are not staying.<br />We're going to Nick's party.
2385380 2386672 - We can just stay for--<br />- No.
2386755 2389213 - The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?<br />- Yes.
2389297 2392380 Yeah, somebody here came from there,<br />I think. Maybe the mayor.
2393297 2395588 Go! Immerse yourselves.
2395672 2398463 [English accent]<br />Review your histories in the parlor.
2398963 2401338 Okay, if your characters aren't married,<br />hands off each other.

2402505 2403880 [continues sobbing]
2403963 2404880 Oh.

2406755 2407672 Oh, she's really good.
2408463 2409672 Oh, my God! You guys are here.
2409755 2411130 - How'd you get here?<br />- What the fuck?
2411213 2412338 How did you get here?
2412422 2413422 And how are you dry?
2413797 2415213 How are you dry?
2415297 2416963 Aaron, I can see you breathing.
2417422 2419297 Gigi? Mm. Dig deeper.
2419380 2420755 - I don't know what...<br />- I don't...
2420838 2421672 - She was like--<br />- Oh!
2421755 2422797 - I can't think about it.
2423130 2424672 Oh, is it over?
2424755 2428463 No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!<br />The house is mine till 11 p.m.

2436505 2438047 Guys, the re-election is coming up
2438130 2440088 and I need to know<br />if I have to buy your votes.
2440172 2441422 Wait, are you the mayor?
2441505 2442922 Do you know where Nick's party is?
2443005 2444880 Of course I do.<br />I know where all the parties are.
2444963 2445797 Where is it?
2445880 2447838 Come into my office, now.

2454213 2455380 Okay.
2456380 2457422 You can't tell anyone.
2457838 2458672 We won't.

2471213 2472963 We know it's at his au--
2473047 2475755 Amy, I swear to God,<br />I need to get out of here.

2478130 2480338 with how well you guys<br />are holding it together.
2480422 2482047 You're doing fantastic.
2482380 2484463 What do you mean?
2484547 2487130 I thought the strawberries<br />would have hit by now.
2487213 2488588 Why would strawberries hit?
2488672 2493172 Because they were dipped<br />in an unbelievably potent drug.
2493255 2496213 - [exhales heavily]<br />- It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.
2497297 2498838 Asian-huasca.
2500088 2501172 I told you guys that, right?
2501255 2503505 - No, no, no, no, no.<br />- I can't...
2503588 2506297 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br />- [operatic music plays]

2518172 2519047 Listen to me.
2519713 2520713 We're gonna be fine.
2520963 2522172 One time I threw up,
2522255 2525630 and my mom caught it in her hands,<br />'cause she loves me.
2525713 2526880 We are healthy,
2527130 2528880 nubile, young women,
2529255 2531213 and we just need to stay calm.
2531630 2532880 We are gonna be...

2572963 2575630 And my boobs are too heavy.<br />I have no core.
2575713 2577297 Our legs don't bend.
2577380 2579422 They're twice as long as our torsos.
2579505 2581630 These proportions are insane!
2581713 2582963 Where's my chub?
2583047 2584505 Wait, where are you going?
2585047 2586797 - [Molly] This is crazy.<br />- [Amy] Wait for me.
2586880 2590297 [Molly gasps]<br />I have to see for myself.
2590380 2592463 Well, I've never done the splits<br />in my life.

2601463 2603463 You have to put my heel in your hole.
2603547 2605880 - My heel...? Your heel in my what?<br />- Your hole!
2605963 2608422 - What hole?<br />- The corn hole!
2608505 2609880 Oh. Fuck!

2614130 2615588 Oh, my God.
2615672 2617422 Um, what the fuck am I wearing?
2619380 2620380 Where's my vag?
2620463 2621880 Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.
2621963 2624005 How do I pee? How do I shit?
2624088 2627130 I mean, I don't even have nipples.<br />These are just mounds.
2627338 2629297 My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.
2629713 2630755 Just... just...
2631380 2633047 Perfect, round.
2633463 2635297 - Huge mounds.<br />- Uh, what?
2635380 2637338 Look at my body. I am beautiful.
2637422 2639130 - No, don't get sucked in.<br /><i>- ♪ Ah, push it ♪</i>
2639213 2641172 This is our nightmare, Amy.
2641255 2643630 I know this is unrealistic<br />and bad for women,
2643713 2645463 but... is it bad?
2645547 2647088 Because I feel pretty good.
2647172 2648713 I mean, this ass won't quit.
2648797 2650755 Amy, use your brain!
2650838 2655047 I don't need to use my brain.<br />I just need to be smooth and flexible.
2655130 2657005 Look at you, you bad bitch.
2657797 2660130 Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.
2660213 2662422 My, my, my. Mm.
2662505 2663588 [grunts]
2663672 2666963 I think I might, like,<br />actually stay here for a while.
2667047 2669380 No, I won't let you do this.
2669713 2671672 Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!
2671755 2674088 [grunts] You need to throw up.
2674172 2677088 Let me have this body!
2677172 2680297 Now that the amuse-bouche<br />of bacon-wrapped dates is over,
2680380 2683630 why don't we play a rousing round<br />of <i>J'accuse!</i>
2683713 2685672 - [glass shatters]<br />- [thumping]
2691255 2693005 Fuck you, George.
2694547 2696130 Who is she supposed to be?
2696297 2697130 [door closes]
2697213 2698630 The orthodontist.
2698713 2700297 [inhaling deeply]
2700380 2701838 - We're okay.<br />- [exhales]
2702505 2703422 We're okay.
2704005 2705130 - [exhales]<br />- We did it.
2705213 2708005 We went... we went to two parties,<br />we did drugs.
2708963 2710130 We can say we went out.
2711088 2712880 - Let's go home.<br />- What?
2712963 2714838 - No, the plan is to go to Nick's.<br />- [groans]
2714922 2716922 We have to stick to the plan.
2718088 2720630 Dude, nothing has gone<br />according to plan tonight.
2720713 2723297 Which is why we have to stick to the plan.<br />Let's call another Lyft.
2723380 2724755 Why are you being so pushy?
2724838 2727630 Honestly, pushy is a compliment.<br />You know who else was pushy?
2727713 2729463 Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,
2729547 2732172 - Queen Noor of Jordan--<br />- I know where Queen Noor is from!
2732255 2734297 Once we get to Nick's,<br />all of this will be worth it.
2734380 2737255 Just forget about about Nick's!<br />No one will even tell us where it is.
2737338 2739130 Why are you being so obsessed<br />with his party?
2739213 2741422 - [Gigi] Because she loves him.<br />- Oh, my God.
2741505 2744255 Gigi, stop doing that!
2744338 2746172 - What did you say?<br />- Molly loves Nick.
2746255 2748463 Can you please stop<br />repeating that sentence?
2748547 2749963 Because it's not true.
2750047 2751505 - Molly hates Nick.<br />- Thank you.
2751588 2754255 She projects disgust<br />to cover up a deep desire.
2754338 2756713 No. No. N-O. Thanks.
2756797 2759422 Uh, you actually... You drugged us<br />and tried to throw us off a boat.
2759505 2760672 I did. I did.
2760755 2762838 So nothing you say is of any value to us.
2762922 2764797 - So-- Oh, you're...<br />- [trilling]
2764880 2766380 Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off
2766463 2768422 because you should flip off,<br />so shut the fuck up.
2768505 2771422 - [growls]<br />- Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?
2771505 2773047 George locked himself in the closet.
2773130 2773963 [Gigi] Fuck!
2774297 2775463 - Dude.<br />- [door closes]
2775880 2776713 No.
2779838 2780672 Dude?
2781880 2782797 No.
2783838 2784880 I don't like him.
2785963 2787755 [sighing] Yes, maybe he is...
2788380 2791297 classically, traditionally handsome<br />and weirdly charming,
2791380 2794880 and maybe my innate biology<br />registers him as an ideal mate,
2794963 2798255 and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize<br />about him sweeping me off my feet.
2798338 2801297 And some weaker people<br />might call that a tiny crush,
2801380 2803380 but I can ignore it,<br />I can fight against it,
2803463 2805213 because we all have weird interests.
2805297 2807630 And the important thing is<br />that we just... we shove 'em down
2807713 2809380 and we never speak about them again.
2810797 2812672 You don't have to shove anything down.
2813422 2814588 [inhales] Yeah.
2814672 2818297 [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah, I do,<br />because I can't like him.
2818380 2822130 Maybe my body can like him<br />but my mind knows that that's stupid,
2822213 2823880 because he's just... he's a jock,
2823963 2825963 and all he cares about<br />is being cool and having fun,
2826047 2828880 and he doesn't even look at girls<br />unless they look like Triple A.
2828963 2831880 And he definitely doesn't want me<br />because I'm a butter personality.
2833338 2836380 How dare you say that<br />about my best friend?
2836463 2837755 Amy, you fucking slapped me--
2837838 2840005 If you ever say anything like that<br />about yourself again,
2840088 2842963 I will fucking lay you out, okay?
2843172 2844963 You are the strongest, coolest,
2845047 2847047 smartest, most stunningly<br />gorgeous creature
2847130 2849172 this high school and this Earth
2849255 2850255 has ever seen.
2850338 2854838 And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky<br />to be a footnote in your story.
2855672 2856880 So we're going to his party.
2856963 2858047 Are you serious?
2858130 2859297 I am dead serious.
2860297 2862713 If Nick's what you want,<br />then that's what you deserve.
2864088 2867172 How? How are we gonna find out<br />where the party is?
2867755 2869130 By doing what we do best.
2870047 2871713 Motherfuckin' homework.

2971588 2973380 - Uh--<br />- [deep voice] Does not matter!
2973463 2975422 Okay, that voice did not<br />make you sound older.
2975505 2977088 So you're basically children,
2977172 2979547 and you just willingly got in the car<br />of a strange man.

3099130 3102463 Fuck! I left my phone in his car!
3102547 3104630 Why did I have to use a visual aid?
3104713 3105922 - Wait!<br />- It's okay!
3106005 3109172 Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.<br />It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.
3109922 3112380 I'm at two percent?<br />Why the fuck am I at two percent?
3112463 3114005 Why is my battery so low?
3114547 3117755 The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.
3118172 3119588 Just-- Just-- Just call a Lyft.
3119672 3121130 No, I can't call a Lyft,
3121213 3124922 because if my phone dies and the driver<br />can't contact us, we are fucked!

3147172 3149380 [Amy] Well, I'm just throwin' out<br />suggestions here.
3149880 3151047 [sighs]
3152588 3154463 [vehicle approaches]
3162672 3163797 You girls need a ride?

3167172 3168588 - [Amy] Shotgun!<br />- I'll take the front!
3168672 3170380 - So cool! Just gonna--<br />- [laughing]
3170630 3171963 - Amy, what are you doing?<br />- No, I--
3172047 3173922 My-- My legs are, like,<br />half an inch longer--
3174005 3176338 Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.<br />What-- Oh!
3176422 3178213 - Just let me go!<br />- [Amy] You're embarrassing me.
3178297 3179838 - Stop--<br />- [Molly] You're embarrassing me!
3179922 3182505 Thank you so much, Miss Fine.<br />You totally saved us.
3182588 3185338 Please. You two saved me<br />from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
3185422 3187422 I've seen it, like, 50 times.
3187797 3190505 Okay, wait, so what is this address<br />I'm taking you to?
3190588 3192422 It's, uh...<br />it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.
3192505 3194838 It's... It's... It's a party, technically.
3195255 3198213 You two want me to drive you<br />to an unsupervised house party?
3198297 3199838 Oh... well...
3199922 3203005 Good. I'm glad you guys are having<br />some fun before graduation. Uh!
3203088 3204338 [both sigh]
3204422 3205255 [chuckling] Really?
3205338 3208880 Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want<br />you guys to make the same mistake I did.
3209213 3210088 What do you mean?
3210172 3212047 I spent the majority of my 20s
3212130 3214963 overcompensating for the fact<br />that I never had fun in high school.
3215047 3218047 And, you know, the pendulum then swung<br />in a completely different direction.
3218130 3219422 I mean, I went crazy.
3219505 3221797 I had some really dark moments<br />there in my 20s,
3221880 3224088 like, some really dark moments.
3224922 3227880 Like, it was bad.<br />You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?
3228338 3231213 Like, not a single Jamba Juice,<br />like every Jamba Juice.
3231297 3232630 That came down from corporate.
3232713 3235213 Do you know how many Jamba Juices<br />there are in this country?
3235297 3236588 Like, a bajillion.
3236755 3238922 It's a national chain, it's a sensation.
3239005 3241505 I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go<br />ever again.
3241588 3243463 But, look, I don't want that for you.
3243547 3245422 Okay? You still have a chance.
3245505 3247922 I want you two to go to this party,<br />and I want you to have fun.
3248005 3250088 Because tonight is your night.
3250172 3251047 - Yes! Yes!<br />- Yes!
3251130 3251963 Okay.
3252047 3252880 - Yes.<br />- Yes.
