18061 20564 <i>You've worked harder than everyone,</i>
20648 23859 <i>and that is why you're a champion.</i>
24359 27780 <i>You understand that greatness<br />takes sacrifice.</i>
28656 31449 <i>Visualize what you still want to achieve.</i>
32159 34745 <i>Stand atop the mountain of your success</i>
34828 37455 <i>and look down at everyone</i>
37539 39541 <i>who's ever doubted you.</i>
40542 42085 <i>Fuck those losers.</i>
42294 46632 <i>Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.</i>
54306 56016 Hey!
57685 58686 Oh, shit.
60228 61605 Hold the phone!
62022 63065 I'm comin'!
63941 65651 Oh, shit.
72532 74534 - What?<br />- What? Excuse me.
75160 76369 What?
76453 77537 What?
77621 78622 - Hey.<br />- What?
78706 80457 - Missed ya!<br />- I missed you.
81083 82885 - I missed you so much.<br />- It's been one night.
85295 87172 - Are we gonna go to school, or...<br />- No.
88298 89261 I don't think we are.
89341 91927 No, we're just gonna stay... here.
104022 105733 - Move!<br />- Jeez!
111697 113531 Are you...
113615 115408 I swear to God.
115993 116997 What are you doing?
117077 119800 - Are you kidding me? Samantha!<br />- You couldn't have just gone around?
119913 122916 Where was this energy<br />at my inauguration assembly, folks?
123000 123834 True.
123917 127545 I hope I never have<br />to see any of you ever again, okay?
127629 128881 That's it. Signin' off.
128964 130465 Go, Crocketts!
133010 135512 Principal Brown?
136179 138348 Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?
138431 140854 I want to make the transition<br />of next year's student government
140934 141897 as seamless as possible,
141977 145397 - so that when I'm up in New Haven...<br />- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.
145480 148191 Well, our class's official policy<br />is to not discuss
148275 149697 where anyone is attending next year.
149777 151695 We don't want them to feel insecure.
151779 152654 Very thoughtful.
152738 155157 I need to go over the end of the year<br />budget numbers we have.
156491 157492 Gosh.
158035 159036 Really?
159202 160203 Like, now?
160746 163165 I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?<br />You know, please?
163248 165170 I mean, he's... you know,<br />he's the vice president.
165250 166251 Nick?
168628 171464 We both know that Nick only ran for VP<br />because they plan the dances.
171548 172716 That position is...
173466 175552 It's basically a popularity contest.<br />He's useless.
175635 177930 Ladies, it's the last day, you know?
178596 179559 We did it, huh?
179639 181141 We got you through high school.
181224 183226 Can't we just graduate,<br />head off to college,
183310 185896 you know,<br />celebrate this wonderful achievement?
185979 188360 Let's get through the day<br />without anything horrible happening.
188440 191123 Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?<br />Not subtle. We will persist!
192485 194404 Nick's like the great equalizer.
195488 199576 Delegates from every group of girls<br />are casting their ballots for his penis.
199910 201578 Oh, Triple A takes the lead.
202162 203580 Don't call her that.
203663 205040 Everybody calls her that.
205123 207485 She gave roadside assistance<br />to three senior guys last year.
207793 209711 You hear them<br />getting degrading nicknames?
209795 211421 They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."
211755 214382 That's not derogatory,<br />it's a factual description.
214883 216927 - 7:20.<br />- Under eight minutes?
217010 218470 You're joking!
218553 220388 Oh, my God. 9:43.
220472 222390 What am I gonna do<br />without you girls next year?
222474 224271 Nobody around here<br />even attempts the Thursday.
224351 227104 Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype<br />the puzzle every single week,
227187 228859 - so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i><br />- Yep.
228939 231069 You know what?<br />Why don't I just give you two my number?
231149 234194 That way, you guys can call or text me<br />if you need anything.
234611 236864 - Yeah! That would make our lives.<br />- Yeah. Cool.
236947 238156 - We'd love that.<br />- Definitely.
238240 240408 - I'll give you mine after.<br />- I'll share the contact.
240492 241621 - I can give...<br />- I'll share it.
241701 244579 Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were<br />no cell phones allowed in class.
244662 247165 - Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?<br />- Hey.
247665 248750 A dollar in the swear jar.
248834 251586 I'm so sorry.<br />These shorts, they don't have pockets.
251669 254506 - Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!<br />- Triple A!
254589 255552 Oh, my God.
255632 258138 - No spatial awareness at this school.<br />- People just really don't.
258218 259469 - Hey, Amy?<br />- It's her!
259970 260804 Yeah?
260888 262890 Did you just score<br />your teacher's phone number?
263348 264311 Yeah.
264391 265558 Nice.
268937 270105 Hey, Miss Fine?
270188 271815 You should come party with us tonight.
271899 275110 Did you just ask Miss Fine<br />if she wants to party with you?
275193 277490 You think she wants to watch you<br />get drunk and break things?
277570 280615 Hold on. I was having a conversation<br />with her. You're not part of this.
280698 281661 - I'm...<br />- Sit down, Theo.
281741 283994 Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine?
284369 286413 Just a last day present<br />for my favorite teach.
286496 289291 - Jared, you are not my student.<br />- I've heard great things.
289374 292627 And, hey, everybody else<br />got their graduation gifts, right?
292920 293882 Come on.
293962 296089 Jare Bear coming at you<br />from all angles, right?
296173 297344 Nobody asked for that.
297424 300468 Big me, littler me,<br />little baby Jared at the bottom.
300552 302720 Baby Jared says,<br />"Happy graduation, everybody!"
302804 305974 Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt<br />with your face on it, Jared.
306058 307725 Like, not even ironically.
307809 310103 Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause...
310187 311479 Jared, just go.
311563 313815 I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.<br />See you, Molly.
314316 315984 - Bye, Molly.<br />- I'll see ya.
316068 317155 Bye, Molly.
317235 319863 - Why does he always do that?<br />- Fair townspeople!
319947 321448 Fair townspeople?
322074 323533 Fair townspeople, I swear to God!
323616 326369 - What?<br />- Mark thy calendars
326453 330457 and make thy plans to attend<br />the drama department's summer program,
330790 333210 Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.
334252 338381 We will be performing the Bard's comedies<br />as modern tragedies
338465 340508 outside Whole Foods across town.
340592 341930 Well, it's actually funny. It's...
342010 343803 It's what we did in my summer program
343887 345889 - last year in...<br />- Barcelona,
345973 347765 when I lived in Barcelona.
347849 349351 I will be directing,
349809 351269 and Alan...
351895 354356 may be starring, pending auditions.
354856 356524 I don't audition.
357150 358610 I'm offer only.
359319 362239 This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...<br />I'm not gonna be here.
362572 364324 Yeah, Amy's spending the summer<br />in Botswana,
364407 365951 helping women make their own tampons.
366034 367035 That's...
367327 368161 gross.
368245 370956 Well, blood attracts lions.<br />I'm saving lives.
371039 374751 Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.<br />I, too, have a fear of big cats.
374834 378588 And I can't because I'm working<br />all summer, and also, I don't want to.
378671 379589 You are a philistine.
379672 381716 Why would you do theater<br />when you could do debate?
381799 384261 Because some of us<br />enjoy working with others.
384344 385887 And some of us know how to win.
385971 387680 Nobody's winning in that outfit.
387764 389561 Sit down, y'all.<br />We got work to do.
389641 391434 So, Molly...
391518 393148 - Why don't you start us off?<br />- Thank you.
393228 394104 Kill it.
394187 396814 All right, well, as you might recall<br />from my analysis yesterday,
396898 398611 - we were talking about...<br />- It's our last day!
398691 400572 - Let us live! God!<br />- ...submitting to authority...
400652 401778 You've gotta open...
401861 404739 You've gotta open your mouth<br />a little bit more, all right?
404822 406661 - Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.<br />- Okay, chips!
406741 408580 - All right, this is it.<br />- I gotcha. Ready?
408660 410873 - Dude, how am I supposed to get there?<br />- That was my bad.
410954 411997 - Nick?<br />- You're wild.
412080 413876 - Nick.<br />- Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.
413957 416046 Nick, there's some student government<br />stuff to go over.
416126 417339 Come on, man, aim for my mouth!
417419 419757 We have to go over the end of year budget,<br />so if you could...
419837 422632 Yeah, just, we're playin' this game<br />where I've gotta catch it with...
422715 424804 It's complicated.<br />I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.
424884 426261 I'm sure it's complicated.
427262 431308 I cannot believe I lasted an entire year<br />with Nick as my vice president.
431683 434186 He's allergic to work.<br />All he wants to do is goof off.
434269 435270 It's infuriating.
447991 449242 Go talk to Ryan.
450202 451369 What? No.
452454 454872 Cool, cool, 'cause I'm...<br />I'm gonna go talk to Ryan.
454956 457000 - 'Cause I have so much to say...<br />- No, no, no.
461088 462255 - Yeah?<br />- Fine.
462464 464091 Just... I'm going.
464257 465842 - Just gonna...<br />- There she goes.
478563 480360 - Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.<br />- Oh, dude.
480440 481274 Amy.
481358 482900 - It's all good.<br />- Here you go.
482984 484152 Sharp elbows.
484236 486154 Not as sharp as your... chin.
486613 487614 What?
487989 490325 So isn't it crazy<br />that it's... it's the last day?
490408 492410 I know, dude. I can barely believe it.
492494 494121 Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?
494204 496206 His aunt went on a cruise ship<br />that broke down,
496289 498041 so Nick's gonna throw a party<br />at her house.
498125 499542 That's... that's awesome.
500043 501169 It's... it's all right.
501253 503921 They're, you know, they're stuck<br />on a boat shitting in buckets.
504005 505465 Oh, that's not really what I meant.
506007 507384 Oh, Jesus.
507467 509269 - Come on, Tanner.<br />- All right, well...
509802 511471 All right, I'll see you later.
511846 512889 I'll just,
513473 514724 Fuck. Fuck, fuck.
514807 516479 - What are you doing? Go back.<br />- Fuck, fuck.
516559 518148 No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.
518228 519812 I don't even know if she's into girls.
519896 521314 She wore a polo shirt to prom.
521398 523775 Well, that's just her gender performance.
523858 525530 It's different from<br />her sexual orientation.
525610 526986 I'm sorry, but I don't get it.
527070 530782 - Well, gender is a construct of...<br />- No. Thank you. That much I understand.
530865 533076 It's just... it's a little bit shocking
533160 534827 that... that you're into Ryan.
535245 537914 First crush, the little white cat<br />from <i>The Aristocats.</i>
537997 539624 You go from that to Avril Lavigne.
539707 541793 It just... it's not...<br />it's not what I anticipated.
541876 543378 I just like that she's...
544254 547090 always in a good mood,<br />and she's got a really cute smile.
547590 550302 She just seems like<br />she'd be a really fun person
550385 552304 to have sleepovers and lie around with.
552387 555807 Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person<br />to have sleepovers and lie around with.
555890 556974 It's literally all we do.
557058 559186 Well, with her, there'd be more...
560728 561854 vagina involved.
562355 563356 That's fair.
563606 565233 She said Nick's having a party tonight.
565317 568361 Of course he would.<br />He's so fucking stupid.
568445 571323 Somebody always gets arrested<br />the night before graduation.
573074 576119 Amy, do you know how many girls<br />are gonna be up your vagina
576203 577457 at Columbia next year?
577537 579581 Are you aware of it?<br />'Cause I'm aware of it.
579664 583168 Every time I come to visit you, you're<br />just gonna be scissoring a different girl.
583251 584336 Dude?
584419 585712 Scissoring is not a thing.
585795 588423 - Don't knock it until you've tried it.<br />- It's not a thing.
588506 591669 - I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.<br />- Don't knock it until you've tried it.
598683 600143 Here comes the one percent.
609236 610862 That car belongs in a museum.
610945 613198 What the fuck, Jared?<br />I said door-to-door.
613281 616493 Museum of death,<br />'cause its smog is killing us all.
617619 619704 - Fuck!<br />- You all right?
619787 622415 They spend every minute together.<br />It's so weird.
622499 624083 We spend every minute together.
624167 625084 We are equals.
625168 627545 Gigi just keeps Jared around<br />for when she needs a liver.
627629 629884 - No, please don't get on my car.<br />- I'm fucking spent, Jared!
629964 631844 - At least take the heels off.<br />- I'm fucking spent!
631924 634264 - I just got it back from the shop.<br />- Okay! I'm napping.
634344 638139 Do you think it's true that his dad got<br />him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?
638223 640642 It's too weird of a story to be made up.
640725 642394 There's so many specifics.
642477 644812 He sprained his ankle,<br />she had a hearing aid.
644896 646022 What up, <i>chicas?</i>
646105 647357 It's intolerable.
647440 648528 You guys... you guys hungry?
648608 650902 I got... I got some soup dumps.
650985 652695 Keep it down out there!
652779 654742 They're probably soggy now,<br />but they're great cold!
654822 655785 - Good Lord.<br />- S'all right.
655865 657995 I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.<br />Watch my stuff.
658075 660995 Until all of us can pee without genitals,<br />none of us can.
661746 663623 These motherfuckers.
664374 665375 "Your ugly" what?
666167 667835 How did you graduate sixth grade?
667919 669546 It's shocking to me.
669629 671798 So, okay, so, I win.
671881 674008 - Marry the sex doll, okay?<br />- Right.
674091 675763 - Fuck the soccer ball.<br />- Yep.
675843 677178 And then, kill Molly.
677262 678930 Dude, no!
679013 680139 There's no other way, dude.
680223 682016 Like, I can't fuck her,<br />you know, 'cause...
682099 684143 when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.
684227 686396 And then, like, I can't marry her,<br />'cause, well,
686479 688606 I don't believe in the institution.
688690 690358 So I have to kill Molly.
690442 692569 And I know it'll haunt me.<br />I'm a peaceful person.
692652 694612 That's very true.
694696 696698 Wait, are you guys talking<br />about Molly Davidson?
696781 697615 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
697699 700618 That girl is so weird.<br />She always acts like she's, like, 40.
700702 703750 I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.<br />Women in their forties know themselves.
703830 706708 Oh, she's cute,<br />you know, yeah, I give her that,
706791 710127 but she'd probably make you quiz her<br />on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.
710211 713673 Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed<br />with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?
713756 715717 That shit's like a filing cabinet<br />down there.
715800 718511 Well, I've got no problem<br />with a filing cabinet.
718595 721556 I would make passionate sex<br />to Molly Davidson.
721639 722682 Really?
722765 725101 Yeah, I'd just put a bag<br />over her personality.
725184 726853 - Yeah.<br />- That's it.
726936 730147 Molly's like a butterface for personality,<br />a butter personality.
730231 731941 Yeah!
733025 734652 - It's so bad.<br />- Yeah.
734736 737364 That's cool, man. What?
738740 739741 Shit.
744662 746831 Oh, please, do not stop on my account.
747790 751168 Do you know what?<br />My vag is stuffed with diplomas.
751669 754213 Soon it's gonna be stuffed<br />with job offers,
754297 757967 and glowing profiles,<br />and commendations from the governor.
758050 761971 So, while you guys<br />were all studying AP hand jobs,
762054 764223 I was kicking ass and busting curves.
764307 766934 And I'm gonna continue to do that<br />at Yale next year.
767018 768019 So...
768811 769774 I like my choices,
769854 772482 and wherever you three are next year,<br />I hope you do, too.
773691 774817 I'm going to Yale, too.
777904 778866 What?
778946 783117 I'm incredible at hand jobs,<br />but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.
784327 785412 No, you didn't.
785495 786746 I got in early.
786829 788205 To Yale?
790458 792835 Oh, um, Tanner,<br />where are you going to school?
793420 795755 I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.
795838 798966 Stanford University?<br />What are you guys talking about? That's...
799050 801761 - No, yes, Stanford.<br />- Stanford University.
801844 803888 Hey, I'm not going to college.
803971 806057 I got recruited to go code for Google.
806140 807892 I mean, it's not Apple,
807975 810227 but the bennies are pretty tight, man,
810311 812355 and it's mid six-figures,<br />so I'm not complainin'.
812439 814110 - That's my boy.<br />- So proud of you. Amazing.
814190 816484 You failed the seventh grade twice.
816818 817819 Rule of threes.
820447 822128 You guys are serious?
822865 826327 Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend<br />like I don't know you next year.
826786 827787 No offense.
829581 831666 This... this isn't possible.
831749 833501 You guys don't even care about school.
834752 835753 No.
836128 838130 We just don't only care about school.
846973 848057 Well, I'm... I'm done.
848140 850062 After... After you. After you, man.
850142 851143 Okay.
852103 854105 Sorry, excuse me.
856357 861070 <i>You've worked harder<br />than everyone who's ever doubted you.</i>
861153 864240 <i>You've worked harder.</i>
864323 865366 <i>...doubted you.</i>
874501 875502 Hey.
875752 877211 You okay?
877294 879380 Nick, where are you going<br />to school next year?
879464 881883 - I thought we weren't supposed to talk...<br />- Just tell me!
881966 883635 Georgetown. Jesus.
885261 888017 - Hope, where are you going next year?<br />- No, I couldn't be less interested
888097 890224 in, like, whatever this is.
890307 892644 Gigi, where the fuck<br />are you going to school next year?
892727 894687 Don't judge me, it was my fifth choice.
895062 896063 Harvard.
917334 919420 Seniors rule!
972682 973843 This is fucked!
974141 975142 Okay.
975560 977186 This is obviously not helping.
977269 981148 We chose. We didn't party<br />because we wanted to focus on school
981232 982734 and get into good colleges.
982817 983780 And it worked.
983860 986028 But the irresponsible people who partied
986112 988364 also got into those colleges,<br />they did both.
988447 989281 So?
989365 990658 So we messed up.
991117 992869 We didn't have to choose. They did both.
992952 994829 We are the only assholes who did one.
994912 997832 Hey, we are not assholes, okay?
997915 998791 Let's just...
998875 1001002 Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,
1001085 1002253 look at the memory box,
1002336 1005632 - celebrate the end...<br />- This is not a time to celebrate.
1006340 1007800 We have to go to a party tonight.
1008509 1010344 - What?<br />- Let's go to Nick's party.
1010427 1012138 No... Are you kidding? No. No way.
1012221 1014766 Amy, we only have one night left
1014849 1016684 to have studied and partied<br />in high school.
1016768 1019562 Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls<br />that missed out.
1019646 1020688 We haven't done anything.
1020772 1022356 We haven't broken any rules.
1022439 1025234 Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.
1025317 1026903 One, we have fake IDs.
1026986 1029947 Fake college IDs,<br />so we can get into their 24-hour library.
1030031 1032867 Name one person whose life<br />was so much better
1032950 1034872 - because they broke a couple of rules.<br />- Picasso.
1034952 1037413 Yes, he broke art rules.<br />Name a person who broke a real one.
1037496 1038706 - Rosa Parks.<br />- Name another.
1038790 1040541 - Susan B. Anthony.<br />- Goddamn it.
1040625 1043628 Amy, I'm so serious.<br />They think that we're robots.
1043711 1047048 They think all we care about is taking<br />a million APs, and getting into Yale,
1047131 1048966 and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,
1049050 1051513 and clerking for a federal judge<br />between junior and senior year
1051594 1054513 before eventually becoming<br />the youngest justice
1054597 1058475 ever nominated<br />to the Supreme Court of the United States.
1061478 1062479 In my case.
1063355 1064356 You get the point.
1064774 1067568 - Nobody knows that we are fun.<br />- We know.
1067652 1068527 They need to know.
1068611 1069445 Who's they?
1069528 1071447 We are not one-dimensional.
1071530 1073532 We are smart and fun.
1074575 1075910 We have to do this.
1075993 1077036 This is crazy.
1077119 1079413 We graduate tomorrow.
1079496 1080957 What if we get in trouble?
1081040 1083042 You know that we are too smart for that.
1083209 1085002 Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.
1085086 1088547 She wanted you to come.<br />You're finally gonna make your moves.
1088923 1090299 No, she's not...
1090382 1092722 You've been out for two years<br />and you've never kissed a girl.
1092802 1094595 I want you to experience this.
1095054 1097598 What will I be doing during that time,<br />you might ask?
1097682 1100810 I'm going to experience<br />a seminal fun anecdote,
1101477 1103980 and we are gonna change<br />our stories forever.
1107566 1109155 We were gonna watch that Ken Burns thing.
1109235 1110945 <i>The Dust Bowl </i>can wait, bitch!
1111320 1113948 What took them four years,<br />we are doing in one night!
1115116 1116325 Oh, Jesus!
1126836 1128045 - No!<br />- No!
1128129 1129421 - No. Not acceptable.<br />- Not okay.
1129505 1130968 Who allowed you to be this beautiful?
1131048 1135261 - Who allowed you to be this beautiful?<br />- Who allowed you to take my breath away?
1135344 1137266 - Call the paramedics, call the police.<br />- Who... No.
1137346 1139909 - 'Cause there has been an emergency.<br />- I can't look right at it.
1141350 1142351 Not today!
1143352 1144645 Grip escape move!
1146397 1148149 Work.
1148232 1149608 Get it? Tushy?
1149692 1150777 Hand sanitizer.
1150860 1151861 ChapStick.
1151944 1153070 College IDs.
1153154 1156282 Now, mace. Listen, it is very important<br />that you keep the safety...
1157616 1159160 - Amy!<br />- The safety's not on!
1159243 1160703 Don't touch your eyes!
1160787 1162747 You have the same parts she does.
1162830 1165582 You just take what you do to yourself,<br />flip it upside down.
1165666 1167459 Well, I don't... I don't really...
1167543 1169754 Just a down, but a flip.
1169837 1171255 - I don't...<br />- A down flip.
1171338 1173674 Well... what if I don't use my hands?
1173758 1176385 You can make yourself come<br />using only your mind?
1176468 1178387 - No.<br />- That's the one thing my mind can't do.
1178470 1181933 No! Well, I use just... other stuff.
1183100 1184310 - A book?<br />- No.
1184393 1186478 Very Freudian,<br />but I'd worry about paper cuts.
1186562 1188647 No. Can we just stop talking about this?
1188731 1191192 - That little elephant?<br />- No! Stop!
1191275 1192819 That weird crochet pig?
1192902 1194406 My grandma gave me that<br />before she died!
1194486 1196158 If you don't tell me what it is,<br />you know...
1196238 1198157 It's the panda! It's the panda, okay?
1198240 1200409 The panda. Whatever. Just...
1201493 1202995 Can we just stop talking about this?
1203079 1205497 Please, for the love of all things.
1205832 1206873 Quick question.
1207499 1208835 Just a quick Q.
1208918 1210377 What happened to her eye?
1212088 1214423 That fell off way before<br />anything happened between us.
1214506 1216675 Does she talk dirty to you?
1217343 1219846 - Tell you about how she's endangered?<br />- No!
1220554 1222556 - Stop!<br />- Do pandas roar?
1222639 1225392 - Stop!<br />- You sneaky little bitch.
1225476 1227311 I can't believe you didn't tell me
1227394 1229939 that you have been mounting<br />that tragic panda
1230022 1231648 every single night!
1231732 1233529 - Yeah.<br />- This is... Honestly, it's exhilarating.
1233609 1235444 I thought I knew everything about you.
1235527 1238781 I think it's healthy for a relationship<br />to have secrets, and now we have one.
1239365 1241450 Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.
1241533 1242534 Yeah.
1242785 1245079 I once tried to masturbate...
1245412 1247414 with an electric toothbrush.
1248207 1250376 But I got a horrible UTI.
1250960 1251878 Horrible.
1251961 1252962 Like...
1253462 1254463 horrible.
1254755 1259176 I wish that would have been a secret,<br />but you've mentioned it many, many times.
1261678 1262679 Hey. Hey!
1263222 1264681 I need you to do the talking.
1265182 1267393 Why don't you just tell them<br />we're going to a party?
1267601 1270479 Because they'll ask too many questions.<br />They'll try to call Nick's aunt.
1270562 1273065 I've never lied to my parents before.
1273149 1275567 You know when I lie,<br />I just add too many details.
1276068 1279864 Just make up a story, but don't say<br />we're having a date night or anything.
1279947 1282199 Why? It's funny<br />your parents think we're boning.
1282283 1283492 No, it's not,
1283575 1286412 because you're not the one<br />who has to deal with their creepy smiles
1286495 1288455 when I tell them<br />I'm meeting you at the library,
1288539 1290875 when I'm actually<br />meeting you at the library.
1290958 1293669 Honestly, it's surprising<br />that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,
1293752 1295212 considering their whole Jesus thing.
1295296 1296172 It's nice.
1296255 1297924 - Charmaine, get to the safe room.<br />- Hey!
1298007 1299553 - We're bein' robbed by supermodels.<br />- Hi!
1299633 1301969 You girls look fabulous.
1302053 1304055 ...- And smart, and also brave.
1304138 1305347 - Thank you.<br />- Yeah, thanks.
1305431 1306435 Are you guys cold?
1306515 1307558 - Oh, no.<br />- A little nippy.
1307641 1309810 I'll start a fire,<br />or I'll turn up the heat.
1309894 1312021 Just get the jackets off.<br />Dinner's about ready.
1312104 1313567 - Oh, you've gotta taste this.<br />- Well...
1313647 1315983 - Yeah.<br />- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."
1317234 1318280 - Sure.<br />- Don't engage them.
1318360 1319946 Oh, right, right, okay.
1320029 1321530 Char-Char, Dougsicles,
1322073 1325576 would it be okay<br />if Amy stayed over at my house tonight?
1328537 1331623 - The... the night before graduation?<br />- Yeah.
1331707 1334210 You know, my mom can drive us<br />to the ceremony.
1334293 1338172 We just want as much time together<br />as we can before she leaves for Africa.
1338630 1339631 We made...
1340549 1341675 mushroom cap and gowns.
1341758 1344553 - Yeah...<br />- We made special names for all this stuff.
1344636 1347139 - Great deal of care was taken.<br />- Well...
1347223 1348891 Every... I mean, look...
1349350 1351227 Chips and sal-so long, high school.
1351310 1352982 You know, cheese and...
1353062 1357108 sala-me being your dad<br />was the greatest honor of my life.
1357566 1359151 You know, e-everything has a name.
1359235 1361820 - O-love my baby girl. That's olives.<br />- Yeah.
1361904 1363784 - Doug.<br />- Do you know what? We get it.
1363864 1365199 - But...<br />- We get it.
1365824 1367288 - Yes, yes, yes.<br />- We understand, okay?
1367368 1369203 - What you two have...<br />- We do. I'm sorry.
1369286 1372789 - What they have is very, very special.<br />- I'm sorry.
1372873 1374041 Yeah.
1374125 1375834 It really is.
1376210 1379338 It is. You know, they say<br />you never forget your first...
1379421 1380422 Friend.
1380965 1383259 - Special friend.<br />- Normal friend.
1383342 1385761 - Yeah, my special friend.<br />- Yeah.
1385844 1388597 I'm just so thankful<br />we get to spend the whole night together
1388680 1390807 to really show each other
1390891 1393394 how much we care about each other.-
1393477 1395104 - That's great.<br />- My girl.
1395187 1397523 We'll probably just do<br />a Korean face mask.
1397606 1399400 Well, I don't need to know all the words.
1400442 1401902 - Okay.<br />- Go, go, go!
1407366 1408909 That's it!

1446613 1448407 outside of academic activities.
1448490 1451160 They probably think we're calling<br />about school stuff.
1451743 1452578 You're right.
1452661 1453912 Can we just call a Lyft?
1454205 1456123 We still don't know where we're going.

1555139 1557311 Jared, it's fine.<br />Isn't she your girlfriend or something?
1557391 1558934 What? No, she's...
1560060 1562521 No girlfriend for me. I can't pick faves.
1562604 1565649 Too many ladies wanna lock this down,<br />and they don't have the code.
1565732 1566775 Two-eight-three-one.
1566983 1569069 Well, that's my PIN number.
1569153 1570028 But...
1570112 1572489 Sorry, I'll just... What's up, Gig?
1572573 1574408 <i>Jared, where the fuck did you go?</i>
1574491 1576993 <i>I left my tin of special things<br />in your car and I need it!</i>
1577077 1578745 Okay, all right. Jeez, Louise!
1579330 1582791 Do I wanna know<br />what a tin of special things is?
1586086 1588004 Oh, my God. This is drugs.
1588547 1589840 - What?<br />- What?
1589923 1593677 Hey, Jare.<br />Jared, we're just gonna hop out here.
1593760 1595137 - Wait, what? Why?<br />- No.
1595221 1597181 - She's kidding.<br />- No, I'm not.
1597264 1598974 Our... Our friend, she just texted us.
1599057 1601602 And she said she... she...<br />she hit a possum with her car.
1601685 1604062 - No! You know what kind of possum?<br />- Yeah. It's bad.
1604146 1607274 But the possum didn't die.<br />Its adrenaline and... and rage
1607358 1610239 - just made it start chasing her...<br />- We are not hopping off. Keep driving.
1610319 1613325 What about the po... Is she gonna be okay?<br />Wanna text her and see if she's okay?
1613405 1615577 Enough about the possum!<br />Jared, you took Spanish, right?
1615657 1617284 <i>Sí, sí, mi bonita mujer.</i>
1617408 1618575 Speak Chinese.
1618659 1619951 It's gonna be fine. Trust me.
1620036 1621411 Don't patronize me.
1621496 1624790 What if Gigi takes it and dies<br />and our prints are on the tin?
1624874 1626333 Chain of custody!
1626377 1627418 I'm not gettin' any of it.
1627502 1629419 Criminally negligent homicide!
1629504 1632422 Our prints aren't on the powder.<br />We could pour it out the window!
1637095 1639306 Came in a little hot there. That's my bad.
1639390 1641808 - But we are here.<br />- What do we do? What do we do?
1641892 1644311 - Don't move, don't inhale.<br />- All right.
1645729 1646772 Oh, shit.
1646855 1649275 There are drugs in my orifices.
1649358 1650192 Drugs.
1650276 1651277 Oh, no, that's...
1651485 1653320 It's not drugs.<br />That's just Gigi's vitamins.
1654696 1655531 Her... her what?
1655614 1659075 Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12. Gigi<br />likes to crush them up and snort them.
1659159 1661923 She says they work better that way.<br />We'll get you cleaned up on board.
1662746 1664581 What? What do you mean, "on board"?
1664998 1667918 Okay, now, you guys said<br />you wanted to go to the best party.
1668001 1670962 So... I brought you to the best party.
1671046 1672130 Which is my party!
1672714 1674341 Prepare to get bashed!
1675926 1677428 Not... Not in, like, a violent way.
1677511 1680096 Completely consensual bashing.<br />I don't know if that was clear.
1680180 1681685 "Prepared to get consensually bashed."
1681765 1683475 I'll have 'em change it.<br />What do you think?
1683559 1685436 You're serious, Jared? This is your party?
1685519 1688146 You don't wanna go<br />to Nick's lame house party. You don't.
1688230 1689856 A boat is international waters, right?
1689940 1692526 Maritime law.<br />Just come check it out for a little bit.
1692609 1693652 It's sick.
1693735 1696572 The catering company said it's<br />the coolest party they've ever been to.
1696655 1698073 And I'll tell you somethin'.
1698907 1700826 They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.
1702286 1704288 - Up to you.<br />- What are we thinking?
1704871 1706873 We still don't have Nick's address.
1707207 1709460 Someone on board might know where it is.
1710043 1712796 And I'd like to meet someone<br />who met Sasha.
1713339 1715341 Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.
1715424 1716425 Yeah?
1716508 1717509 Let's go.
1717968 1718969 You guys excited?
1723056 1724099 Welcome to the club!
1724182 1725434 Oh, no.
1725517 1727561 Cool, huh? We're on a boat.<br />What's up with that?
1727853 1729271 There is not a soul here, Ames.
1729355 1730230 Ice tiger.
1730314 1732190 This is insane. You made gift bags?
1732983 1734735 There is an iPad in here.
1734818 1738405 Preloaded with photos of all of our best<br />high school memories, class of 2019.
1738489 1739865 Say what? Champagne?
1739948 1742200 There's a masseuse in the back,<br />male or female.
1742284 1744328 Gambling behind the bar. Do you guys tan?
1745704 1747498 I'm so happy you guys are here.
1748832 1751209 - I knew you guys partied. Didn't I?<br />- You did, she said it.
1751293 1752961 I told him. "Those guys seem quiet",
1753044 1755759 but they're probably spending<br />every weekend at, like, a sex dungeon."
1755839 1758467 - No.<br />- Here, try one of these strawberries.
1758550 1759551 Okay.
1759843 1760761 No.
1760844 1762679 No, no, no...
1768644 1770228 - Not bad.<br />- That's pretty good.
1770312 1771313 Wait.
1778654 1780489 Oh, God, you taste like my vitamins.
1780572 1782533 I think I'm in love with you.
1782616 1783659 I don't think you are.
1783742 1785411 - You're coming with me.<br />- What?
1785494 1787704 Dance party upstairs!
1787788 1789373 Yeah!
1789456 1790874 <i>- </i>No, wait!<br /><i>- </i>Yes, yes, yes!
1790957 1793209 Amy? Amy? Amy? Ame, we're not...
1793293 1795754 Look what I found... with your name on it.
1795837 1796963 Come on, too cool.
1797047 1798799 How do you feel, huh? You look stoked.
1798882 1800509 - Chicken spring roll?<br />- No, thank you.
1801677 1802761 Oh, you...
1804555 1805556 You want?
1805931 1807349 Oh, no thank you.
1807433 1808850 Not a drug person.
1808934 1811687 Not even pot?<br />I feel like it could help you relax.
1811853 1814230 <i>- </i>Nope. Doesn't work for me.<br /><i>- </i>Huh.
1814314 1816316 DJ Rod!
1816400 1818569 What the fuck?
1820362 1822238 Jared... stop.
1822823 1824741 Jared, wrap...
1824825 1827369 Take the helmet off! Take the helmet off!
1830664 1833417 This isn't working.<br />You can't buy people's affection.
1838171 1841341 No, I'm pretty sure you can.
1841425 1844511 'Cause I've seen it a lot.<br />My parents did it.
1845429 1847643 - Their parents did it.<br />- Just stop trying so hard, okay?
1847723 1849182 People sense it, it turns them off.
1849265 1850350 But you try hard.
1851560 1853843 You try hard and everything.<br />That's what I like about you.
1855981 1857899 - I didn't mean it like...<br />- I'm just gonna...
1857983 1859693 - I meant more like...<br />- I'm gonna go.
1859776 1861987 - Lamb meatball?<br />- Motherfucker! You're everywhere!
1862070 1865907 One time I ate a legal pot brownie<br />when Model UN went to Amsterdam.
1866700 1868789 And as soon as I got high,<br />I just cried about the fact
1868869 1870954 that one day my mom will die, so...
1871037 1872998 - I had the exact same thing.<br />- Really?
1873081 1875751 I lost my virginity<br />in what I thought was a park, but...
1875834 1879087 it turned out to be a graveyard, and now<br />the ghost spirits live inside my eggs
1879170 1880464 waiting to be reborn.
1880547 1881632 That's not at all the same.
1881715 1883174 I always felt like we were similar.
1883258 1884430 God, I'm gonna miss you.
1884510 1885844 Hey. You can't smoke up here.
1885927 1887220 ...- What'd you say to her?
1887303 1889389 I said it to you, you can't smoke.-
1889473 1891683 You do not speak to her that way.
1891767 1893602 Is... Is the her me? 'Cause I'm fine.
1893685 1895937 That is my best friend<br />in the fucking world!
1896021 1898982 - We're not, she's not...<br />- We'll fucking fight you to the death!
1900275 1901610 Okay, I'm calling security.
1901693 1904988 - Amy, we need to get the fuck outta here...<br />- Oh, my God!
1905071 1907658 Light 'em up, Luanne! It's go time!-
1908283 1910911 There's only one thing left to do. Jump.
1910994 1912954 - No! Off the boat?<br />- Wait, what? No! No!
1913038 1914079 - No, seriously...<br />- You...
1914540 1917083 - What are you guys doin' up here?<br />- Swan dive into the future!
1917167 1918418 Grip escape move!
1918502 1920128 No, no, no!
1920211 1922380 Gege? Gege?
1922464 1923840 Holy fuck!
1923924 1925133 Gege, are you okay?
1925216 1927511 - She's okay. Bail, bail, bail, bail!<br />- Just bail.
1931932 1932933 Jesus!
1934350 1935561 Oh, my God!
1935644 1937688 I am so sweaty!
1937771 1939565 Oh, my God!
1939856 1942058 We need to figure something out<br />before we get to Nick's.
1942609 1944570 - You still want to go to Nick's?<br />- You don't?
1945028 1946988 Well, dude, we went to a party.
1947447 1948740 We did it. Let's go home.
1952410 1954370 - Amy...<br />- Don't do your lecture voice.
1954454 1956247 That was not a party.
1956331 1958166 Well, it definitely was a party.
1958249 1959835 That was a detour.
1959918 1962504 We are A-plus people,
1962588 1964673 and we are going to an A-plus party.
1964756 1965757 Like this.
1970762 1972305 Oh, my God, Alan responded.
1972388 1974641 We have the address!<br />Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.
1974975 1976392 Oh, my score is...
1976810 1977728 My score is very low.
1977811 1979941 I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.<br />You should call.
1980021 1981022 I'm gonna go home.
1981147 1984484 But if you wanna go to Nick's,<br />you should really go. Seriously, go.
1986194 1987195 Malala.
1992158 1994285 - I'm calling Malala.<br />- Wow.
1994369 1997581 You know you only get,<br />like, one Malala a year?
1997664 1998874 Yeah, I'm calling it.
1999374 2002460 Full support, no questions asked,<br />you are coming with me.
2006632 2007633 Malala.
2008466 2009467 All right.
2010636 2011637 Malala.
2017392 2020103 Okay. Jordan?
2020186 2021730 Yeah, and you're Am...
2024775 2026401 Shit.
2034242 2035243 You know, I-I,
2035326 2038580 this job's a good way to supplement<br />the, the old income.
2039122 2041249 You know, teachers' salaries today<br />and all, so...
2041332 2043376 - It's terrible.<br />- Yeah, it's a disgrace.
2043459 2045629 Meet new people<br />and see new parts of the city,
2045712 2046922 and run into old friends.
2048173 2050592 - Friends?<br />- Plus, I'm writin' a book now.
2051593 2053348 - Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.<br />- Cool.
2053428 2057683 Nothing more exciting or daunting<br />than the blank page, you know?
2057766 2059893 One book I'm thinkin' about doin'<br />is a book of quotes.
2059976 2063605 Nothing more daunting or exciting<br />than the blank page.
2063897 2066942 But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'<br />about doin' a detective novel.
2067025 2068985 Actually, you know what?<br />You two will love...
2069235 2072238 Amy, you'll love this.<br />It's a, a female detective.
2072322 2073657 - Oh, really?<br />- A lady detective.
2073740 2075221 - Yeah, how about that?<br />- Interesting.
2075450 2078036 Yeah, she's, And she's pregnant too.<br />Still workin'.
2078119 2081372 And, you know, the baby,<br />whenever she's, like, close to a clue,
2081456 2084500 or, like, one of her hunches is,<br />like, you know, close,
2084584 2085627 the baby kicks,
2085919 2088129 you know, and the harder it kicks,<br />the closer she is.
2088213 2089881 And, that's where I'm at right now.
2089965 2091842 I... I... I don't know what to do<br />once,
2092258 2093885 you know, when she, um, gives birth.
2093969 2095178 But,
2095261 2097973 Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!
2098348 2099474 Choose a lane!
2100391 2101226 That was nuts.
2101309 2103189 Don't know what that was.
2103269 2104270 Oh, this town.
2104813 2107065 The angry people in this town...
2109651 2110652 Yeah.
2116491 2117370 Want some music maybe?
2117450 2118785 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
2118869 2119870 Genius.
2123581 2125834 Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.
2125917 2128044 It's fine.<br />Everybody shows up to parties late.
2128128 2130171 It's like, it's cooler to be late.
2130255 2131965 We're gonna arrive right at the crest.
2132048 2133967 Before you know it,<br />you'll be neck deep in Ryan.
2134259 2136386 Neck deep in what direction?
2136469 2139931 - You tell me.<br />- I don't know. I don't know anything.
2140015 2142934 This is like your nightmare about<br />having to land a commercial airliner,
2143018 2144811 but much, much worse.
2146021 2148815 I mean, is it? Is it worse?
2148899 2149983 Well, yeah.
2150066 2151654 I had the lives of 100 people<br />in my hands.
2151735 2153779 My crew was counting on me.<br />I was their Sully.
2153862 2156698 - I'm really stressed about it.<br />- I-m... Okay, I know you are.
2156782 2158199 If only there was just...
2159242 2161244 a video of people hookin' up.
2163204 2165081 Sorry, are you talking about porn?
2165165 2166249 - All I'm saying...<br />- No.
2166332 2169878 No one would know<br />if you watched one porn one time.
2170545 2171880 Think of it as a documentary.
2171963 2174549 Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.
2174632 2177302 All of those women<br />are European trafficking victims.
2177385 2179975 Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging<br />other people's sexual preferences?
2180055 2183058 - 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.<br />- "Fuck a panda..." So fucking funny!
2183141 2186561 Are you about to say you're gonna judge me<br />for dabbling in pornography?
2186644 2189689 - Thought you were a sex-positive feminist.<br />- Are you insane?
2190231 2192483 Principal Brown is right there.
2192567 2194736 - I have headphones.<br />- He's four feet away from us.
2194820 2196696 I have headphones, madam.
2198114 2201159 All right, but once we get a sense<br />of the mechanics,
2201242 2204746 - I am shutting it off real quick.<br />- Of course.
2206497 2207958 It's for educational purposes.
2208041 2210752 Educational purposes.
2218927 2220636 Plug in. Your phone's gonna die.
2225809 2227268 Principal Brown?-
2227352 2228728 Principal Brown was my dad.
2229187 2230331 Just call me Jordan.
2231314 2232816 No, thank you. Principal Brown?
2232899 2233862 - Yes.<br />- I'm so...
2233942 2235526 Do you have a phone charger?
2235610 2237153 No, I don't.-
2237237 2238279 Got like 13.
2238363 2240281 Yeah, here. Here you go. Catch.
2242742 2244619 Didn't know you could do that<br />from that angle.
2246162 2247705 Oh, wait, what did I miss?
2248081 2249585 - Go back, actually.<br />- Yeah, scroll back.
2249665 2251793 - The part... Wait, start right there.<br />- Oh, there.
2253003 2255801 If you guys want to listen to your music,<br />I can just plug it in up here.
2255881 2257883 - No! No! No!<br />- No! No!
2257966 2259425 No, fuck!
2259509 2262178 <i>That's fuckin' hot.</i>
2262262 2264139 <i>Yes!</i>
2265849 2267725 Come on! Come on!
2276067 2277068 Don't touch me.
2279779 2281031 Was that Cardi B?
2284910 2287370 - You... Oh, my God! You are the...<br />- I cannot believe it!
2287453 2289372 - You are the devil!<br />- I'm gonna die!
2289455 2291582 I'm literally gonna physically die!
2291666 2293459 Oh, Jesus Christ.
2295962 2296963 Come in.
2298256 2299966 He's dead!
2300050 2301426 What the fuck?
2301509 2302802 He's dead!
2303386 2305221 - Wh... Who's dead?<br />- My husband.
2306306 2307598 He's been killed!
2307682 2310310 Okay, Alan, you don't have<br />to do your entrance
2310393 2313104 every time somebody arrives, okay?
2314940 2317150 - What are you guys doing here?<br />- What is going on?
2317233 2319444 It's a murder mystery party.
2320236 2323239 - I've been planning it for months.<br />- Wait, this is your house? Alan?
2323573 2327285 Alan, I was so clear in my text<br />we are looking for Nick's party.
2327368 2330163 My husband, Robert,<br />was an esteemed Broadway director
2330246 2332040 and the love of my life.
2332415 2333959 And he's been killed.
2334500 2336252 Like a dog in the street.
2336336 2339005 - Was he stabbed?<br />- That sounds very tragic.
2339422 2341925 But there's been a mistake.<br />We're looking for Nick's party.
2342008 2344135 Do you have the address? We can't find it.
2344219 2345720 I don't know a Nick.
2346471 2348014 I only know sorrow...
2348890 2350016 and grief.
2350100 2351226 Okay, you're at a ten.
2351309 2352768 I need you at a two.
2355396 2357565 I have a wake to plan.
2357648 2359775 Okay, well, if you guys are here,
2359859 2361822 you might as well take<br />some of the extra characters
2361903 2364239 - since two people decided not to show up.<br />- No...
2364489 2365490 Okay.
2367783 2370165 - Adorable farmer new to the city.<br />- We don't need characters.
2370245 2373789 - We're not staying.<br />- Hideous barren orthodontist.
2373873 2375000 Why am I barren?
2375083 2377293 Am I here to farm<br />or have I given up that life?
2377377 2378753 This just says "orthodontist."
2378836 2381172 - Your backstories are in the packets.<br />- No, no.
2381256 2383633 We are not staying.<br />We're going to Nick's party.
2383716 2385010 - We can just stay for...<br />- No.
2385093 2387553 - The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?<br />- Yes.
2387637 2390723 Yeah, somebody here came from there,<br />I think. Maybe the mayor.
2391641 2393935 Go! Immerse yourselves.
2394019 2396812 Review your histories in the parlor.
2397313 2399694 Okay, if your characters aren't married,<br />hands off each other.
2399774 2400775 No!
2403319 2405030 Do not go gently.
2405113 2406114 Oh, she's really good.
2406822 2408033 Oh, my God! You guys are here.
2408116 2409495 - How'd you get here?<br />- What the fuck?
2409575 2410701 How did you get here?
2410785 2411786 And how are you dry?
2412162 2413579 How are you dry?
2413663 2415331 Aaron, I can see you breathing.
2415790 2417667 Gigi? Dig deeper.
2417750 2419127 - I don't know what...<br />- I don't...
2419210 2420045 She was like...-
2420128 2421171 I can't think about it.
2421504 2423048 Oh, is it over?
2423131 2426842 No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!<br />The house is mine till 11 p.m.
2427135 2429971 Cindy, I swear to fucking God!
2431847 2434809 - Jesus Christ! God.<br />- Gigi! What the fuck?
2434892 2436436 Guys, the re-election is coming up
2436519 2438479 and I need to know<br />if I have to buy your votes.
2438563 2439814 Wait, are you the mayor?
2439897 2441316 Do you know where Nick's party is?
2441399 2443279 Of course I do.<br />I know where all the parties are.
2443359 2444194 Where is it?
2444277 2446237 Come into my office, now.
2446321 2447530 Okay, thank you.
2448031 2450825 In, in, in. Go, go, go.<br />Come, come, come. Now, now, now!
2452618 2453786 Okay.
2454787 2455830 You can't tell anyone.
2456247 2457248 We won't.
2457415 2458458 Not even each other.
2459084 2460085 Okay.
2460626 2462003 Nick's party...
2465923 2466924 is at...
2467883 2468926 his aunt's house.
2469635 2471387 We know it's at his au...
2471471 2474182 Amy, I swear to God,<br />I need to get out of here.
2474265 2476476 By the way, I am pretty impressed
2476559 2478769 with how well you guys<br />are holding it together.
2478853 2480480 You're doing fantastic.
2480813 2482898 What do you mean?
2482982 2485568 I thought the strawberries<br />would have hit by now.
2485651 2487028 Why would strawberries hit?
2487112 2491616 Because they were dipped<br />in an unbelievably potent drug.
2491699 2494660 It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.
2495745 2497288 Asian-huasca.
2498539 2499627 I told you guys that, right?
2499707 2501959 - No, no, no, no, no.<br />- I can't...
2502043 2504754 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2507090 2508299 Pull me back in.
2508966 2510426 Pull me back in.
2513888 2516557 Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.
2516641 2517642 Listen to me.
2518184 2519185 We're gonna be fine.
2519435 2520645 One time I threw up,
2520728 2524107 and my mom caught it in her hands,<br />'cause she loves me.
2524190 2525358 We are healthy,
2525608 2527360 nubile, young women,
2527735 2529695 and we just need to stay calm.
2530113 2531364 We are gonna be...
2551967 2552968 What?
2553261 2554929 What the fuck?
2555680 2558516 What the fuck? What is happening?
2561811 2563479 Why do you look like that?
2563563 2565606 Molly, y... you're a fucking doll.
2565690 2568359 - No, you're a fucking doll.<br />- What?
2569235 2571404 Fuck, that hurt.
2571487 2574157 And my boobs are too heavy.<br />I have no core.
2574240 2575825 Our legs don't bend.
2575908 2577952 They're twice as long as our torsos.
2578035 2580163 These proportions are insane!
2580246 2581497 Where's my chub?
2581581 2583040 Wait, where are you going?
2583583 2585338 - This is crazy.<br />- Wait for me.
2585418 2588838 I have to see for myself.
2588921 2591006 Well, I've never done the splits<br />in my life.
2592007 2593259 Amy!
2594093 2595845 Help! Molly, help me!
2595928 2598097 Oh, my God! Don't look down, Amy, no!
2598181 2599557 I... I can't reach!
2600015 2602017 You have to put my heel in your hole.
2602101 2604437 - My heel...? Your heel in my what?<br />- Your hole!
2604520 2606981 - What hole?<br />- The corn hole!
2607064 2608441 Fuck!
2608816 2609817 Molly!
2612695 2614155 Oh, my God.
2614239 2615990 Um, what the fuck am I wearing?
2617950 2618951 Where's my vag?
2619034 2620453 Molly, I have no genitals.
2620536 2622580 How do I pee? How do I shit?
2622663 2625708 I mean, I don't even have nipples.<br />These are just mounds.
2625916 2627877 My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.
2628294 2629337 Just... just...
2629962 2631631 Perfect, round.
2632047 2633883 - Huge mounds.<br />- What?
2633966 2635926 Look at my body. I am beautiful.
2636010 2637723 No, don't get sucked in.
2637803 2639764 This is our nightmare, Amy.
2639847 2642225 I know this is unrealistic<br />and bad for women,
2642308 2644059 but... is it bad?
2644143 2645686 Because I feel pretty good.
2645770 2647313 I mean, this ass won't quit.
2647397 2649357 Amy, use your brain!
2649440 2653653 I don't need to use my brain.<br />I just need to be smooth and flexible.
2653736 2655613 Look at you, you bad bitch.
2656406 2658741 Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.
2658824 2661035 My, my, my.
2662287 2665581 I think I might, like,<br />actually stay here for a while.
2665665 2668000 No, I won't let you do this.
2668334 2670295 Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!
2670378 2672713 You need to throw up.
2672797 2675716 Let me have this body!
2675800 2678928 Now that the amuse-bouche<br />of bacon-wrapped dates is over,
2679011 2682265 why don't we play a rousing round<br />of <i>J'accuse!</i>
2689897 2691649 Fuck you, George.
2693192 2694777 Who is she supposed to be?
2695861 2697280 The orthodontist.
2699031 2700491 We're okay.
2701158 2702159 We're okay.
2702660 2703786 We did it.
2703869 2706664 We went... we went to two parties,<br />we did drugs.
2707623 2708791 We can say we went out.
2709750 2711544 - Let's go home.<br />- What?
2711627 2713504 No, the plan is to go to Nick's.
2713588 2715590 We have to stick to the plan.
2716757 2719302 Dude, nothing has gone<br />according to plan tonight.
2719385 2721974 Which is why we have to stick to the plan.<br />Let's call another Lyft.
2722054 2723431 Why are you being so pushy?
2723514 2726309 Honestly, pushy is a compliment.<br />You know who else was pushy?
2726392 2728143 Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,
2728227 2730855 - Queen Noor of Jordan...<br />- I know where Queen Noor is from!
2730938 2732982 Once we get to Nick's,<br />all of this will be worth it.
2733065 2735943 Just forget about about Nick's!<br />No one will even tell us where it is.
2736026 2737820 Why are you being so obsessed<br />with his party?
2737903 2740114 - Because she loves him.<br />- Oh, my God.
2740197 2742950 Gigi, stop doing that!
2743033 2744869 - What did you say?<br />- Molly loves Nick.
2744952 2747162 Can you please stop<br />repeating that sentence?
2747246 2748664 Because it's not true.
2748748 2750207 - Molly hates Nick.<br />- Thank you.
2750291 2752960 She projects disgust<br />to cover up a deep desire.
2753043 2755421 No. No. N-O. Thanks.
2755505 2758135 You actually... You drugged us<br />and tried to throw us off a boat.
2758215 2759384 I did. I did.
2759467 2761552 So nothing you say is of any value to us.
2761636 2763513 So... Oh, you're...
2763596 2765100 Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off
2765180 2767141 because you should flip off,<br />so shut the fuck up.
2767224 2770144 Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?
2770227 2771771 George locked himself in the closet.
2771854 2772855 Fuck!
2773022 2774189 Dude.
2774607 2775608 No.
2778569 2779570 Dude?
2780613 2781614 No.
2782573 2783616 I don't like him.
2784700 2786494 Yes, maybe he is...
2787119 2790039 classically, traditionally handsome<br />and weirdly charming,
2790122 2793626 and maybe my innate biology<br />registers him as an ideal mate,
2793709 2797004 and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize<br />about him sweeping me off my feet.
2797087 2800049 And some weaker people<br />might call that a tiny crush,
2800132 2802134 but I can ignore it,<br />I can fight against it,
2802217 2803969 because we all have weird interests.
2804053 2806392 And the important thing is<br />that we just... we shove 'em down
2806472 2808140 and we never speak about them again.
2809559 2811436 You don't have to shove anything down.
2812186 2813354 Yeah.
2813438 2817066 Yeah. Yeah, I do,<br />because I can't like him.
2817149 2820903 Maybe my body can like him<br />but my mind knows that that's stupid,
2820986 2822655 because he's just... he's a jock,
2822738 2824744 and all he cares about<br />is being cool and having fun,
2824824 2827660 and he doesn't even look at girls<br />unless they look like Triple A.
2827743 2830663 And he definitely doesn't want me<br />because I'm a butter personality.
2832122 2835167 How dare you say that<br />about my best friend?
2835250 2836544 Amy, you fucking slapped me...
2836627 2838799 If you ever say anything like that<br />about yourself again,
2838879 2841757 I will fucking lay you out, okay?
2841966 2843759 You are the strongest, coolest,
2843843 2845845 smartest, most stunningly<br />gorgeous creature
2845928 2847972 this high school and this Earth
2848055 2849056 has ever seen.
2849139 2853644 And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky<br />to be a footnote in your story.
2854479 2855688 So we're going to his party.
2855771 2856856 Are you serious?
2856939 2858107 I am dead serious.
2859108 2861527 If Nick's what you want,<br />then that's what you deserve.
2862903 2865990 How? How are we gonna find out<br />where the party is?
2866574 2867950 By doing what we do best.
2868868 2870536 Motherfuckin' homework.
2891682 2893521 <i>- I will now be attempting...</i><br />- Wait. Look.
2893601 2895645 <i>...15 pizza boxes.</i>
2897312 2900525 How many orders that big do you think<br />Lido's could have filled tonight?
2901651 2902735 - Genius.<br />- Yeah.
2929178 2931931 Two half-cheese, half-sausage pizzas
2932222 2935017 are just one cheese and one sausage pizza,
2935309 2936894 you fucking morons.
2936977 2937978 Jesus.
2939188 2940189 Oh, God.
2948698 2951366 - Everybody down! 911! Stay down.<br />- Oh, my God! What the fuck?
2951450 2952910 Fuck! What the fuck is this?
2952993 2955245 - We ask the questions!<br />- Oh, my God.
2955329 2957331 Oh, shit, shit!<br />Is this some Manson family shit?
2957414 2958833 - What is this?<br />- No!
2959249 2961502 No! Everything is gonna be just fine!
2961586 2965089 You're just gonna give us the address to<br />where you delivered some pizzas tonight.
2967341 2970430 Oh, my God. Are you guys out of your<br />fucking mind? How old are you, by the way?
2970511 2972304 Does not matter!
2972387 2974348 Okay, that voice did not<br />make you sound older.
2974431 2976016 So you're basically children,
2976100 2978477 and you just willingly got in the car<br />of a strange man.
2978561 2979937 Do you guys have a weapon?
2980563 2981564 Yes?
2981689 2984316 If we claim to have a weapon,<br />this might be a felony.
2984817 2985651 Fuck.
2985735 2988654 - Yes.<br />- Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask
2988738 2990615 and trying to rob someone with no weapon.
2990698 2991866 'Cause the funny thing is,
2991949 2994284 - I actually have a weapon.<br />- Fuck!
2994368 2996078 - Dear God, no! You have a gun?<br />- Fuck! No!
2996161 2999123 I keep that to protect myself<br />from bad people,
2999206 3000711 something you guys should think about.
3000791 3004294 Did the... did the possibility<br />of sexual assault ever enter your minds?
3005129 3005963 Not really.
3006046 3007757 Yeah, not really, I can tell.
3007840 3010175 You were spendin' more time on,<br />like, the hair
3010259 3012469 and that... that whole part of it,<br />maybe, yeah.
3012553 3015180 'Cause... 'cause we're like...<br />right by the freeway.
3015264 3017975 I could have you across the state line<br />in, like, 40 minutes,
3018058 3020853 take you to some cabin,<br />hog tie your ankles,
3020936 3022855 leave you in a room<br />with, like, a saucer of milk
3022938 3024899 and videotape the whole thing<br />for a couple days.
3024982 3026066 - What?<br />- What?
3026150 3027071 - No.<br />- Think about that.
3027151 3028986 - What?<br />- No, I'm not gonna think about...
3029069 3030696 We just need you to give us the address
3030780 3033157 to where you delivered<br />this huge order tonight.
3034575 3036285 Oh, shit, that p...
3039872 3041666 Okay, you know what?
3042750 3044213 Let me give you the address.
3044293 3045544 I feel like if I don't...
3045628 3047382 ...you guys are so stupid,
3047462 3051300 some dog walker's gonna find<br />your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.
3051383 3053093 Okay.
3053177 3055015 - Don't show me your pass code!<br />- Oh, that's fair!
3055095 3057347 - Okay, sorry.<br />- That's the whole thing with pass codes.
3057431 3058891 I'm just copying the address.
3058974 3061018 That's your private information.
3061101 3063729 - Thank you!<br />- Thank you so much!
3063813 3065105 Oh, my God!
3066440 3067482 Quick Q.
3067566 3070945 Now that we're already in your car,<br />would you mind driving us there?
3072655 3073488 Yeah, why not?
3073572 3075365 - Oh, great!<br />- I'm being sarcastic!
3075449 3076954 Get the fuck out of my car!-
3077034 3078327 - Okay!<br />- Thank you so much!
3078410 3080913 Don't trust people. Oh, my God.
3082289 3084709 Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God!
3084792 3088170 You were incredible! You were so scary.
3088253 3091423 If you were a criminal, you'd be<br />the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.
3092591 3095260 Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.
3098180 3101516 Fuck! I left my phone in his car!
3101600 3103686 Why did I have to use a visual aid?
3103769 3104979 - Wait!<br />- It's okay!
3105062 3108232 Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.<br />It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.
3108983 3111443 I'm at two percent?<br />Why the fuck am I at two percent?
3111526 3113070 Why is my battery so low?
3113612 3116824 The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.
3117241 3118659 Just... Just... Just call a Lyft.
3118743 3120202 No, I can't call a Lyft,
3120285 3123998 because if my phone dies and the driver<br />can't contact us, we are fucked!
3124498 3125624 Unless...
3129461 3131091 - Pick up, pick up.<br />- Who are you calling?
3131171 3133841 Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're<br />at Lido's Pizza on Victory Boulevard.
3133924 3136176 We are stranded.<br />Please pick us up, we need...
3138595 3139596 It died.
3143976 3146190 - We could hitchhike.<br />- Are you aching to be murdered?
3146270 3148480 Well, I'm just throwin' out<br />suggestions here.
3161786 3162912 You girls need a ride?
3166290 3167712 - Shotgun!<br />- I'll take the front!
3167792 3169501 So cool! Just gonna...
3169752 3171090 - Amy, what are you doing?<br />- No, I...
3171170 3173047 My... My legs are, like,<br />half an inch longer...
3173130 3175465 Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.<br />What...
3175549 3177346 - Just let me go!<br />- You're embarrassing me.
3177426 3178973 - Stop...<br />- You're embarrassing me!
3179053 3181638 Thank you so much, Miss Fine.<br />You totally saved us.
3181722 3184474 Please. You two saved me<br />from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
3184558 3186560 I've seen it, like, 50 times.
3186936 3189646 Okay, wait, so what is this address<br />I'm taking you to?
3189730 3191565 It's...<br />it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.
3191648 3193984 It's... It's... It's a party, technically.
3194401 3197362 You two want me to drive you<br />to an unsupervised house party?
3197446 3198989 ...well...
3199073 3202159 Good. I'm glad you guys are having<br />some fun before graduation.
3203577 3204411 Really?
3204494 3208040 Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want<br />you guys to make the same mistake I did.
3208373 3209249 What do you mean?
3209333 3211210 I spent the majority of my 20s
3211293 3214129 overcompensating for the fact<br />that I never had fun in high school.
3214213 3217216 And, you know, the pendulum then swung<br />in a completely different direction.
3217299 3218592 I mean, I went crazy.
3218675 3220970 I had some really dark moments<br />there in my 20s,
3221053 3223263 like, some really dark moments.
3224098 3227059 Like, it was bad.<br />You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?
3227517 3230395 Like, not a single Jamba Juice,<br />like every Jamba Juice.
3230479 3231814 That came down from corporate.
3231897 3234399 Do you know how many Jamba Juices<br />there are in this country?
3234483 3235776 Like, a bajillion.
3235943 3238112 It's a national chain, it's a sensation.
3238195 3240697 I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go<br />ever again.
3240781 3242657 But, look, I don't want that for you.
3242741 3244618 Okay? You still have a chance.
3244701 3247124 I want you two to go to this party,<br />and I want you to have fun.
3247204 3249289 Because tonight is your night.
3249373 3250249 - Yes! Yes!<br />- Yes!
3250332 3251166 Okay.
3251250 3252084 - Yes.<br />- Yes.
3252167 3254837 So, what are you two wearing?
3254920 3256213 We were thinking...
3257923 3259008 Well, just this...
3259091 3260843 this... this, this look.
3260926 3262719 You do know you guys are matching, right?
3262803 3266140 We added this embellishment here.
3266223 3269476 Well, lucky for you two,<br />I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,
3269559 3271937 so I got a lot of shit in this car.
3272021 3274064 Why don't y'all go through<br />some of those bags?
3274148 3275610 I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?
3275690 3277484 Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.
3277567 3279409 - Please get a change of clothes.<br />- This night!
3291790 3292875 - I have no breath.<br />- What?
3292958 3293876 Excuse me?
3293959 3295714 - Sorry, what?<br />- I have nowhere to go with this.
3295794 3297880 - It's too perfect.<br />- You are literally glowing.
3297963 3300424 You've hit the level of perfection<br />and now I'm just...
3300507 3302512 - Be still my heart.<br />- You just came out of the water.
3302592 3304761 You're fresh from the water,<br />you're a mermaid here.
3304845 3306763 How are you so fucking shiny?
3306847 3308682 Can you fetch me an inhaler?<br />I can't breathe.
3308765 3311018 - Um, my eyes.<br />- I'm physically unable...
3311101 3313312 My eyes hurt so bad<br />from your beauty.
3313395 3314900 Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.-
3314980 3317024 - Oh, sorry.<br />- There's a... a party to get to.
3318358 3320903 - All right.<br />- I will see you two inside, all right?
3320986 3322696 Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.
3322779 3324618 - Just kidding.<br />- Imagine if I just went in.
3324698 3325619 That'd be weird, right?
3325699 3327409 That'd be so fun.
3327492 3329703 - Anyway, see y'all later.<br />- Okay, bye.
3340422 3341506 Love you.
3341590 3342591 Love you.
3428843 3430637 Another?
3430720 3432347 Here.
3433390 3434391 You good?
3434808 3435809 Yeah.
3436685 3438062 <i>¡El Presidente!</i>
3438145 3439604 And the protest lady!
3440022 3441898 Welcome, my little turtledoves.
3442274 3443317 How are you?
3443400 3445902 Do you guys want to drink or smoke?<br />Nothing?
3446361 3448155 Let me know, okay? I'm your guy tonight.
3448238 3449864 I'll take care of you. You're the best.
3449948 3451533 You guys honestly freak me out.
3452409 3455120 But I'm gonna miss you guys.<br />Okay? It's all love.
3455829 3459416 Class of '19... for fuckin' ever!
3462836 3463670 Ryan.
3463795 3465464 - Where? Where?<br />- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
3466090 3466965 Oh, God.
3467049 3468845 - She's glowing.<br />- Go get her.
3468925 3469926 Hug me.
3471595 3472724 - Okay. Get her.<br />- Okay.
3472804 3474098 Get her. Flick the bean!
3475057 3477101 Molly, here's to you, gorgeous.
3477184 3478852 - Thank you.<br />- Of course, of course.
3479186 3481855 Tanner, where's the rubbing alcohol?<br />There's nothing strong enough.
3481938 3483107 - No.<br />- Yep.
3483190 3484691 - No.<br />- I'm here.
3484774 3485775 How?
3486026 3487236 I'm gonna go downstairs.
3489613 3490655 Well...
3490739 3491740 Bye, Gigi.
3505337 3508173 - I'm so stoked you're here, dude.<br />- Thanks.
3508882 3510550 I've always wanted you to come out.
3510634 3512136 Oh, I-I am out.
3513262 3515180 I came out in the tenth grade.
3516681 3520435 No. I meant, like, come out<br />and hang out on the weekend.
3522354 3524314 Oh, right, that... Hang out.
3524398 3526983 - Yeah, that's... that's what I meant also.<br />- You know,
3527067 3529903 you need to have a little bit of fun<br />before you go to Africa.
3529986 3531405 You remembered I'm going to Africa?
3531488 3533990 Of course. Aren't you gonna go to,<br />like, Uganda or something?
3534074 3536785 Botswana. They'd kill me in Uganda.
3536868 3537702 Why?
3537786 3540080 'Cause that's country's<br />not really a fan of gay people.
3540539 3542166 Oh, shit, that's crazy.
3542249 3544168 Would you be afraid to go to Uganda...
3544251 3546670 - Karaoke in the guest room!<br />- Jesus!
3546753 3548963 God, I've missed you. Fuck.
3549381 3552301 Do you wanna go do karaoke<br />in the guest room? I love that girl.
3552384 3553218 Yeah.
3553302 3554386 - Come on, let's go.<br />- Okay.
3559599 3561059 Elbows.
3561226 3562852 Oh, fuck. Re-rack, please?
3563228 3564896 Holy shit!
3565272 3566815 Wait, Molly's here?
3566898 3569568 What a fuckin' compliment<br />to get Molly to roll.
3569651 3571361 Dude, are you actually here right now?
3571445 3574364 Is this some mirage?<br />Am I fucking losing my mind?
3574448 3577326 Or did I actually get President Molly<br />to come out on her weekend?
3577409 3579369 It's a purely ceremonial visit.
3579453 3582164 Okay, okay. Hey, why don't you sit here?
3582247 3583707 Yeah, right next to me, please.
3583790 3585334 Sit here and let's go.
3585417 3588503 I've been fuckin' waitin' for this<br />since, like, seventh grade.
3588670 3590088 Please. It's for you.-
3590172 3591631 This song goes out to my cast.
3623247 3624373 Miss Fine.
3625499 3626500 Miss...
3627000 3628710 ...Fine.
3629085 3630212 Señora Fine.
3632339 3634048 You ever made love to a Mexican?
3638220 3639471 Hey, listen, this pong
3639554 3641226 is actually supposed to be my thing.
3641306 3643850 So if you could just tone it down<br />for my sake, my self-esteem...
3643933 3646144 No, I think you just have<br />to step up your game.
3646228 3648647 You just have to rise to my level.
3648730 3651107 - It's not my fault.<br />- To her level.
3651191 3654486 It's crazy we haven't hung out<br />outside of school before, you know.
3654569 3656655 I used to think you were all work<br />and no play, but...
3657614 3658990 you're actually pretty fun.
3660242 3661117 I...
3661201 3662202 I am fun.
3664746 3665747 Okay.
3672837 3673838 Hi, Miss Fine.
3674464 3675465 Hi, Theo.
3716965 3718049 This is amazing.
3718383 3719468 You're amazing.
3720719 3721720 You're 20, right?
3722429 3723430 Yeah.
3727392 3728935 You've got a mic. You've gotta sing.
3729018 3730312 - No.<br />- Please.
3730395 3732647 - No.<br />- Come on. Please?
3733022 3734148 Do it for me. Come on, Amy.
3734232 3735692 For you, okay...
3756045 3758923 You can tell she's not supporting.<br />No breath control. But it's good.
3759007 3761009 - It's on pitch. Yeah.Yeah.<br />- I support you, okay?
3765972 3768850 Oh, my God!
3769601 3770769 Ready?
3770852 3771853 Fuckin'...
3772854 3774773 Oh, God!
3775315 3778109 - Of course.<br />- Nick, you need more...
3778192 3779989 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3780069 3781363 You need more of an arc.
3781821 3783907 Like... no, too much flick. Like.
3783990 3786993 See, well, that's easy for you to say<br />when you're, like, three feet tall.
3787076 3788662 I'm lookin' straight down at it.
3789037 3790079 How tall are you?
3792040 3793041 Well...
3793583 3795043 How tall do you think I am?
3804177 3805845 Five-four?
3807221 3809057 My teammates usually aren't this mean.
3809140 3811102 Oh, no, no, no,<br />they're usually blonde and skinny,
3811184 3813603 - and they don't drink carbs.<br />- No, no way, okay?
3813687 3815063 I fuck with Hufflepuffs.
3816105 3817941 Hu... Hufflepuff, like <i>Harry Potter?</i>
3818024 3819025 Yeah.
3819108 3820944 I mean, what, are you, like a...
3822612 3824406 half-Slytherin, half...
3825365 3826700 Ravenclaw, yep?
3827576 3829619 That is exactly what I am.
3830119 3831287 Yeah, you are.
3834248 3835211 Oh, fuck.
3835291 3838339 Okay, see, I'm gonna go take care of them,<br />make sure they don't kill themselves.
3838420 3839924 - But you stay right here, yeah?<br />- Yeah.
3840004 3842298 Okay, don't move. I'll come back<br />in a moment. Don't move.
3842382 3844551 - I'm not gonna move.<br />- Don't move. Yeah?
3844634 3847971 - I feel like you're gonna move.<br />- No, I'm not... I'm not gonna move.
3848054 3849097 - Don't move.<br />- Okay.
4084123 4086504 Oh, my God, there you are.<br />How's it going? Did you find Ryan?
4086584 4087752 Did you guys go in the pool?
4087836 4089253 - What's going on?<br />- Molly...
4089337 4092010 Things are going so well over here,<br />like really, really, really well.
4092090 4093720 I'm being so mean to him,<br />but it's working.
4093800 4095889 We talked about <i>Harry Potter.</i><br />He knows I'm a Slytherin.
4095969 4097849 - He seems to like it.<br />- I think we should go home.
4097929 4099973 Wait, what? No. Just... just dry off.
4100056 4102183 No, I think we need to leave.<br />Come on, let's go.
4102266 4103810 Are you nuts? No. He...
4103893 4104814 - Nick is fully...<br />- No.
4104894 4106229 He's fully flirting with me.
4106312 4107358 This actually might happen.
4107438 4109027 - Listen to me, this might happen.<br />- No, no.
4109107 4111192 Molly, please, I'm asking you,<br />let's just go, okay?
4111275 4113695 - Ame, just go find Ryan. It'll be great.<br />- Malala!
4115071 4116072 Amy, no.
4118491 4120034 - Are you kidding?<br />- No, I...
4120118 4123955 I've done whatever you wanted all night,<br />and I'm calling Malala, so come with me.
4124038 4127001 No, I'm not leaving just because<br />you're doing the thing that you always do.
4128793 4130211 What is that supposed to mean?
4130294 4131880 Just... You...
4132380 4135466 You talk a big game, and then you give up<br />just when things get uncomfortable.
4135549 4138427 Like you jumped in the pool, and now<br />you're sad that you're wet, like...
4138511 4140391 - That's bullshit, Moll, that's bullshit.<br />- No...
4140471 4142811 If I didn't drag you to do things,<br />you just wouldn't do them.
4142891 4144392 You... you... you don't drag me.
4144475 4147020 You force me to do<br />whatever you want to do.
4147729 4148772 What does that even mean?
4148855 4151941 You decide what we do and when we do it,
4152025 4153612 and then we always<br />have to do it together,
4153693 4154906 - all the time.<br />- I have to decide
4154986 4156696 because you literally decide nothing.
4156780 4158823 Like, I do all the heavy lifting<br />in our friendship.
4158907 4161284 - You never take charge.<br />- I take charge all the time!
4161367 4162827 You never take charge!
4162911 4165914 I always have to push you.<br />Without me, you wouldn't do anything.
4165997 4169500 - I'm going to Africa without you.<br />- Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.
4169583 4171669 I'm not going for the summer.
4172295 4174088 I'm going for the entire year.
4177008 4178009 What?
4180344 4181805 I'm taking a gap year.
4182513 4184473 I deferred Columbia until next fall.
4185391 4186559 When did you decide that?
4186642 4187643 When I applied.
4189645 4192190 In January? You've been lying to me<br />since January?
4192273 4195359 Yeah, because I knew if I told you,<br />you'd bully me into staying.
4195443 4197528 So all our schedules are gonna be off now.
4197611 4198988 We're not gonna graduate together,
4199072 4200827 not gonna go<br />on a post-college trip together,
4200907 4203076 we're not gonna move to DC together,<br />our whole plan...
4203159 4204660 That was your plan!
4204744 4205706 That was never my plan.
4205787 4207705 - It's always your plan!<br />- I can't believe you!
4207789 4209585 You think<br />that going to Africa makes you tough,
4209665 4212046 and you weren't even fucking brave enough<br />to tell me about it!
4212126 4213502 You're a fucking coward, Amy!
4213586 4214879 You're selfish and mean!
4214963 4216005 You're a bad friend!
4216089 4217631 You're a fucking bad friend...
4267015 4268016 What the fuck?
4270393 4271394 I locked that.
4276690 4277984 Well, I guess you didn't.
4279068 4280194 What's wrong with you?
4280653 4281737 Fight with your wife?
4281821 4283656 Can you please just...
4284323 4285286 leave me alone?
4285366 4286742 Why are you even at a party?
4287118 4290246 Shouldn't you be, like, marching<br />in some meaningless protest somewhere,
4290329 4292581 or, I don't know,<br />in your bed doing homework?
4293124 4294208 You don't even know me.
4294292 4296377 - Pretty sure I do.<br />- No.
4296460 4299213 You're just one of those people<br />who claims they're honest,
4299297 4300882 or calling people on their shit,
4300965 4302425 when you're really just mean.
4305469 4306470 Wow.
4308264 4309473 Wow, I take it back.
4314145 4315146 You...
4315604 4316898 are a badass...
4317690 4319358 who takes no prisoners...
4321277 4324655 and cries in the bathroom at parties.
4330328 4331704 Why are you so cruel?
4333164 4334832 I just don't like meek people.
4336667 4337668 And you?
4338794 4341797 You're like Molly's little sidekick bitch.
4341881 4344926 Well, you're just a basic hot girl<br />who's gonna peak in high school.
4374956 4375999 When'd you get here?
4377375 4378376 A while ago.
4379127 4382546 See Amy? She fucking freaked out on me.<br />I don't know what's wrong with her.
4382630 4385133 Do people really think<br />I had sex with a prostitute?
4388094 4389178 You didn't?
4389512 4390513 No.
4391180 4392556 Of course not. I haven't...
4394517 4396144 I haven't slept with anybody.
4400106 4402108 No one in this entire school<br />knows me at all.
4405987 4406820 Except Gigi.
4406904 4409532 I'm a golden starfish!
4411951 4413995 Gigi, the girl who jumped off your boat
4414078 4416497 and gave you a prison tat<br />while you were sleeping?
4416580 4417873 Oh, that wasn't about me.
4419250 4421752 She's a sad person, you know?
4422128 4424255 And yeah, she may be a little nuts, but...
4426007 4428134 she's the most loyal person I've ever met.
4428801 4432346 I mean, she once tried to shiv our mailman<br />because she thought he laughed at me.
4433181 4435474 Turns out, he wasn't...<br />he wasn't laughing at me at all.
4435558 4437185 He was just lookin' at a meme...
4437643 4438644 on his phone.
4438811 4441689 Plus, not everyone's lucky enough<br />to find someone like you and Amy.
4442148 4444650 I'm just doin' my best<br />so I can get out of here and...
4445109 4447695 find some people<br />who are into the same weird shit I'm into.
4449030 4451115 Not like sex stuff.<br />I mean, like, you know...
4452616 4454077 airplanes and musicals.
4454535 4455578 What?
4456704 4458456 I wanna design fuckin' airplanes.
4459165 4462210 Yeah, get rich off that, and then use<br />the cash to produce some new musicals.
4462293 4464382 Enough with the revivals already.<br />It's total bullshit.
4464462 4466339 Audiences deserve something original.
4466547 4467548 I think.
4468591 4469717 I don't know.
4470343 4473721 I should probably go make sure<br />that's not an actual dead man's float.
4477433 4479185 Well, see you at graduation, Molly.
4501707 4502916 Are you okay?
4503209 4504793 Yeah, sorry, I just...
4505794 4507508 I just got a little dizzy<br />for a second there.
4507588 4509673 We can stop if you want.
4509757 4511925 No, we are not stopping.
4512009 4513052 Okay.
4527483 4529277 I'm sorry.
4530528 4532196 - Oh,<br />- Are you okay?
4532280 4533614 - Yeah.<br />- Oh, my God.
4549755 4551382 I should probably take off...
4552133 4553134 mine too.
4553342 4554343 Yeah.
4564978 4565979 It's a nice dress.
4566355 4568482 It's all she had.
4570151 4570984 Miss Fine.
4571068 4573070 Oh, my God. Of course.
4600681 4602933 How... How... How is that for you?
4603476 4605102 Um, it's okay.
4606061 4609648 Is... Is there, like, another way<br />you would prefer, or, like, is this...
4609732 4611275 I ju...
4612526 4614768 I don't think that's the hole<br />you think it is.
4615946 4617114 - Oh, my God.<br />- No, it's okay.
4617198 4619742 - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.<br />- No, it's okay.
4619825 4620826 Oh, my God.
4620909 4623246 I just... I'm not used<br />to approaching it from that angle,
4623329 4624663 and my... my geometry was off...
4624747 4627082 - Seriously, don't worry about it.<br />- I'm sorry.
4638886 4641305 - Wh...<br />- Are... are you good?
4643182 4645017 Oh, my God!
4645100 4647603 What the... what the fuck?
4647978 4650189 - I'm so sorry.<br />- What the fuck?
4650273 4652941 Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
4654193 4655194 Are... Are you okay?
4655319 4656529 Amy, just go.
4658781 4659782 Please go.
4661158 4663076 Oh, sh... Please fucking leave.
4663160 4665663 - Sorry, I'm going as fast as I can.<br />- Go!
4707746 4709332 Hey, have you guys seen Amy?
4709415 4710416 - No.<br />- No.
4714169 4715045 What the...
4715128 4716129 Wait.
4718257 4720634 Amy! Amy! Amy!
4721009 4724597 We're fucking sitting ducks. They're gonna<br />come in here, they're gonna find us.
4724680 4726056 Shut the fuck up, Rob.
4734315 4735733 I am not a coward.
4739445 4740488 All right, focus up.
4741447 4744074 Wait for my signal.<br />I'm gonna create a diversion.
4747953 4748954 What?
4750247 4751248 Hey!
4777400 4778401 No.
4779652 4780653 Really?
4807846 4811475 You know, this is why people say<br />I gave guys roadside assistance, right?
4813101 4814978 I gave them a ride home, that's all.
4819983 4821364 Okay, that's not true, I blew them.
4821444 4824241 But it's not like they ran out of gas<br />and I showed up to suck their dick
4824321 4825489 while they waited for help.
4825573 4828451 We hooked up in their car.<br />It makes sense to hook up in a car.
4828534 4830869 I'm not gonna, like,<br />suck a dick at my own home
4830953 4833080 where my father can walk in<br />at any moment.
4833330 4835958 Also, I wanna enjoy it. Fucking sue me.
4837376 4838711 That makes a lot of sense.
4847010 4848637 You know what the worst part is?
4850055 4852099 All the fucking girls call me that, too.
4855268 4859690 I knew, like, Ben and Max<br />and Dick Splinter would say stupid shit.
4864319 4865320 I just...
4865654 4869700 I didn't think the girls would, too.
4869783 4871159 Amy never called you that.
4874538 4876540 I'm sorry, I'm genuinely sorry.
4879292 4882463 Just, like, please don't call me Triple A<br />at Yale next year.
4882546 4885924 I just want people to know my real name.
4886299 4887342 Of course.
4888343 4889177 Annabel.
4889261 4891221 Fuck, dude, no, not right now.
4891304 4892640 I'm sorry. That was bad.
4892723 4893977 - That wasn't my best.<br />- Come on.
4894057 4895771 - Jesus Christ.<br />- That was embarrassing for me.
4895851 4897352 I'm sorry for that too.
4900939 4902733 Wait, where the fuck do you live?
4922545 4923586 [phone buzzes
4929593 4931053 Fuck!
4936725 4937726 What?
4942648 4943482 <i>All right.</i>
4943566 4946026 <i>- Well, just so you know, I know my rights.</i><br />- Oh, my God.
4946109 4948779 <i>There are more prisons than colleges<br />in the United States.</i>
4948862 4950158 <i>- Did you know that?<br />- You're right.</i>
4950238 4953408 <i>And it costs $71,000<br />to house an inmate in California.</i>
4953492 4954913 <i>That's more than Harvard.</i>
4954993 4956787 <i>- Yeah, really?<br />- Well, it seems excessive.</i>
4956870 4959372 <i>Shotgun. Just kidding. I don't have one.</i>
4984523 4987237 Oh, I'm actually... I'm actually here<br />for someone else. I'm so sorry.
4987317 4989361 - My mistake. My mistake. My mistake.<br />- Oh, my God!
4990696 4992197 Fuck you, dude.
4992280 4994074 Dude, you're in full-on jail.
4995951 4997202 Yeah, I know.
4997661 4999037 I'm so sorry.
4999997 5001624 I mean, it's okay.
5001707 5005002 I'm gonna have to pay a fine<br />and go before the judge,
5005085 5006629 - but we both...<br />- No, I'm sorry.
5007254 5009256 I know women apologize too much,
5009339 5011261 but, in this case,<br />I have so much to be sorry for.
5011341 5012342 I was so selfish.
5012425 5013677 I... I was being a coward.
5013761 5014928 You called Malala.
5015012 5016471 I lied to you, Moll.
5016555 5020100 You were trying to save me from seeing<br />Nick rub his boner all up against Ryan.
5020183 5021977 Oh, my God, can you believe that,<br />by the way?
5022060 5023604 No. Honestly, no.
5023687 5025649 I would have guessed<br />that Nick hooked up with Theo
5025731 5027027 before I would have guessed Ryan.
5027107 5029693 Nick and Theo do have great chemistry.
5029777 5031486 Divine. I mean, it's palpable.
5034281 5037034 I'm sorry I'm so controlling.
5038619 5041204 I just can't imagine my life without you.
5044917 5048253 You are the motherfucker who got arrested<br />the night before graduation.
5048336 5050047 Oh, my God, graduation.
5050130 5052507 Molly, what... what time is it?<br />You have to go.
5052591 5054885 Yeah, why do you think I'm here?<br />You're coming with me.
5054968 5056887 Dude, no, I am screwed. I can't leave.
5056970 5058305 - You have to go.<br />- Amy...
5058764 5060515 I am not graduating without you.
5060599 5064728 So either I get arrested<br />and I join you in there or we go together.
5065187 5066188 How?
5068857 5070818 We're gonna trade some information.
5071526 5073445 Because we have seen this man.
5073528 5074529 What?
5074988 5077119 - Is that Jared's car?<br />- I'll explain later.
5077199 5078996 - Am I driving?<br />- Of course you're driving!
5079076 5081286 - Need this. Go!<br />- Oh, that was my fault!
5081369 5083664 Okay, Waze says 19 minutes.<br />We're doing it in seven.
5084039 5085040 Let's fuckin' do this.
5105185 5106867 Hey, guys, let's go ahead and take a seat.
5108689 5109982 Stop!
5117990 5118991 Hey, Evelyn.
5121243 5122452 I just wanted to say...
5123203 5124872 Have a great summer.
5124955 5127082 That's what the kids are doin', right?
5127332 5128500 Have a great...
5129376 5131044 All right, cool.
5131128 5132796 Cool, cool, cool. Sickening.
5132880 5134214 Morning, my queen.
5134757 5135719 Hi.
5135799 5137718 So last night was amazing.
5138301 5140303 Can I see you again?
5145267 5146935 Good luck at Google next year, okay?
5147019 5148311 Okay.
5148687 5149688 Bye.
5150605 5151606 Bye.
5153817 5155193 Did you fuck Miss Fine?
5166246 5167915 Has anybody seen, Molly?
5167998 5171084 'Cause we've gotta get started.<br />She kicks it off. Huh? Nobody?
5171376 5173503 'Cause I haven't seen her either<br />since yesterday
5173586 5175633 when we were at school, all of us,<br />at school together.
5175714 5177716 So, Molly warned me<br />she might be a little late
5177800 5179137 and tapped me to start her speech.
5179217 5181469 - Molly is gonna be late to graduation?<br />- Yeah.
5181553 5183430 - That doesn't sound like her.<br />- Right.
5183513 5186892 Well, she also asked me<br />to remind you that...
5188685 5189686 I got it...
5190062 5192981 This sort of thing happens all the time<br />on the Senate floor.
5193065 5195067 And if a senator isn't present for a vote,
5195150 5198028 - a proxy can call for a motion...<br />- Okay. That does sound like her.
5198111 5200408 - ...for the vote to take place...<br />- I got it. Thanks, Jared.
5200488 5201701 - ...in her absence.<br />- Okay, so...
5201782 5202783 So she tapped you?
5202866 5204242 - Tapped me.<br />- Okay.
5205077 5207913 Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.<br />You're gonna kick it off.
5208246 5210582 Okay, there he goes.
5210665 5212835 - Yeah, yeah, Shantay, you stay, honey!<br />- Oh, Jared!
5212918 5214169 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
5215337 5216338 Look at you.
5225555 5226639 Good morning.
5226723 5227808 Good morning.
5230560 5231812 I'm Molly Davidson.
5244032 5245533 I am a woman.
5245617 5247702 - I am a powerful woman.<br />- My boy!
5247786 5251874 And I'm ready to take the fists<br />of my femininity to the status quo.
5251957 5254084 Straight, white man,
5254167 5256294 your time is...
5256378 5257379 Okay.
5269892 5274062 Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.
5285198 5287826 All right, I'm gonna go take my seat.<br />I'm gonna go take my seat.
5287910 5290871 Come on. Come on! Look who made it!
5292664 5294332 - Amy!<br />- Amy!
5296501 5298753 Whooooo!
5324362 5325405 Thank you.
5331703 5332829 Okay.
5332913 5335290 Looks like Jared did a pretty good job.
5335373 5336541 Yes, he did.
5336624 5337876 Yes, he did.
5337960 5339419 Yeah!
5341004 5342005 I...
5345884 5346969 I was so...
5347928 5349304 scared of you.
5349387 5352057 I felt like I had to prove<br />that I was better than you.
5352640 5353641 But really...
5354517 5356728 I don't know any more than you guys.
5356811 5360482 All I know is that<br />we have a lot more to learn.
5365153 5366488 'Cause this part's over.
5367780 5368991 And that's so sad.
5370325 5372119 But it was great, wasn't it?
5374537 5377874 Things are never gonna be the same,<br />but... it was perfect.
5381336 5383380 And... And I may not have before, but...
5383922 5385257 I see you now.
5386674 5388801 And you're all pretty great.
5389386 5391972 Don't let college fuck it up.
5392055 5392889 Congratulations.
5392973 5394349 I... I see you.
5401356 5402357 Yes!
5405568 5407612 Okay. Okay.
5408738 5410740 That went over,
5410823 5412993 but I will not be cutting down<br />my allotted time.
5413076 5414202 Gigi, hit the track.
5419707 5421213 - That's pretty good.<br />- Know what's good?
5421293 5422419 If you roll these...
5422502 5424091 ...and then you'll have more room.
5424171 5426756 - Oh, probably not rolling them.<br />- Yeah, but...
5426839 5429217 - Well, why does it have to be...<br />- Look!
5429301 5430927 God, you're bringing Lingling.
5431011 5433555 - Well...<br />- Oh, Lingling!
5433638 5434764 No.
5434847 5437100 - Please be good to my Amy.<br />- I've gotta pack up.
5437184 5439189 - Make her feel like she's not so lonely.<br />- Pack it up.
5439269 5440645 Make her feel good.
5440728 5443398 - Amy, make it stop.<br />- Gotta put that in the old suitcase.
5443481 5445692 Please don't put your face on the face.
5445775 5446738 Make it stop.
5446818 5449154 - On the head, on the neck.<br />- Not the nose.
5449237 5450363 - I got...<br />- Amy, there's...
5450447 5451489 Look who she's bringing.

5455160 5456578 No, no...
5462792 5464919 Amy, there's, someone here to see you.
5465212 5466254 Who?
5467297 5468298 What?
5469341 5470925 Why is she here?
5471009 5472010 Excuse me.
5472885 5475347 Amy, why is she here?
5486941 5487942 Hey.
5488026 5489027 Hey.
5489486 5491654 I figured I'd bring back your clothes.
5491904 5493865 Thanks so much.
5494699 5497410 I don't...<br />I don't usually leave my underwear
5497494 5498828 in... in places that are...
5498911 5500538 that aren't my room.
5501664 5502665 Yeah, I figured.
5504000 5505043 So,
5506711 5507712 How... how...
5508671 5510465 Are... Are you... Are you okay?
5511674 5512675 Yeah, I'm fine.
5514677 5515845 Are <i>you </i>okay?
5516263 5517264 Yeah.
5518390 5519391 You know...
5519766 5522352 prison kind of changes you, but...
5524687 5525730 I'm fine.
5525813 5529692 I'm sorry, I just... I really don't know<br />what I'm doing with all that stuff yet.
5529776 5531528 Well, for...
5532154 5534572 someone who has no idea<br />what they're doing...
5536908 5538493 you kind of know what you're doing.
5541871 5542872 That's a...
5544957 5546751 Um, that's cool.
5548253 5549504 So, how...
5549796 5552132 How is your... How is...<br />How is your summer going?
5553341 5556761 I mean, wh... what are you doing for...<br />for the summertime?
5559556 5561558 I think I'm gonna backpack around<br />for a bit.
5562559 5563685 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
5563768 5564769 Where?
5565562 5568523 I don't know. Honestly, anywhere<br />I can find a couch to crash on.
5568606 5571401 I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff<br />before college.
5572110 5573570 That's... that's really cool.
5573653 5576114 Me too, that's...<br />that's why I'm taking a gap year.
5576614 5577615 Yeah?
5577865 5578866 Yeah.
5578950 5579784 Yeah.
5579867 5581119 All right, well...
5581411 5582620 have fun, nerd.
5591213 5594591 Um, well, if... if you ever end up in...<br />in Botswana...
5595592 5597552 you'd have a couch to crash on.
5597844 5599011 Okay.
5600096 5603766 Well, technically, it won't be my couch,<br />'cause I'll be staying with a family,
5603850 5606060 - but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.<br />- Okay.
5615528 5616529 Yes.
5617113 5618114 Yes.
5619324 5620492 Molly!
5620575 5623035 Amy, this thing drives like a cruise ship.
5623786 5625997 Well, it's yours now.
5626080 5627457 Take care of the old Volvo for me.
5627540 5629167 Oh, speaking of vulva,
5629251 5631169 remember when you missed Hope's,
5631253 5633129 and you just went straight<br />for that butt hole!
5633213 5635215 I said... I said, "once a day."
5635298 5637550 - Hey, I have to stock up.<br />- Once a day.
5637634 5641263 - You're gonna be on a flight for 28 hours.<br />- I said you could mention it once a day.
5641346 5642475 So I have to stock up.
5642555 5643931 It's not my fault.
5654317 5656319 Yeah. It feels weird<br />to be on this side of the car.
5656403 5658988 It's like everything's... different.
5661157 5663368 Yeah, I can't believe<br />I'm not gonna see you tomorrow.
5663993 5666078 Call me on that weird<br />international flip phone, okay?
5666162 5667163 I will.
5668206 5669207 Okay.
5670041 5671251 - Bye. I love you.<br />- Bye.
5671334 5672585 Love you.
5674045 5674879 Bye.
5674962 5677424 - Go make those tampons, girl.<br />- I will. I...
5678550 5680134 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5687517 5688851 Oh, gotta get that bag.
5688935 5691938 Yep. Yeah, it's... it's a long trip.
5692021 5693022 Go get 'em.
5694691 5695692 What's a year?
5697402 5698403 Okay.
5747452 5749537 - Oh, fuck!<br />- Fuck!
5749621 5751748 What the fuck is wrong with you?
5751831 5754376 I was going through a thing!
5754459 5755547 You weren't... You're...
5755627 5758296 I was going through a whole fucking thing!
5758380 5759422 What the fuck?
5759506 5762133 - I can be the last one on the plane.<br />- What's wrong with you?
5762216 5763217 You wanna get pancakes?
5763301 5765762 Fuck, yeah, I do! Fuck, yeah!
