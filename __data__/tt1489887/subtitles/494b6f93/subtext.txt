4087 6624 OLIVIA WILDE: Hi. I'm Olivia Wilde,<br />director of Booksmart,
6715 8706 and let's watch the movie together.
9176 10712 WOMAN ON TAPE:<br />Take a deep breath.
10802 13089 WILDE: So, this voiceover<br />is actually Maya Rudolph,
14014 18804 and she did this for us as a favor,<br />and I was very excited.
19645 21682 She had fun with it,
21772 25811 and we wanted her to do a kind<br />of Tony Robbins/Oprah impression.
26693 29731 And she was so perfectly calming,
29821 31186 and then as it takes a turn,
31281 34649 she becomes fierce<br />and incredibly intense,
34743 36484 which is exactly what we wanted.
36578 39570 Everyone who's ever doubted you,
40749 42410 fuck those losers.
42501 46836 Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.
47548 49084 WILDE: And then this is supposed<br />to be a mouth guard,
49174 51586 like Molly has to meditate<br />with a mouth guard
51677 53213 because she's that intense.
54263 55173 Hey!
55264 58598 WILDE: So, this actually wasn't<br />originally the beginning of the film,
58684 62518 but once I saw how the girls<br />would greet each other in real life,
62604 64686 with these dance moves,
64773 68858 I decided this had to be<br />how Molly and Amy were introduced.
69236 73901 And I love how their dance styles<br />perfectly represent their personalities
73991 75607 and how they're different<br />from each other.
76618 80452 And I love a nonverbal way<br />of showing chemistry.
81248 82238 I missed you so much.
84793 86875 WILDE: It makes me so happy,<br />that little body roll.
88255 89711 I don't think we are, no.
89798 92335 WILDE: Originally, this was a scene<br />that had a lot of dialogue.
92426 94133 It was supposed to be<br />the girls in this car,
94219 97337 driving to school<br />talking about the year.
97431 100674 But once I saw them dance, I knew<br />we didn't really need any dialogue.
100767 102474 We just needed<br />to watch them move.
103061 106349 That's actually visual effects.<br />We changed that in post.
106732 109099 And that skater there<br />really did terrify Kaitlyn.
109192 110353 That was a real flinch.
110444 111309 (school bell ringing)
114323 117907 So, in this sequence,<br />I just wanted to show how,
117993 119358 as book smart as they are,
119453 121865 they quite literally<br />can barely walk down a hallway
121955 123946 without running into people.
124916 127954 They kind of have to plow<br />through school in order to survive.
129004 132588 And here they are seeing<br />their principal, Jordan Brown,
133842 135549 played by Jason Sudeikis.
136970 139428 And this scene, we really<br />wanted to show that the girls
139514 144600 are so fiercely ambitious<br />in their academic experience
144686 147178 that they're even<br />a burden to the people
147272 150310 who would typically<br />really appreciate that level of ambition.
151026 152687 And he's just so exhausted
152778 155190 after four years of dealing<br />with this intensity
155280 156941 that he can barely handle them.
158116 162075 Really? Now?<br />Why don't you do it with Nick?
162162 165200 WILDE: I loved having the girls side<br />by side in the doorway like this.
165290 168658 I love that they choose to stand<br />as close to each other as possible.
168752 171494 We both know that Nick only ran for VP<br />because they plan the dances.
172130 175418 WILDE: That little pop to Nick<br />was something that we did in post.
175509 178001 I just wanted there<br />to be a flash to this kid
178095 180336 that would allow we,<br />the audience,
181098 183635 to misjudge him immediately<br />as kind of a meathead.
183725 186262 ...celebrate this wonderful achievement?<br />Let's focus on...
186353 189937 WILDE: And here they are being<br />shut out even by the principal.
190232 191097 We will persist.
192526 194108 Nick's like the great equalizer.
194194 197357 WILDE: So, I love this opportunity to show<br />in an almost anthropological way
197447 201441 how Amy perceives the world around her
201535 203492 and how they kind of observe everyone
203578 206536 while being themselves<br />largely invisible.
207999 212584 They can't even understand how other<br />"normal” kids interact.
212671 215504 They're able to be so effortless<br />in their flirtation.
216007 217497 Under eight minutes?
217592 219549 WILDE: So, Jessica Williams,<br />playing Miss Fine,
219636 224051 is herself an incredibly cool,<br />smart woman.
224933 226674 And if she were my English<br />teacher in high school,
226768 229556 I would've been<br />equally obsessed with her.
229646 232729 But what I love is that,<br />although all the kids love her,
232816 236150 she loves the most<br />intelligent of the bunch.
236236 238773 She appreciates<br />how hard these ladies work.
238864 240525 She just wants them<br />to also have some fun.
240615 242481 -I'm gonna share the contact.<br />-Wait, wait, wait, Miss Fine.
243410 245868 WILDE: And there's Triple A,<br />played by Molly Gordon.
247539 251908 She is incredibly confident
253211 256499 and as we find out,<br />also incredibly intelligent.
257299 260667 And this is George and Alan,<br />Noah Galvin and Austin Crute,
261553 263715 and Diana Silvers, playing Hope.
263805 266638 This was a scene where we introduced<br />most of our ensemble,
266725 269387 which made it incredibly<br />difficult to edit,
269478 271264 because we wanted<br />to give everyone a moment.
271354 273470 Here's Eduardo Franco playing Theo.
275108 276769 But we wanted to make it feel--
277444 280277 Keep the pace up,<br />but make it feel smooth,
280363 282445 and allow the audience
283158 286492 to meet all these characters that they're<br />later going to fall madly in love with,
286578 288364 such as Skyler, played...
288455 290947 sorry, Jared,<br />played by Skyler Gisondo.
292000 293957 And this moment, here,<br />is one of my favorites.
294044 295626 Jare-Bear comin'<br />at you from all angles.
295712 298374 WILDE: He's an extraordinary improviser,<br />as they all are,
298465 300456 but this moment here<br />really made me laugh.
300550 302757 Baby Jared says,<br />"Happy graduation, everybody."
302844 305211 No one's gonna wear a shirt<br />with your face on it.
305305 306670 WILDE: So, there's Hope,
306765 309632 withering in her critiques,<br />as always,
310185 312517 and Jared being able<br />to kind of rub it off.
313146 315934 He's not affected<br />by anybody's judgment,
316024 317765 which we love about him.
318568 323563 That look that Beanie gave Skyler<br />in that shot really just blew me away.
323657 325819 It was a little hint<br />of something to come.
327077 329660 And here are the theater kings.
330163 331949 They're both the kings and the queens,
333083 335324 introducing the concept<br />of Shakespeare in the parking lot,
335418 338126 which was writer<br />Katie Silberman's brilliant idea,
338213 339703 which made me laugh so hard.
340882 341963 It was actually funny.
342050 346510 It's what we did in my summer program<br />last year in Barcelona, when I lived in...
347264 351303 WILDE: Noah Galvin is,<br />in real life, a theater master.
351393 353976 He always has been.<br />He's a professional Broadway actor,
354437 359273 and he really had fun<br />poking fun at the theater world.
359359 361726 And the "Barthelona" thing<br />is something we all recognize
361820 364903 from the kids who took a year abroad,<br />or even a semester or week abroad.
364990 365980 ...make their own tampons.
366074 368190 That's... gross.
368285 370151 Well blood attracts lions.
370245 372156 WILDE: Here's where we were<br />planting information
372247 375581 that Amy is going away for what<br />Molly believes to be the summer.
375667 378625 Then, of course, we find out later<br />that's not the entire truth.
379170 382208 And here is the rivalry<br />between Molly and George,
382299 383789 truly between Molly and everyone.
383884 385625 And what the first 10<br />of the movie is doing
385719 390259 is establishing her adversarial<br />relationship to everyone in the school
390348 394808 except her ride or die, Amy,<br />who loves her so intensely,
394895 396886 as you can see<br />in this look coming up right here.
397731 401690 This look of adoration and respect<br />right here just really breaks my heart.
401776 402891 ♪♪
404070 408735 Here we have the classic<br />high school lunch scene,
408825 412910 where everyone is able to kick back<br />and relax, confidently.
414205 416822 And Molly's plowing through it<br />with a true intensity
416917 418157 that she really can't turn off.
418251 420333 It's her way of protecting herself.
420420 422081 We're playing this game where I got to...
422172 425381 WILDE: Here I wanted to show that Nick<br />quite literally won't ever look at her.
425467 426332 He doesn't see her.
426426 428508 This is a story about people<br />learning to see each other.
428595 431257 And in the beginning<br />no one looks at these girls,
432223 434806 and they don't really understand<br />how to connect,
435560 439474 although Amy is trying<br />desperately to understand how.
440690 442772 She's watching Ryan--
443693 445809 In this sequence<br />that makes me so happy.
446404 449396 Victoria Ruesga, playing Ryan,<br />is a professional skateboarder,
450075 452533 and it was so fun to capture<br />these skating moments,
452619 454951 because she can do anything.
455038 457200 And I got to tap into my dreams
457290 460203 of being just<br />a skateboard video director
460293 464958 because it was a really fun chance<br />to show her skills.
465048 466584 And of course, we could<br />only use a sliver of it,
466675 469258 but that's footage I really love.
470011 472548 And here's Amy heading into the fray.
472639 474846 That's Discovery playing right now,
474933 478471 which is a band we feature heavily<br />on the soundtrack, and they're excellent.
478603 480310 - Oh, oh, sorry, sorry...<br />- RYAN: Dude.
480397 481558 Amy.
481898 486108 WILDE: Here's some pretty<br />elegantly laid exposition
486194 488652 on behalf of our screenwriter,<br />Katie Silberman.
488738 491901 The concept of Nick's party<br />is introduced here.
492617 494904 Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?<br />His aunt went on a cruise...
494995 498078 WILDE: And we understand<br />that the reason Amy
498164 501031 eventually agrees<br />to go on the adventure to find Nick
501126 504494 is because of this moment here,<br />the promise of connecting with Ryan.
504587 507420 That's not really what I meant.<br />Oh, Jesus.
507674 511542 That moment of Nico Hiraga, playing<br />Tanner, blasting through on his board
512303 514761 is in there because I always feel,<br />when I'm around skateboarders,
514848 518011 I'm this really kind of awkward,<br />nerdy, clunky person
518101 521344 who's always running<br />into some smooth skateboarder.
521438 522974 So, that was Amy in that moment.
523064 525101 ...gender performance. It's different<br />from her sexual orientation.
525191 527558 And here we have the chance<br />to really listen in
527652 530440 on a conversation between the girls<br />for the first time,
530530 534273 where they talk about<br />what Molly wants for Amy.
536453 539115 And we see how well they know<br />each other here.
539205 542994 This is a bit of improv-- the girls<br />were very good at not breaking,
543084 546418 but I have to say this is one scene<br />where Kaitlyn Dever
546504 548711 could not stop breaking,<br />and we kept a little bit of it there.
548798 552007 You saw her smirk,<br />which she didn't do on purpose,
552093 554004 but I had to keep<br />because she's just...
554429 557638 It's so delightful to watch them<br />being delighted by each other.
557724 561467 With her, there'd be more...<br />vagina involved.
561561 564349 WILDE: And this is a scene I love because<br />it's establishing a close relationship
564439 567272 between people who identify<br />differently in terms of sexuality,
567358 569144 but they really couldn't be closer.
570945 574563 We also introduce the idea<br />that somebody always gets arrested,
574657 577490 which we assume<br />will not be one of our heroines.
577994 581487 We assume it will be Nick,<br />which was a little fun misdirect.
581581 583322 You're just gonna be scissoring<br />a different girl.
583416 585748 Dude, scissoring is not a thing.
586294 587784 WILDE: This scissoring conversation
587879 591543 was something that I really loved<br />watching them play with.
592592 594833 Here is Gigi,<br />played by Billie Lourd,
594928 598717 and it's truly an iconic performance<br />by an iconic actress.
598807 600172 Here comes the one percent.
600975 604309 And this is a hood mount shot<br />that I was very excited about.
605105 607312 I kind of had a moment<br />at the end of this scene
607398 611141 to throw the camera on the hood<br />and get this high speed shot,
611236 614149 which, of course, allows for<br />this dramatic, slow-mo,
614239 617482 almost kind of badass<br />music video entrance for Billie.
618326 620988 And that song is "Money" by Leikeli47,
621079 623912 which was a perfect<br />accompaniment to Gigi.
623998 627582 We are equals. Gigi just keeps<br />Jared around for when she needs a liver.
627669 630832 WILDE: We're witnessing<br />two couplings of best friends.
630922 632504 There's Jared and Gigi,
632590 634456 who are as close and loyal to one another
634551 635882 as Molly and Amy.
637679 639966 But at this point the two haven't<br />really been able
640056 643924 to see or understand<br />each other as humans,
644018 647010 as often happens in high school.
648648 650230 We also see here another moment
650316 652978 of Jared really trying hard<br />to connect with Molly.
653069 655026 They're probably a little soggy now,<br />but they're great cold.
655113 658777 WILDE: This was a chance to watch<br />Skyler and Billie just play.
658867 662280 I let them improvise on that car<br />for a long time,
662370 664987 and it was just so much fun.<br />I was laughing so hard.
665081 666116 Here's one of my favorite moments.
666207 669450 The "you're ugly,”<br />grammatically-incorrect graffiti
669544 671205 was something that I just loved.
671296 675711 What a perfectly classic way<br />to describe who Molly is as a character,
675800 680590 and that came from location scouting<br />this high school, San Fernando High,
681472 683804 and I saw that<br />somebody had written "you're ugly"
683933 686721 with the incorrect use of the apostrophe.
686811 688643 And I was like, "Whoops,<br />that's in the movie."
688980 690937 I sent a picture of it<br />to our screenwriter Katie,
691024 693140 and I was like,<br />"We have to use this."
694235 697648 Here we see<br />the gender neutral bathroom,
698239 700776 which is pretty familiar<br />to a lot of kids these days,
700867 703074 but certainly wasn't the case<br />when I was in high school.
703161 707655 And one thing that would be tricky<br />about it would be this kind of situation,
707749 711208 where there's a group of guys<br />and girls outside your stall,
711294 712534 potentially talking about you,
712629 716167 making it incredibly awkward<br />and kind of terrifying.
717258 718748 We all remember this feeling.
718843 721835 I would make passionate sex<br />to Molly Davidson.
721930 722840 Really?
722931 726549 WILDE: This is introducing the idea<br />of Molly being, as tough as she is,
726643 729305 also affected by the opinions of others.
730146 732604 What I love is that<br />they're not critiquing appearance,
732690 734931 which is so common<br />in high school films.
735026 738064 They're really critiquing<br />her intensity,
738821 740607 which she embraces.
740990 743698 And you see here she has a moment<br />where she says, "Yeah, you're right.
743785 746743 I'm brilliant. I'm intense.<br />It doesn't bother me. I like my choices."
747538 749370 What she doesn't expect<br />is that they will tell her
749457 752245 they, too, are really intelligent.
752335 754952 And she's kind of misjudged them<br />in a very simplified way.
755046 758084 ...profiles and commendations<br />from the governor.
758174 759585 So while you guys were...
759676 762885 WILDE: I love Beanie's performance here.<br />It's so strong.
762971 766259 And that little look from Mollie Gordon<br />is just perfectly telling.
768893 772136 That penis drawn on the wall<br />is a visual effect,
772230 773720 because it kept jumping all over.
773815 775977 Every time Tanner drew the penis,<br />it moved,
776067 778775 so we had to eventually<br />spend some money
779404 782146 creating some consistency<br />of the drawing.
784284 786776 And here is really what sets<br />the movie off.
786869 789406 Here's the information<br />that blows Molly's mind.
789497 793491 Triple A, whom she has assumed to be<br />really dumb,
794043 797286 turns out to be brilliant,<br />as does Tanner and Theo.
797672 800664 - What are you guys talking about?<br />- Yeah, Stanford.
800758 801964 WILDE: And we see that--
802051 804918 We assume that the nerdy girls are<br />the ones being judged unfairly,
805013 808472 but this scene is about<br />how she has judged them unfairly
808558 812517 and her kind of vision of the world,<br />of being on the defensive
813646 816513 is actually kind of turned upside down.
816607 818393 She's misunderstood everyone else.
818484 822102 How did they possibly have fun<br />and do well in school? It can't be true.
824657 826568 What's funny is that<br />Molly Gordon and Beanie Feldstein
826659 828445 are best friends in real life.
828536 832575 So, these are two people who love<br />each other intensely playing adversaries,
832665 834952 and they just<br />had a lot of fun with this scene.
835043 837831 No, we just don't<br />only care about school.
837920 840161 They're basically<br />like sisters in real life,
840256 843248 so this was fun for them,<br />in a kind of twisted way.
847055 848045 And I love this little moment.
848139 849049 After you.
849140 850005 WILDE: "After you."
851100 852636 This was a moment to play with,
852727 857847 an illustration of what Molly's mental<br />breakdown looks and feels like.
858900 862985 She hears Maya's voice<br />bringing back her mantra,
863071 865358 which doesn't seemed to have worked.
865448 869066 And here's our Hitchcock push-in,
870119 873612 which I was I was adamant about getting,<br />and I'm really happy we did.
874332 875242 Hey.
875792 880036 WILDE: The sound design here<br />is really important,
880129 883087 because we're kind of sensing<br />that everything's falling apart.
883174 885085 The stakes are very, very high.
886052 887668 - Where you going to school next year?<br />- I couldn't be less interested.
887762 889878 WILDE: And there we see<br />Hope doesn't really engage.
889972 891258 It's what sets her apart.
892308 894345 And this really<br />sends Molly over the top.
895061 896802 - Harvard.<br />- Gigi"s going to Harvard.
897814 900021 WILDE: The one who we assume<br />to be the most frivolous
900441 903183 is actually<br />the most intelligent and special.
903444 905902 Okay, here's Nico Hiraga<br />on the skateboard.
905988 907774 I couldn't ask<br />a normal actor to do this,
907865 909606 but because he's<br />a professional skateboarder,
909700 911691 I was able to say, "Hey,<br />hop on this board,
911786 914699 grab this fire extinguisher and go."<br />And he was like, "Sure, man."
917708 920200 It was great, except the camera operators<br />were panicked
920294 923082 that the fire extinguisher<br />was gonna ruin the cameras.
923172 927040 And here, I just set everybody free.<br />I said have fun, go nuts.
927844 929926 This is about a senior prank,
930555 932922 where they fill condoms with water
933015 936383 and pelt them at each other<br />and just destroy the school.
937311 940474 Of course, that condom hit the camera,<br />which was pretty funny.
941441 944809 This was a chance<br />to just blast music in this hallway
944902 948190 and send the actors<br />into a just frenzy.
950032 951648 And that is shot<br />at 2,000 frames per second
951659 951739 And that is shot<br />at 2,000 frames per second
951742 952322 And that is shot<br />at 2,000 frames per second
952410 956825 to really achieve that intensity<br />of the water balloon hit,
956914 959531 which was a lot of fun for us,<br />but not so fun for Beanie.
960001 962493 Poor thing. She's a trooper.
964172 966288 In this moment, something fun<br />to know is Kaitlyn Dever
966382 969750 is a musician in real life,<br />and she plays the autoharp.
969844 972131 And once I found that out,<br />I said, "Can you bring it?
972221 973882 Can you incorporate that<br />into the scene?”
973973 977307 And she wrote that little piece<br />with Katie Silberman right before we shot.
978102 980093 And I love it,<br />I love that little song.
980188 982395 ...focus on school<br />and get into good colleges.
982482 984564 WILDE: So, here's where our plan<br />is hatched.
985610 987817 And something that's so extraordinary<br />about these actors
987904 991022 is that they don't make it sound<br />or feel like exposition.
991782 993568 It feels entirely organic.
993659 995616 - ...the only assholes who did one.<br />- Hey!
995703 997785 And I really,<br />really love that about them.
999332 1002290 We see the difference<br />in their sort of states of mind.
1003085 1005952 Amy is willing to stay<br />in this place where they are.
1006047 1009039 She's not feeling particularly driven<br />to prove anything to anyone.
1009634 1013878 Molly is the one who's world view<br />has been kind of broken,
1013971 1016838 and she needs them to prove<br />their multidimensionality.
1016933 1019595 Otherwise, we're just gonna be<br />the girls that missed out!
1019685 1020925 We haven't done anything!
1021020 1023762 WILDE: This is the first scene<br />they shot together.
1023856 1025187 We've broken a lot of rules.
1025274 1027936 WILDE: And it's an incredible<br />amount of dialogue
1028027 1031145 to capture in your first scene<br />of your first day.
1031822 1032983 And of course they nailed it.
1033074 1034906 - ...because they broke a couple of rules.<br />-Picasso.
1035660 1037697 He broke art rules.<br />Name a person who broke a real rule.
1037787 1039073 - Rosa Parks.<br />- Name another one.
1039163 1040699 WILDE: That's an exchange<br />that's a really good example
1040790 1043282 of how great<br />these actresses' timing is.
1043376 1046368 They just both have amazing timing.<br />Very sharp.
1046462 1049625 ...getting into Yale and editing<br />law review at Georgetown, and clerking...
1049715 1053333 WILDE: Here we see that Molly has<br />a very different plan ahead of her,
1053886 1056503 which is planting a seed<br />for a later conflict, of course.
1056597 1058508 ...Court of the United States!
1058599 1059805 (birds chirping)
1061435 1062345 In my case.
1063396 1066434 WILDE: This was a scene we originally<br />planned to be set at golden hour,
1066524 1070062 with a really kind<br />of Terrence Malicky-golden hue.
1070152 1074817 And we got there, and it was<br />the one cloudy day I had seen in LA.
1075700 1077566 And I was mad.<br />But now, actually I'm happy
1077660 1081699 because it seems to reflect<br />the emotional state of the characters.
1081789 1085453 We end the movie at golden hour,<br />but we begin in this colder place.
1085543 1088285 She wanted you to come.<br />You're finally gonna make your moves.
1089046 1092380 WILDE: Here you can hear a great piece<br />of score by Dan the Automator...
1092842 1094207 I want you to experience this.
1094302 1096634 ...which I really, really love.
1096721 1097631 ...you might ask?
1097722 1100180 I'm going to experience<br />a seminal, fun...
1100266 1102473 WILDE: You feel that it's heading<br />somewhere exciting.
1102560 1104096 This is the beginning<br />of the journey.
1104186 1106518 <i>N'</i>
1106606 1107562 (exhales)
1107648 1109480 We were gonna watch<br />that Ken Burns thing.
1109567 1110978 The Dust Bowl can wait.
1111068 1112024 WILDE: (chuckles)
1113571 1115278 In this moment, Beanie threw the cake
1115364 1116354 Oh, Jesus!
1116449 1118941 And actually did think<br />she hurt someone with the plate,
1119035 1120491 which is why she flinches that way.
1120578 1124287 They were very worried they hurt the kid<br />playing basketball below the hill.
1126000 1128492 So, this is one of my favorite moments.
1128586 1133752 This is the one of the compliment-offs,<br />which is something we're very proud of.
1134175 1138385 The idea is they compliment each other<br />so intensely that it's almost an insult
1138971 1140461 that's actually<br />an expression of their love.
1140556 1143264 They love each other so intensely<br />that they have to kind of...
1143351 1144432 Grip escape move!
1144518 1148637 It almost sounds like they're...<br />insulting each other.
1148731 1152019 It's very specific to their styles,<br />and I just love it so much.
1152109 1153065 College IDs.
1153402 1156736 What I also love is that this is<br />a classic getting ready montage,
1156822 1157937 which in a normal teen movie
1158032 1160399 would be about them<br />trying on clothes to look good.
1160493 1161779 And instead, for these girls,
1161869 1166363 it's about them preparing for the threat<br />of violence on a night out.
1166457 1168198 -I don't... I don't really...<br />- Just a down...
1168292 1171910 WILDE: And then here, we get to see them<br />hanging out as friends do.
1172004 1175872 We see the familiarity that Molly<br />feels towards this space.
1175966 1180631 She has her own drawers, that's her bed,<br />she spends all her time here,
1180721 1183429 which we gather has to do a little bit<br />with her home life
1183516 1186429 and how Amy's basically<br />a sister to her.
1186519 1189853 - No! Can we just stop talking about this?<br />- That little elephant?
1189939 1191304 WILDE: Now they're talking<br />about masturbation,
1191399 1195939 which is something that I was<br />really adamant that we have in the movie
1196028 1199191 to show that this is<br />what girls talk about,
1199281 1202148 and it's often relegated<br />to kind of male-centric films.
1203202 1205739 But we wanted to show<br />that, of course, girls talk about this,
1205830 1207537 as they should, without shame.
1207623 1208784 Just a quick Q.
1208874 1209739 What happened to her...
1209834 1213293 WILDE: "Quick Q" is a very<br />Beanie Feldstein phrase,
1213379 1216167 which we absolutely embraced for Molly.
1217341 1219924 - Tell you about how she's endangered?<br />- No!
1220886 1222047 WILDE: That little roar.
1222930 1227094 I think this is one of the best<br />examples of Beanie's brilliance.
1227601 1231720 That's also a pretty close closeup,<br />and she couldn't be more beautiful.
1232523 1234355 Not hard actresses to shoot.
1234442 1235477 ...everything about you.
1235568 1238606 I think it's healthy for a relationship<br />to have secrets, and now we have one.
1238696 1241108 WILDE: And this is again planting<br />a seed of future conflict.
1241198 1244486 Of course, there's a secret between them<br />that Amy, at this point, can't share.
1245077 1246613 ...with an electric toothbrush.
1246704 1249162 WILDE: This UTI joke was<br />one of my favorite jokes in the script.
1249248 1251956 ...horrible UTI.<br />Horrible.
1252042 1254374 Like... horrible.
1254879 1256495 I wish that would've been a secret,
1256589 1258921 but you've mentioned it many, many times.
1259467 1262380 WILDE: That bedroom, designed<br />by production designer Katie Byron,
1262470 1266464 is so layered, it's incredibly detailed.<br />And I love that sign on the door.
1266557 1270596 It says "A Room of One's Own,"<br />which is, of course, Virginia Woolf.
1270686 1272973 I've never lied to my parents before.
1273063 1274895 You know when I lie,<br />I just add too many...
1274982 1276143 This is one shot.
1276233 1277974 I call this<br />my Hannah and her Sisters shot,
1278068 1281311 because I really feel like they look<br />like they're in an '80s Woody Allen movie
1281405 1282861 in those coats and the beret.
1282948 1285485 ...It's not, because you're not<br />the one who has to deal...
1285576 1287943 And it's the panicked conversation
1288037 1290870 before walking into a dining room<br />feels very Woody as well.
1291040 1293828 Honestly, it's surprising<br />that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,
1293918 1296125 considering their whole Jesus thing.<br />It's nice.
1296212 1298044 Charmaine, get to the safe room.
1298464 1301456 WILDE: So, Beanie Feldstein<br />and Kaitlyn Dever
1301550 1305168 were the only pair<br />I could see as Molly and Amy,
1305721 1308429 and I really knew<br />they would have perfect chemistry.
1308516 1310928 But I got lucky that I was right.
1311018 1314227 But they're both genius,<br />genius actresses
1314313 1318477 that are gonna have massive careers,<br />but seeing them together was incredible
1318567 1321855 because they compliment each<br />other's styles in perfect ways.
1321946 1324734 They do very different things,<br />but it works very well together.
1324824 1326610 They also happen to be<br />the same height,
1326700 1329032 which doesn't seem like<br />a important factor
1329119 1330985 but actually worked out<br />very well for us
1331080 1333617 in the way that we wanted to frame them<br />together as much as possible,
1333707 1336369 until later in the film<br />when we separate them.
1338796 1341834 So, here we have Will Forte<br />and Lisa Kudrow
1341924 1347169 in these cameos that I was just<br />thrilled that they were willing to do,
1347263 1348753 and they just are brilliant.
1348848 1350930 Here is Will
1351016 1355260 improvising puns<br />that go with the food
1355354 1357846 that he's prepared<br />for his daughter for a meal
1357940 1360147 that he really wanted her<br />to stay there for.
1360693 1364402 The quilt trip, the dad guilt trip,<br />which I love so much.
1364488 1367776 And here's Lisa,<br />the understanding mom, Charmaine.
1369285 1371242 I love Lisa and Will<br />together so much.
1371328 1375287 We have like an hour of footage of them<br />improvising, and I really want them to do
1375374 1376864 Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?<br />on Broadway,
1376959 1378996 because they are a perfect pair.
1379086 1381953 It's like Elizabeth Taylor<br />and Richard Burton
1382047 1384709 have nothing on Forte and Kudrow.
1385759 1386965 I'm just so thankful...
1387094 1388676 WILDE: So, this is the girls<br />having a lot of fun.
1388762 1390594 You can see them breaking a little bit,<br />which I loved,
1390681 1393343 'cause they were just making each other<br />laugh so hard with this little moment.
1393434 1396893 They also are both obsessed<br />with Lisa Kudrow,
1397563 1399429 so they were freaking out<br />for this entire scene.
1399440 1399520 So they were freaking out<br />for this entire scene.
1399523 1400354 So they were freaking out<br />for this entire scene.
1400900 1401981 ♪♪
1402735 1407400 That house is in Studio City,<br />very sweet little house,
1407489 1410572 which I picked because it's very different<br />from Molly's apartment building.
1410659 1414698 You see such good friends often come<br />from such different backgrounds.
1414788 1415994 And here we are.
1416081 1418573 This is footage the actors<br />actually shot themselves on iPhones.
1418667 1422251 I would give them iPhones and say,<br />"Please go shoot stuff that feels real.
1422338 1426582 Just have fun with it.<br />Shoot party stuff, play stuff, jokes,"
1426675 1428757 and we have four hours of it,<br />as you can imagine.
1428844 1430460 Someone get him milk. That's...
1430554 1431840 That's not gonna help.
1431931 1435390 WILDE: And the idea<br />of kids today living with social media
1435476 1440016 and the FOMO that must cause...<br />They are so aware of the fun
1440105 1442938 that's happening at the party<br />that they cannot find.
1443025 1443890 ...the address.
1443984 1448444 We've never hung out with any of these<br />people outside of academic activities.
1449114 1450696 WILDE: That milk, by the way, really<br />made me happy
1450783 1456620 when Nico Hiraga basically poured<br />an entire gallon of milk on himself,
1457164 1460122 without even missing a beat,<br />just happy to do it.
1461043 1461953 I think I do.
1464546 1467459 - Who are you calling?<br />- Don't worry about it, chica.
1468050 1468960 What?
1469802 1472009 WILDE: April Napier<br />is our costume designer,
1472096 1473586 and she is the one who came up
1473681 1476093 with the idea of the Rosie<br />the Riveter jumpsuits.
1476183 1477765 I had asked for one of them<br />to be in jumpsuits,
1477851 1479137 but she tried them on both of them
1479228 1480969 and then decided<br />they should both wear them.
1481063 1482178 And I love that,
1482272 1485640 because so often that happens<br />by accident with your best friend,
1485734 1488192 which is exactly what happens<br />with them, but they embrace it.
1488278 1493023 No one is forced to change.<br />And I love that it's iconic immediately.
1493367 1494573 It's a means to an end.
1494660 1498528 WILDE: They really embrace<br />this almost utilitarian approach
1498622 1502160 to going out to party.<br />And the outfits really reflect that.
1502251 1508293 Here is Skyler Gisondo playing Jared<br />post-school, in his going-out outfit,
1508382 1512216 which we kind of pulled from the idea...
1513303 1517638 of the supreme vibe<br />of very expensive street wear
1517725 1522390 that he hopes will afford him a certain<br />amount of popularity and approval.
1523731 1526143 I actually really love his outfit.<br />I would wear Skyler's outfit.
1527443 1529184 That's embarrassing.
1529278 1530484 WILDE: So here we have--
1530571 1536237 Sheryl Sandberg allowed us to use<br />the audio version of Lean In
1537244 1540828 for this amazing joke<br />that really makes me laugh,
1541415 1545704 that he's trying to show them<br />he's this male-ally feminist.
1546503 1547709 There's the Fuk Boi plate,
1547796 1551255 based on our screenwriter and producer<br />Kate Silberman's family dog
1551341 1552706 that they named Fuck Boy.
1554011 1555092 Sorry about that.
1555179 1557011 WILDE: Also Fuck Jams. We're terrible.
1557431 1560014 What? No, she's...<br />(forced laugh)
1560100 1562637 No girlfriend for me.<br />I can't pick faves.
1562728 1565561 Too many ladies wanna lock this down,<br />and they don't have the code.
1566690 1569523 WILDE: This is a scene where I really am<br />happy with the way it turned out,
1569610 1572898 because we actually had to cut out<br />a section of this because of time.
1572988 1576982 There used to be a fantasy sequence<br />for Amy's fantasy,
1577076 1579408 where she looked out the window<br />and saw Ryan
1579495 1583580 basically having sex with a man-sized<br />panda in a car next to them,
1583665 1585155 and we had to cut it for time,
1585250 1589164 but I'm happy that we were<br />able to smooth it out editorially.
1589755 1593168 And here we are introducing the idea<br />of what they assume to be drugs.
1594301 1597134 This car, in the very, very early version<br />of the script--
1597221 1601260 Before I came on board,<br />this car was a Hummer.
1602017 1604179 And I said, "I just can't have--<br />I can't look at a Hummer.
1604269 1605600 I don't wanna be in a Hummer."
1605687 1608679 And so I have a real passion<br />for classic cars
1608774 1612563 and we found this Firebird<br />and we put flames on it
1612653 1618899 and it's just it's a really funky old car.<br />I think it's a 67.
1618992 1620903 (speaking Mandarin)
1620994 1625534 WILDE: These girls memorized their lines<br />in Mandarin. I am so impressed.
1625624 1628491 They had a coach<br />on set who said it was perfect.
1628585 1629916 And of course I couldn't tell,
1630003 1631744 so I kept looking at the coach,<br />saying "are they nailing it?"
1631839 1634331 And she was blown away.<br />She said, "they really are ."
1635843 1636753 Ooh!
1637177 1641341 Came in a little hot there.<br />That's my bad. But we are here.
1641431 1643718 - What do we do?<br />- Don't move. Don't inhale.
1644351 1645307 WILDE: This moment.
1646270 1648102 So that was Handsome Boy Modeling School
1648188 1650395 playing on the radio there,<br />which is a great band
1650482 1652644 I was very happy<br />to have on the soundtrack.
1654236 1657103 One of my favorite scenes for Jared<br />coming up here,
1657197 1659609 the boat scene,<br />the party that wasn't.
1660909 1661944 We'll get you cleaned up on board.
1662202 1664990 We were shooting this in Marina Del Rey,<br />in Los Angeles,
1665080 1667492 and we chose that<br />because we really wanted
1667583 1669540 to show the kind of epic odyssey<br />the characters go on.
1669626 1672038 They go-- if you know LA,<br />they go from the Valley
1672129 1674962 to the marina to kind of mid-city LA<br />through Hollywood
1675048 1678837 and back to the Valley,<br />all to find this party
1678927 1681464 that actually was very close<br />to where they started.
1682681 1685719 "Prepare to get consensually bashed" is<br />another Katie Silberman special,
1685809 1688892 which I love so much. Very timely.
1688979 1690811 There's lots of dialogue<br />peppered in here
1690898 1694607 that we wanted to be kind of time stamps<br />of the world we're living in now
1694693 1699312 and reflective of what kind of language<br />young people are speaking right now.
1699406 1700817 Sasha Obama's sweet 16.
1701491 1703903 This is our loving callout<br />to Sasha Obama.
1703994 1704904 What are we thinking?
1704995 1706906 We still don't have the address to Nick's.
1706997 1708829 Someone on board might know...
1708916 1710406 WILDE: So there were<br />several moments in the film
1710500 1714084 where we had to show them<br />deciding to continue with the journey.
1714880 1716462 - Okay. Mm-hmm.<br />- Yeah?
1716548 1718414 WILDE: It always made me think<br />of Blues Brothers
1718508 1720294 with the continued decision<br />to keep moving.
1720385 1722217 "We're on a mission from God,<br />we're on a mission from God."
1722304 1724136 And here it's "we're on a mission<br />to find Nick's party.
1724223 1726260 We have to find information."
1726350 1730765 They're on a mission to gather--<br />to find the address
1730854 1734188 and they're willing to throw themselves<br />into uncomfortable situations
1734274 1735935 in order to do so.
1736026 1739235 Here, this is-- Jared has put<br />his own face on everything,
1739321 1743531 including gift bags that contain<br />an iPad, which really made me laugh.
1744117 1747485 This is another example of production<br />designer Katie Byron's genius,
1747579 1750446 this boat looked very different in--
1750540 1752247 Before we got to it<br />and we cleared it out.
1752334 1755668 I just wanted it to feel as sad<br />and empty as possible.
1756338 1758875 Someone who really expected<br />this to be a rager
1758966 1761879 and instead has literally<br />four people at his party.
1763679 1765761 Billie Lourd is wearing this head piece
1765847 1769306 that I wanted to kind of be<br />reminiscent of Hedy Lamarr.
1770227 1776564 It's this nod to old Hollywood,<br />which comes up a few times in the film,
1776650 1780939 specifically sort of honoring<br />Billie's legacy.
1781321 1783688 - I think I'm in love with you.<br />- I don't think you are.
1783782 1784817 You're coming with me.
1784908 1787445 WILDE: I love actors<br />who are always working.
1787536 1789903 Look at Skyler back there,<br />just dancing in the background,
1789997 1790987 keeping it alive.
1791081 1794199 - Amy! Ame, we're not...<br />- Look what I found,
1794543 1796204 with your name on it.<br />Come on.
1796295 1799287 WILDE: So this was a scene that was<br />an interesting challenge to cut.
1799381 1802919 We wanted to-- we've separated the girls<br />for the first time now.
1803010 1804796 She's upstairs, Molly is downstairs
1804886 1809175 and we really wanted to keep them<br />connected through the power of editing,
1809266 1814102 keep the pace up and keep the two<br />journeys happening very connected.
1814354 1816265 DJ Rod!
1816356 1818347 WILDE: This was something that Skyler<br />was not prepared for.
1818442 1819603 When we got to the set that day,
1819693 1823527 we were supposed to have<br />a background performer playing the DJ
1823613 1825900 and it wasn't<br />going to be featured very closely.
1825991 1828824 And I said, "You know what?<br />This is too tempting.
1828910 1832778 Skyler, can you pretend to be<br />kind of working these turntables?”
1833749 1836582 And they just ran with it.<br />And he didn't even flinch.
1836668 1839456 He put on that helmet<br />and he's like, "Oh, yeah, I got this."
1840339 1842580 And this turned into a really<br />touching moment.
1842674 1845541 It's very revealing<br />about Jared's loneliness
1845635 1847751 in the family<br />that he's grown up with.
1847846 1849132 People can sense it.<br />It turns them off.
1849222 1850633 WILDE: And of course,<br />this connects them.
1850724 1856094 They both feel like<br />they're trying hard to be loved.
1856313 1858099 - I Didn't mean it like...<br />- No. I'm just gonna...
1858857 1861724 WILDE: Which of course later<br />kind of brings them together.
1861818 1865186 That's Ben Harris, one of our casting<br />directors, playing the waiter.
1866823 1867733 And as soon as I got high,
1867824 1870612 I just cried about the fact that one day<br />my mom will die, so...
1870869 1872951 WILDE: So this is one of my favorite<br />Billie Lourd moments.
1873038 1874995 I lost my virginity in<br />what I thought was a park,
1875082 1877198 but it turned out to be a graveyard.
1877292 1880535 And now the ghost spirits live<br />inside my eggs, waiting to be reborn.
1881338 1885002 WILDE: The non sequiturs<br />that are so passionate.
1885092 1887049 She really believes they're bonding.
1887844 1890586 We see evidence that the character--<br />Billie is easy--
1890680 1893763 I mean, Billie's character of Gigi<br />is easy to misunderstand
1893850 1895261 as just being kind of a wild woman,
1895352 1898890 but she's incredibly loyal,<br />kind of violently loyal.
1899731 1902268 - Okay! I'm calling security.<br />-Amy,
1902359 1903690 we need to get the fuck...
1903777 1905893 WILDE: And this is,<br />we really wanted to show...
1907280 1911239 that Gigi is unpredictable in a way<br />that really throws the girls off.
1911326 1915991 It's always insanity<br />and chaos when Gigi's around.
1917332 1921041 Particularly when she's willing<br />to leap off a forty-five-foot yacht.
1921920 1926790 That's a stunt woman,<br />who did this incredibly brave leap.
1927592 1930755 Billie wanted to do it,<br />but of course I didn't let her.
1932305 1934672 Some fun visual effect fireworks there.
1934766 1937929 Oh, my god! I'm so sweaty!
1938061 1939927 WILDE: Now this is a moment<br />where we see...
1941064 1943351 the first moment of conflict<br />between the girls,
1943442 1946184 where Amy doesn't wanna continue.
1946278 1951364 We see Molly use the Malala tool
1951783 1954024 to make sure she continues<br />on this journey.
1954202 1958742 But this was a challenging moment<br />for us as a production,
1958832 1962245 for the script to continue<br />to move forward on the journey,
1962961 1966124 even when they keep hitting<br />these obstacles.
1966965 1968706 (all cheering)
1970093 1974382 WILDE: That is a stuntman<br />diving into a pool off a balcony,
1974473 1975963 which was terrifying.
1976057 1979140 My score is-- My score is very low.<br />I'm much too abrasive...
1980061 1982302 WILDE: "Much too abrasive<br />with the drivers" really makes me laugh.
1982397 1986231 It's so perfectly Molly.<br />So here's the Malala moment.
1986318 1987228 Malala.
1988612 1990774 WILDE: And Kaitlyn's performance<br />there just couldn't be better.
1990864 1993105 She understands<br />the significance of Malala.
1993909 1996492 Wow. You know<br />you only get like one...
1996578 1999912 WILDE: And we loved the fact<br />that the girls use Malala points
1999998 2006210 to their level of intelligence<br />and engagement with the world,
2006296 2012918 that they understand that Malala<br />is the kind of pinnacle of respect
2013512 2016504 and that she's kind of a superhero
2016598 2020717 that they use as code word<br />for devotion and loyalty and support.
2022270 2025388 This is the moment where of course<br />their Lyft driver
2025482 2028349 is revealed to be<br />the principal that they detest.
2028443 2031060 He's stuck with them,<br />they're stuck with him.
2032030 2034897 They're trapped<br />and yet there's that instinct
2034991 2039201 to try to be polite<br />and deferential to your superior.
2039287 2041494 But it's all just very, very awkward.
2042916 2045533 I really wanted these chili lights<br />inside the Lyft
2045627 2050087 so that it would look like this guy,<br />Jordan Brown,
2050173 2052210 he really wants to be the party Lyft.
2053176 2055964 In my mind he used to be a DJ<br />before he became a principal
2056054 2057840 and he just wants to be the fun guy.
2058723 2062341 And so he puts a bunch<br />of chili lights in his Lyft,
2062435 2063971 which turned out<br />to be very difficult
2064062 2066599 in terms of the visual effects<br />of the comps for driving.
2067983 2069644 But it was worth it.
2069734 2071691 Our colorist, Alex Bickel,<br />really figured out
2071778 2074361 how to make<br />these lights glow in a beautiful way.
2076032 2077898 And Jason's one of the best<br />improvisors on earth
2077993 2080610 and he improvised<br />a huge amount of this.
2082289 2084496 Including this description<br />of the novel he's writing,
2084583 2085994 which really made us laugh.
2086084 2090123 Katie and I were just kind of buckled<br />over at the monitor howling, laughing.
2090255 2094795 I don't know what to do once...<br />you know, when she gives birth, but...
2094884 2101096 It was fun also to see the actresses<br />observing a veteran improvisor
2101182 2103219 and just watch their awe
2103310 2106473 as he continued<br />to come up with material.
2106563 2108770 They were just really<br />really delighted by it.
2109983 2113772 I love that little psycho look<br />he gives to the mirror.
2114487 2115693 So working with Jason was great
2115780 2120115 because we've improvised together<br />on stage at UCB or Second City,
2120201 2122408 but I've never directed him before.
2123038 2124824 And it was really fun to see
2124914 2128123 how he just takes a tiny bit<br />of information and rolls with it.
2128209 2131327 And he was just making<br />everybody laugh so hard.
2131421 2133628 And it was difficult stuff,<br />because he's pretending to drive.
2133715 2136707 They're actually on a sound stage.<br />It's all green screen.
2136801 2139964 And he was<br />the best fake driver that we had.
2140055 2141762 Everyone was very impressed.
2142307 2144799 And he was just a great example<br />for the girls
2144893 2147885 of just rolling with it<br />and taking the opportunity of a scene
2147979 2150220 and turning it into something<br />much, much more.
2150315 2151897 I had the lives of 100 people<br />in my hands.
2151983 2156693 WILDE: So this is the Sully joke<br />that we love so much.
2156780 2159943 Of course, Sully being the pilot<br />who successfully saved the lives
2160033 2163116 of over a hundred people<br />landing a plane in the Hudson river.
2163203 2165740 And we love the kind of references<br />that the girls throw out
2165830 2167446 are so kind of beyond their years,
2167540 2172125 using references like Ken<br />Burns, Malala, Sully Sullenberger.
2172212 2174328 ...just a sexy documentary.<br />It's a hot doc.
2174422 2175287 WILDE: It really made us laugh.
2175382 2177419 ...those women are<br />European trafficking victims.
2177509 2179591 Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging<br />other people's sexual preferences?
2179678 2183421 WILDE: And here's a another example<br />of the language
2183515 2186598 being so specific to the film<br />and specific to these characters,
2186685 2192021 that they talk about sex positivity<br />and feminism and pornography
2192107 2196066 in terms of education and empowerment,
2196152 2199736 and I just haven't seen that<br />from teenage characters before
2199823 2202360 and it feels really reflective<br />of gen Z
2202450 2204532 and the way that they kind<br />of move through the world.
2204619 2206530 So I was really proud of that scene.
2207872 2211786 I also love that moment where Kaitlyn<br />puts the ear pod in Beanie's ear.
2212377 2214084 Such a loving little gesture.
2215964 2218205 So this was a choice<br />not to show the porn,
2218925 2221883 because the girls<br />were so good, they're so--
2221970 2224507 Their expressions are so evocative<br />of what they're watching.
2224597 2227180 We Kind of didn't need<br />to cut to the porn.
2228017 2229553 We can imagine, we kind of project
2229644 2233308 the worst version of pornography<br />onto what's on that screen.
2234441 2236398 - Do you have a phone charger?<br />- No, I don't.
2236484 2239226 There's Kaitlyn<br />pretending to be sweating,
2239863 2241900 which really, really<br />just makes me laugh.
2242741 2245028 And that little moment<br />with the chargers.
2245118 2248611 And it's all about the details<br />that we think really make up
2248705 2251117 what makes this texture<br />of this film really work.
2251207 2253448 There's just so many layers<br />to everything,
2253543 2256626 but the idea is to not make<br />that too apparent, of course,
2256713 2259455 but here is the porn.
2260216 2262628 We purposely picked<br />whatever would be
2262719 2265552 the most horrifying porn<br />you could imagine.
2265638 2268380 And Katie Silberman found this one.
2268475 2272844 She dug this one up for us<br />and it's just the perfect choice.
2272937 2276180 She really nailed it,<br />really nailed it.
2279903 2280984 Was that Cardi B?
2281070 2283437 Of course that was Jason improvising
2283531 2286489 and it's really fun<br />to hear the reaction in a theater.
2287452 2289534 Everybody laughs very hard.
2289621 2292158 So this house is a house where--
2292248 2296708 We actually went to a real immersive<br />theater party here,
2296795 2300288 this weird theatrical experience<br />called The Willows,
2300381 2303419 and it really inspired this scene
2303510 2305217 and the production design<br />within this scene.
2305303 2307010 I forced Katie Byron,<br />our production designer,
2307096 2310259 to come with me to The Willows<br />so she could study,
2310350 2315095 and it's a very weird<br />and specific experience.
2315188 2317020 But I love that this is exactly<br />the party
2317106 2319063 that George and Alan<br />would wanna throw.
2320401 2321641 I've been planning it for months.
2321736 2323067 WILDE: This was<br />one of our first days of shooting
2323154 2327648 and it was incredibly difficult work.<br />So many quick pivots and moves
2327742 2333033 and it was a mixture<br />of grounded performance and broad
2333122 2334704 and they're all nailing it.
2334791 2337749 That's Austin Crute wearing drag<br />for the first time
2337836 2342831 and he really just looks beautiful.<br />And I think he felt really good.
2342924 2346258 He just rocked those heels.<br />I love this moment.
2346553 2349887 I only know sorrow...<br />and grief.
2349973 2351384 Okay, you're at a ten.
2351474 2355138 WILDE: Austin Crute was graduating<br />from NYU while we shot this
2355228 2357139 and he had to send a paper<br />to his professor
2357230 2358561 the night we were shooting this.
2358648 2364564 So in between every shot he was off<br />to the side finishing a term paper
2364654 2367567 and we were all rooting<br />for him to graduate, which he did.
2367949 2369314 Adorable farmer, new to the city.
2369450 2372533 WILDE: Inside these packets are actually<br />real character descriptions
2372620 2375954 that Katie Silberman wrote,<br />which was just incredible.
2376040 2380580 I mean, the level of detail on the part<br />of every single department head,
2380670 2384038 from producer, screenwriter down<br />through everyone in the art department,
2384132 2387250 it was a lot of love that made<br />the experience
2387343 2389334 just much, much more interesting.
2389429 2390885 ...I think. Maybe the mayor?
2391723 2394010 Go! Immerse yourselves.
2394100 2396888 Review your histories in the parlor.
2397478 2400687 WILDE: And this is Noah Galvin<br />just being brilliant.
2401816 2404023 And Billie Lourd<br />in this moment,
2404110 2406898 we wanted the reveal to be kind<br />of the introduction of Gigi
2406988 2410777 as a magical creature who can<br />teleport herself through time and space
2410867 2413700 in an impossible way,<br />but we all know a girl like that.
2413786 2415493 Aaron, I can see you breathing.
2416748 2419035 WILDE: This is, I have to say--<br />there are so many examples
2419125 2422163 of how beautiful<br />the cinematography is in this film,
2422253 2425245 but Jason McCormick,<br />our cinematographer,
2425340 2428708 really nailed the different textures<br />of this scene.
2428801 2430007 That little girl I have to say,
2430094 2433428 that's my goddaughter,<br />that's Bluesy Burke
2433514 2436222 and I'm really proud of her<br />that she's in the movie.
2436309 2440769 But Jason McCormick really understood<br />that we wanted to create a comedy
2440855 2445395 that had a style that made it feel<br />specific and elevated
2445485 2448477 and we wanted to introduce all these<br />different environments stylistically.
2448571 2449777 The theater party,<br />the boat party,
2449864 2453528 Nick's party, school, graduation,<br />they all have a different texture.
2454243 2456951 We're shooting in 2:4 anamorphic
2457038 2459951 and it's not typically<br />how comedies are shot.
2460750 2464664 But I was influenced<br />by comedy directors...
2465755 2470625 who find a way to create that balance<br />between style and material.
2470718 2472129 You think about the Coen brothers,
2472220 2474461 they don't sacrifice<br />the comedy for the style,
2474555 2477388 but it's so specific and they're<br />kind of unafraid of that choice.
2477475 2479512 So I was really inspired by them.
2479602 2482970 - ...fantastic.<br />- What... do you mean?
2483481 2487850 WILDE: This is this shot is lit<br />by that single bulb and nothing else,
2487944 2492404 which I think a lot of cinematographers<br />shooting a comedy would balk at,
2492490 2495778 and instead Jason McCormick couldn't have<br />been more supportive of the idea
2495868 2500078 of, "Yeah, let's light it with one bulb.<br />Why not? Make it moody."
2501249 2504241 There's Kaitlyn<br />is starting to melt down.
2504585 2509421 I have to say, Noah Galvin improvised<br />with that statue for 40 minutes
2509507 2510793 and I wish I could<br />have it all in the movie.
2510883 2513124 So here we're approaching a scene,
2513219 2515802 which was one<br />of our biggest swings we took
2515888 2521054 in terms of out-of-the-box<br />tonal departures
2521144 2524102 that we wanted to have<br />throughout the film.
2524188 2526179 And the Barbie trip is one
2526274 2529642 that I've been dreaming about creating<br />for several years,
2529736 2533229 and I'm really happy that we actually<br />got it in the movie.
2533322 2537065 It was the work of several artists<br />over about six months.
2537160 2538696 ♪♪
2538828 2541195 A team out of Portland<br />called ShadowMachine,
2542040 2546705 who created the stop-motion animation,<br />built the puppets.
2548755 2550837 That bell.<br />I wish we could've kept that bell
2550923 2552834 going for another minute.<br />It's so funny.
2552925 2554131 So here we are.
2554218 2556129 We had to shoot this<br />in two different pieces.
2556220 2560509 'Cause everything you see that's<br />stop-motion is shot in Portland,
2560600 2564059 and everything that doesn't involve<br />the stop-motion is in Los Angeles.
2564145 2569311 So this was the interweaving of several<br />different people's hard work.
2570234 2571770 Fuck, that hurt!
2572028 2574065 And the idea behind the sequence is,
2574155 2576738 what is the worst possible<br />bad trip nightmare
2576824 2578861 for two ardent young feminists?
2578951 2580908 It's that they would become<br />the physical manifestation
2580995 2583487 of the patriarchy,<br />of objectification.
2583581 2587119 They'd become these big breasted,<br />impossibly skinny creatures
2587210 2591499 that young girls are exposed<br />to from the youngest of ages.
2592381 2594292 And what is that telling us?<br />What's the kind of messaging
2594383 2597876 we're perpetuating through the idea<br />of Barbie dolls?
2597970 2602760 So in Molly and Amy's worst nightmare,<br />they become those images
2603267 2604883 and the only thing<br />that could make that worse
2604977 2607139 is if one of them started<br />to actually like it,
2607230 2609221 which is, of course,<br />what happens to Amy.
2610274 2612106 "Put your heel in my hole"
2612193 2614730 is a Katie Silberman line<br />that I will never forget.
2617406 2618487 Where's my vag?
2618574 2620531 WILDE: Now it was funny--<br />when we were creating these dolls,
2621369 2625909 I knew I wanted them to be<br />extreme versions of the Barbie-like doll,
2625998 2630743 so I needed really ridiculously tiny<br />waists and immovable knees,
2630837 2634956 and long, skinny legs<br />and big, big boobs.
2635049 2637666 And the puppet creators<br />were like, "who is this lady?"
2637760 2639797 I kept saying, "Bigger boobs. Bigger."
2641389 2644006 Because we needed it<br />to make our point, of course.
2644308 2645969 Because I feel pretty good.
2646519 2650478 WILDE: The girls are actually recording<br />this dialogue largely on their phones
2650565 2652306 because we kept rewriting the scene.
2652400 2658487 So they were sending me dialogue<br />from their respective locations,
2658573 2663033 and we used a lot of iPhone recording<br />for this, which is pretty amazing.
2663119 2667534 I give it up to Apple<br />for sound quality on iPhone recordings.
2668166 2670533 Stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop.
2671210 2673998 WILDE: This was, as you can imagine,<br />pretty hard to animate.
2674088 2677297 This sequence here took several,<br />several weeks.
2677383 2678999 ...bacon-wrapped dates is over,
2679093 2681050 why don't we play<br />a rousing round of...
2681137 2682002 WILDE: Just love it.
2682138 2684004 (objects clattering)
2684265 2685596 WILDE: So this was our way of tying in
2685683 2687674 the experience<br />of the bad trip with reality,
2687768 2691102 that they would still be<br />coming down off the drugs,
2691189 2693430 and would still be very stiff.
2693524 2696858 - Who is she supposed to be?<br />- The orthodontist.
2698154 2701692 And this is-- it's a comedy<br />of errors sequence,
2701782 2703648 which really was the intention,
2703743 2705859 and I think these actors are just<br />so incredible
2705953 2707443 that they pulled it off effortlessly.
2707538 2709950 And it brings us to this moment<br />where the momentum
2710041 2713659 slows long enough<br />for us to have the conversation
2713753 2716666 that ends up being very revealing<br />about Beanie's character.
2716756 2719373 Dude, nothing has gone<br />according to plan tonight.
2719467 2721208 Which is why we have<br />to stick to the plan.
2721302 2722963 - Let's call another Lyft.<br />- Why are you being so...
2723054 2724715 WILDE: So this was a scene<br />that was actually interesting.
2724805 2727718 We-- Katie and I ended up rewriting<br />this scene on the day...
2728893 2731681 which was pretty thrilling, actually.
2731771 2734263 It was-- it's a memory that I'll cherish,
2734357 2735643 because when you're under the gun
2735733 2740603 and you have to solve problems<br />very quickly on set,
2740696 2744781 it's a thrill if you have a screenwriter<br />like Katie with you.
2744867 2748826 But we were able to tighten this scene
2748913 2753498 and make it really illustrate exactly<br />what we wanted to
2753584 2755074 about the friendship between the girls
2755169 2756534 and the devotion,<br />the love between them
2756629 2760497 and the insecurities<br />that Molly is harboring.
2762927 2764292 Another great Gigi moment,
2764387 2768426 just the magical kind of--<br />she looks like Glinda the Good Witch,
2769183 2774303 just popping up everywhere.<br />Just thrilling. I love her so much.
2776274 2780108 So here-- this scene was<br />really about Amy telling Molly
2780194 2782902 "there's nothing you could tell me<br />that would make me judge you."
2782989 2787153 There's nothing about you<br />that could be wrong, so it's fine.
2787243 2790656 Your deepest, darkest insecurity to me
2790746 2794956 is really fine and actually beautiful<br />and it's part of the reason I love you.
2795042 2796953 So that's the point behind this scene.
2798671 2802380 And this is inspired by all the female<br />friendships that I've had in my life.
2802466 2806755 I've had the blessing<br />of having a lot of really good friends
2806846 2810805 who always remind me of my value<br />in my lowest moments,
2810891 2812757 and that's really<br />what it's all about.
2814645 2817603 Beanie Feldstein's performance<br />here is pretty magical.
2817690 2822400 She refuses to let her guard down,<br />even with Amy,
2822486 2826901 which shows us that she's hardened<br />to a pretty deep place
2826991 2830234 and she's had to be that way, she's--<br />this is a defense mechanism.
2832371 2834078 So that's a real slap.
2834749 2837036 Because it's very hard<br />to make a fake slap look real,
2837126 2840289 so I had to tell Kaitlyn,<br />"You gotta hit her once."
2840379 2843792 It wasn't too hard. It wasn't too hard.<br />We sweetened up the sound.
2843883 2845089 It wasn't actually that sharp.
2845176 2847759 ...gorgeous creature this high school<br />and this earth...
2847845 2849586 WILDE: That was inspired<br />by a friend of mine
2849680 2851921 who once when I was<br />pretty low on myself,
2852016 2853882 she said, "I'm sorry, have you met you?"
2853976 2856058 And I thought, "What a loving thing<br />to say to a friend."
2856145 2858728 So that's what I was thinking about<br />as we shot this.
2859106 2861564 If Nick's what you want,<br />then that's what you deserve.
2861859 2863224 WILDE: And it's just<br />a really loving moment,
2863319 2865481 without ever allowing it<br />to get too saccharin.
2865571 2867733 And of course, at this point we have<br />to pick up the momentum again.
2867823 2870281 We don't allow ourselves<br />to slow down for too long ever.
2870368 2872575 We know this is a moving train.
2872661 2878282 This movie should feel like a fast<br />drive with lots of interesting turns.
2879835 2883294 That slow-mo walking shot through<br />the library is one of my favorites.
2884048 2885504 And I just love the juxtaposition
2885591 2887423 between the environment<br />and their attitude.
2887510 2890002 Most people don't associate<br />the library
2890096 2893339 with badass action heroes
2893432 2895844 and yet it's exactly<br />what it feels like to them.
2895935 2896970 (yells)
2898521 2901263 WILDE: Incorporating the social media<br />footage into the rest of the film
2901357 2902472 was an interesting challenge.
2902608 2905942 We went through several different<br />versions of how we would do that.
2906570 2908811 We settled<br />on the most timeless simple version
2908906 2910897 of how to bring in the iPhone videos.
2910991 2915531 This is a Steadicam shot<br />that I really feel proud of.
2915621 2919535 Chris Haarhoff, our operator,<br />just nailed this perfectly,
2919625 2925621 and it involved choreographing<br />several non-actors
2925714 2927546 who were actually<br />pizza chefs back there,
2927633 2933128 that were just lovely<br />and sweet to allow us to choreograph
2933222 2936340 some fun pizza movement<br />to create this one shot.
2936434 2940177 This is Mike O'Brien,<br />playing Pizza Pat.
2941063 2945557 He is an incredible writer, SNL alum,
2945651 2948734 Second City alum, UCB,
2948821 2952485 really just a well-known comedy legend
2952575 2955909 and this scene<br />is one of our favorites.
2955995 2958953 The hair masks, something created<br />by Katie Silberman,
2959039 2964000 is something that I am very happy<br />to see a lot of young women emulating
2964086 2967750 and showing on social media<br />already, which is just great.
2969091 2970957 The idea of creating a mask<br />with your own hair
2971051 2974464 is just something I have never seen<br />and they look like little Chewbaccas.
2974555 2975966 It's really great.
2976056 2978548 And you just willingly got<br />in the car of a strange man?
2978642 2980053 Do you guys have a weapon?
2980144 2982181 WILDE: The hair mask is something<br />that Katie came up with
2982271 2984262 and she knew right away<br />this was the right idea.
2984356 2987565 It actually came from an original idea<br />that they would be in actual masks,
2987651 2992612 that at the theater party it would be<br />a "sleep no more" vibe.
2992698 2995861 It would be sort of an Eyes Wide Shut<br />mask party,
2995951 2997441 so that they would<br />still have the masks.
2997536 2999573 And one we lost the masks<br />from that scene,
2999663 3003031 which I think was the right choice,<br />Katie replaced the physical masks
3003125 3007744 with the hair masks and it was<br />just an example of a great solve
3007838 3010830 that adds to something even funnier<br />than what you had before
3010925 3016796 and creates this iconic specific<br />and original look that I'm so proud of.
3016931 3019764 ...in, like, 40 minutes,<br />take you to some cabin...
3019892 3021257 WILDE: So this was planting<br />the information
3021352 3023434 there might be something<br />kind of off about Pizza Pat.
3023521 3025228 Why does he know so many details
3025314 3026804 about how he would actually<br />kidnap them?
3026899 3028856 - What?<br />- No, I'm not gonna think about--
3028943 3030684 WILDE: And of course,<br />that pays out later.
3030778 3032519 ...to where you delivered<br />this huge order tonight.
3033572 3036280 WILDE: So they're on a mission,<br />and they're willing to take great risks
3036367 3037653 in order to find this information.
3037743 3041281 But again,they're not the greatest<br />criminals, as he points out,
3041372 3042988 because they don't have a weapon
3043082 3045244 and this wasn't<br />very well thought through.
3045334 3046699 But it works.<br />He gives them the address.
3046794 3049377 ...SO stupid, some dog walker's<br />gonna find your bodies...
3049463 3050453 WILDE: They do get lucky.
3050548 3053085 The kindness of strangers<br />prevents any real danger.
3053259 3055876 - Don't show me your pass code.<br />- Oh, that's fair. Okay, I'm sorry.
3055970 3057711 That's the whole thing with pass codes.
3057805 3059387 WILDE: I think this is another example
3059473 3063467 of Beanie Feldstein's<br />incredible physical comedy
3063561 3067395 mixed with intelligence and knowledge<br />of exactly what the scene is about.
3067481 3070599 And Kaitlyn Dever always creating<br />texture to a scene,
3070693 3072855 always doing something<br />that takes it up a notch.
3072945 3074151 - Yeah, why not?<br />- Oh, great!
3074238 3076900 I'm being sarcastic!<br />Get the fuck out of my car!
3076991 3079107 - Thank you so much for your help!<br />- Don't trust people.
3079201 3082159 WILDE: This is another use<br />of the Discovery track
3082246 3085784 that kind of becomes our cue<br />that things are moving forward.
3085874 3087239 You were incredible!<br />You were so scary!
3087334 3088870 WILDE: This is handheld footage.
3088961 3091828 I tried to use handheld whenever<br />we needed to reflect
3091922 3095040 a certain kind of kinetic energy<br />and excitement or chaos,
3095134 3097091 so this is Jason McCormick, our DP,
3097177 3099885 actually operating handheld,<br />which he's very, very good at
3099972 3101337 and I love how this turned out
3101432 3105847 with the beautiful pink and green light<br />of the Lido's pizza sign
3105936 3112683 and this strange, little, neon-lit<br />strip mall that's so iconically LA to me.
3113861 3116273 Porn. We streamed a lot of porn.
3116363 3118980 WILDE: Also a bit of an homage in my mind<br />to the scene in Clueless,
3119074 3123568 where Cher is held up in the strip mall,<br />this idea that LA kids find themselves
3123662 3126780 in these strip malls in the middle<br />of the valley and need rides.
3126874 3128535 They desperately need a ride.
3129543 3131250 -Pick up, pick up, pick up!<br />-Who are you calling?
3131337 3132452 Hi, it's Molly and Amy.
3132546 3134662 We're at Lido's Pizza<br />on Victory Boulevard. We are stranded.
3134757 3136794 WILDE: It's a real pizza place,<br />great pizza.
3137509 3140001 They were very kind<br />to let us shoot there.
3140095 3141927 By the way this is 4 a.m.<br />that we're shooting this.
3142014 3144221 The girls have limitless energy.
3145017 3148430 That Daisy's Nail sign is a little nod<br />to my daughter Daisy.
3148520 3150227 It was fun.
3150856 3153518 So this is a moment<br />where we really wanted to
3153609 3155976 create a kind of "all is lost" lull
3156612 3161527 and then introduce<br />Miss Fine as the hero that saves them.
3161617 3162607 You girls need a ride?
3162701 3164692 WILDE: And that just iconic moment
3164787 3166949 of her stepping out and saving them,
3167039 3172580 it's something that felt worthy<br />of this Jurassic 5 needle drop.
3173587 3176796 She couldn't be more--<br />she couldn't be cooler,
3176882 3180466 she couldn't be more powerful<br />within their lives in their story.
3180969 3183961 But they cannot decide<br />who can sit shotgun,
3184056 3186798 so they both have to sit in the back,<br />which made us laugh so hard.
3186892 3189554 Okay, wait. So, what is<br />this address I'm taking you to?
3189645 3191227 It's, uh, Nick Howland's aunt's...
3191313 3193600 WILDE: You know the challenge<br />in a movie that has a lot of car rides
3193691 3195898 is not to make it feel<br />redundant or slow.
3196485 3201696 So this was a process of figuring out
3201782 3204774 how to make it feel like<br />we're continuing to move forward
3204868 3211080 and the cars are part of a story<br />that is very much LA-centric,
3211166 3213077 where a lot of life happens in cars,
3213168 3216456 but also just to show them learning<br />something from each cameo.
3216547 3220256 Each person who comes into their life,<br />each adult teaches them something.
3220342 3223084 It was sort of a Wizard of Oz structure,
3223178 3228969 that each friend that Dorothy makes<br />teaches her something about herself.
3229059 3232393 And here's what's--<br />Miss Fine is the Scarecrow,
3232479 3233969 teaching them about courage.
3235065 3236931 She says, "Don't be like me.<br />Go for it.
3237025 3238766 Go for it now or else<br />you'll regret it later.”
3238861 3240727 ...another Mango-A-Go-Go<br />ever again.
3241739 3243730 WILDE: That Mango a Go Go joke<br />really made me laugh.
3243824 3246907 Jessica Williams<br />is, of course, a comedian
3246994 3251830 and she came up with that<br />and really just flattened me.
3251915 3253076 I love it so much.
3253667 3257456 - What are you two wearing?<br />- We were thinking...
3257796 3260379 WILDE: I love the idea that they--<br />it never occurred to them
3260466 3263834 that it was a problem that they were<br />wearing matching jumpsuits.
3266096 3267427 I just love-- I love this two-shot,
3267514 3269300 I love what's happening<br />on both their faces.
3269391 3273476 Molly couldn't be more disappointed
3273562 3276350 that Miss Fine<br />disapproves of their look
3276440 3278431 and yet it leads to this opportunity
3278525 3280857 to touch and, in fact,<br />wear her clothing,
3280944 3282901 which is, of course, overwhelming.
3283405 3285737 So here they are. They finally<br />made it to their destination.
3285824 3287781 This house is in Encino.
3287868 3291031 It's an incredible architectural gem.
3291705 3292911 - I have no breath.<br />-What?
3292998 3295786 WILDE: And I was really, really lucky<br />to be able to shoot here.
3295876 3296991 - It's too perfect.<br />- You are literally...
3297085 3300874 Another example of the compliment-off<br />that, you know,
3300964 3304252 if Miss Fine doesn't stop this,<br />they would go on for hours.
3304343 3305799 There's nothing<br />that makes them happier.
3305886 3306796 ...fucking shiny?
3306887 3309049 Can you fetch me an inhaler?<br />"Cause I can't breathe, Amy.
3309139 3311597 - My eyes. Ow, ow!<br />- I'm physically unable...
3311683 3313890 - My eyes hurt so bad from your beauty.<br />- Um, exsqueeze me...
3313977 3315968 WILDE: Just an aggressive amount<br />of love for each other.
3316063 3317303 ...a party to get to.
3317397 3319229 - (girls chuckle)<br />- All right.
3319316 3320898 I will see you two inside,<br />all right? (laughs)
3321360 3323146 WILDE: So there's a moment,<br />they truly don't believe
3323237 3325399 that Miss Fine<br />would ever come inside,
3326281 3329444 but she's testing the waters<br />to see how weird would it be?
3329535 3333449 "Could I go in?<br />Technically I was invited by Theo."
3333539 3335871 Okay, so in the background<br />you hear a Santigold track,
3335958 3339542 Look at These Hoes, which I love<br />because of the drum beat intro,
3339628 3341335 building this anticipation.
3341964 3344877 The girls are finally<br />at the doors of Oz.
3344967 3347584 They have reached their destination,<br />but they're terrified.
3347678 3351797 They have no idea if they'll be shooed<br />out of the house immediately
3351890 3355508 or what will be greeting them inside.
3355602 3358685 They have no reason to believe<br />that they'll be greeted warmly.
3360941 3364184 But they've made it and it's everything<br />they dreamed it would be.
3364278 3367566 Now this is a sequence<br />that I'm very, very, very, very proud of.
3368615 3370572 The idea behind this was to show
3370659 3375119 that for all her intensity<br />and for all her defense mechanisms,
3375205 3378288 Molly is actually the most<br />romantic character in the film.
3379126 3382414 She dreams of Nick<br />sweeping her off her feet
3382504 3384711 and here we get to see exactly<br />what that feels like to her.
3384798 3387961 And it was about creating<br />this visceral connection to Molly
3388051 3389712 in a way that Amy<br />doesn't even know her,
3389803 3393046 but the audience is peeking in<br />to how she really feels about him.
3393599 3395465 And I wanted to create this iconic,
3395559 3399553 1940's Hollywood<br />sweeping dance number
3399646 3402855 that's inspired by Singing In The Rain,
3402941 3405808 and the Gene Kelly/Cyd Charisse<br />dance number
3405903 3408611 that is, of course,<br />iconic and fantastical.
3410324 3415160 And this is one shot on Steadicam.<br />It is choreographed by Dana Thomson,
3415245 3417327 and Chris Haarhoff,<br />who's operating here,
3417414 3420247 had to effectively be one of the dancers
3420334 3424202 in order to move smoothly<br />between them and capture this in one.
3425339 3428457 The lighting design is cued<br />by the choreography itself.
3428759 3433094 Dan the Automator created that incredible<br />score to go along with that.
3433180 3435467 That's actually my breath<br />on top of the track,
3435557 3437969 which was<br />a pretty funny thing to record.
3439061 3440677 And there she is. She snapped out of it.
3441688 3444146 Amy doesn't even know where Molly<br />went in that moment, but we know,
3444232 3447691 which prepares us for the expectations<br />Molly has for this party
3447778 3449815 and for her interactions with Nick.
3449905 3452943 Here's Tanner welcoming them<br />with open arms.
3453033 3456526 Nico Hiraga decided to wear<br />his overalls backwards,
3456620 3459908 which I think is pretty iconic<br />and I hope it becomes a thing.
3461792 3463203 So any time you shoot a party scene,
3463293 3466502 it's a challenge to focus<br />on your lead characters
3466588 3468454 amidst a chaotic environment.
3468548 3472758 But to keep everything feeling real,<br />to keep everything moving,
3472844 3475302 there's nothing I hate more<br />than seeing bad pantomime.
3475389 3478472 So we worked very hard on creating<br />the texture of this party.
3478558 3481846 It meant I played<br />a lot of real music loud on set.
3481937 3484224 - No! No.<br />- Yep. (trills)
3484314 3486681 WILDE: This is a little added moment<br />we put in there,
3486775 3489984 so another opportunity for Gigi<br />to pop up out of nowhere.
3490070 3491652 I think we shot that at 4 a.m.
3491738 3493820 <i>N'</i>
3493907 3497025 So here we see-- with the incredible<br />Lizzo track "Boys,"
3497119 3500032 we see Miss Fine walk in
3500122 3503615 and we remember Theo<br />actually invited her
3503709 3505666 to this party in class earlier today.
3505752 3510087 Oh, I, am out.
3510507 3512214 Oh, I, am out.
3512300 3514667 WILDE: So this is a is a scene<br />I love very much.
3514761 3518425 Victoria Ruesga playing Ryan here,<br />she's a new actress.
3518515 3520005 She's actually<br />a professional skateboarder,
3520100 3522592 acting for the first time in this film,<br />and hopefully not the last.
3522686 3523801 She's wonderful.
3523895 3525932 And this scene was all about showing
3526023 3528185 that she has<br />so much love and kindness,
3528275 3531518 but it's easily misinterpreted<br />as romantic interest.
3532029 3536489 And we had a lot of fun shooting this,
3536575 3540489 because it's the moment<br />Amy's kind of been waiting for.
3540579 3543196 - Oh, shit. That's crazy.<br />- Would you be afraid...
3543290 3546123 WILDE: And Victoria is wearing<br />all her own clothes in this,
3546209 3548826 because it's just--<br />I couldn't beat with costumes
3548920 3553130 what she naturally rocks.<br />She's just a perfectly cool chick.
3553216 3554377 - RYAN: Come on, let's go.<br />- Okay.
3554468 3556459 <i>N'</i>
3557637 3559969 WILDE: This dress that Molly<br />is wearing here,
3560057 3562264 I really wanted something<br />that would stand out in this crowd.
3562350 3565183 You know when you're<br />slightly overdressed for a party
3565270 3568183 and that adds to your insecurities?
3568273 3569434 She's feeling a bit of that.
3569524 3573267 But here's Nick just welcoming her<br />SO warming-- warmly.
3573361 3575898 He's just so excited to see her,<br />which is not what she expected
3575989 3577650 but is everything that she hoped.
3577741 3579527 It's a purely ceremonial visit.
3579618 3581359 WILDE: So it's like Amy's attraction<br />with Ryan,
3581453 3583569 Molly's having the chance to realize
3583663 3587406 that the people they assume<br />have no connection with them
3587501 3589117 actually really want to connect<br />with them
3589211 3590372 and it's the girls themselves
3590462 3593079 who have been distancing<br />themselves from their peers.
3594174 3598088 This karaoke moment<br />is one that I also love.
3598178 3599464 I mean, I love every scene, of course,
3599554 3604048 but this one we told the actors about<br />this day that we shot it.
3604142 3606759 I remember telling Noah Galvin,
3606853 3608594 "I hope you know Alanis Morissette
3608688 3610895 because you're about to sing<br />"You Oughta Know"
3610982 3612598 and I want you to really belt it."
3612692 3614524 And of course it took him<br />about 40 minutes
3614611 3617194 to go learn every single word
3617864 3621778 and then he came and performed this,<br />which was just so great.
3623203 3625786 And that scene, the karaoke scene<br />is really about--
3625872 3629365 Karaoke is a chance for people<br />who reside inside their shell
3629459 3631325 to break out a little bit,
3631419 3634537 which is, of course, what Amy is<br />is about to do
3634631 3636872 in a way that is really satisfying.
3636967 3640585 And while Molly is also breaking out,<br />she's having fun,
3640679 3642841 she's playing beer pong.<br />Now I'm not good at beer pong,
3642931 3645969 so this was a moment where I had<br />to keep saying,
3646059 3648096 "What are the rules?<br />When do you drink it?"
3648186 3649472 This is cause I didn't go to college.
3649563 3651725 When you don't go to college,<br />you don't learn how to play beer pong.
3651815 3654603 So go to college Kids,<br />or else you won't know.
3654693 3656559 I used to think you were<br />all work and no play, but...
3657863 3659729 WILDE: And of course,<br />it's very easy to assume
3659823 3662406 that Nick is taking an interest here.
3662492 3664984 Mason Gooding is an incredible actor.
3665078 3667820 He's so kind
3667914 3670827 and you don't expect<br />that from such a good looking dude.
3671543 3675753 He's just so warm, which is exactly<br />what we needed for that popular kid
3675839 3678706 who seems to be<br />effortlessly able to connect
3678800 3680632 with every single person in school.
3680719 3682756 ♪ Does she know that you told me<br />you'd hold me... ♪
3682846 3685258 WILDE: I love how George is just<br />never looking at the words.
3685348 3687885 That karaoke person who just proves--
3687976 3691435 like, really works hard to prove<br />they don't need to look at the words.
3693023 3696641 And Gigi of course is supportive<br />as can be.
3698570 3699685 Perfect hype man.
3699779 3701190 And this is a chance to see Amy
3701281 3703397 really coming out of her shell,<br />really happy.
3703491 3706904 And this is the first time<br />we've seen her happy away from Molly,
3706995 3708110 which is significant.
3708205 3711573 G You seem very well I
3712375 3713911 g Things look... I
3715212 3717624 WILDE: I loved the idea of "You Oughta<br />Know" for the karaoke scene
3717714 3721048 because it's a classic<br />karaoke song at this point,
3721134 3725344 but of course, that song came out<br />in 1996, it was on Jagged Little Pill.
3725430 3729890 Alanis herself was this example<br />of a new kind of rock star woman,
3729976 3733844 incredibly passionate<br />and emotional and singular.
3733939 3738809 She's a poet who wasn't afraid to tackle<br />the issue of female anger.
3738902 3740188 And she became an icon
3740278 3743191 because she was<br />so different and such a rock star,
3743281 3746069 and Flea is performing on that track.
3746159 3750744 It is rock'n'roll to the till<br />but it's a female vocalist
3750830 3754573 really flexing<br />all of her passion and power
3754668 3756329 and that's what this scene's all about.
3756419 3759207 ...She's not supporting,<br />no breath control, but it's good.
3759297 3760253 - It's on pitch.<br />- I support you.
3760340 3762206 WILDE: And of course Kaitlyn Dever<br />is a great singer,
3762300 3763665 so she had no trouble with that.
3763760 3766092 It turns out that's actually<br />her go-to karaoke song,
3766179 3767385 which was lucky.
3768473 3769884 <i>N'</i>
3772811 3773801 Oh! (laughs)
3773895 3778765 WILDE: So we wanted to show<br />that of course Molly is fun.
3778858 3780348 She's fun.<br />We've seen her fun with Amy,
3780443 3782730 but we've never seen her<br />be able to relax with anyone else.
3782821 3787816 So here she is relaxing with Nick<br />in a really easygoing, organic way,
3787909 3793245 and it's just a delight to see her<br />be able to show that side of her
3793331 3795572 to someone<br />other than her closest friend.
3796710 3801546 This flirtation is one that I adore<br />because it's so specific to these two.
3804968 3808552 Molly is actually someone<br />who is eager to connect
3808638 3812097 and finds ways to do so<br />with really smart jokes,
3812183 3815221 but we reveal a bit<br />of her physical insecurity there.
3816813 3819726 And then Nick reveals<br />that he is a Potterhead,
3819816 3822899 and this is something that is<br />is very specific
3822986 3825068 to Katie Silberman<br />and Beanie Feldstein.
3825155 3830275 Two Potterheads, really passionate<br />about picking the house of Potter
3830368 3833451 that Beanie's character Molly<br />would be a part of.
3834456 3838199 I was not aficionado,<br />a Potterhead myself,
3838293 3843584 so I relied on them to tell me exactly<br />whether she should be a Slytherin.
3843673 3845380 It was it was really funny.
3845467 3847378 - Don't move.<br />- No, I'm not... you know...
3847469 3850882 WILDE: So this is a big tonal shift<br />in the story that's happening here.
3850972 3854010 We've reached a point where they've<br />ostensibly sort of achieved their goal
3854100 3855716 that we've set<br />from the beginning of the film.
3855810 3856971 They're here.<br />They're having fun.
3857062 3860100 They're connecting with exactly<br />the people they wanted to connect with.
3860190 3861851 So what happens now?
3861941 3864558 Now it's kind of a different<br />chapter of the journey.
3864652 3869317 Amy is following Ryan into the abyss.
3869407 3872399 She's ready to take a leap,<br />literally into the pool,
3872494 3874610 and she's gonna shed her skin and fly.
3875622 3878080 This is Perfume Genius<br />playing here, "Slip Away."
3878166 3881625 This was a really exciting discovery
3881711 3886126 when I realized that "Slip Away"<br />was the perfect song for this sequence.
3886216 3889754 I was editing this scene<br />and put on "Slip Away"
3889844 3891460 just to get a little bit of inspiration.
3891554 3894216 I put on this whole album,<br />which was called No Shape,
3894307 3897845 and I realized that it was<br />syncing up magically.
3898436 3901053 And I turned the music way up<br />and I muted the production track
3901147 3906438 and suddenly it was as though<br />we had shot this to the music.
3906528 3909441 And I got full chills<br />and became really emotional.
3910824 3911939 It's one of those magical moments
3912033 3913398 that happens sometimes<br />in an edit room,
3913493 3916781 but here you can see that the music
3916871 3918578 is adding so much dimension<br />to the scene.
3918665 3921828 That's such an emotional moment<br />for Amy. It's transformative.
3922919 3925911 Kaitlyn Dever is somehow<br />able to act under water,
3926005 3929669 which I'll never quite understand,<br />but she's that good.
3932137 3936631 The idea in the color correct<br />was to allow this to feel like flying.
3936724 3938635 It's supposed to feel ethereal.
3938726 3942890 She's unburdened completely<br />and she's comfortable.
3944149 3947813 That smile shows that she's happy.<br />She's happy on her own.
3947902 3950519 It's not just<br />about finding her love interest.
3950613 3954732 It's about feeling her sense of self.<br />She's liberated.
3956995 3959953 And then she decides to take<br />that confidence towards Ryan,
3960039 3962872 so she has to find her now.<br />She's looking everywhere.
3962959 3966748 And what she finds is<br />the worst possible discovery,
3966838 3970297 which is that Ryan<br />is not only with someone else,
3970383 3971873 but it's with a dude,
3971968 3974960 which is uncomfortable,<br />because she's been questioning
3975054 3976920 whether Ryan would be into her<br />as a woman.
3977015 3978847 And then it's not only any dude,<br />it's Nick,
3978933 3981516 who she knows her best friend<br />is pining after.
3981603 3985892 And it just means<br />the end of this high point.
3987275 3989266 They have no longer<br />achieved their goal.
3989360 3990395 The goal has shifted.
3992989 3997074 This was-- that's a shot<br />I love so much.
3997160 4000198 And this score, Dan the Automator,<br />really, really nailed it.
4000288 4004748 We worked very hard on creating<br />this kind of soundscape
4004834 4009249 that would reflect how disjointed<br />Amy's emotions feel at this moment.
4009339 4012001 She's really trying hard<br />to get out of there.
4012091 4014378 Suddenly this environment<br />which previously--
4014469 4017211 Moments before felt so exciting<br />and welcoming
4017305 4019091 now has a sinister quality.
4020642 4025011 The water looks colder.<br />The people seem further away.
4025104 4029473 It's all menacing and she wants<br />to find Molly and get out.
4030151 4033189 That's a stitch right there.<br />That's the only stitch in this sequence.
4033279 4037489 The steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff<br />was able to continue this sequence
4037575 4041614 from that point of that dress wipe<br />throughout the end of this scene,
4041704 4044492 which is not easy to do<br />and it's a testament to his talent
4044582 4047791 as well as the entire crew's<br />and the performers.
4049128 4054248 I wanted to create that feeling<br />of searching for your safe space,
4054342 4056800 which is, of course, your best friend.
4058221 4060087 I wanted to stay with Amy<br />in this moment
4060181 4061717 so we'd feel the building anxiety
4061808 4064220 and we ourselves<br />would be yearning to find Molly.
4065353 4070723 This house afforded us the opportunity<br />to really create this kind of maze.
4073403 4076941 And right there, right when things<br />are becoming kind of unbearable,
4077031 4078317 she finally finds her,
4078408 4081992 but of course Molly has no idea<br />why Amy's in this emotional state
4082078 4084160 and this leads to their greatest conflict.
4085373 4086989 So we're still in this same shot,
4087083 4090326 which meant Beanie's actually<br />been waiting for Amy,
4090420 4091910 for Kaitlyn to approach.
4092005 4095919 She's been waiting to interact<br />and to create this scene,
4096009 4098842 which I always find interesting<br />as an actor when cameras are rolling
4098928 4100760 but you're not on camera<br />for a few minutes,
4100847 4103635 and it allows you to really get<br />your head into gear,
4103725 4105636 which has something to do
4105727 4108640 with how brilliant Beanie is<br />in this scene, as is Kaitlyn.
4108730 4112394 They are extraordinary in this sequence.
4112483 4113848 It is a very difficult scene.
4113943 4115479 Amy, no.
4115570 4118107 WILDE: And they were able to do it<br />in one shot.
4118197 4121531 This is their second take,<br />which is pretty mind-blowing.
4121618 4123825 ...all night. And I'm calling Malala,<br />so come with me.
4123911 4125322 WILDE: I wanted to keep this in one
4125413 4127495 so that we'd have the chance<br />to see them listening.
4127582 4131997 You know often time when<br />you see arguments on film
4132086 4134953 you're only seeing<br />the person speaking.
4135048 4139667 And what we know is that when<br />someone receives painful information,
4139761 4143629 their reaction is spontaneous and<br />unpredictable and really fascinating.
4143723 4145088 So I wanted to make sure
4145183 4148050 we didn't lose track<br />of the experience of the characters
4148144 4153059 hearing this very, very thorny--<br />uncomfortable information.
4153149 4155686 They don't often argue<br />in this way.
4155777 4160738 It's a kind of existential crisis<br />and they're not alone.
4160823 4163736 There's people watching<br />and recording,
4163826 4165612 which is what you see happening<br />in the back slowly
4165703 4169492 as the camera is being lifted.<br />And that's actually not an effect.
4169582 4175794 That's the real iPhone flashlight<br />on the prop iPhones
4175880 4179714 which we knew would bloom in this really<br />beautiful way with these Cooke lenses
4179801 4184295 and I'm really happy<br />that we were able to achieve that
4184389 4188758 because it intensifies<br />the discomfort of the argument.
4189227 4192060 In January?<br />You've been lying to me since January?
4192146 4193807 WILDE: It's such an intimate moment
4193898 4196560 that they're sharing with people<br />they don't really know.
4196651 4198688 ...are gonna be off now.<br />We're not gonna graduate together,
4198778 4200564 we're not gonna go<br />on a post-college trip together,
4200655 4201816 we're not gonna move to DC together?
4201906 4205490 WILDE: So at this point we made<br />a decision to drop the dialogue out,
4205576 4208193 because the emotions<br />are running so high
4208287 4210699 that the words don't matter as much.
4210790 4212747 At this point they've lost control.
4212834 4216702 And we all know that feeling of being<br />in an argument you've lost handle of,
4216796 4219663 and it's just become--<br />it's become too overwhelming.
4219757 4221122 You don't even know<br />what you're saying anymore.
4221217 4223128 You're just trying to survive,<br />you're trying to win,
4223219 4226052 and you don't even know why<br />and you just want it to end.
4226973 4230887 And they're hurting each other<br />in a way that's hurting themselves.
4230977 4232843 And I wanted everyone to project
4232937 4235645 their worst painful argument<br />onto this moment,
4235732 4237973 and to bring up the score,
4238067 4240479 which was something we worked<br />very, very hard on.
4242280 4246194 And of course, suddenly<br />the sound sucks back in,
4246284 4247490 and they realize they're not alone
4247577 4248988 and that there's nothing more<br />to be said,
4249078 4253618 and we can feel the regret<br />on Molly's heart there.
4253708 4256541 Just another example<br />of Beanie's beautiful acting.
4260006 4261747 So this is a moment<br />where Amy thinks she's alone.
4261841 4263252 She's found a place to go and cry.
4263342 4266084 She's held it in successfully<br />until this moment.
4266179 4267419 But of course she's not alone.
4268514 4270676 The worst possible person is there.
4270767 4274305 Hope, who we think<br />is just a mean girl from school,
4274395 4276227 who couldn't be less sympathetic.
4277023 4278934 She's in this--
4279484 4283148 It's as though Amy's gone to hide<br />in what she thinks is an empty cage,
4283237 4287105 and it's actually a lion's cage,<br />and now she has to survive
4287200 4293162 up against this really,<br />really tough adversary
4293247 4295113 who then becomes an ally.
4295208 4299452 No. You're just one of those people<br />who claims they're honest...
4299879 4303463 WILDE: So this is a scene that was<br />really, really well written
4303549 4306962 and really exciting for<br />these actresses to play with.
4307053 4310341 'Cause it's multi-dimensional.<br />It's layered.
4310431 4314345 They're there's a lot of subtext.<br />They're dancing around something.
4314435 4318474 They feel a lot of energy<br />between them.
4318564 4320680 They don't really know what it is.
4322026 4324188 But Hope challenges Amy on purpose.
4324278 4327236 Hope wants more from Amy.<br />Hope sees Amy's fire
4327323 4333035 and she feels it's being dulled<br />by Amy's relationship to Molly.
4333621 4335487 And here's Amy defending herself,
4335581 4338949 and we see that Hope<br />is nudging her to break out
4339043 4341785 and to show her teeth a bit.
4341879 4344962 You're just a basic hot girl<br />who's gonna peak in high school.
4346133 4347669 WILDE: We made the choice<br />to lose some dialogue here
4347760 4350593 because we found those looks to say<br />more than any words ever could,
4350680 4352170 and then of course the surprise kiss,
4352265 4356509 which at first you don't know<br />if Hope receives in a positive way,
4356602 4360061 and then of course that little laugh,<br />that iconic kind of cool girl laugh
4360690 4363022 lets Amy know<br />she can go back in for another one.
4363109 4364816 <i>N'</i>
4371534 4373320 This is another Perfume Genius song.
4375496 4376361 It's so good.
4377373 4381833 We used a lot of mixture of source<br />and score sound quality in the film.
4382545 4385708 I wanted it to feel organically<br />sourced from the environment
4385798 4388039 but also a little bit thicker,
4388134 4394301 a little bigger to make the scenes feel<br />supported by anthems,
4394390 4397974 anthems that let you know<br />their significance to these moments.
4398060 4399676 These songs will always bring back
4399770 4402478 the emotional lessons<br />from these scenes.
4403441 4407230 And here's a moment where there's<br />a connection between two characters
4407320 4410062 who we, at first, thought<br />had nothing in common,
4410156 4414024 and then of course Jared is the one<br />who teaches Molly about empathy.
4414118 4416485 ...and gave you a prison tat<br />while you were sleeping?
4416579 4417944 Oh, that wasn't about me.
4419290 4420746 WILDE: This was something<br />we had to shoot quickly
4420833 4423120 because of our schedule<br />and they nailed this.
4423210 4426669 This was something I gave them<br />each two takes for
4426756 4428872 and they didn't need<br />any more than that,
4428966 4430752 because they knew<br />exactly what they were doing.
4430843 4435838 I think there's some really delicate,<br />just brilliant pivots
4435932 4439141 and moves and choices<br />made here by each of them.
4439226 4441263 Not everyone's lucky enough<br />to find someone like you and Amy.
4441354 4445848 WILDE: It's an intimate scene<br />that's still a chance
4445942 4448775 to see how they're reacting<br />individually while connecting.
4448861 4452024 It's just so good.<br />They're just so good.
4452490 4453446 Lit by that fire.
4455743 4458280 We get the sense that there<br />might be some chemistry here,
4458371 4463616 but we knew we didn't wanna be heavy<br />handed with sentimentality, ever.
4463709 4465541 ...bullshit. Audiences deserve<br />something original.
4465628 4468711 WILDE: We learn that Jared has<br />so much more to offer
4468798 4470334 than we originally expect from him.
4470424 4471539 I should probably go make sure
4471634 4473090 that's not an actual<br />dead man's float.
4473177 4477842 WILDE: He's truly the most loyal<br />and empathetic character in the film.
4481060 4483176 It only makes Molly feel more lonely
4483270 4486058 that she's lost her best friend<br />at that point,
4486148 4489561 who we see is having<br />this transformative experience.
4489652 4492394 So here's Diana Silvers<br />and Kaitlyn Dever
4492488 4496447 shooting what I wanted to be<br />an incredibly realistic intimate scene.
4496534 4499367 I wanted to finally show what--
4499453 4503788 How clumsy and funny and odd<br />sex can be,
4504375 4507288 particularly in adolescence<br />when they're still...
4507378 4511872 everything feels like<br />it's for the first time, and in fact is.
4513551 4516259 So it was about allowing for<br />the space between the characters.
4516345 4517961 You know, often times<br />you'll see in films
4518055 4520137 people just kissing constantly<br />through a scene,
4520224 4521680 and I thought it's all<br />about the space between,
4521767 4526307 the clumsiness of taking off shoes,<br />taking off jeans.
4526397 4529355 It's not posed, it's not contrived,
4529442 4532605 it's not for anyone's enjoyment<br />except theirs.
4535239 4537947 This is Cautious Clay, "Cold War."
4538034 4541698 It's a just a beautiful<br />and really sexy, moody song.
4541787 4543698 That shot there of the underwear<br />coming over the knees,
4543789 4546156 I really wanted that in there to show
4546250 4550869 that you can be incredibly provocative<br />and sexy without showing nudity.
4550963 4553921 There's no reason to show nudity<br />when you can suggest it.
4554008 4555999 It's like you know<br />the scariest parts of Jaws
4556093 4557504 are when you don't see the shark.
4557595 4560713 And I think that applies<br />to love scenes in many cases.
4561223 4562509 <i>N'</i>
4564101 4567219 That look right there from Diana<br />is just an example
4567313 4573480 of how beautifully powerful<br />she can be,
4573569 4577358 just this steadiness<br />and confidence in her gaze
4577448 4581863 that is indicative<br />of the ultimate crush.
4583579 4586071 And they're really connecting<br />and it's clumsy,
4586165 4592832 and Hope is bringing Kaitlyn--<br />Amy along on this journey, and...
4594340 4599085 and just when it's going well,<br />just when it's going well
4599845 4606057 there's this sort of faux pas on behalf<br />of Amy that she's mortified by,
4606143 4609681 but we know, we don't want her<br />to freak out too much, but she does.
4611398 4614140 You know, and this is something--<br />in shooting a scene like this,
4614235 4616602 it's a director's job<br />to make everyone feel really safe.
4616695 4618902 And I was honored<br />to have the opportunity
4618989 4621777 to create a real closed set<br />for these young women
4621867 4625531 and for these actors<br />to feel totally relaxed.
4625621 4629205 So that meant truly limiting<br />the amount of crew members involved
4629291 4633660 and it was just me, the DP,<br />who was operating handheld here,
4633754 4639045 and a focus puller and a sound person<br />and I believe that was it.
4639260 4641297 Are... are you good?
4642638 4646222 So she of course takes a sip of a drink<br />that has a cigarette in it.
4646308 4649517 It causes her to throw up<br />all over Hope and she's mortified.
4650187 4652724 The reason we needed<br />things to go badly here
4652815 4657400 is because we had to really isolate Amy<br />and bring her to her lowest point
4657486 4659978 so she could find her<br />personal individual courage.
4661073 4665032 We see her go from being with Molly<br />to being with Ryan to being with Hope,
4665119 4666655 and now finally she's alone,
4666745 4669578 which is of course where she'll find<br />her real strength, as we all do.
4672418 4675080 This is a scene we shot<br />at 5 a.m., of course,
4675171 4678914 and I asked these two to show<br />an intimacy that felt sweet.
4679008 4681921 Because there's nothing worse<br />than seeing the object of your desire
4682011 4683672 not only intimate with someone else,
4683762 4687721 but in a sweet and innocent way
4687808 4692052 that just feels almost more crushing<br />than something purely sexual.
4692396 4693978 ♪ I wanna make this play ♪
4694815 4699776 WILDE: This song is beautiful.<br />This is Rhye singing "Open."
4701530 4703771 And another just perfect needle drop.
4704366 4707529 I'm really grateful for music supervisor<br />Bryan Ling
4707620 4711113 for making sure that we had all<br />this incredible music on the soundtrack.
4713334 4715416 So when we were planning this,
4715502 4720963 I really didn't want the cops moment<br />to be something that took away
4721050 4723462 from the experience<br />of the young characters.
4724470 4726256 We've obviously seen many movies
4726347 4728634 that have the cops<br />breaking up the party,
4728724 4730010 and we made the decision
4730100 4733092 to not focus on the story<br />of the cops themselves as characters,
4733187 4737021 but to just have it be a device<br />that creates a need for Amy
4737107 4739223 to really come through<br />and show her courage.
4739360 4740395 All right, focus up.
4741362 4743899 Wait for my signal.<br />I'm gonna create a diversion.
4743989 4747482 WILDE: Kaitlyn Dever has this ability<br />to be incredibly funny in subtle ways.
4747576 4751410 She knows how to use her face,<br />her body, her voice
4751497 4756458 without ever feeling like she's lost track<br />of the emotional roots of her character.
4756543 4760502 The same goes for Beanie Feldstein.<br />This is a scene that's emotional,
4760589 4764127 but they don't ever feel that<br />you've left the world of their movie.
4764218 4765299 <i>N'</i>
4767012 4769549 This, of course, is LCD Soundsystem<br />"Oh Baby,"
4769640 4773258 a track that we were very lucky<br />to get for this sequence.
4774061 4777725 I sent this to James Murphy<br />and said, "I need you. I need this song.
4777815 4779931 It's my dream<br />to have this song in this movie,"
4780025 4782232 and he very, very kindly agreed.
4785114 4790405 So here we are on a bridge at 4 a.m.<br />and Beanie Feldstein and Molly Gordon
4790494 4794237 able to evoke<br />such subtle and beautiful emotion.
4797876 4799537 And we wanted<br />to create a situation
4799628 4803587 where these two are forced<br />to be in the same space
4803674 4806336 and forced to connect,<br />which allows them to realize
4806427 4808464 that there's not actually<br />that much space between them.
4808554 4811717 ...why people say I gave guys<br />"roadside assistance," right?
4811807 4814139 WILDE: Triple A is one of the more<br />important characters in this film
4814226 4817969 because what she shows to us<br />is that this isn't a story
4818063 4821681 just about judgment<br />and women proving their power,
4821775 4824608 women being strong, and funny,<br />and brilliant, and complicated.
4824695 4826982 It's also about the relationship<br />between women
4827781 4830148 and how women need<br />to support one another,
4830242 4833109 not participate in the pulling down<br />of each other,
4833203 4836662 which is all said in this very beautiful<br />line where she says,
4836749 4839958 "I knew the guys would say stupid shit,<br />I didn't think the girls would too."
4841128 4843460 That line is so important to this film,
4843547 4845959 and it allows Molly to realize<br />that she's been so unfair
4846050 4849133 and kind of labeling Triple A<br />and slut-shaming her.
4849762 4853130 And it's crushing for Molly to realize<br />that she's guilty of that,
4853223 4854384 but it's transformative.
4854475 4857638 She knows in this moment she won't be<br />that judgmental person ever again.
4857728 4859685 Dick Splinter<br />would say stupid shit.
4862191 4863647 WILDE: Triple A is also learning
4863734 4866021 that Molly is a vulnerable,<br />human, flawed person
4866111 4870275 and she, of course, has a personality.<br />She's-- of course is nuanced.
4871617 4874826 But it took this experience<br />to allow them to see it.
4875496 4877328 So these two, again,<br />they're best friends in real life.
4877414 4878779 Here they are, brilliant actresses
4878874 4883084 working together<br />for the first time on a sound stage,
4883170 4885161 and just nailing it.
4886256 4887417 Of course...
4888467 4891710 WILDE: Again, we always wanted<br />to undercut sentimentality with a joke.
4891804 4895638 It was important to us that we never<br />veer too far into the lane of sweetness.
4895724 4897089 I'm sorry for that too.
4899895 4901101 WILDE: This ending here...
4901188 4902098 Where the fuck do you live?
4902189 4904647 That's something<br />that came from Molly Gordon's audition,
4904733 4906519 the "where the fuck do you live"<br />was something that--
4906610 4907566 It just made me laugh so hard,
4907653 4909815 because why do people in movies<br />magically know where they're going?
4909905 4912112 There's never that awkward moment<br />of like, "What street?
4912199 4913940 Should we map it?"
4914034 4915741 Okay so "Hail to the Chief ."
4917871 4922115 "Hail to the Chief" as Molly's ringtone<br />was a sort of a last minute decision
4922209 4924621 that really made us laugh<br />in the sound mix.
4924711 4927578 And I'm happy it's in there. It's like,<br />of course this is her ringtone.
4927673 4931291 She wants to be on the Supreme Court.<br />This is the kind of person she is.
4932511 4934923 It's her alarm, it's her ring tone,<br />it's her text tone,
4935013 4937254 it's the music<br />she wants to live by.
4940727 4944265 The fun little easter eggs in there<br />of our entire post production staff
4944356 4945892 named in texts.
4945983 4947144 AMY: There are more prisons than colleges.
4947234 4950727 WILDE: That "take no prisoners" sign<br />is actually decal on the wall.
4950821 4952437 It looks like a graphic,
4952531 4956365 but it's actually something<br />we pasted up there last minute.
4956743 4957699 Shotgun.
4959329 4961366 So that "Shotgun. Just kidding,<br />I don't have one,"
4961457 4964165 that's a Katie Silberman line<br />that I hope will go down in history
4964251 4965867 as one of the best moments<br />in Booksmart,
4965961 4968419 because it certainly is<br />one of my favorites.
4968505 4972794 And here we reveal this fun little twist,
4972885 4977675 that the pizza guy is actually<br />a wanted criminal,
4978807 4981720 which allows for a trade to be made
4981810 4986179 and that frees<br />Amy early from this local jail.
4986273 4987855 I'm so sorry. My mistake.
4987941 4991559 WILDE: And this was a scene<br />that we loved so much,
4991653 4996022 because it was really a chance for them<br />to make up in a strange environment.
4996116 4998824 We wanted them to have<br />a chance to reconnect,
4998911 5000618 but in an unexpected place.
5002122 5003533 And to show that best friends,
5003624 5005991 even in the most bizarre<br />and dire circumstances,
5006084 5009293 will find a way to make jokes<br />and connect to each other.
5009379 5011211 But in this case,<br />I have so much to be sorry for.
5011298 5013585 - I was so selfish.<br />- I was being a coward.
5013675 5015336 - You called Malala.<br />- I lied...
5015427 5020593 WILDE: Molly is able to be apologetic<br />and positive at this moment
5020682 5022548 'cause she knows<br />she has a plan in her back pocket.
5022643 5027012 Amy is a little bit more discouraged<br />at this point.
5027105 5031224 She just assumes<br />they're not going to graduation,
5031318 5033935 the plan did not work out,<br />but Molly knows what they're gonna do.
5034404 5036896 I'm sorry I'm so controlling.
5038534 5041242 I just can't imagine my life without you.
5043622 5046364 WILDE: So this is actually--<br />it's a real jail in Glendale
5046458 5049166 that's not used anymore<br />but you can shoot there.
5049336 5052874 Graduation. Molly, what time is it?<br />You have to go.
5052965 5054126 WILDE: So we had<br />several different ideas
5054216 5055672 of how to get Amy out of jail.
5055759 5057716 And when I called Katie Silberman
5057803 5060545 and said, "What if they trade information<br />about the Valley Strangler
5060639 5062095 who happens to be Pizza Pat?"
5062182 5064264 And she said, "What is this?<br />A Christopher Nolan movie?"
5065852 5067468 I was like, "Let's just try it."
5067980 5071473 And we went for it and I'm just<br />so happy that audiences embraced it,
5071567 5073274 'cause I think it's really funny.
5074403 5077270 Mike O'Brien has that wanted<br />poster framed in his house now,
5077364 5078775 which makes me happy.
5079116 5080652 - No, that was my fault!<br />- AMY: Go!
5081410 5083617 Okay, Waze says 19 minutes.<br />We're doing it in seven.
5083704 5085069 WILDE: Typical Molly.
5085163 5086619 ♪♪
5087666 5090124 So we have DJ Shadow<br />and Run the Jewels here,
5090210 5092542 a perfect soundtrack
5092629 5096543 to a pretty high octane,<br />muscular car chase sequence
5097384 5100422 that involved using the team<br />from Fast and the Furious,
5100512 5106508 'cause I really wanted to achieve<br />as realistic car fast stunt driving
5106602 5110596 as we possibly could to<br />intercut with these moments,
5110689 5112851 these little vignettes of graduation,
5112941 5115808 which are moments that tie up<br />the journey of each character.
5115902 5118519 This is very much an ensemble piece,
5119531 5122273 and so we wanted them each<br />to have a moment
5122367 5124904 to kind of acknowledge<br />what they've learned,
5124995 5127612 or what's happened to them<br />on this one crazy night.
5129166 5133000 Jessica Williams doing her little purr<br />really, really works well.
5133086 5135168 - ...my queen.<br />- Hi.
5135881 5137246 So, last night was amazing.
5137341 5138923 WILDE: So here all questions<br />are answered
5139009 5141797 as to what happened<br />between Theo and Miss Fine.
5142429 5144420 But she's still a teacher.<br />He may be 20 and legal,
5144514 5148758 but she's a little too responsible
5148852 5150513 to allow it to go any further.
5150604 5151514 Bye.
5152147 5154229 WILDE: And this amazing<br />Molly Gordon performance.
5154316 5155272 Did you fuck Miss Fine?
5155359 5156520 (tires screeching)
5156610 5159272 WILDE: So in terms of editing<br />this sequence,
5159363 5162856 we really wanted to make sure we cut<br />between the chaos of this driving,
5162949 5164155 which really was chaotic.
5164242 5166233 I mean, the girls didn't know<br />what they were in for
5166328 5167910 when we pulled them on this rig,
5167996 5170613 going incredibly fast,<br />whipping around the Valley.
5170707 5172448 They just held on for dear life
5172542 5175660 and they just had never<br />experienced anything like it.
5176338 5180923 I, as an actor, have always really loved<br />any stunt performance opportunities.
5181009 5184468 And to be inside a real stunt car<br />that's being whipped around is--
5184554 5186295 It's like a rollercoaster,
5186390 5189473 but it's something that is also<br />pretty stressful
5189559 5191470 if you're not totally ready for it.
5191561 5193848 ...time on the senate floor,<br />and if a senator isn't...
5193939 5197022 WILDE: Skyler Gisondo just nailing<br />this scene with Jason.
5197109 5198725 I want them to do<br />more movies together.
5198819 5201060 Skyler reminds me<br />of a young Jason Bateman.
5201154 5207150 He is just extraordinary and this scene<br />just really, really makes me laugh.
5208245 5209701 (laughing) Oh!
5209788 5212200 WILDE: So we put the camera<br />on everyone in the ensemble.
5212290 5215408 We had cameras on them<br />in the audience during this sequence
5215502 5217539 and Noah Galvin<br />and Austin Crute
5217629 5222089 just kept giving us so much great<br />improvised moments,
5222175 5225042 so many great moments that we just<br />ended up using them a lot.
5225137 5226673 And they're--
5226763 5227753 Like this...
5228724 5229680 "Good morning."
5230517 5231723 "I'm Molly Davidson."
5232352 5236141 WILDE: So the idea of-- this is<br />how awesome Jared is,
5236231 5237892 is that he's actually willing to give
5237983 5244104 Molly's hardcore feminist<br />manifesto speech at graduation
5244197 5245687 on her behalf.
5245782 5247147 "I am a powerful woman.
5247242 5251736 And I'm ready to take the fists<br />of my femininity to the status quo.
5251830 5256165 Straight white man, your time is..."
5256251 5257116 Okay.
5257210 5259872 WILDE: I love the environment<br />of the Valley,
5259963 5262625 the San Fernando Valley, with those<br />crazy mountains in the background.
5262716 5265083 I was really excited<br />to be able to show that.
5265177 5268044 And, of course, this stunt driving<br />was a blast.
5268138 5272598 I wanted it to be<br />just as disruptive as possible,
5272684 5274015 that these girls--<br />this is the last thing
5274102 5275388 you would expect<br />from these characters
5275479 5278267 that at the end of the movie<br />they'd be smashing through a fence
5278356 5280597 and driving at 80 miles an hour
5280692 5283810 to show up at a graduation<br />after breaking out of jail.
5283904 5288740 I mean, this is as exciting<br />and iconic as it gets.
5288825 5290782 Look who made it!
5290869 5292030 Whoo!
5292120 5293781 WILDE: This moment of them<br />holding hands
5293872 5297456 and Molly celebrating<br />Amy is so loving.
5297542 5300910 She's excited to have brought her here.
5301004 5303962 She would never have graduated<br />without Amy by her side.
5304841 5308050 But of course Molly is valedictorian<br />and this is her moment.
5308136 5309752 And as she takes the stage...
5309846 5310881 (students cheering)
5310972 5312588 ...we see her kiss Jared,
5312682 5314298 which is a moment<br />we wanted in there.
5314392 5316303 It's not about finding a boy,
5316394 5319386 but she's at this level of confidence<br />now where yeah, why not?
5319481 5322940 Kiss Jared, you know you want to.<br />It's not your whole story.
5323026 5326064 But it's a footnote that you are<br />very much worthy of.
5328865 5332074 And, of course,<br />this look on Jared's face.
5332160 5334276 He's just a very happy puppy.
5334371 5336738 - ...Jared did a pretty good job.<br />- Yes, he did!
5338250 5342619 WILDE: So I wanted to create<br />a golden hour warmth to this scene,
5342712 5346125 which means in reality<br />this entire graduation takes place
5346216 5348799 at a very long golden afternoon,
5348885 5352094 but it of course was...
5353723 5357057 just a beautiful, beautiful...
5358103 5359685 I just-- I'm so taken by it,
5359771 5361978 because our entire crew<br />worked so hard
5362065 5364056 to make sure<br />that we captured this graduation
5364150 5367939 in a way that would feel<br />worthy of the journey
5368029 5370737 that the girls have been on<br />up until this point.
5370824 5371859 I love this moment.
5371950 5373657 This is score that we worked<br />very hard on,
5373743 5374904 that Dan the Automator and I
5374995 5378738 and the entire team worked<br />really hard to create a subtlety.
5378832 5382575 It's actually the theme you heard<br />during their fight, simplified,
5382711 5386249 and now brought back in<br />in very different moment between them.
5386339 5388455 Essentially, this is a breakup scene.
5388550 5391759 Molly is saying to Amy,<br />"it was perfect, but it's done."
5392721 5395759 And when Katie Silberman and I<br />realized that it was a breakup scene,
5395849 5397305 I remember we both burst out crying,
5397392 5399724 realizing, "Wait,<br />that's what this movie's about."
5400437 5401927 It's about--
5403690 5407684 Sometimes we have to leave the people<br />we love in order to grow.
5407777 5409859 But again, we had to undercut it.
5409946 5413280 There's a bit of sentimentality and love<br />and warmth and heart to this scene,
5413366 5416950 but we had to undercut it with jokes,<br />cause that's what we do.
5418622 5420283 Now these guys improvised this scene,
5420373 5422330 which you hear<br />at the end of the credits,
5422417 5425205 you can hear them<br />singing the rest of that Crocket song.
5427005 5431499 They also sang "Seasons of Love"<br />from Rent, but we couldn't afford it.
5433428 5435795 And here of course<br />we bring back Lingling.
5437724 5439886 Just to mortify you a little bit.
5440477 5442889 And this was a great chance<br />for Lisa Kudrow to play
5442979 5448019 and it was just wonderful to see<br />the girls with her in this moment.
5448109 5450146 She was just delighting<br />all of us so much,
5450236 5451818 and then Will Forte,<br />of course, as well.
5451905 5456024 And this moment when Beanie knocks<br />Lingling out of his hands,
5456117 5459451 she actually hit Will<br />very hard in this moment,
5459537 5461528 and it's amazing<br />that none of them broke.
5461623 5463785 It's a testament<br />to their sheer brilliance.
5463875 5465957 "Cause she actually<br />whacked him really hard,
5467128 5468789 and they all just held it in.
5469881 5472088 -Why is she here?<br />-Oh. Excuse me.
5472968 5474629 WILDE: So this is when we realize
5474719 5477177 Amy never told Molly<br />what happened with Hope,
5477263 5479049 and it's like there hasn't been time,
5479140 5482474 there hasn't been time to fill her in<br />on everything that happened last night.
5482560 5486554 This walk that Kaitlyn has here<br />is just incredible to me,
5486648 5490858 just trying to be confident, cool girl.<br />It is just hilarious.
5492570 5495688 And then we get to see<br />Hope embodying
5495782 5498490 what is classically,<br />I think, known in these films,
5498576 5500408 typically to be<br />the cool guy lean,
5500495 5503613 but, of course, in our movie<br />it's the cool girl lean.
5503707 5506870 Molly putting together what happened<br />based on body language.
5506960 5510373 How... Are you okay?
5511423 5513630 WILDE: I love the performances<br />in this scene.
5513717 5515299 There's so much subtext.
5516136 5517467 They're acknowledging<br />what happened
5517554 5519545 without trying<br />to make a big deal out of it.
5519639 5522506 Amy couldn't be more thrilled<br />that Hope is here...
5523393 5526260 but she's not quite sure what Hope<br />wants from her,
5526354 5527970 and she's trying to focus,
5528064 5530647 even though Molly<br />is making it very difficult
5530734 5532771 because the window<br />is directly behind Hope.
5532861 5534351 ...who has no idea<br />what they're doing...
5534487 5535443 WILDE: And then this moment.
5536781 5538692 You kinda know what you're doing.
5538783 5540069 WILDE:<br />That moment her eyebrows raised
5540160 5541776 is where we brought in the score here,
5541870 5545204 because it's just victory for Amy.
5545290 5546576 That's cool.
5546666 5547952 WILDE: She assumed<br />it had been devastating,
5548043 5548999 she would never see Hope again.
5549085 5551622 And then, of course,<br />she can barely look at her now,
5551713 5554125 because she just wants<br />to scream with happiness.
5554924 5556585 Hope is that cool person
5556676 5560795 who just never goes out of her way<br />to make you feel comfortable,
5560889 5565178 but just because of that is<br />is the pinnacle of cool.
5565268 5567930 Honestly, anywhere I can find<br />a couch to crash on.
5568021 5569477 WILDE: And then they realize<br />they have this in common,
5569564 5571146 they both want to adventure,
5571232 5574395 they both just wanna break out<br />and find themselves.
5574486 5575851 And we think, "Wait a minute.
5575945 5577982 There might be a future<br />between these two."
5580742 5583404 I love this shot of her handing her<br />the phone number.
5583495 5586283 It really makes me happy,<br />just that little moment there.
5588792 5592581 And then the love, the joy,<br />the excitement Molly has for her friend.
5592670 5594502 If you ever end up in Botswana,
5595548 5596913 you would have a couch to crash on.
5597008 5600091 WILDE: And then here we brought in<br />something that's a motif for Amy
5600178 5603842 that she-- every time<br />everything's going kind of well,
5603932 5605218 she does something to ruin it
5605308 5608300 and the score drops out there,<br />which we loved.
5608895 5613890 And then that's Hope's cowboy<br />walk away, which is iconic in itself.
5615568 5618981 This is Edward Sharp<br />and the Magnetic Zeros, "One Love."
5619239 5620354 Molly!
5620573 5622155 Amy, this thing drives like a cruise...
5622242 5623607 WILDE: Which brings us through<br />the airport scene,
5623701 5628787 which is just a moment<br />for the girls to acknowledge
5628873 5632082 that they have to say goodbye.<br />We know it's coming.
5632168 5634079 Everyone has that feeling when<br />you're approaching the airport,
5634170 5637754 you know the goodbye is imminent<br />and you try to deny that,
5637841 5641584 but you know you'll have<br />to eventually separate
5641678 5646514 and it's just so beautifully<br />performed by these two.
5647976 5649933 The silence, the nervous laughter.
5653439 5657683 This was shot in the valley<br />at a flyaway, it's a fake airport.
5657777 5659859 I'm really proud of how we made<br />it look like a real airport.
5659946 5662187 It's not quite a huge LAX-airport,
5662282 5663864 but you really feel<br />that they're at a real airport.
5663950 5666282 It's excellent work by our AD team.
5668288 5670575 Okay... bye.
5670665 5671951 WILDE: We had to shoot this<br />very quickly
5672041 5673748 'cause the sun was going down,
5673835 5676122 and the girls were able to stay<br />so focused.
5677463 5681582 But we really wanted to achieve<br />that nervousness that we understand,
5681676 5683713 it's all about pushing down the emotion.
5683803 5686670 The audience doesn't<br />want them to say goodbye either.
5687473 5689840 - Oh, gotta get that bag.<br />- Yep. Gotta...
5690643 5693351 "Gotta get that bag"<br />is one of our favorite lines.
5693438 5695975 Just saying anything<br />but the thing you really feel.
5698067 5701025 So this is Lykke Li covering<br />"Unchained Melody."
5701112 5705026 And I really wanted a love song,<br />because it's a love story.
5706492 5709029 And in some ways...
5710330 5714574 it's just heavy-handed enough
5714667 5716453 to make you feel kind of a--
5718254 5722589 Kind of laugh at how overwhelming<br />their love for each other is,
5722675 5723756 but you do connect to it.
5723843 5727336 You know that we've all felt<br />that longing for that friend
5727430 5729512 who knows us so well,<br />better than anyone.
5731351 5734889 Amy looks around just too late.<br />Molly has just left.
5736397 5739890 And she thinks, "Oh, she didn't wait.<br />She didn't wait for a last goodbye."
5740568 5741683 And I let her leave frame here,
5741778 5744236 so we would really feel<br />that was the end of Amy in our story
5744322 5747405 and we're left with Molly alone,<br />as we started the film.
5747492 5748402 Oh!
5748493 5749574 WILDE: But she's back!
5749661 5751652 So this was an idea that the girls had,
5751746 5754204 that she would actually hit her<br />with her car.
5754290 5756122 And I love it so much.
5756209 5759076 ...through a whole fucking thing.<br />What the fuck?
5759170 5761787 - I can be the last one on the plane.<br />- What's wrong with you?
5761881 5765419 - You wanna get pancakes?<br />- Fuck, yeah, I do. Fuck, yeah.
5766469 5769177 WILDE: There we go. So that ending,<br />I really love that ending.
5769264 5772928 I just wanted to smash cut out of there<br />and leave you with the hope
5773017 5776055 that they hung out for a little longer<br />before Amy had to leave.
5776145 5778853 These are water balloon shots<br />that we captured.
5778940 5781398 It's the last thing<br />we ever shot of the film.
5781484 5785569 It's 2,000 frames<br />per second water balloon hits
5785655 5789614 that allowed everyone in the cast<br />to experience the feeling
5789701 5792944 that Beanie had already had when she<br />got hit with that water balloon.
5793037 5798157 And it's really, really funny to see<br />all of them and how they react.
5798251 5800538 Of course, at the end they got me
5800628 5802710 and our cinematographer,<br />Jason McCormick,
5802797 5805004 so we got a taste<br />of our own medicine there.
