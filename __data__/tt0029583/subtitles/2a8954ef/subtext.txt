179990 182430 What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
183109 185189 Magic Mirror on the wall,
185589 188229 who is the fairest one of all?
189350 192629 Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
192709 196668 But hold, a lovely maid I see.
197709 200869 Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
201989 206669 Alas, she is more fair than thee.
206748 210628 Alas for her! Reveal her name.
211388 213547 Lips red as the rose.
214148 216508 Hair black as ebony.
216587 218947 Skin white as snow.
220388 221827 Snow White!
255585 257505 Want to know a secret?
257585 259305 Promise not to tell?
259624 263904 We are standing by a wishing well
265304 267864 Make a wish into the well
267945 270464 That's all you have to do
270544 273504 And if you hear it echoing
273584 276864 Your wish will soon come true
277863 281504 - I'm wishing<br />- I'm wishing
281583 284223 For the one I love

294062 296702 And I'm dreaming of
296783 299943 - The nice things<br />- The nice things
300022 302782 - He'll say<br />- He'll say
315581 318901 - I'm wishing<br />- I'm wishing
318981 321661 For the one I love
321741 325021 - To find me<br />- To find me
325101 328701 - Today<br />- Today
329500 331260 - Oh!<br />- Hello.
331341 333340 - Oh.<br />- Did I frighten you?
334100 336380 Wait! Wait, please.
337060 338899 Don't run away.
339580 342460 Now that I've found you
342540 346659 Hear what I have to say
347459 350019 One song
350099 353539 I have but one song
354299 358779 One song only for you
360858 366578 One heart tenderly beating
367058 370338 Ever entreating
370737 374658 Constant and true
375297 378098 One love
378177 381817 That has possessed me
382417 385177 One love
385256 389656 Thrilling me through
389737 393016 One song
393096 397216 My heart keeps singing
397296 400696 Of one love
401496 406456 Only for you
420414 422774 Take her far into the forest.
423335 425975 Find some secluded glade
426054 428455 where she can pick wildflowers.
428854 430614 Yes, Your Majesty.
430694 434334 And there, my faithful Huntsman,
434933 436693 you will kill her!
436774 439213 But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
439293 440733 Silence!
441253 444853 You know the penalty if you fail.
445933 448293 Yes, Your Majesty.
449052 451333 But to make doubly sure
451973 454012 you do not fail,
455372 459092 bring back her heart in this.
467571 471092 One song, I have but one song
485491 487131 Hello there.
487370 489010 What's the matter?
489610 491690 Where's your mama and papa?
492170 494250 Why, I believe you're lost.
494890 496690 Oh, please don't cry.
501930 503849 Come on, perk up.
504489 506369 Won't you smile for me?
506889 508369 That's better.
509489 511769 Your mama and papa can't be far.
513849 515448 There they are!
517368 519048 Can you fly?
520048 522768 Good-bye. Good-bye!
530567 532487 I can't, I can't do it.
533247 537367 Forgive me.<br />I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
537727 539167 I don't understand!
539247 541766 She's mad, jealous of you!<br />She'll stop at nothing!
541847 544086 - But, but who?<br />- The Queen.
544126 545127 - The Queen?<br />- Now, quick, child, run.
546207 547526 Run away, hide!
547607 550486 In the woods! Anywhere!<br />Never come back!
550566 554286 Now, go. Go! Go!
554806 558326 Run! Run! Hide!
671199 672439 Oh!
676398 678358 Please don't run away.
679318 681038 I won't hurt you.
683317 686398 I'm awfully sorry.<br />I didn't mean to frighten you.
686838 689797 But you don't know<br />what I've been through.
689877 692437 And all because I was afraid.
693197 695997 I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
697836 700397 What do you do<br />when things go wrong?
702317 704636 Oh! You sing a song!
732394 736274 With a smile and a song
736355 739634 Life is just like a bright, sunny day
739714 742914 Your cares fade away
743233 746514 And your heart is young
748834 752513 With a smile and a song
752593 755953 All the world seems to waken anew
756033 759073 Rejoicing with you
759152 762273 As the song is sung
764512 766952 There's no use in grumbling
767032 770272 When raindrops come tumbling
770752 774712 Remember you're the one
775232 780472 Who can fill the world with sunshine
781032 784031 When you smile and you sing
785391 788671 Everything is in tune and it's spring
788751 792031 And life flows along
792311 796990 With a smile and a song
801870 804270 I really feel quite happy now.
804350 806630 I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
806990 809430 Everything's going to be all right.
810510 813550 But I do need a place to sleep at night.
814790 817269 I can't sleep in the ground like you
817949 820109 or in a tree the way you do.
820909 824588 And I'm sure no nest would possibly<br />be big enough for me.
825828 828109 Maybe you know where I can stay.
828588 830548 In the woods somewhere?
831428 832708 You do?
833828 835748 Will you take me there?
879145 880825 Oh, it's adorable!
882185 884224 Just like a doll's house.
897864 899424 I like it here.
910583 913543 Ooh, it's dark inside.
923742 925742 Guess there's no one home.
929182 930581 Hello?
931141 932622 May I come in?
955580 956700 Oh!
960020 961980 What a cute little chair!
964459 966819 Why, there's seven little chairs!
967180 969339 Must be seven little children.
969859 973779 And from the look of this table,<br />seven untidy little children.
976699 979539 A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
984019 985618 And a shoe!
990578 993058 And just look at that fireplace.
993137 994937 It's covered with dust.
1001936 1004337 And look, cobwebs everywhere!
1004937 1007177 My, my, my!
1007256 1009376 What a pile of dirty dishes!
1011857 1013937 And just look at that broom!
1016735 1019296 Why, they've never swept this room.
1020175 1022496 You'd think their mother would...
1023056 1025095 Maybe they have no mother.
1026175 1027896 Then they're orphans.
1028576 1030256 That's too bad.
1031695 1032975 I know!
1033055 1035496 We'll clean the house<br />and surprise them.
1035575 1037855 Then maybe they'll let me stay.
1044095 1046175 Now, you wash the dishes.
1046575 1048454 You tidy up the room.
1049094 1051294 You clean the fireplace.
1051374 1053294 And I will use the broom.
1059894 1062293 Just whistle while you work
1064574 1069133 And cheerfully together<br />we can tidy up the place
1069213 1071373 So hum a merry tune
1073492 1078092 It won't take long when there's a song<br />to help you set the pace
1078172 1080333 And as you sweep the room
1080412 1082452 Imagine that the broom
1082532 1087532 Is someone that you love and soon<br />you'll find you're dancing to the tune
1087612 1091331 Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
1091412 1093772 When hearts are high the time will fly
1093851 1096011 So whistle while you work
1105131 1106891 Not under the rug.
1231242 1233722 So whistle while you work
1257361 1259601 We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
1259681 1261761 In our mine the whole day through
1261840 1266280 To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />is what we like to do
1266360 1268440 It ain't no trick to get rich quick
1268521 1270640 If ya dig, dig, dig<br />with a shovel or a pick
1270720 1275200 - In a mine<br />- In a mine
1275279 1279799 - Where a million diamonds<br />- Shine
1279880 1281879 We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
1281960 1284119 From early morn 'til night
1284199 1288639 We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />up everything in sight
1288719 1291038 We dig up diamonds by the score
1291119 1293199 A thousand rubies<br />Sometimes more
1293279 1295399 Though we don't know<br />what we dig 'em for

2221979 2223379 If the Queen finds her here,
2223459 2226779 she'll swoop down<br />and wreak her vengeance on us!
2227299 2229338 But she doesn't know where I am!
2229458 2232178 She don't, eh? She knows everything.
2232818 2234778 She's full of black magic.
2235258 2237818 She can even make herself invisible.
2239857 2242457 Might be in this room right now.
2246897 2249018 Oh, she'll never find me here.
2249457 2252497 And if you let me stay,<br />I'll keep house for you.

2553117 2555877 But you gotta admit<br />it's good and clean fun
2555997 2558718 So splash all you like<br />'Tain't any trick

2752145 2753745 He sure is cute!
2754785 2756944 You'll pay dearly for this!
2757265 2758704 Supper!
2759984 2762704 - Supper!<br />- Food. Hooray!
2766224 2767504 Hah!
2783662 2786223 Magic Mirror on the wall,
2786263 2789462 who now is the fairest one of all?
2790462 2793262 Over the seven jeweled hills
2793342 2795822 beyond the seventh fall,
2795862 2798222 in the cottage of the seven dwarfs
2798702 2802861 dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
2803741 2807821 Snow White lies dead in the forest.
2807861 2810381 The Huntsman has brought me proof.
2811341 2813741 Behold her heart.
2814741 2817140 Snow White still lives,
2817261 2819261 the fairest in the land.
2819981 2823900 'Tis the heart of a pig<br />you hold in your hand.
2824700 2826420 The heart of a pig!
2827020 2828940 Then I've been tricked!
2851379 2853338 The heart of a pig!
2854139 2855858 The blundering fool!
2856538 2859498 I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage
2859578 2862378 in a disguise so complete
2862458 2865778 no one will ever suspect.
2867698 2872697 Now, a formula to transform<br />my beauty into ugliness,
2873337 2876977 change my queenly raiment<br />to a peddlerâ€™s cloak.
2878937 2881577 Mummy dust to make me old.
2882897 2885896 To shroud my clothes,<br />the black of night.
2889736 2894296 To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
2901495 2905255 To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
2909135 2911175 A blast of wind
2911975 2914615 to fan my hate!
2916054 2918214 A thunderbolt
2919974 2922094 to mix it well.
2923734 2925014 Now,
2925974 2928933 begin thy magic spell.
2951332 2952612 Look!
2953572 2954852 My hands!
2960611 2961891 My voice!
2963651 2965011 My voice.
2969011 2971850 A perfect disguise.
2975970 2977610 And now...
2979010 2981450 A special sort of death
2982050 2983970 for one so fair.
2984930 2986570 What shall it be?
2989450 2991570 A poisoned apple!
2991889 2994290 Sleeping Death.
3053085 3055005 I'd like to dance and tap my feet
3055086 3056925 But they won't keep in rhythm
3057006 3060925 You see, I washed 'em both today<br />and I can't do nothin' with 'em
3060965 3064765 Ho-hum, the tune is dumb<br />The words don't mean a thing
3064805 3068325 Isn't this a silly song<br />for anyone to sing?
3080203 3081404 I...
3087323 3089323 Oh, gosh!
3094042 3097723 I chased a polecat up a tree<br />Way out upon a limb
3097803 3101762 And when he got the best of me<br />I got the worst of him
3101882 3105602 Ho-hum, the tune is dumb<br />The words don't mean a thing
3105722 3109322 Isn't this a silly song<br />for anyone to sing?
3176878 3179438 Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
3179557 3181437 Watch... Watch...
3184397 3185677 Thanks.
3228474 3232234 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
3232314 3234114 Hey! Hey!
3241953 3243313 Hooray!
3280751 3282471 That was fun!
3282551 3284231 Now you do something.
3284310 3285871 Well, what shall I do?
3286350 3289350 - Tell us a story.<br />- Yes, tell us a story.
3289430 3292270 - A true story.<br />- A love story.
3292790 3296230 Well, once there was a princess.
3296590 3298790 Was the princess you?
3298870 3301829 - And she fell in love.<br />- Was it hard to do?
3301910 3304029 Oh, it was very easy.
3304110 3307229 Anyone could see that the Prince<br />was charming.
3307789 3309349 The only one for me.
3309429 3311909 Was he strong and handsome?
3311989 3313669 Was he big and tall?
3313749 3317348 There's nobody like him<br />anywhere at all.
3317429 3319388 Did he say he loved ya?
3319469 3321429 Did he steal a kiss?
3321508 3324548 He was so romantic
3325348 3329348 I could not resist
3338467 3343946 Some day my prince will come
3344867 3349547 Some day we'll meet again
3350266 3355986 And away to his castle we'll go
3356826 3360186 To be happy forever
3360265 3362306 I know
3363346 3365465 Hah! Mush!
3366106 3371265 Some day when spring is here
3372145 3377185 We'll find our love anew
3377984 3382624 And the birds will sing
3383624 3388224 And wedding bells will ring
3389664 3394823 Some day when my dreams
3395464 3398743 Come true
3410862 3412743 Oh, my goodness!
3412822 3414663 It's past bedtime.
3414742 3416662 Go right upstairs to bed.
3418902 3421062 Wait! Hold on there, men!
3422782 3426941 The Princess will sleep<br />in our beds upstairs.
3427022 3428502 But where will you sleep?
3428581 3433181 Oh, we'll be quite comfortable<br />down here in...in...
3433261 3434381 In a pig's eye!
3434461 3437501 In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...
3437581 3440181 We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
3440701 3443221 Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
3443300 3446101 Now don't you worry about us.
3446180 3451020 - We'll be all right, ma'am.<br />- Go right on up now, my dear.
3451100 3453220 Well, if you insist.
3455179 3456660 Good night.
3456740 3458499 Good night, Princess.
3461619 3463299 You're sure you'll be comfortable?
3463380 3466499 Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
3467579 3469499 Well, pleasant dreams.
3470379 3472379 Pleasant dreams.
3477338 3478339 Let go!
3478418 3480178 - I saw it first!<br />- Now, men, don't get excited.
3480259 3482498 Remember, share.<br />It's share and share alike.
3482578 3484818 Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
3498497 3501936 Bless the seven little men<br />who have been so kind to me.
3502776 3506297 And... And may my dreams come true.
3506857 3507937 Amen.
3509416 3512217 Oh, yes!<br />And please make Grumpy like me.
3513336 3514936 Hah! Women!
3520615 3522935 A fine kettle of fish!
3622849 3625329 Dip the apple in the brew.
3626129 3629609 Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
3639928 3642768 Look! On the skin!
3643328 3646767 The symbol of what lies within.
3647448 3651887 Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
3652247 3654607 To make her hunger for a bite.
3657766 3659286 Have a bite?
3662367 3664326 It's not for you.
3664727 3666606 It's for Snow White.
3667686 3670206 When she breaks the tender peel
3670686 3672926 to taste the apple in my hand,
3673286 3676565 her breath will still, her blood congeal.
3677166 3680366 Then I'll be fairest in the land!
3683045 3684405 But wait!
3685965 3688204 There may be an antidote.
3688285 3690325 Nothing must be overlooked.
3692685 3694924 Oh, here it is!
3704884 3707244 "Love's First Kiss."
3709164 3710924 No fear of that.
3711403 3713763 The dwarfs will think she's dead.
3714363 3717203 She'll be buried alive!
3728202 3730722 Buried alive!
3741961 3743241 Thirsty?
3743841 3745321 Have a drink!
3803358 3804997 Now, don't forget, my dear.
3805077 3807637 The... The old Queen's a sly one,
3808117 3809677 full of witchcraft.
3809757 3811877 So beware of strangers.

4209251 4211771 I'll share a secret with you.

4238609 4241369 They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
4241849 4245089 Maybe the old Queen's<br />got Snow White.
4245169 4246809 - The Queen!<br />- Snow White!

4293526 4295805 I thought so. I thought so!
4297246 4300526 Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
4300566 4303325 Now, take the apple, dearie,
4303405 4304925 and make a wish.

4339323 4341483 Don't let the wish grow cold!
4343163 4346042 Oh, I feel strange.
4346962 4350922 - Her breath will still.<br />- Oh. Oh.
4352042 4355122 - Her blood congeal.<br />- Oh.
4365361 4368881 Now I'll be fairest in the land!
