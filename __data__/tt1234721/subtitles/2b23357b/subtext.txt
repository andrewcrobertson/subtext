51542 55500 And we're on in four, three,
55833 57667 two, one.
60042 63708 What if I told you that even<br />the worst neighborhood in America
63792 65792 could be made completely safe?
66125 67708 And what if I told you
67792 69042 that this could be accomplished
69125 70250 without risking the life
70333 72583 of one single law enforcement officer?
73500 74958 How do I know this?
75042 77167 Because it's happening right now
77250 79625 in every country in the world
79708 81000 but this one.
81958 83667 I'm Pat Novak,
83750 85208 and welcome to <i>The Novak Element.</i>
90167 91833 In tonight's State of the Union segment
91917 94000 we'll be joined by General Curtis Monroe
94083 95643 live from the War Room in the Pentagon.
97917 99792 General Monroe, welcome back.
99875 101083 <i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>
101167 103625 Thank you for this unprecedented access
103708 105417 to your operations.
105500 109167 Could you walk us<br />through what we're seeing here?
109250 111583 <i>Well, this is a routine operation.</i>
111667 113875 <i>We found that random patrols</i>
113958 115333 <i>helped the local population</i>
115417 117167 <i>to feel safer and to trust us.</i>
117250 118333 It's amazing.
118417 120792 And what are these colored dots
120875 122375 that we're seeing here, General?
122458 125375 <i>These are our assets on the ground.</i>
125458 128208 <i>In green, we got the ED-209s.</i>
128292 131083 <i>They're the big boys.<br />They secure the perimeter.</i>
131167 133125 <i>Purple are the smaller EM-208s.</i>
133208 135000 <i>They sweep and mop up.</i>
135083 137708 <i>And the red dots,<br />Pat, that's your film crew.</i>
139625 142208 It is great to see American machines
142292 145458 helping to promote<br />peace and freedom abroad.
145542 147309 <i>All right, you guys,<br />this is a standard op, all right?</i>
147333 148792 <i>There's no opposition expected.</i>
148875 151000 <i>I'm gonna set your markers to code red.</i>
154542 156958 All our drones are gonna<br />give top priority to your safety.
157042 158958 No red assets have ever been lost.
159042 160208 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
160292 162000 Does that make you feel better?
162083 163417 But, listen,
163500 165542 <i>keep those bracelets on,<br />you're completely safe.</i>
165625 166625 <i>Okay?</i>
166667 167833 <i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>
173792 175792 All right. Let's go.
181208 184000 <i>May peace be upon you.</i>
184083 187125 <i>Please exit<br />your homes with your arms raised</i>
187208 189625 <i>for a noninvasive scanning procedure.</i>
189708 191625 <i>No one will be harmed.</i>
202125 204875 <i>Please exit<br />your homes with your arms raised</i>
204958 207667 <i>for a noninvasive scanning procedure.</i>
207750 209417 <i>No one will be harmed.</i>
212167 214250 Scott, get me a shot of this.
214333 216792 <i>Your cooperation is appreciated.</i>
216875 219583 <i>We apologize for any inconvenience.</i>
219667 221542 As-Salaam-Alaikum.
221625 223000 <i>May peace be upon you.</i>
231042 232042 Incredible.
232667 234708 Incredible!
234792 236125 Not long ago,
236208 239375 that would have been<br />American men and women
239458 242000 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
243333 245625 General, you care to comment on this?
245708 248042 <i>Well, Pat, we had Vietnam,</i>
248125 250833 <i>we had Iraq, we had Afghanistan.</i>
251458 252750 <i>Never again.</i>
252833 256292 <i>From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.</i>
256458 258125 <i>We can accomplish our objectives</i>
258208 260542 <i>without any loss to American lives</i>
260625 263667 <i>and I think the honest people<br />over there really appreciate it.</i>
263750 265708 And why wouldn't they?
265792 267958 For the first time in their lives
268042 270458 they get to watch their children grow up
270542 274417 in an environment of safety and security.
313958 316208 <i>Kelly! Can you hear me out there?</i>
316292 319125 <i>Loud and clear, Pat.<br />I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>
319208 323292 where locals have clearly<br />embraced these routine scans.
323375 325333 As you can see behind me, they're working
325417 327167 in collaboration with the robots
327250 331292 and obviously their safety is<br />everyone's top priority.
361958 363083 <i>You'll notice children</i>
363167 365208 <i>in the streets as well.<br />This is everyday life</i>
365292 367417 <i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>
372708 373875 <i>Oh, great. Here, come here.</i>
373958 375208 <i>Stay put, stay put, stay put.</i>
375292 376852 It's fine. Don't worry. My guys got it.
419500 420500 Oh, my God!
427667 428667 <i>Drop your weapon.</i>
434083 435292 <i>Kelly?</i>
435375 437375 Kelly! Are you all right? Kelly!
437458 438750 <i>We're okay, Pat.</i>
438833 440268 <i>- Our robots have just repelled...</i><br />- Hold on, Kelly.
440292 441375 <i>...some suicide bombers.</i>
441458 444042 I'm sorry, Kelly, but for security reasons
444125 446542 the Pentagon's going<br />to cut our feed to Tehran.
446625 448000 But, please, be careful.
448083 449792 <i>Yeah. I'll continue to stand by.</i>
452417 454958 Now you see how fundamental
455042 456833 these robots are to our foreign policy.
457417 458958 So then tell me.
459042 461625 Why can't we use
461708 463625 these machines here at home?
463708 468000 Why is America so robophobic?
469458 472333 On the one hand, we have Raymond Sellars.
473167 476458 An entrepreneur and true American
476542 479792 whose product just<br />saved my colleague's life.
479875 481083 And on the other.
482083 483333 Hubert Dreyfus.
484708 488750 A man with both feet<br />planted firmly in the past
488833 490125 whose bill prohibits
490208 493375 the use of drones on US soil.
493458 496583 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act
496667 500000 because they haven't<br />experienced this technology,
500083 503208 and they fear what they don't understand.
503750 507500 We at <i>The Novak Element</i><br />support Mr. Sellars' efforts
507583 510000 to make our country and our viewers safer.
510625 511667 After all,
512625 513875 what's more important
513958 515958 than the safety of the American people?
543958 545417 - Hey, Murphy.<br />- Hey.
547708 548792 How's Jack?
549500 550667 We don't know yet.
551458 553500 - Murphy.<br />- Hey.
553583 554833 - How's it going?<br />- Good.
561042 562417 What the hell are they doing here?
562500 565417 Six in the morgue. Lewis in the hospital.
565500 567417 This was the mother of all bad ideas.
567500 569250 We got a lead on<br />Antoine Vallon, we took it.
569333 570333 What lead?
571500 573167 Not in front of them.
573250 575250 - This is bullshit.<br />- Yeah?
575333 576893 Yeah, you got something to say, Murphy?
576958 578167 Vallon's our case.
578250 580708 Yeah, two years<br />without no arrest, no nothing?
580792 583125 You've gotta be dumb or dirty.
583208 585625 You got something on us?<br />Or is this personal?
585708 586917 No, it's nothing personal.
588083 589833 Although, I don't like you as a person.
590000 591833 Okay, you two, out.
591917 592917 No problem.
595000 596601 Maybe if you hadn't<br />gone off the reservation,
596625 598105 your partner would still be standing.
598167 599927 - What'd you say to me?<br />- Hey, that's enough!
603042 604042 Okay, Alex.
606875 609500 It's just you and me now.
609583 611543 So me and Jack,<br />we've been doin' some street buys.
612250 613458 We get a line on some guns.
614250 616167 <i>We meet up with this low-level G</i>
616250 617417 <i>called Jerry,</i>
617500 620042 <i>who ends up havin' a piece<br />he's not supposed to have.</i>
620125 622000 Where the hell<br />you get a gun like that, Jerry?
622083 624042 I can get you two whole crates full, man.
624125 624958 Two crates?
625042 626042 No disrespect, J,
626125 628085 but how a clown like<br />you get so much product, man?
628125 629559 What's it matter where it comes from?
629583 632167 Why it matters,<br />we don't want no dirty guns, Jerry.
632250 634042 These guns got bodies on 'em, Jerry?
634125 635434 Yo, look, they're clean, all right?
635458 636698 You gonna buy this shit or not?
636750 638458 Hey, hey, why you acting so nervous, man?
638542 640375 You fishin' on us, Jerry?
640458 641625 What'd you say?
641708 643643 - You think he fishin', D?<br />- I think he's fishin' on us.
643667 645143 Yo, what the hell are<br />they talkin' about, man?
645167 646247 Hey, let me see your phone.
646917 649226 - Let me see your phone.<br />- I'm not showing you my phone, man!
649250 650583 You recordin' this?
650667 652208 I think you're a goddamn cop!
652292 653601 What the hell are you talkin' about, man?
653625 654792 I'm not showing you my phone!
654875 655958 Hey! Put your gun down!
656042 657333 Put your phones on the table.
657417 659518 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
659542 660708 What?
660792 662958 Shut up! Shut up! What'd you say?
663042 664583 Ends up he works for Vallon.
664833 667073 Before the meet,<br />we ran the serial numbers on the rifles.
667958 669918 The guns were supposed<br />to be in our evidence room.
671375 672917 <i>Not out on the street.</i>
673000 674958 <i>Intake papers blank. No signatures.</i>
675042 676833 - What do you got?<br />- Nothin'.
678167 679417 How do you think that happened?
682375 684208 I'm telling you,<br />Murphy, this is a mistake.
684292 686667 These guys'll shoot<br />you just to see if they gun work.
687458 688750 We need backup.
688833 690893 If we call for backup,<br />word's gonna get around the station.
690917 692667 He's gonna disappear.
692750 695125 It's gonna be all right.
695208 697375 <i>So we told Vallon<br />we were gun buyers,</i>
697458 698875 <i>and he bought it.</i>
698958 700958 What do you two need<br />with that much product?
701042 702042 You plotting a coup?
703792 706101 Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna bust<br />a single shot in your town.
706125 708083 We got some problems<br />back home with Chicago PD.
708167 710833 Yeah, I heard you don't like cops.
711667 712833 Hey, boss.
714750 715750 What do you got for me?
718208 718958 Really?
719042 720625 <i>We were<br />just about to close the deal</i>
720708 721958 <i>but someone tipped him off.</i>
722042 724583 Gentlemen,<br />I gotta deal with this.
724667 725833 Two minutes.
733042 734417 Make sure you kill 'em both!
743500 745833 I got two handguns, one automatic.
759083 761292 We gotta get out of here.<br />I'm gonna take the automatic.
761375 762375 You sure about this?
784875 785875 You ready?
786250 787250 Move.
827625 828708 Lewis!
829708 830708 Lewis!
834083 837667 Officer down! Officer down, 331 Hamilton.
837750 839125 This is Detective Alex Murphy
839208 841208 in need of immediate medical assistance.
841292 842833 331 Hamilton Road.
844292 845292 Jack.
846375 848833 Jack, come on. Jack. Can you hear me?
849708 851500 Jack. Stay with me.
852625 854500 Jack.
854583 857250 <i>Alex,<br />you don't do something like this</i>
857333 858833 unless you bring it to me first.
859500 861083 Vallon's connected.
861167 862167 I'm warning you,
862208 865083 don't make any more moves<br />until I vet this.
865167 866809 If officers are supplying him with guns...
866833 868500 That's up to IAD.
869500 870500 I'll handle it.
876708 878792 I don't care how sophisticated
878875 881458 these machines are, Mr. Sellars.
881542 882958 A machine does not know
883042 886083 what it feels like to be human.
886167 888625 It can't understand<br />the value of human life.
888708 890188 Why should it be allowed to take one?
891375 894667 To legislate over life and death,
894750 896958 we need people who understand
897042 898750 right from wrong.
898833 902750 - What do your machines feel?<br />- Well, they feel no anger.
902833 904583 They feel no prejudice.
904667 906583 They feel no fatigue,
906667 909083 which makes them<br />ideal for law enforcement.
910375 913542 Putting these machines on the streets
913792 916917 will save countless American lives.
917000 918875 - You're evading the question.<br />- No, I'm not.
918958 920101 Yes,<br />you're evading the question.
920125 923583 I asked what do these machines feel?
923667 926167 If one of them killed a child...
927583 928583 what would it feel?
932667 934625 - Nothing.<br />- And that's the problem.
934708 937667 That's why 72% of Americans
937750 939875 will not stand for<br />a robot pulling the trigger.
946875 948333 America is the world's
948417 951083 most valuable market,<br />and we can't touch it.
951167 953042 With a domestic expansion,
953125 956625 we'd clear 600 billion dollars per annum.
956708 958875 In other words, every second
958958 961667 that law is in existence,<br />we are hemorrhaging money.
961750 962833 What do you want me to do?
962917 965167 We've thrown cash at senators<br />at both sides of the aisle.
965250 966333 Nobody's budging.
966417 968417 They don't want to vote<br />against their constituents.
968458 971542 So unless we sway public opinion,<br />the battle's lost.
971625 973542 Now, to that effect,
973625 975250 my team have come up with
975333 978083 a pretty aggressive new campaign.
978167 980875 Wow factor off-the-charts.
980958 982918 We need to give Americans<br />a product they can love.
983917 985625 A figure they can rally behind.
985708 987542 Sir, I have dissected this bill.
987625 989083 There are no loopholes.
989167 990601 We can't put a machine on the streets.
990625 991667 Forget machines.
991750 993792 You saw the polls.
993875 995833 Americans don't want a machine.
997458 998958 They want
999042 1001458 a product with a conscience.
1002500 1003500 They want...
1004542 1006250 something that knows...
1008458 1009833 what it feels like...
1010917 1011917 to be human.
1018958 1020833 We're gonna put a man inside a machine.
1025083 1026125 You're not you
1026208 1028917 because of your legs,<br />your arms, your hands.
1029000 1030583 You're you because of your brain.
1030667 1032833 It's your brain's capacity
1032917 1035208 to process information<br />that makes you who you are.
1036667 1039458 Relax, and just do<br />what you've always done.
1044708 1046667 I've never played with these.
1046750 1048042 The music doesn't come
1048125 1051000 from your fingers, Michael,<br />it comes from your mind.
1051083 1052833 All you have to do is let it out.
1054000 1055000 Please.
1086125 1087208 Oh, my God.
1091667 1093208 No, it's okay. Easy.
1095792 1097125 His emotions are peaking.
1097208 1098476 The readings are getting clouded.
1098500 1099958 It's okay.
1100042 1102542 Relax. If you get too emotional,
1102625 1104583 it'll change the chemistry in your brain.
1104667 1105833 It'll throw the system out.
1109500 1111583 You're doing great. Come on.
1126667 1127958 I need emotion to play.
1129333 1131833 <i>Concierto de Aranjuez,</i><br />second movement.
1132833 1134208 Beautiful piece.
1134292 1137417 Dennett, when you have<br />a moment. Thank you.
1137500 1140542 Now, we agreed on this<br />a long time ago, Raymond.
1140625 1142417 I-I wouldn't be asked
1142500 1144375 to develop combat applications.
1144458 1145875 My-my work here
1145958 1147667 is driven by its own questions.
1147750 1149000 And your work is brilliant.
1149083 1151208 But your ideas are being underutilized.
1151292 1154250 Look, I think I found a way
1154333 1157583 to put real revenue stream<br />behind your research
1157667 1161083 and save thousands<br />of lives in the process.
1174500 1175750 You're not keeping up your end,
1175833 1177375 leaving me exposed like that.
1177458 1179333 Detective Murphy's<br />just a little impulsive.
1179417 1181559 So put him on the payroll.<br />Why are we talkin' about this?
1181583 1183463 It won't work.<br />And now that his partner got hit,
1183542 1185375 he's never gonna let it go.
1185458 1187417 - What is that?<br />- Lewis' hospital.
1187500 1189208 Alex is dropping by this afternoon,
1189292 1190612 in case you want to send flowers.
1195208 1196208 Yeah.
1196542 1197875 I kill a cop,
1197958 1200042 lookin' over my shoulder<br />the rest of my life.
1200125 1201875 That's not good for business.
1201958 1203758 Who do you think's<br />gonna be investigating you?
1210292 1212125 I'm gonna go hard after Lake and Daniels.
1214958 1216998 I'm gonna have 'em in<br />bracelets within a month, man.
1219167 1220647 Hey, Vallon,<br />I'm walking up right now.
1221875 1222875 Cameras off?
1224625 1225625 Clear.
1227250 1230083 <i>You were right.<br />We should've had backup.</i>
1230667 1231667 <i>I'm sorry.</i>
1235750 1237150 You're not really sleeping, are ya?
1240250 1241250 Asshole.
1243625 1248042 Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.<br />Paralyzed from the waist down.
1249167 1252917 He has let himself go<br />a little since the accident.
1253000 1254250 Pass.
1254333 1255792 Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.
1256417 1258958 Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.
1259042 1262500 "Severe Cerebellar..."
1262583 1264292 Cerebellar ataxia.
1264375 1266292 That's why you're the doctor, Doctor.
1266750 1270167 He scored through the roof<br />with our urban demos.
1270250 1272010 Let's keep this one in mind.<br />I like this guy.
1272042 1274625 Very good, sir. I saved the best for last.
1276500 1278583 I give you Sergeant Jack Freeman,
1278667 1280167 masculinity incarnate.
1280250 1282792 Led Pittsburgh SWAT for five years,
1282875 1285083 now confined to a wheelchair.
1285625 1287500 I...
1287583 1289792 think I can see the appeal.
1289875 1290875 No.
1290958 1292833 What? Why?
1292917 1295708 Well, check the psych evaluation.<br />He's far too unstable.
1296042 1297667 He's trying to say that he has a temper.
1298167 1300458 Have you any idea<br />what we'd be putting him through?
1300542 1302000 The psychological strain
1302083 1303750 requires someone emotionally balanced.
1303833 1306250 We have to be scientific.
1306333 1309000 I mean, we're not selling<br />a soft drink here, are we?
1309083 1311542 He's right. Okay. Keep looking.
1313708 1316500 David, what did I say?<br />Not until you're finished.
1316583 1318958 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hi, Dad.
1319042 1321750 - Hey.<br />- Hey, little monkey.
1326083 1327208 How's the game, buddy?
1327292 1328542 Damon got ejected,
1328625 1330250 but we got a two-man advantage.
1330333 1333042 Oh, yeah? That's fantastic.
1333125 1334958 Hey, D, why don't you head upstairs
1335042 1336750 and start getting ready for bed.
1336833 1338208 But he just got home.
1338917 1340542 I'll be up in a second.
1340625 1342958 Tuck you in, okay? All right?
1347042 1348809 - Now give your mom a kiss.<br />- Good night, baby.
1348833 1349833 Too slow, boy.
1352125 1353208 You're just too slow.
1361708 1363208 How's Jack holding up?
1363292 1365012 They said a week<br />till he's back on his feet.
1366292 1367292 It's my fault.
1367375 1368735 We shouldn't even have been there.
1371958 1372958 Here.
1436542 1437875 Oh, shit, I thought I fixed that.
1438417 1439458 It'll stop.
1446125 1447500 It's gonna wake up David.
1491667 1492833 <i>He suffered</i>
1492917 1496167 <i>fourth-degree burns<br />over 80 percent of his body.</i>
1496625 1498583 <i>Lower spine has been severed.</i>
1500042 1501375 <i>If he survives...</i>
1502667 1503958 he'll be paralyzed
1504042 1506083 from the waist down<br />and confined to a wheelchair.
1509458 1510833 Mrs. Murphy...
1512792 1514750 we don't have to do this.
1516625 1519250 I need to know everything<br />before I make a decision.
1522792 1524042 Please continue.
1525333 1527542 Vestibulocochlear,
1527625 1530417 optical nerves have<br />been critically damaged.
1531750 1533375 He'll be blind in one eye.
1534458 1535500 Most likely deaf.
1536958 1539083 Frankly, Dr. Norton<br />and the Omni Foundation
1539167 1540833 are the leaders in this field.
1540917 1544583 In my opinion, this is<br />the only chance your husband has.
1544667 1546500 I'd seriously consider their offer.
1549625 1550833 I'm sorry, Doctor.
1552708 1554125 I need time to think.
1554208 1555625 I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy,
1555708 1557625 time is one thing you don't have.
1562375 1564542 You say you can save him,<br />but what does that mean?
1568250 1569917 What kind of life will he have?
1587292 1589750 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
1589833 1591625 You know she's gonna make me dance again.
1591708 1593458 Now that I've gotta see.
1593542 1594622 You don't want to see that.
1594667 1595708 Here she comes now.
1596458 1597458 Hold on to that.
1597542 1598750 Get out there, partner.
1600458 1601833 Every time.
1605917 1607125 Get her, boy.
1625625 1627333 Subject is still dreaming.
1628708 1630458 He's retrieving memories,
1630542 1633250 trying to make sense of<br />sensorial stimulation package 37.
1634833 1635833 Perfect, Kim.
1637875 1639292 Let's reconnect the spine.
1640875 1641958 Time to wake him up.
1668833 1669875 Excuse me?
1671042 1672125 What are you doing here?
1672875 1673875 Baby, where you going?
1677792 1678792 Lewis.
1689958 1692542 Subject regaining cognitive functions.
1694625 1695667 What's happening?
1698500 1699500 Where am I?
1699542 1701333 You were in an explosion, Alex.
1702042 1703750 You're in a hospital.
1704208 1705208 Where's...
1706625 1709125 Where's Ciara? My wife. Where's my wife?
1709208 1711458 I want you to calm down,<br />Alex. Listen to me.
1711542 1713417 You're okay. And your family's fine.
1713500 1714833 Both your wife and your son.
1716125 1717583 Who the hell are you?
1717667 1720292 I'm Dr. Dennett Norton. I'm treating you.
1721042 1722042 Heart rate rising.
1725250 1726250 I can't move.
1729458 1731792 I can't move. What the hell is all that?
1731875 1733167 Visual input unstable.
1733250 1734792 I want you to relax, Alex.
1734875 1736184 Subject's dumping too much epinephrine.
1736208 1737448 - Should we purge it?<br />- Not yet.
1738292 1739667 Unlock vertebrae.
1745208 1747000 Go ahead, Kim.
1747083 1749833 Unlock upper, lower extremities.
1762917 1764917 What kind of suit is this?
1765000 1768333 It's not a suit, Alex. It's...
1770500 1771792 It's you.
1773708 1775667 This was the only option.
1775750 1779333 We're here, all of us,<br />to make you whole again.
1779417 1780833 Full body unlock.
1780917 1782958 I want you to walk now, Alex.
1783500 1784625 You can do that.
1809292 1810375 This seems so real.
1813750 1815625 Alex, it's very important
1815708 1817333 you understand what is happening.
1817417 1818792 This is real.
1818875 1822167 It's not a dream,<br />it's not drugs or anesthetics.
1822250 1825083 I know I'm dreaming<br />'cause I can feel all of this.
1825167 1828125 Alex, amputees can often<br />feel their missing appendages.
1828208 1829518 It's called phantom limb sensation.
1829542 1831292 What do you mean "amputees"?
1831375 1833309 - What the hell did you do to me?<br />- You need to relax.
1833333 1834750 Take this off me now.
1834833 1837542 I need to get out of this thing.<br />What did you do to me?
1837625 1839750 What have you done to me?
1839833 1841625 Alex? Hey!
1843125 1844250 Shut him down.
1844333 1846542 No! Let him run! Let him run!
1867542 1868542 Where am I?
1893250 1894583 <i>Alex, please.</i>
1896458 1897458 <i>Stop.</i>
1898625 1900042 <i>Alex, you have to stop.</i>
1901667 1902708 <i>Please.</i>
1904083 1905083 <i>Alex.</i>
1906667 1907833 Please stop.
1908625 1910292 Stay where you are
1910375 1912667 and we'll come and pick you up.
1946583 1947833 Okay, Kim.
1949458 1950667 Shut him down.
1976500 1977500 Alex...
1978792 1980375 you can't run from this.
1982833 1986417 You have to understand<br />the reality of the situation.
1990292 1991292 Show me.
1993792 1994792 Kim.
2011375 2012375 Oh!
2014792 2015792 No.
2019958 2020958 Holy Christ.
2022333 2023792 Holy Christ.
2026250 2027833 Holy Christ, there's nothing left.
2034500 2037917 Your body may have gone,<br />but you're still here.
2044667 2046417 That's not even my brain.
2046500 2049792 We had to repair the damaged areas.
2049875 2052292 But we didn't interfere with<br />your emotion or your intellect.
2052375 2055042 Do you understand me, Alex?
2056375 2058833 You're... You're in control.
2059667 2061833 - I'm in control?<br />- Yes.
2064875 2065875 Okay.
2069458 2070583 If I'm in control...
2073083 2074292 then I wanna die.
2076417 2078167 Just unplug whatever it is
2078250 2081375 keepin' me alive and end this nightmare.
2082125 2083667 Now, say I did that,
2083750 2086583 which as a doctor would<br />almost be impossible for me,
2086667 2088083 but say I did.
2090750 2092250 What do I say to your wife?
2093542 2095208 What does she say to your son?
2095292 2097833 That it didn't work. That you tried.
2098875 2100208 Somethin' went wrong.
2101625 2103083 You did everything you could...
2107333 2108833 but I died.
2108917 2111000 So after all they've been through,
2111083 2114542 all the pain, all their hope restored,
2114625 2115958 we would just rip that away?
2118083 2120125 Your wife loves you, Alex.
2120208 2122708 She signed the consent forms herself.
2122792 2125375 Otherwise, you couldn't<br />have undergone the procedure.
2135875 2137042 She loves you
2137125 2140167 and she gave you a second chance.
2142708 2144875 I need you to take it.
2149875 2151833 I don't wanna see myself like this again.
2153833 2155000 Ever.
2155083 2156833 And the same goes for my family.
2165083 2166167 Just put me back in.
2171292 2172292 Zoom in.
2174708 2175708 Stop.
2178792 2179792 Zoom in.
2182417 2183417 Stop.
2188708 2189875 Accept the connection.
2196042 2198167 <i>It's so good to finally see you.</i>
2198250 2199875 I was gonna say the same thing.
2201625 2202792 I'm sorry.
2204292 2205833 I know how I must look to you.
2206792 2208542 <i>I think you look beautiful.</i>
2213083 2215125 <i>Are they treating you okay, baby?</i>
2215208 2218833 So far. Dr. Norton,<br />he seems like a nice guy.
2221042 2222282 Does David know you're calling?
2226417 2227458 <i>He misses you.</i>
2228833 2230167 <i>- I can go get him.</i><br />- No.
2232292 2233772 I don't want him to see me like this.
2236375 2237375 Not yet.
2238000 2239000 <i>Sure.</i>
2245042 2246708 <i>We're gonna get through this, baby.</i>
2250167 2251833 <i>We're gonna make it like it was.</i>
2257125 2258792 <i>When are you comin' home?</i>
2258875 2260275 Well, they've still got some tests.
2262042 2263833 But they're sayin' it's goin' really well.
2266083 2267208 The minute they let me.
2270000 2271000 I gotta go.
2272583 2274042 I love you.
2274125 2275125 End the connection.
2290125 2293625 Okay, blood cleansing initiated.
2295917 2298833 Viral and bacterial screening activated.
2301708 2305125 Releasing proteins, fats,
2305208 2307833 minerals and carbs.
2310208 2314917 Energy inflow is at 1320 kilocalories.
2316667 2318000 Now starting
2318083 2321000 anti-inflammatory corticoids, hormones
2321083 2323667 and antibiotic protocols.
2324667 2326083 Standard daily intake.
2329083 2330708 Release antidepressants.
2332417 2333958 Let's give him a nice dream.
2345958 2347638 All right,<br />here's what you're dealin' with.
2347667 2350208 Modified M2 battle rifle.
2350292 2352833 .50 caliber Beowulf<br />ammunition at 30 round clips.
2352917 2354375 Three-shot bursts or full auto.
2355833 2356833 Heavy-duty.
2358458 2361583 TSR 66. Cartridge-driven taser pistol.
2361667 2364292 Each projectile<br />releases up to 200,000 volts.
2364375 2367208 It can stun,<br />it can kill and it's nasty shit.
2367917 2369042 Your armor,
2369125 2370476 state-of-the-art, but not invulnerable.
2370500 2373042 .50 caliber or larger<br />can penetrate and kill.
2373125 2374250 Multiple hits,
2374333 2376250 and guess who ends<br />up in the recycling bin?
2379375 2381375 If you sense you need<br />a weapon or are threatened
2383125 2385605 the visor goes down and the system<br />makes the weapons available.
2386417 2387292 But you gotta remember,
2387375 2388655 it's not the weapons that count.
2389333 2390417 It's who's handling them.
2390500 2392250 Or, in your case, what.
2393250 2395708 - You think you can do this?<br />- Oh, just stick to your job.
2395792 2397125 Just stick to my job?
2397208 2398500 Combat robots are my job, Doc.
2398583 2400125 Rio, Congo,
2400208 2403042 you name it, I was there.<br />Our machines run perfectly.
2403125 2404958 You ask me, stickin' organics<br />into the system
2405042 2406792 is a huge step backwards.
2407708 2409508 I don't care how well<br />you designed this thing.
2409583 2410875 Without my sign-off,
2410958 2412018 it better start learnin' Chinese,
2412042 2413362 'cause it ain't never goin' home.
2421292 2422667 It's nice to meet you, too.
2424417 2425417 Let's do this,
2426292 2427292 Tin Man.
2434083 2438042 Quality control, EM-208 versus Tin Man.
2438125 2440833 Rendering scenario one now.
2441958 2443101 Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.
2443125 2444725 I like a little music while I'm workin'.
2449042 2449958 All right.
2450042 2452583 All right, let's let the games begin.
2452667 2453667 Let's rock 'n' roll.
2455625 2457042 Commence scenario.
2491250 2492708 Laggin' on the corners.
2492792 2494417 No, there, do you see that?
2494500 2496100 What my robot did, that's how you do it.
2498750 2499750 New product's afraid.
2500625 2504167 2.3 seconds behind. Great.
2505542 2506917 <i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>
2507000 2508000 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2510375 2511375 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2512542 2514292 <i>Drop the weapon. Let the kid go!</i>
2514375 2517458 Oh, well, it's worried<br />that the kid's gonna get hurt.
2517542 2518833 <i>- Let the kid go!</i><br />- Too bad.
2520625 2521875 Well, there you have it.
2521958 2524667 5.6 seconds behind. Scenario failure.
2524750 2526125 I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.
2531917 2534167 - Let's do it again.<br />- Your funeral.
2538208 2539417 Detective Alex Murphy.
2539500 2540708 <i>Search results.</i>
2540792 2542792 <i>"Detective Murphy<br />making a speedy recovery."</i>
2542875 2545417 <i>"Alex Murphy. Man or Machine?"</i>
2545500 2548417 <i>"Thrust into the spotlight,<br />Ciara Murphy won't talk."</i>
2549500 2551292 Antoine Vallon.
2551375 2552292 <i>Search results.</i>
2552375 2554167 <i>"DPD says Antoine Vallon</i>
2554250 2556500 <i>no longer suspect<br />due to lack of evidence."</i>
2560125 2561542 <i>Detroit Free Press.</i>
2562208 2563458 <i>Unfortunately,</i>
2563542 2565333 <i>Murphy's investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>
2565417 2566958 <i>wasn't authorized in the first place.</i>
2567042 2570667 <i>Look, Detective Murphy<br />was simply overzealous, okay?</i>
2570750 2572083 <i>We have absolutely no evidence</i>
2572167 2574000 <i>linking Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>
2574083 2576167 <i>All I'm gonna say is<br />my partner's a great cop.</i>
2576250 2577458 <i>And I won't rest until the men</i>
2577542 2579302 <i>who tried to kill him<br />are brought to justice.</i>
2583708 2584750 What's wrong with him?
2584833 2586042 No, nothing, nothing.
2587125 2589833 Watch the procedural bars on the 208.
2591250 2594458 The machine assesses the threat and acts.
2594625 2596083 - All right.<br />- That's it.
2597250 2599083 It's two steps. Now watch Alex.
2600750 2602500 The software assesses the threat,
2602583 2604458 just like the robot.
2605125 2607042 And it sends the information to the brain.
2607125 2608917 Alex's brain receives the information
2609000 2611101 and decides what to do with<br />it based on his emotional...
2611125 2611875 Right.
2611958 2614042 ...cognitive abilities like any man would.
2614125 2619042 Then the brain relates this<br />to the AI module and, uh...
2619125 2620750 Yeah, like, you know, a year later.
2620833 2622167 And our computers finish the job.
2622250 2626083 Raymond, you wanted<br />a man inside a machine.
2626167 2627458 And that's what you've got.
2627542 2629583 But the human element<br />will always be present.
2629667 2633500 Fear, instinct, bias, compassion,<br />they will always interfere with
2633583 2635292 - the system!<br />- Okay, but, Dennett...
2635375 2636917 I've gotta give...
2637000 2638880 the American people<br />something they can root for.
2638958 2640708 Something aspirational, right?
2640792 2642143 They have to believe in this thing.
2642167 2645458 "Pretty good"? That's not...<br />I don't know how to sell "okay."
2645542 2647667 We, you and I, have got a release date,
2647750 2650059 and we've gotta make it, okay?<br />So I don't care how you do it.
2650083 2651518 I'm askin' ya, come on, can you help me?
2651542 2654833 Just get him to do that.
2654917 2656667 - Get him to do that.<br />- That is a machine.
2656750 2658184 I know, but it's a man inside a machine.
2658208 2660625 No, that's a man<br />inside a machine right there!
2660708 2662292 And his life depends on it.
2662375 2663893 And the future of OmniCorp depends on it
2663917 2666750 so get your ass back<br />to China and get it fixed.
2666833 2668625 I don't care how you do it, just go do it!
2684333 2687042 It tastes like peanut butter.
2691417 2692917 I can't get it out of my mouth.
2694250 2696042 And<br />you don't like peanut butter?
2696125 2698250 No.
2698333 2699708 You like peanut butter, Kim?
2699792 2701083 I love it.
2702917 2703917 Okay.
2705500 2707000 I'm gonna put you to sleep now, Alex.
2707083 2708083 Okay.
2709500 2710875 Now, put him under, Kim.
2716708 2718000 What are you planning to do?
2719542 2723583 Consciousness is nothing more
2723667 2725792 than the processing of information.
2727708 2729042 I'm gonna fix him.
2731042 2732625 And he won't know the difference.
2744542 2746292 - Raymond?<br />- Yeah?
2746375 2749417 We just ran focus groups<br />at Ryan Correctional Facility.
2750542 2753792 We call this Combat Mode.
2753875 2756375 It really put the fear of God<br />into the prisoners.
2756458 2757750 Yeah, that's okay.
2757833 2758833 And get a load of this.
2760458 2763917 - What's that?<br />- He transforms. Kids love it.
2764667 2766958 - Really?<br />- Focus group numbers through the roof.
2767042 2768583 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
2768667 2770750 Well, that's really embarrassing.
2770833 2772875 What is this? You know what?
2772958 2774792 People really don't know what they want
2774875 2776833 until you show it to 'em most of the time.
2777667 2778958 Make him more, uh...
2780083 2781125 tactical.
2781208 2782583 Make him look, uh...
2785125 2786125 Let's go with black.
2787875 2788875 Yeah.
2824292 2825417 Alex.
2825500 2827500 He looks like a billion dollars.
2827583 2829083 2.6 billion.
2830083 2832042 Raymond Sellars.
2832125 2834250 I've looked forward<br />to meeting you, Detective.
2834333 2836268 I really appreciate<br />everything you've done for me.
2836292 2838583 Well, we funded this program
2838667 2840458 to give men like you a second chance.
2841708 2842833 You just do your best today.
2843667 2845292 - Shall we?<br />- Let's.
2848375 2850583 - Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.<br />- Okay, great.
2850667 2852375 Chief Technician Shuman.
2852458 2853458 Morning, folks.
2857083 2858875 <i>Okay,<br />so this is how it's gonna be.</i>
2858958 2861958 We're goin' toe-to-toe.<br />Last man standing wins.
2862042 2864708 <i>I hit you, you go<br />back to the drawing board.</i>
2864792 2866750 <i>You hit me, you get a ticket back home.</i>
2868250 2870792 My guys are gonna be shootin'<br />.47 caliber rounds.
2870875 2873208 Do a little damage,<br />but they can't take you out.
2873292 2874667 But make no mistake, Tin Man,
2874750 2876167 my gun will.
2891958 2893083 Alex, listen to me.
2893750 2895833 <i>The EM-208s will try to maneuver you</i>
2895917 2897917 <i>so Mattox can get a clear shot.</i>
2898000 2900167 <i>Do not let that happen.</i>
2901083 2901875 <i>If Mattox hits you,</i>
2901958 2904000 <i>everything but your life support<br />will shut down.</i>
2904083 2905458 <i>You'll feel more pain</i>
2905542 2907542 <i>than you've ever felt in your life.</i>
2907625 2910042 I don't know about that.<br />I've been through a lot.
2916250 2917250 All right.
2918292 2919708 I say we go on three.
2920250 2921250 Three.
2943292 2944458 How's it going down there?
2947167 2949833 Whatever you do,<br />don't get shot in the face.
2953833 2954833 Wow.
2986750 2990167 Dr. Norton,<br />how, how is he doing this?
2990250 2991958 His software is faster.
2992042 2993750 His hardware is stronger.
2993833 2995083 <i>He's a better machine.</i>
2998000 3000208 <i>But you said humans hesitate.</i>
3000292 3002583 Only when they're making decisions.
3002833 3004333 He's not making decisions?
3004958 3006333 Yes and no.
3007167 3009917 In his everyday life,<br />man rules over the machine.
3010000 3011458 Alex makes his own decisions.
3012500 3014167 <i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>
3014292 3017792 <i>the visor comes down<br />and the software takes over.</i>
3017875 3019833 <i>Then the machine does everything.</i>
3019917 3023125 Alex is, he's a passenger,<br />just along for the ride.
3026750 3028059 <i>But if the machine is in control,</i>
3028083 3029542 <i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>
3029625 3030667 Who's pulling the trigger?
3030750 3032042 Well, when the machine fights,
3032125 3034708 the system releases<br />signals into Alex's brain
3034792 3035917 making him think he's doing
3036000 3037542 what our computers are actually doing.
3037625 3040208 I mean, Alex believes<br />right now he is in control.
3040292 3041333 But he's not.
3041500 3043833 It's the illusion of free will.
3053708 3054708 Crap!
3077000 3078458 So you've circumvented the law
3078542 3080018 by creating a machine<br />that thinks it's a man.
3080042 3081167 But that's illegal.
3081250 3082833 No. No, no, no.
3084083 3086417 It's a machine<br />that thinks it's Alex Murphy.
3086500 3087583 And in my book...
3088500 3089500 that's legal.
3092000 3093042 Well done.
3094583 3095833 Well done.
3099417 3101917 Hey, Doctor, what happens<br />if I tase an exoskeleton
3102000 3103792 with a little asshole inside?
3105125 3108500 I, uh, I think we're<br />all curious to find out.
3108583 3109583 Go ahead.
3146958 3148833 If I had a pulse, it'd be racing.
3149792 3151542 She's been waiting four months.
3152458 3153833 I'm sure hers is, too.
3156667 3157875 You're gonna do fine.
3168125 3169667 I love your sign, D.
3173250 3174250 Hey.
3179083 3180542 There's nothin' to be nervous about.
3185458 3186500 Thank you, Dennett.
3187667 3188708 It's been a privilege.
3283333 3284333 Hi, Dad.
3287917 3289077 You know I missed you, buddy.
3290625 3291667 Me, too.
3299083 3300208 Wanna feel it?
3304375 3305375 What is it?
3306917 3307917 It's okay, sweetie.
3320125 3322750 I saved all the Red Wings games<br />on my computer.
3323667 3324708 You did?
3328125 3330042 - How'd they do?<br />- I don't know.
3330125 3331958 I've been waiting to watch them with you.
3333833 3335375 You know I'd love to, kiddo.
3336333 3337750 But I can't tonight.
3339000 3340833 You know, 'cause<br />Daddy's suit needs some...
3342375 3343667 Some special handling.
3345625 3346792 Do you understand?
3378208 3379667 Thanks for coming, Jack.
3379958 3381583 I heard you went home already.
3381667 3383434 I know Ciara must be<br />thrilled to have you back.
3383458 3384458 I saw Ciara...
3385792 3386792 and David.
3389833 3391000 That ain't my home right now.
3393375 3395333 It's in a damn lab across the hall.
3395667 3397083 I'm sorry, Alex.
3397792 3398875 Startin' tomorrow,
3398958 3401083 I'm gonna take down<br />Vallon and his whole damn crew.
3401458 3403208 I was waitin' to hear you say that.
3407667 3409375 Least I know you're the right color now.
3442542 3444625 <i>Pat, the cooler<br />temperatures here today</i>
3444708 3447375 <i>certainly have not stopped<br />people from showing up.</i>
3447458 3449833 <i>We're expecting people<br />from every corner of the city</i>
3449917 3450917 <i>here in Detroit</i>
3450958 3452792 <i>to come out and show their support</i>
3452875 3454208 <i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>
3454292 3455708 <i>You know, a lot of questions</i>
3455792 3458000 <i>on people's minds today<br />is what will he look like.</i>
3458083 3459667 <i>Is he a changed man?</i>
3459750 3461833 <i>Rumor has it he is in the building</i>
3461917 3463375 <i>preparing to come out...</i>
3463875 3466375 <i>Alex, we're gonna upload</i>
3466458 3469875 <i>the entire DPD database into your brain.</i>
3469958 3471250 <i>That means you'll have</i>
3471333 3474250 <i>instantaneous access to criminal records</i>
3474333 3476708 <i>plus an archive of CCTV footage</i>
3476792 3478458 <i>from 2011 to the present.</i>
3478542 3479542 All right.
3480542 3481542 Hit me.
3482458 3484458 Okay. Kim, it's all yours.
3486375 3488958 Archive footage<br />uploading successfully.
3489042 3491792 Your system draws<br />connections automatically.
3491875 3493708 It will link perpetrators to their crimes
3493792 3495583 and give you their exact locations
3495667 3496917 whenever available.
3497708 3501042 I got evidence to make 138... No, no.
3501125 3502792 166 arrests.
3504042 3505708 His emotions are stable.
3507500 3508875 This is incredible.
3509375 3512458 <i>You will notice his family<br />is here in the building as well.</i>
3512542 3514667 <i>The mayor is standing on stage behind me.</i>
3514750 3517000 <i>Also, Raymond Sellars from OmniCorp.</i>
3517083 3519375 <i>They seem like great friends<br />obviously echoing</i>
3519458 3521258 <i>the partnership that they've<br />brought together.</i>
3522458 3523875 How much longer will this take?
3523958 3526958 Well, the feed<br />from the database is almost done, so.
3527042 3528542 We're approaching present day.
3528625 3532292 634 pending arrests.
3532375 3533833 We're gonna need a bigger prison.
3537250 3538375 He's on top of her.
3538458 3540167 Dr. Norton,<br />he's getting too emotional.
3540250 3541833 - I gotta do something!<br />- Alex.
3541917 3543667 Alex, calm down.
3544500 3545667 Take a breath.
3546375 3547833 Relax.
3547917 3549250 Kim, what are the readings?
3549333 3551208 I haven't seen him at levels like this.
3551292 3552625 - He's gonna shoot 'em!<br />- Alex!
3552708 3554667 Alex, Alex, relax.
3555708 3556708 Relax.
3557708 3558750 Alex?
3559542 3561667 - What is this?<br />- This just a computer glitch?
3561750 3563458 No. That's his own crime scene.
3563917 3565625 - Alex!<br />- He's spiking all over the place.
3565708 3566708 Alex!
3567542 3569375 - Alex?<br />- The system is crashing, Doctor.
3569458 3570583 Alex, can you hear me?
3571042 3572250 Alex! Alex!
3572333 3574351 - I'm not sure he can handle this.<br />- I gotta do something!
3574375 3575750 He's emotionally overloaded.
3575833 3576750 Unlock me!
3576833 3578625 Alex! Stop!
3578708 3580208 Stop! He's having a seizure!
3580292 3582500 Kim, shut him down! Alex!
3582583 3584042 Get me a live feed!
3584125 3584875 I can't do it.
3584958 3586351 - Dr. Norton's with the patient.<br />- Do it now!
3586375 3587625 Jesus Christ!
3587708 3589375 Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!
3589458 3590518 - What?<br />- The press is waiting!
3590542 3591833 We have to get him up there now!
3591917 3593167 What do you want me to do?
3593250 3595875 I don't know! Fix him!<br />Do what you have to do!
3595958 3599250 Your reputation is on the line<br />every bit as much as ours.
3600042 3601833 We're running out of time.
3603625 3604708 Okay.
3605917 3606917 Everybody out!
3609125 3609875 Out!
3609958 3611708 <i>Mayor Durant is about to take to the stage</i>
3611792 3612875 <i>and introduce Detroit's</i>
3612958 3615500 newest weapon in the war on crime.
3615583 3618125 I'm actually getting word<br />that he's ready to go right now.
3623083 3624083 Heart rate rising.
3624167 3625417 He might start spiking, Doctor.
3625500 3628042 Set modules to absorb<br />dopamine and noradrenalin.
3628125 3629434 But you'll be taking away his emotions.
3629458 3631417 Drop the levels until I tell you to stop.
3631500 3632667 Doctor, you'll be taking away
3632750 3634550 - his ability to feel anything.<br />- Now, please!
3640375 3642417 Pull the footage. Put it on a loop.
3645167 3647667 - Dopamine level's at 20 percent.<br />- More.
3650458 3652625 - Dopamine level's at 10 percent.<br />- More.
3653958 3655708 - Dopamine level's at five percent.<br />- Lower.
3655792 3657232 - You're flattening him out.<br />- Lower!
3660333 3661833 - Two percent.<br />- Hold it there.
3669500 3670500 Alex?
3671917 3673417 Alex, how do you feel?
3677958 3679417 I feel fine, Dr. Norton.
3681417 3685667 Well, today I'm not here<br />to talk about crime prevention.
3686792 3689500 I am here to give you the cure.
3689583 3690917 That's right!
3698750 3699750 Hi, Dad!
3702333 3703333 Dad?
3709500 3710750 Ladies and gentlemen,
3710833 3713000 the revolution begins right now
3713083 3716167 with Detective Alex Murphy!
3733208 3734208 Detective.
3749000 3750958 - What's he doing?<br />- He looks like a zombie.
3752167 3754250 I think he's accessing criminal data.
3761542 3763333 Thomas King! You are under arrest!
3780958 3784875 Until today, Thomas King was<br />a convicted felon
3784958 3788125 wanted for rape, arson, and murder.
3788833 3792167 This man has torn apart American families.
3793208 3795833 On the loose for six years.
3797625 3802083 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3806000 3810375 Right in front of the police headquarters.
3811042 3814917 Here he is, just steps<br />away from two of Detroit's finest.
3815667 3819667 These two officers are completely unaware
3819750 3822417 of the monster in their midst.
3824875 3827667 And then, in 60 seconds...
3827750 3831417 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3831833 3835042 Detective Murphy brings him down.
3836000 3837542 <i>If you cannot afford an attorney,</i>
3837625 3838917 <i>one will be provided for you.</i>
3840125 3842250 This, my friends,
3842333 3845833 is the future of American justice.
3845917 3849125 How many like Thomas King<br />will pay for their crimes
3849208 3852333 now that RoboCop is here?
3853125 3854375 Yes,
3854458 3858292 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3859500 3862833 Men weren't up to the task.
3863458 3864708 But Alex Murphy,
3865250 3866333 <i>a robot cop,</i>
3867292 3868292 <i>was.</i>
3869708 3870934 We can't take him off the street.
3870958 3872625 This is what I'm saying. He's a hit.
3872708 3874375 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3874458 3876625 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3876708 3878333 Hey, we all knew there would be issues.
3878917 3880208 It's inevitable.
3880292 3882768 Dennett, you're my guy.<br />I just need you to get a handle on this.
3882792 3883952 I know, but I need more time.
3884000 3886583 Scientifically, we're in uncharted water.
3886667 3888917 We need to take him back<br />to the lab and do more tests.
3889000 3890542 I mean, it was like something
3890625 3892083 was interfering with our system.
3892417 3894958 Something beyond chemistry or physics.
3895042 3896917 Like what? His soul?
3897000 3899375 Hey, look, this train<br />has already left the station.
3899458 3901833 I can't exactly go<br />out to the world and say,
3901917 3904417 "Sorry, I released a defective product."
3904500 3905875 So, no matter what we do,
3905958 3907558 we just need to keep him on the streets.
3907583 3909083 What about the interviews?
3909167 3910958 Cancel 'em. Cancel all of 'em.
3911833 3912875 Everything.
3913875 3915083 In fact, Dennett.
3916042 3917125 Let's, uh...
3918125 3920292 <i>Let's keep the wife<br />at a distance for now, as well.</i>
3921917 3923125 <i>I'd like to see him.</i>
3924083 3925625 Can you arrange that?
3925708 3926917 Look, I won't lie to you.
3928083 3931583 Alex was so nervous, we had to sedate him.
3931667 3934458 I looked in his eyes<br />and I couldn't see my husband.
3934542 3936625 And then he just shoots a man<br />in front of our son.
3936708 3937833 That's not sedation.
3939625 3942125 He's responding to drugs differently now.
3944667 3946458 We both knew from day one...
3947708 3949292 there would be complications.
3954458 3955833 Just give me a little more time.
3957458 3958458 I promise...
3960083 3961667 you'll have your husband back.
3964333 3966458 This goes for every squad
3966542 3968042 in every department.
3968375 3971750 Detective Murphy will have<br />full access to all investigations.
3971833 3974625 Robberies, narcotics, homicides.
3974833 3977250 If he requests to take over a case,
3977333 3979000 the case will be handed to him.
3979083 3980833 No arguments, no complaints.
3980917 3981917 This is bullshit!
3982000 3985708 I said no complaints!<br />And I mean it. Now...
3986708 3989708 Good morning, Chief Dean.<br />Good morning, officers.
3989792 3991583 I've selected 13 targets for today,
3991667 3993042 all wanted for murder.
3993125 3994833 John Biggs is target number one.
3994917 3996500 I'll be taking over this case.
3996583 3998708 Ambulances,<br />detention vehicles, and coroners
3998792 4000958 should be ready to move in on my request.
4001042 4002500 I wish you all a very good day.
4010250 4011250 Murphy.
4012333 4013333 You okay, man?
4015708 4016833 I'm fine, Sergeant.
4017958 4019583 Can't wait to get back to work.
4019792 4021726 Lake and Daniels are in there<br />shittin' their pants...
4021750 4022833 Excuse me, I have casework.
4072458 4074917 That's him!
4075000 4077792 Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
4084167 4086208 Walter Karrel, look at me.
4086292 4087542 You have two options.
4087625 4088625 Option one.
4089917 4091917 I shoot you with 50,000 volts
4092000 4093875 which may cause respiratory failure,
4093958 4095083 organ malfunction,
4095167 4097625 internal burns, and loss<br />of bowel and bladder control.
4097708 4099625 And then I arrest you.
4099708 4101292 Option two. You tell me where
4101375 4103250 John Biggs' drug lab is located.
4103750 4105000 And then I arrest you.
4106542 4108250 You have two seconds to decide.
4177542 4178750 Totally justifiable.
4178833 4180917 We are going to make a lot of money.
4181333 4185083 Nothing. No fear.<br />No increase in heart rate.
4185167 4188042 No traces of anger whatsoever.
4188875 4190542 Congratulations, Doctor.
4191458 4192458 You did it.
4193917 4194958 Yes, I did.
4203708 4205208 <i>I told you, sir.</i>
4205292 4208167 Norton clearly never<br />had control of the product.
4208250 4209292 I agree.
4209375 4210695 And that's why I called you here.
4211500 4212768 I just want a second pair of eyes
4212792 4214292 on this thing, that's all.
4214375 4215500 Okay.
4215583 4217458 I'll need a feed from the Tin Man's head
4217542 4219792 plus full surveillance of the lab, and...
4219875 4222292 You're gonna have<br />full access to everything.
4222375 4223417 If anything comes up...
4224250 4225375 I'm gonna be in Washington.
4229958 4231333 <i>He brought peace</i>
4231500 4233875 <i>to this country's most violent city.</i>
4234333 4235333 <i>He showed us all</i>
4235375 4238542 <i>that Detroit and America<br />can have a brighter future.</i>
4238917 4242667 <i>A future of economic growth,<br />freedom, and happiness.</i>
4242750 4246875 On tonight's show,<br />a visionary and true patriot.
4246958 4250583 The CEO of OmniCorp, Raymond Sellars.
4252958 4254000 - Hello, Pat.<br />- Raymond.
4254083 4254958 Thanks for havin' me.
4255042 4257750 You must be doing a victory lap about now.
4257833 4258667 Well...
4258750 4259625 Two weeks ago,
4259708 4262833 Omni's stock went through the roof.
4262917 4265042 And the Senate has finally agreed
4265125 4267208 to vote on the repeal of the Dreyfus Act.
4267292 4268667 Well, look, I mean,
4268750 4270458 the tide is definitely turning.
4270542 4272000 I just feel certain that
4272083 4273723 soon we'll be keeping all Americans safe.
4273792 4275000 I certainly hope so.
4275083 4276375 But, I think
4276458 4278143 our next guest will<br />have a different point of view.
4278167 4279458 Mmm-hmm.
4279542 4280542 Hubert Dreyfus.
4281125 4283042 Senator, thank you for joining us.
4283125 4284917 <i>Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.</i>
4285000 4287375 Senator, do you know what this is?
4287458 4290208 The American public is divided
4290292 4291542 on the Dreyfus Act.
4291958 4297167 Our polls at <i>Novakelement.com</i><br />are tight at 50-50.
4297250 4301125 <i>There is no doubt<br />OmniCorp created a sensation</i>
4301208 4304583 <i>but this bill is not about Alex Murphy.</i>
4304667 4307625 <i>It's about whether<br />America's willing to give robots</i>
4307708 4311292 <i>- the authority over human lives.</i><br />- No. Look, look, look.
4311375 4314792 This sea change we're witnessing,<br />and it is a sea change,
4314875 4317125 shows that Americans don't really care
4317208 4319875 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4319958 4322792 What they care about is efficiency<br />and they care about safety.
4322875 4324208 <i>You're clouding the issue.</i>
4324292 4327625 <i>This is clearly an attempt<br />to sway public opinion</i>
4327708 4329833 <i>- with a marketing stunt.</i><br />- No. What's clear is
4329917 4331833 that with just one system in place,
4331917 4333542 we've cut crime by 80 percent.
4333625 4335667 Just imagine if we put,
4335750 4338000 I don't know,<br />let's say 100 systems in place.
4338083 4339958 And then, I want you to ask yourself,
4340042 4341542 why are you holding us back?
4341625 4343417 <i>- Is that your plan?</i><br />- Thank you, Senator.
4343500 4345458 - And thank you, Raymond.<br />- Thank you, Pat.
4345542 4348542 Well, there you have it.
4348708 4350792 Who could argue with that?
4350875 4352083 Which begs the question.
4353583 4358250 Has the US Senate become pro-crime?
4367583 4368917 Yeah, hi.
4369000 4370167 No, no, 5000.
4371125 4372125 Call me tomorrow.
4373833 4374833 Hey, guys.
4375583 4376863 Vallon's waitin' for you inside.
4378750 4380059 What, you too busy to walk us in?
4380083 4381934 - I'm out here makin' money.<br />- Yeah, yeah, I know.
4381958 4382875 Where are my trip wires?
4382958 4384333 I gotta do this myself?
4385000 4387500 - What took you so long?<br />- What the hell is all this shit?
4387583 4389833 I can't move any product<br />with this thing on the street.
4391000 4392667 What are you doing to protect me?
4392750 4394917 Relax. The guy's a walkin' zombie.
4395000 4396500 And tell me your phones are off.
4396583 4398917 He's not going after you.<br />We covered our tracks.
4399000 4401042 He can't manufacture<br />evidence out of thin air.
4401125 4402875 If he does, I'm ready for him.
4411583 4412583 Well?
4416583 4417833 I've been getting calls.
4417917 4418917 From whom?
4419708 4421458 Well, Ciara.
4421542 4423292 You need to let her see her husband.
4423375 4424625 She has rights.
4425750 4428958 That's not your decision.<br />That's Legal's call.
4429042 4431208 Yeah, but it's only a question of time
4431292 4432708 before she turns up on television.
4433542 4435667 Well, she can try.
4435750 4437958 I'll issue a gag order<br />before I let her see her husband.
4439958 4441000 I'd hop to it.
4443167 4445042 Alex. Alex!
4447167 4450000 Alex, you need to come home.
4450083 4451458 Ciara, please stand aside.
4451542 4453083 You need to speak to your son.
4453167 4455208 Right now, I see three crimes in progress.
4455292 4456542 Alex, listen to me.
4458375 4459375 I know you're in there.
4461500 4463417 David won't show his face at school.
4464667 4466000 He's having nightmares.
4468083 4470417 He's falling apart. I am falling apart.
4472083 4473083 Please.
4475125 4477167 I can't do this on my own.
4477583 4480333 He's been scared ever since that night.
4490292 4491708 <i>What do you think she's gonna do?</i>
4492708 4493833 What's he gonna do?
4514917 4516458 <i>Are you okay?</i>
4516542 4518875 <i>David? David.</i>
4519333 4521458 <i>Stand back. Come on, stand back!</i>
4542083 4544250 He's supposed to be watching this.
4544333 4546167 Instead, he's accessing
4546250 4548833 images of Ciara and David<br />arriving at school.
4548917 4550958 Over and over again.
4551042 4554792 Somehow, he's overriding<br />the system's priorities.
4565625 4567833 <i>- Do you want me to shut him down?<br />- No.</i>
4567917 4568917 Not yet.
4570792 4572292 I wanna see what happens.
4592292 4593833 What's he doing at his house?
4596333 4598417 Look, he's disobeying protocol.
4598500 4600125 You have to shut him down.
4600208 4602500 As far as I can tell,<br />he's still doing his job.
4662625 4664833 Adrian, give me an image of his brain.
4666875 4669875 He's undoing what we did to him.
4669958 4672708 His dopamine levels<br />are coming back to normal.
4672792 4674750 How is that even possible?
4676375 4677917 I haven't the faintest idea.
4679167 4680167 <i>Alex.</i>
4706917 4708833 <i>Alex, please return to the station.</i>
4710208 4711375 I wanna run some tests.
4712500 4713917 Well, this should be interesting.
4731583 4732833 <i>And your phone on the table!</i>
4732917 4734893 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
4734917 4736833 - Whoa!<br />- What'd you say?
4738125 4739750 We work for Antoine Vallon.
4768750 4770125 My hand, man!
4770208 4772417 - Where's Antoine Vallon?<br />- You broke my hand, man!
4773583 4774958 I know you remember me, Jerry.
4779458 4780458 Where's Vallon?
4780500 4781333 Wait, man.
4781417 4782851 Wait, man.<br />If I tell you where Vallon is,
4782875 4784333 he'll kill my wife and kid, man.
4785708 4787375 Your wife left you in 2019
4787458 4789417 after filing charges for domestic abuse.
4789500 4790625 And you don't have a kid.
4791917 4792917 But I do.
4794417 4795792 I'm not askin' again!
4795875 4798083 Look, I swear, man.<br />I don't know where Vallon is, okay?
4798167 4799887 The only guy I talk to<br />is his driver Marcus.
4799917 4801417 That's it, man. That's it!
4801875 4803333 Does he have a phone number?
4820125 4822833 We have a problem.<br />Alex is breaking protocol.
4823667 4824667 What's he doing?
4824750 4826583 He's off solving his own murder.
4826958 4829625 Oh, that is genius.
4830125 4831375 Why didn't I think of that?
4839000 4840333 <i>How long till he gets here?</i>
4840417 4842542 - <i>Five minutes.</i><br />- All right.
4843042 4844500 Johnny, you stay on these monitors.
4844583 4845625 What happened?
4847292 4849667 Some idiot used an unencrypted phone.
4851333 4852333 Shit.
4860542 4861833 All right, everyone, listen up!
4862583 4864042 He's coming.
4864125 4866833 He leaves alive, you don't.
4868125 4869292 How do we stop him?
4871375 4874125 .50 caliber and above. Aim for the head.
4886333 4888000 This one's set.
4888083 4889417 Let's go. Go!
4889500 4890625 All right, move! Let's go!
4892167 4893500 Come on. Come on!
4896000 4897000 Ready to go!
4897917 4899000 They're all set.
4987000 4988000 Finish it!
5002833 5004083 Freak, die!
5053208 5054208 Watch out.
5055000 5056417 Need me to call a doctor?
5056500 5058208 Come on, Jack. You're gonna like this.
5060625 5062184 What's going on?<br />What the hell you doin' here?
5062208 5063601 Y'all gonna play good cop, bad cop?
5063625 5065833 Nah, Daniels. Bad cop, RoboCop.
5068417 5070083 I've recovered 26 guns
5070167 5071708 from Vallon's warehouse.
5071792 5073000 13 serial numbers
5073083 5074625 match weapons missing from Evidence.
5074708 5076375 And I got your prints all over 'em.
5076458 5077833 This is bullshit.
5077917 5080583 I also have<br />CCTV footage of you and Vallon
5080667 5082208 the same day he tried to kill me.
5082292 5084184 <i>So put him on the payroll.<br />Why we talkin' about this?</i>
5084208 5085208 <i>It won't work.</i>
5085292 5087625 <i>Now that his partner got hit,<br />he's never gonna let it go.</i>
5087708 5089125 <i>- What is that?<br />- Lewis' hospital.</i>
5089208 5090917 <i>Murphy's dropping by this afternoon.</i>
5091000 5093542 <i>I kill a cop,<br />I'm lookin' over my shoulder...</i>
5093625 5095708 You know what<br />they do to cops in prison, man?
5096500 5098917 Being locked up with<br />the same dudes you put in there?
5102625 5104305 How long you think before he gives you up?
5107958 5110625 Don't shoot me. Okay?
5111750 5113875 I swear to Christ. It was Dean.
5114375 5116542 She helped pull those guns.<br />Just don't shoot me.
5118917 5120542 Thank you for your cooperation.
5123083 5124458 You can cuff him now, Jack.
5133542 5135417 Now I know why we couldn't get an arrest.
5137208 5139000 'Cause Vallon was<br />protected from up on high.
5139083 5140583 Alex, I can explain.
5141583 5142875 You tipped him off today.
5142958 5145500 - Come on, man. Don't do this.<br />- You tried to kill me twice.
5146292 5149708 I trusted you.<br />And you destroyed my family.
5150125 5151167 Confess.
5152208 5153542 Now, in front of everyone.
5154083 5155083 Confess!
5164917 5165917 What happened?
5165958 5168208 Tin Man is down. Had to be done.
5168292 5169417 <i>Why?</i>
5169500 5170833 Product shot a corrupt cop.
5170917 5172309 Two more seconds, the chief's brains
5172333 5174542 would've been splattered<br />across the 6:00 news.
5175292 5176542 We got anything on her?
5176625 5179000 Well, she's the Chief of<br />the Detroit Police Department.
5179750 5180750 What do you think?
5184708 5185708 You know what?
5187500 5190042 This might actually tip<br />this thing right into the net.
5197250 5200458 <i>Alex,<br />I don't know if you can hear me.</i>
5200542 5203833 <i>But tonight,<br />you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>
5203917 5206542 <i>inside the Detroit Police Department.</i>
5206625 5207750 <i>And in so doing,</i>
5207833 5210417 <i>you shed light on an invaluable truth.</i>
5211542 5212958 Even the police,
5213042 5216792 the men and women<br />who swore to keep us safe,
5217708 5218833 they can be bribed.
5219958 5222667 They can be bought.
5224542 5228417 Machines, however, are corruption-free.
5229583 5231917 Americans could be living in a country
5232000 5234833 where law enforcement<br />is not only efficient,
5235458 5236625 but incorruptible.
5238333 5240333 Thank you, Alex, for all you've done.
5240917 5242458 And for all that you are.
5243208 5246000 <i>Detective Murphy is<br />currently in critical condition.</i>
5246958 5248875 Our doctors are working ceaselessly
5249792 5252250 but, at this time,<br />it is unclear if he will survive.
5253833 5255833 <i>Ms. Kline,<br />how do you think the attempt</i>
5255917 5257792 <i>on Detective Alex Murphy's life</i>
5257875 5260083 <i>will affect tomorrow's vote<br />for the Dreyfus Act?</i>
5260167 5262125 <i>At this time,<br />OmniCorp's sole concern</i>
5262208 5264125 <i>is the full recovery of Detective Murphy.</i>
5265292 5267542 <i>How many times does Detective Murphy</i>
5267625 5269708 <i>have to give his life for his country?</i>
5270625 5272583 <i>I sincerely hope...</i>
5273500 5275542 <i>the Senate makes the right vote tomorrow</i>
5275625 5280083 <i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices<br />will not have been in vain.</i>
5284917 5287042 <i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>
5287125 5290125 <i>He has been my mentor and my strength</i>
5290208 5292083 <i>in times of difficulty on this floor.</i>
5293083 5295708 <i>But despite all that,<br />I work for the state of Ohio,</i>
5296083 5298833 <i>and the safety of<br />its citizens is my top priority.</i>
5299708 5300958 <i>So I vote yes.</i>
5301042 5302917 <i>The Dreyfus Act must be repealed.</i>
5303583 5305917 That's us ahead, 39 to 10.
5306000 5308917 Yeah, I spoke to the Senate liaison<br />and it looks like it's in the bag,
5309000 5311333 but we still have to tread<br />carefully with the politicians.
5313542 5315833 <i>We're here live<br />at DPD headquarters</i>
5315917 5317625 <i>where moments ago, Ciara Murphy</i>
5317708 5320000 <i>- made a shocking statement.</i><br />- What the hell?
5320083 5324833 <i>OmniCorp has denied me and my son<br />access to Alex for weeks.</i>
5325625 5327250 <i>I demand to know why.</i>
5328625 5333292 <i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody<br />needs to be held accountable.</i>
5334583 5336583 Oh, we're fucked.
5336667 5338083 No, we only need 12 votes.
5338167 5339750 She shouldn't make much difference.
5339833 5341708 Yeah,<br />but what about after the vote?
5341792 5344125 I mean, those two<br />should not be allowed contact.
5344208 5346708 If she starts putting ideas in his head...
5346792 5349333 Bring her in. I'll handle the explanation.
5349417 5351000 And what about Alex?
5351083 5353243 You know, unfortunately,<br />we can't just keep him on ice.
5354000 5356417 The shooting at the station<br />spooked some of the politicians.
5356500 5358667 They're our clients.<br />We have to take care of them.
5359042 5361792 They're fine when a machine<br />is lowering the murder rate,
5361875 5366125 but when a man is investigating<br />city politics, they get nervous.
5366208 5368417 All right. First off,<br />it's not a man, okay?
5368500 5370500 It's property of OmniCorp.
5370583 5372917 And politics are<br />the least of your concern.
5373000 5374640 I mean, this thing solved its own murder.
5374708 5377059 How long till it realizes<br />you haven't been on the level with it?
5377083 5378375 If that happens,
5378458 5381208 every journalist in this country<br />is dying to speak to him.
5381292 5383083 I mean, we created a hero.
5384000 5386333 What happens when he opens his mouth?
5390042 5391625 What's bigger than a hero?
5403417 5404500 Dead hero.
5408958 5410833 Get me Dr. Norton.
5420000 5421250 What is this, Raymond?
5421917 5426375 You have Mattox spying on me and now this<br />bullshit about a "critical condition"?
5426458 5429208 You know and I know Alex is fine!
5429292 5430667 Calm down.
5430750 5432208 Dennett.
5432292 5433572 Your work is so good, I don't...
5433625 5435018 Well, now, this is not about my work!
5435042 5437083 You saw the woman on TV!
5437167 5438792 This has to stop!
5441083 5442083 You're right.
5443042 5445292 But let me ask you something, Dennett.
5445375 5447667 What kind of life have<br />we really given Alex Murphy?
5447750 5451292 He's never gonna be a normal man,<br />a father, a husband.
5451375 5454667 By the time we put the other units<br />on the street, he's just...
5454750 5455792 Dennett.
5457833 5458917 Let's face it.
5459958 5461292 We failed him.
5463042 5464792 We failed Alex Murphy.
5464875 5466755 But I want you to think<br />about the bigger picture
5466792 5468458 'cause that's what we're talking about.
5468542 5471167 The work you've done with him<br />is gonna be studied for decades.
5471250 5473375 You've changed<br />the face of history, Dennett.
5473458 5477875 No policeman is ever going to die<br />in the line of duty again
5478500 5479833 'cause of you.
5481750 5483042 You think about that.
5491667 5495667 I want that family taken care of
5495750 5497125 beyond their wildest dreams.
5497208 5498917 - We owe them that.<br />- I agree.
5500042 5502750 I want full funding. 10 years.
5503917 5505542 New staff, all my own people.
5505625 5506917 Fantastic.
5507875 5508875 Deal.
5519250 5520917 Hey. What's going on?
5521000 5522840 Security's here.<br />They're clearing everyone out.
5522917 5524208 They're not waking him up.
5524750 5526708 Whatever you do, don't leave him alone.
5526792 5528472 What do you mean<br />they're not waking him up?
5530125 5531542 <i>The voting period has ended.</i>
5531625 5534208 <i>The clerks have tabulated the results.</i>
5534292 5536375 <i>The yeas are 63.</i>
5536458 5538292 <i>The nays are 22.</i>
5539083 5541333 <i>A majority of senators<br />have voted in the affirmative.</i>
5541917 5544958 <i>The Dreyfus Act has<br />been repealed by Congress.</i>
5551250 5553458 God, you guys are slow,<br />like a bunch of girls.
5553542 5554667 This is Mattox.
5554750 5556208 <i>Dennett's on board.</i>
5556292 5557500 It's about time.
5563083 5564083 Call it.
5564917 5566125 <i>Get it done.</i>
5567250 5568250 My pleasure.
5577375 5579708 - Mrs. Murphy...<br />- You can come here as much as you want.
5579792 5582958 You can threaten me.<br />You can sue me. You can take my home,
5583042 5586417 but I am not gonna stop till I see<br />my husband. Do you understand that?
5586500 5588625 Mr. Sellars would<br />very much like to see you.
5590583 5592250 Is Alex okay?
5592333 5595167 He has important information to share<br />with you. Will you accompany me?
5598167 5599167 David.
5601083 5602875 We gotta go. Can you grab your coat?
5602958 5605250 Hey!
5605333 5606773 <i>I'm in the elevator, on my way down.</i>
5606833 5608250 I need access to the lab.
5608333 5609693 That's insane. They're still here.
5610000 5611583 <i>Distract them.</i>
5611917 5613000 Okay.
5614333 5615458 I cannot...
5615542 5617375 There's a lady in here going hysterical.
5617458 5619559 She will not let us in.<br />She's got the codes for the door.
5619583 5621292 I repeat, she will not let us in.
5621375 5623684 Lady, you need to let us in there now.<br />We have to get in there.
5623708 5625351 Are you not understanding what I'm saying?
5625375 5628292 Do you wanna be responsible for<br />the deaths of everyone in this building?
5628375 5629375 Hey! Stop!
5633792 5634958 Don't shoot!
5635042 5636208 Step outside.
5642833 5644375 Unlock the transmitter!
5645875 5647000 Transmitter unlocked!
5654542 5656333 Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.
5656417 5657708 <i>Right away, sir.</i>
5660125 5661125 <i>Wake him up!</i>
5661875 5664667 Alex! Alex!
5665167 5668375 Alex, it's Dr. Norton,<br />you have to wake up!
5668458 5669625 Alex, can you hear me?
5671167 5672708 These men are here to kill us!
5672958 5675208 They're here to kill us, for Christ sakes!
5680375 5681833 <i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>
5681917 5683583 Alex had a psychotic break.
5684250 5688250 He killed an unarmed colleague<br />and later suffered a seizure.
5689792 5691042 We did everything,
5691125 5694417 everything we could,<br />but the doctors couldn't save him.
5695667 5698000 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5698083 5700043 We're going to be<br />making the announcement shortly.
5701083 5703375 You shut me down.<br />I was about to get a confession.
5703958 5705083 Mattox shut you down.
5707125 5709542 I've removed your transmitter<br />so he won't do it again.
5710333 5712000 Sellars can't afford to wake you up.
5713583 5715542 He sent these guys to pull the plug.
5716250 5719417 He wants you dead,<br />Alex. Do you understand?
5719875 5721542 Sorry.<br />If there's anything we can do
5721625 5723083 for you and David, we'll do it.
5723167 5724750 I want nothing from you.
5726458 5727542 I understand.
5728250 5729833 You stay out of our lives.
5732000 5733542 You and your company.
5733625 5734945 If that's what you think is best.
5736167 5737542 There's one more thing.
5737625 5740750 I think it would be to the benefit<br />of everyone, especially David,
5740833 5742833 if we kept this matter private.
5742917 5745292 We don't wanna damage Alex's legacy.
5748292 5750500 <i>Alex! Alex!</i>
5750583 5751792 I can fix this!
5752250 5753542 You lied to me.
5753833 5754958 You lied to my wife.
5755292 5757059 You're working for<br />the people that are trying to kill me.
5757083 5759833 - You want me to trust you, Doctor?<br />- Alex, I can go to the press!
5761667 5764167 Alex, I can tell them the whole story!
5764708 5765708 Alex!
5766500 5767833 Listen to me, please!
5769417 5772458 Alex! Alex!
5784292 5785333 What the hell?
5793833 5795273 Keep all our systems at green light,
5795333 5797250 and for Christ sakes,<br />get Sellars on the phone.
5797333 5798375 <i>Roger that.</i>
5798458 5800417 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
5801792 5803000 Look at this city.
5805333 5806500 So beautiful.
5807625 5809833 It's become so peaceful.
5813208 5814333 I wish...
5815583 5817500 I had some good news for Detroit.
5818208 5820208 I have very sad news.
5820292 5822750 Despite our best efforts to save him,
5823167 5825542 Alex Murphy passed away just hours ago.
5826125 5827250 Alex Murphy...
5827333 5828792 Mr. Sellars.
5828875 5830542 - What is it?<br />- Mattox just called.
5831125 5832625 We need you to come with us now.
5839208 5841226 Ma'am, I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way, please.
5841250 5843268 - What are you talking about?<br />- We have a security situation here.
5843292 5845018 I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way.
5845042 5846143 Sir, there's a car outside...
5846167 5847958 That area is locked down. Now go.
5848042 5849750 - What's happening?<br />- I said go!
5850458 5852000 I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.
5855292 5856292 Mr. Sellars.
5856667 5857917 How close is that helicopter?
5858000 5859042 About 10 minutes, sir.
5876417 5877833 - Excuse me.<br />- Yes?
5877917 5880208 I need to speak with Sergeant Jack Lewis.
5880292 5881667 It's an emergency.
5881833 5883833 Stand by. Mr. Sellars.
5883917 5885757 Apparently there's<br />a Ciara Murphy in the lobby.
5886208 5889000 Raymond, if she sees him,<br />we are dead in the water.
5889083 5890083 What do you wanna do?
5890458 5891625 Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.
5891708 5892708 Yes, sir.
5896708 5899625 Norton said they may be<br />using drones for protection.
5899708 5901833 So whatever you do,<br />do not draw your weapons.
5901917 5904333 They won't shoot if we're unarmed. Clear?
5904417 5905625 Clear.
5922042 5923292 Hold it right there.
5923375 5925375 Don't move.
5927958 5932458 This is private property.<br />You are not authorized to be here!
5936333 5938625 I'd put those guns down now if I were you.
5938708 5940868 - Stand down.<br />- All right, man, we're good, we're good.
5943083 5944083 Go, back it up!
5987167 5988167 Head to the lower level.
5989750 5990833 Hold up, hold up!
5990917 5992000 Ram it!
6052375 6053417 Gun it.
6055042 6056500 Go, go, go! Now!
6072625 6073958 Alex, run!
6075125 6077083 OmniCorp Security!<br />Drop your weapons!
6077167 6078917 <i>Drop your weapon.</i>
6079333 6082292 <i>Keep your hands above your head<br />and no one will be harmed.</i>
6097292 6098458 What's going on?
6098542 6100917 Mrs. Murphy,<br />I want you to listen to me carefully.
6101000 6103500 The organic part of<br />your husband Alex is dead.
6103583 6105750 The robotic part of him is malfunctioning,
6105833 6107059 and he's shooting up the building.
6107083 6109667 So we've gotta get you and your son<br />out of here right away.
6109750 6111125 I gotta take this call.
6112417 6114292 He just left the lobby<br />and he's headed our way.
6114375 6115583 <i>Roger that, sir.</i>
6116375 6118042 Don't shoot. My robot.
6118125 6119500 - You just flank.<br />- Got it.
6119583 6120833 Tin Man.
6123625 6124833 Tin Man.
6125792 6127000 Tin Man.
6127417 6128583 Oh, there it is.
6129458 6130625 You look like crap.
6133458 6134542 What's the matter?
6134625 6135833 Can't shoot?
6137625 6138625 Huh?
6139458 6141208 What were you thinking?<br />This isn't a drill.
6141375 6142625 You're a robot.
6142875 6145667 I'm a red asset. Wrote that myself.
6145750 6146750 What do you think?
6147500 6150292 Come on, Tin Man, just pull the trigger.
6150375 6151375 Pull it.
6152125 6153417 You can run.
6153917 6154958 Go on.
6155042 6156083 Run.
6156667 6157917 Run!
6158000 6159750 There you go. Run.
6160375 6162000 Run. Run!
6164708 6165958 Whoo!
6166375 6168375 Stings like a bitch, don't it?
6168708 6171583 Aren't you lucky I didn't<br />have my gun set to "kill"?
6173167 6174792 Hey, listen.
6174875 6176083 This isn't personal.
6177667 6179333 Well, maybe a little.
6181042 6182708 I'm gonna put you out of your misery.
6194625 6195792 <i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>
6195875 6197583 Mr. Sellars boards first.
6197667 6200708 No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy,<br />you and your son can get on first.
6205792 6207167 Officer down.
6207250 6208417 Mechanical room.
6208500 6209875 OmniCorp Building.
6209958 6211833 <i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>
6213667 6215417 You're gonna be okay, Jack.
6215500 6216583 It's nonfatal.
6216667 6218250 Go. Go.
6219667 6222000 Omni-LZ Helo-1<br />on approach to deck.
6229000 6230000 What's that?
6231958 6233250 - He's got a gun!<br />- What?
6233333 6234333 Pull up! Pull up!
6239125 6241458 - What the hell is he doing?<br />- Sorry, sir. I don't know.
6247000 6248125 Alex?
6248208 6249208 Dad?
6252458 6253833 Ciara, David.
6255333 6256333 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6256375 6257375 Wait.
6258417 6260458 - Get out of the way.<br />- Alex, put down the gun.
6260542 6262833 Ciara, take David<br />and get out of the way now!
6264333 6266000 Raymond Sellars, you're under arrest
6266083 6267958 for the attempted murder<br />of a police officer.
6271292 6273792 Oh, you're here to cuff me? All right.
6274667 6276000 Go ahead, cuff me.
6277250 6280083 You can't. You're not programmed that way.
6280167 6281417 If you go against the program,
6281500 6283500 the entire system shuts down, so.
6283583 6285851 You don't even have a warrant.<br />We'll overlook this little...
6285875 6287934 Get down on the ground and<br />put your hands behind your back.
6287958 6289458 - I'm just from marketing.<br />- Now!
6289542 6291250 Okay, yep, yep, yep. Yep.
6291333 6293750 Alex, we need to work together here.
6293833 6297167 Because I'm the only one with<br />the technology to keep you alive.
6298417 6300083 Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
6305833 6307125 All right.
6307208 6308208 Weapon.
6309958 6313208 Alex, honestly, I mean you no harm.
6313292 6315542 If I wanted to, I could<br />have killed you a long time ago.
6315625 6317559 I just aim this right at<br />your head and blow it off.
6317583 6319375 Sellars, please! Don't!
6319458 6322292 I mean, if I wanted to, I could<br />just aim this at your little family...
6323208 6324792 and I could just kill them too.
6324875 6326726 And really, there's<br />nothing you could do about it
6326750 6328000 because, let's face it,
6329500 6330625 you're a robot.
6331458 6332917 Do you understand that?
6337458 6338458 Alex.
6341417 6342458 Dad!
6346500 6347792 Baby.
6353625 6354708 Hey.
6356292 6357750 Hey.
6357833 6359708 Everything's gonna be all right.
6360833 6362583 Everything's gonna be all right.
6412833 6414250 How are you feeling, Alex?
6416292 6417417 I'm ready.
6455292 6456792 He's ready.
6490625 6492000 There's still no word
6492083 6495042 from OmniCorp parent company, OCP.
6496000 6499792 And although the government<br />says they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,
6499875 6502042 rumors continue to<br />swirl about his condition.
6502583 6507042 But we have obtained<br />exclusive video taken by cell phone
6507125 6509667 that shows the people of Detroit
6509750 6511792 may have Alex Murphy back on the streets
6511875 6513333 sooner than they think.
6515500 6517042 The real tragedy here
6517125 6522167 is that our president<br />chose to uphold the Dreyfus Act.
6523125 6527792 Now, I have no doubt he was<br />manipulated by our biased media
6527875 6531583 and by whistle-blower Dennett Norton.
6531667 6535333 <i>I acknowledge<br />we know less than we thought.</i>
6536458 6538875 <i>But I do believe<br />my research program is sound.</i>
6540875 6542083 <i>What I did with it...</i>
6543875 6544750 <i>was wrong.</i>
6544833 6547833 The fact that this mother
6547917 6551250 is not serving time in<br />some federal penitentiary
6551333 6554833 is a huge, hot,<br />heaping pile of horse.
6561042 6565375 Now I know some of you may think<br />that this kind of thinking is dangerous
6565458 6568958 and these machines<br />violate your civil liberties.
6569417 6573750 Some of you even believe<br />that the use of these drones overseas
6573833 6578167 makes us the same<br />kind of bullying imperialists
6578625 6580833 that our forefathers<br />were trying to escape.
6581667 6583708 To you, I say...
6584625 6586542 stop whining!
6588542 6591250 America is now
6591333 6593750 and always will be
6593833 6597750 the greatest country<br />on the face of the Earth!
6602583 6603833 I'm Pat Novak.
6605667 6606833 Good night.
