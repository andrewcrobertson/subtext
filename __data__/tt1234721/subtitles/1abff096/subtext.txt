49936 51850 -(singing descending scale)<br />- DIRECTOR: And we're on
51939 56893 in four, three, two, one.
58863 62404 What if I told you that even the<br />worst neighborhood in America
62532 64400 could be made completely safe,
64534 67404 and what if I told you<br />that this could be accomplished
67537 72082 without risking the life of one<br />single law enforcement officer?
72251 73413 How do I know this?
73543 75913 Because it's happening right now
76005 80880 in every country in the world<br />but this one.
80968 85137 I'm Pat Novak, and welcome<br />to "The Novak Element."
88184 90598 In tonight's<br />State of the Union segment
90728 92471 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe,
92606 95600 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
95691 98483 General Monroe,<br />welcome back.
98612 100320 - Good to see you, Pat.<br />- Uh, thank you
100446 104273 for this unprecedented<br />access to your operation.
104409 106118 Could you walk us through
106202 107946 what we're seeing here?
108039 110328 Well, this is a, uh,<br />a routine operation.
110457 112324 We found that<br />random patrols
112459 114121 helped the local population
114252 116121 to feel safer<br />and to trust us.
116213 117124 It's amazing.
117214 118797 And what are these colored dots
118924 121294 that we're seeing here,<br />General?
121427 123636 These are our assets<br />on the ground.
123720 126637 Uh, in green,<br />we got the ED-2093.
126724 129684 They're the big boys,<br />they secure the perimeter.
129810 131520 Purple are the<br />smaller EM-2083.
131646 133136 They sweep and mop up.
133271 136189 And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.
136318 138026 (laughs)
138152 140988 It is great to see<br />American machines
141072 143657 helping to promote peace<br />and freedom abroad.
143782 145992 All right, you guys, this is<br />just standard op, all right?
146077 147365 There's no<br />opposition expected.
147495 149990 I'm gonna set your<br />markers to code red.
150082 151288 (blipping)
153084 155795 All our drones are gonna give<br />top priority to your safety.
155878 157997 No red assets<br />have ever been lost.
158090 159126 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
159216 160548 That make you feel better?
160675 162463 -(woman chuckles)<br />- But, listen,
162678 164010 you keep those bracelets on,<br />you're completely safe.
164137 165378 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
165513 166970 Okay, enjoy the show.

213354 215394 Your cooperation<br />is appreciated.
215482 219184 We apologize for<br />any inconvenience.
219278 220269 As-salaam alaikum.

230289 231405 Incredible.
231498 233788 In... credible!
233918 237790 Not long ago, that would have<br />been American men and women
237880 241878 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
241967 243459 Uh, General, you care
243594 244926 to comment on this?
245012 247974 Well, Pat, we had<br />Vietnam, we had Iraq,
248099 250593 we had Afghanistan--
250685 252223 never again.
252312 255273 From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.
255356 256722 We can accomplish<br />our objectives
256816 259277 without any loss<br />to American lives,
259360 261273 and I think<br />the honest people over there
261362 263150 really appreciate it.
263281 264613 A-And why wouldn't they?
264699 267285 For the first time<br />in their lives,
267368 269281 they get to watch<br />their children grow up
269370 273699 in an environment<br />of safety and security.

3991120 3993032 Good morning, officers.
3993163 3995909 I've selected 13 targets for<br />today, all wanted for murder.
3996042 3997328 John Biggs is target number one.
3997417 3998659 I'll be taking over this case.
3998752 4001372 Ambulances, detention<br />vehicles, and coroners
4001463 4004049 should be ready<br />to move in on my request.

4014644 4016728 you okay, man?

4092056 4094892 I shoot you<br />with 50,000 volts,
4094976 4098302 which may cause respiratory<br />failure, organ malfunction,
4098438 4100807 internal burns, and loss of<br />bowel and bladder control,
4100899 4102812 and then I arrest you.
4102902 4104359 Option two: you tell me
4104486 4106821 where John Biggs' drug lab<br />is located,
4106906 4109491 and then I arrest you.
4109574 4112366 You have two seconds<br />to decide.

4244880 4246794 On tonight's show,
4246883 4249958 a visionary and true patriot:
4250053 4254004 the CEO of Omnicorp,<br />Raymond Sellars.
4254140 4255849 (applause)
4255975 4256842 - Hello, Pat.<br />- Raymond.
4256977 4258308 Thanks for having me.
4258436 4261022 You must be doing a<br />victory lap about now.
4261147 4263140 - Well...<br />- Two weeks ago,
4263232 4265647 Omni's stock went<br />through the roof,
4265735 4268149 and the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4268237 4270481 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.
4270615 4273451 Well, look, I mean,<br />the tide is definitely turning.
4273535 4275495 I, I just feel certain<br />that, soon,
4275580 4276991 we'll be keeping<br />all Americans safe.
4277080 4278163 I certainly<br />hope so,
4278248 4280333 but I think<br />our next guest will have
4280418 4281453 a different point of view.
4281543 4282660 SELLARS:<br />Mm-hmm.
4282753 4284336 Hubert Dreyfus.
4284421 4286460 Senator, thank you<br />for joining us.
4286548 4287881 Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.
4288008 4290878 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4291011 4293551 The American public is divided
4293681 4295172 on the Dreyfus Act.
4295349 4300178 Our polls at NovakEIement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4300312 4304185 There is no doubt Omnicorp<br />created a sensation,
4304317 4307813 but this bill is not<br />about Alex Murphy.
4307903 4310694 It's about whether America<br />is willing to give robots
4310781 4311864 the authority<br />over human lives.
4311992 4314486 No, no, no, no,<br />look, look, look.
4314577 4317163 This, uh, sea change<br />we're witnessing--
4317247 4320117 and it is a sea change-- shows<br />that Americans don't really care
4320208 4322919 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4323044 4324912 What they care about<br />is efficiency
4325046 4326333 and they care about safety.
4326422 4327880 You're clouding<br />the issue.
4328008 4330719 This is clearly an attempt<br />to sway public opinion
4330802 4333341 -with a marketing stunt.<br />- No, what's clear is
4333429 4335173 that with just one system<br />in place,
4335266 4336723 We've cut crime by 80%.
4336808 4339347 Just imagine if we put,<br />I don't know,
4339435 4340724 let's say<br />a hundred systems in place.
4340813 4343728 And then I want you<br />to ask yourself,
4343815 4345354 why are you holding us back?
4345443 4346558 - Is that your plan?<br />- Thank you, Senator.
4346693 4348561 - And thank you, Raymond.<br />- Thank you, Pat.
4348654 4351945 Well, there you have it.
4352073 4353942 Who could argue with that?
4354076 4356695 Which begs the question:
4356828 4358913 has the U.S. Senate
4358998 4362494 become pro-crime?

4381730 4383267 What, you too busy<br />to walk us in?
4383398 4384855 - I'm out here making money.<br />- Yeah, no, I know.
4384983 4386098 VALLON:<br />Where are my trip wires?
4386235 4387772 I gotta do this myself?
4387861 4389227 What took you so long?

4432365 4434359 Yeah, but it's only<br />a question of time
4434493 4436862 before she turns up<br />on television.
4436995 4438989 Well, she can try.
4439081 4441871 I'll issue a gag order before<br />I let her see her husband.

4457392 4458679 I see three crimes in progress.

5078239 5079479 and I got your prints<br />all over them.
5079573 5081316 This is bullshit.
5081409 5082445 I also have
5082576 5084535 CCTV footage of you and Vallon
5084662 5085995 the same day he<br />tried to kill me.
5086080 5087663 VALLON:<br />So put him on the payroll.
5087790 5089533 - Why we talking about this?<br />- DANIELS: It won't work.
5089667 5091661 Now that his partner got hit,<br />he's never gonna let it go.
5091753 5093336 - What is that?<br />- Lewis's hospital.
5093462 5094954 Murphy's dropping by<br />this afternoon.
5095131 5096498 If I kill a cop, I'm looking<br />over my shoulder.
5096591 5097831 I kill a cop,<br />I'm looking over...
5097925 5099292 LEWIS:<br />You know what they do to cops
5099386 5101345 in prison, man?<br />Being locked up
5101430 5102887 with the same dudes<br />you put in there?
5103014 5104802 VALLON: I kill a cop,<br />I'm looking over my shoulder
5104891 5105677 the rest of my life.
5105767 5106724 If I kill a cop...
5106851 5108513 How long you think<br />before he gives you up?
5108602 5110312 (people screaming)
5111189 5112807 Don't shoot me.
5112899 5115735 Okay?
5115819 5118234 I swear to Christ, it was Dean.
5118363 5119901 She helped pull those guns.
5119990 5122985 Just don't shoot me.
5123077 5124786 Thank you<br />for your cooperation.
5125995 5127158 (Lake groaning)
5127247 5128956 You can cuff him now, Jack.
5137884 5140344 Now, I know why<br />we couldn't get an arrest.
5140428 5143219 'Cause Vallon was protected<br />from up on high.
5143348 5145557 Alex, I can explain.
5145683 5146924 You tipped him off today.
5147059 5148142 Come on, man.<br />Don't do this.
5148269 5150011 You tried to kill me twice.
5150104 5152223 I trusted you,
5152315 5153772 and you destroyed my family.
5153899 5156234 Confess.
5156319 5158232 Now, in front of everyone.
5158363 5159229 Confess!
5159364 5160982 (power whirrs off)
5169124 5170035 What happened?
5170166 5171249 MATTOX (over radio):<br />Tin Man is down.
5171377 5172412 Had to be done.
5172502 5173539 Why?
5173629 5174961 Product shot a corrupt cop.
5175088 5176546 Two more seconds,<br />the chief's brains
5176632 5179218 would've been splattered<br />across the 6:00 News.
5179301 5181590 - We got anything on her?<br />- Well, she's, uh,
5181678 5183296 the Chief of the Detroit<br />Police Department.
5183430 5185799 What do you think?
5188519 5190762 You know what?
5190896 5194474 This might actually tip<br />this thing right into the net.
5201282 5204118 NOVAK: Alex, I don't know<br />if you can hear me,
5204201 5208120 but tonight,<br />you uncovered a nest of vipers
5208248 5210287 inside the Detroit<br />Police Department.
5210375 5212915 And in so doing, you shed light
5213003 5215747 on an invaluable truth.
5215838 5217251 Even the police,
5217340 5218957 the men and women
5219050 5221967 who swore to keep us safe,
5222095 5224179 they can be bribed.
5224264 5226884 They... can be bought.
5228518 5230808 Machines, however,
5230938 5233307 are corruption-free.
5233399 5236190 Americans could be living<br />in a country
5236319 5239644 where law enforcement<br />is not only efficient,
5239738 5242653 but incorruptible.
5242741 5244700 Thank you, Alex,<br />for all you've done,
5244827 5246866 and for all that you are.
5246995 5250321 Detective Murphy is currently<br />in critical condition.
5250499 5253163 Our doctors are<br />working ceaselessly
5253252 5256167 but, at this time, it is<br />unclear if he will survive.
5256296 5257881 (reporters clamoring)
5258007 5259875 KELLY: Ms. Kline,<br />how do you think the attempt
5260009 5261968 on Detective<br />Alex Murphy's life
5262053 5264343 will affect tomorrow's vote<br />for the Dreyfus Act?
5264431 5266218 LIZ: At this time,<br />Omnicorp's sole concern
5266349 5268810 is the full recovery<br />of Detective Murphy.
5268893 5271182 NOVAK: How many times<br />does Detective Murphy
5271354 5274190 have to give his life<br />for his country?
5274315 5277858 I sincerely hope
5277987 5279854 the Senate makes<br />the right vote tomorrow,
5279946 5281689 so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
5281781 5284525 will not have been in vain.
5288788 5290998 OHIO SENATOR (voice-over):<br />Senator Dreyfus is my friend.
5291083 5294204 He has been<br />my mentor and my strength
5294294 5296207 in times of difficulty<br />on this floor.
5296296 5299712 But despite all that,<br />I work for the state of Ohio
5299799 5303091 and the safety of its citizens<br />is my top priority.
5303220 5305213 So I vote yes.
5305347 5307215 The Dreyfus Act<br />must be repealed.
5307307 5310018 That's us ahead, 39 to 10.
5310102 5311560 Yeah, I spoke to<br />the Senate liaison,
5311687 5313396 and it looks like<br />it's in the bag.
5313481 5315896 But we still have to tread<br />carefully with the politicians.
5318277 5320271 We're here live<br />at DPD headquarters
5320405 5322739 where moments ago, Clara Murphy<br />made a shocking statement.
5322823 5324236 POPE:<br />What the hell?
5324326 5327195 Omnicorp has denied me<br />and my son
5327287 5328905 access to Alex for weeks.
5329040 5332205 I demand to know why.
5332292 5334457 This treatment is inhuman,
5334586 5337581 and somebody needs<br />to be held accountable.
5339216 5340958 - CLARA: Thank you.<br />- Oh, we're fucked.
5341051 5342589 No, we only need 12 votes.
5342719 5343881 She shouldn't make<br />much difference.
5343970 5345086 Yeah, but what about<br />after the vote?
5345221 5346554 We... I mean,
5346640 5348098 those two should not<br />be allowed contact.
5348225 5350889 If-if she starts putting ideas<br />in his head...
5350977 5352139 Bring her in.
5352271 5353262 I'll handle the explanation.
5353397 5354478 And what about Alex?
5354606 5356098 You know, unfortunately,
5356192 5357650 we can't just keep him on ice.
5357735 5359397 LIZ: The shooting<br />at the station
5359486 5360944 spooked some of the politicians.
5361072 5363441 They're our clients;<br />we have to take care of them.
5363574 5365818 They're fine when a machine<br />is lowering the murder rate,
5365952 5369073 but when a man<br />is investigating city politics,
5369163 5370621 they get nervous.
5370748 5372786 All right, first off,<br />it's not a man, okay?
5372875 5374493 It's property of Omnicorp.
5374627 5377291 And politics are the<br />least of your concern.
5377379 5378997 I mean, this thing<br />solved its own murder.
5379132 5380294 How long till it realizes
5380425 5381632 you haven't been<br />on the level with it?
5381718 5383427 POPE: If that happens,<br />every journalist
5383511 5385095 in this country<br />is dying to speak to him.
5385180 5387514 I mean, we-we created a hero.
5388517 5391102 What happens<br />when he opens his mouth?
5393814 5396308 What's bigger than a hero?
5406744 5409660 A dead hero.
5413459 5415452 Get me Dr. Norton.
5424427 5425761 What is this, Raymond?
5425847 5428090 You have Mattox spying on me
5428182 5430472 and now this bullshit<br />about a "critical condition"?
5430602 5432595 You know and I know
5432687 5433974 Alex is fine!
5434105 5435313 Calm down.
5435440 5436476 What... Dennett.
5436608 5437770 Your work is so good, I don't...
5437859 5439146 Well, now,<br />this is not about my work!
5439235 5440318 You saw the woman on TV!
5440445 5443109 This has to stop!
5445492 5447404 You're right.
5447535 5449154 But let me<br />ask you something, Dennett.
5449288 5452123 What kind of life have we really<br />given Alex Murphy?
5452206 5453825 He's never gonna be<br />a normal man,
5453918 5455705 a father, a husband.
5455836 5457999 By the time we put<br />the other units on the street,
5458129 5460464 he's just... Dennett...
5460549 5461837 (sighs)
5461967 5464553 Let's face it.
5464679 5467469 We failed him.
5467556 5469220 We failed Alex Murphy.
5469309 5471176 But I want you to think<br />about the bigger picture
5471268 5473011 because that's<br />what we're talking about.
5473145 5475639 The work you've done with him<br />is gonna be studied for decades.
5475730 5477849 You've changed<br />the face of history, Dennett.
5477983 5481024 No policeman<br />is ever going to die
5481111 5482353 in the line of duty again
5482447 5484781 because of you.
5486283 5488277 Think about that.
5495836 5498330 I want that family
5498421 5501337 taken care of<br />beyond their wildest dreams.
5501424 5502541 We owe them that.
5502634 5504091 I agree.
5504219 5506429 I want full funding
5506555 5508046 for ten years.
5508139 5510179 New staff, all my own people.
5510267 5512054 Fantastic.
5512185 5513598 Deal.
5523114 5525073 Hey, what's going on?
5525199 5526235 Security's here.
5526367 5527574 They're clearing everyone out.
5527701 5529239 They're not waking him up.
5529328 5531412 Whatever you do,<br />don't leave him alone.
5531497 5533081 What do you mean<br />they're not waking him up?
5533165 5535955 SENATE LEADER:<br />The voting period has ended.
5536043 5538127 The clerks have<br />tabulated the results.
5538254 5541090 The yeas are 63.
5541216 5542924 The nays are 22.
5543050 5545795 A majority of senators<br />have voted in the affirmative.
5545928 5548548 The Dreyfus Act<br />has been repealed
5548723 5549930 by Congress.
5550016 5551976 (applause over TV)
5554354 5555937 (phone rings)
5556022 5558141 God, you guys are slow,<br />like a bunch of girls.
5558275 5559310 This is Mattox.
5559442 5561060 SELLARS:<br />Dennett's on board.
5561153 5563146 It's about time.
5567326 5569568 Call it.
5569661 5571119 Get it done.
5571204 5573197 My pleasure.
5575626 5577619 (doorbell rings)
5581632 5582873 Mrs. Murphy...
5582966 5584504 You can come here<br />as much as you want.
5584635 5585968 You can threaten me.
5586095 5587460 You can sue me.<br />You can take my home.
5587554 5589218 But I am not gonna stop<br />till I see my husband.
5589348 5590636 Do you understand that?
5590767 5594058 Mr. Sellars would<br />very much like to see you.
5595271 5596808 Is Alex okay?
5596897 5598811 He has important information<br />to share with you.
5598942 5601356 Will you accompany me?
5602528 5604863 David.
5604989 5605980 We gotta go.
5606115 5607197 Can you grab your coat?
5607325 5608361 (phone rings)
5608492 5609859 Hey.
5609994 5611361 NORTON: I'm in the elevator,<br />on my way down.
5611496 5613033 I need access to the lab.
5613164 5614247 That's insane;<br />they're still here.
5614374 5615786 NORTON:<br />Distract them.
5615875 5617493 Okay.
5619046 5620002 I cannot...!
5620129 5622169 There's a lady in here<br />going hysterical.
5622299 5624212 She will not let us in;<br />she's got the code for the door.
5624343 5625459 I repeat:<br />She will not let us in.
5625552 5626840 Lady, you need to let us<br />in there now.
5626929 5628341 We have to get in there.
5628430 5629968 Are you not understanding<br />what I'm saying?
5630057 5631844 Do you want to be responsible<br />for the deaths
5631934 5632891 of everyone in this building?
5633018 5634008 Hey! Stop!
5634143 5636137 (panting)
5638232 5639189 Don't shoot.
5639274 5641644 Step outside.
5647700 5649488 Unlock the transmitter!
5649577 5651786 KIM:<br />Transmitter unlocked.
5658336 5660706 Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.
5660839 5662501 WOMAN (over intercom):<br />Right away, sir.
5664550 5666168 NORTON (voice-over):<br />Wake him up!
5666261 5669587 Alex! Alex!
5669723 5670714 Alex, it's Dr. Norton.
5670807 5672846 You have to wake up!
5672934 5674552 Alex, can you hear me?
5675770 5677012 These men are here to kill us.
5677105 5678563 They're here to kill us,
5678650 5680436 for Christ sakes!
5684988 5686902 SELLARS (voice-over):<br />Mrs. Murphy, last night,
5686991 5688778 Alex had a psychotic break.
5688910 5690868 He killed an unarmed colleague
5690952 5693196 and later suffered a seizure.
5693289 5695874 We did everything--
5695957 5697746 everything-- we could,
5697835 5699121 but the doctors<br />couldn't save him.
5700337 5701922 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5702049 5704040 We're going to be making<br />the announcement shortly.
5704132 5706547 ROBOCOP (voice-over):<br />You shut me down.
5706636 5708253 I was about to get a confession.
5708387 5711759 Mattox shut you down.
5711849 5713056 I've removed your transmitter,
5713142 5714761 so he won't do it again.
5714895 5717935 Sellars can't afford<br />to wake you up.
5718022 5720517 He sent these guys<br />to pull the plug.
5720609 5722567 He wants you dead, Alex.
5722652 5724270 You understand?
5724404 5725817 SELLARS (voice-over):<br />Sorry. If there's anything
5725948 5728112 we can do for you and<br />David, we'll do it.
5728200 5730820 I want nothing from you.
5730953 5732490 I understand.
5732620 5735035 You stay out of our lives.
5736249 5737991 You and your company.
5738127 5739994 If that's what<br />you think is best.
5740128 5741837 There's one more thing.
5741964 5744174 I think it would be to<br />the benefit of everyone,
5744300 5745540 especially David,
5745633 5747968 if we kept<br />this matter private.
5748053 5751015 We don't want to damage<br />Alex's legacy.
5752225 5753968 NORTON (voice-over):<br />Alex.
5754102 5755183 Alex!
5755310 5756518 I can fix this!
5756645 5757761 You lied to me.
5757855 5759643 You lied to my wife.
5759732 5761476 You're working for the people<br />that are trying to kill me.
5761610 5762692 You want me to<br />trust you, Doctor?
5762819 5764937 Alex, I can go to the press!
5765029 5768320 Alex, I can tell them<br />the whole story!
5768407 5771198 Alex!
5771327 5774288 Listen to me, please!
5774373 5775614 Alex!
5775707 5777700 Alex...!
5786468 5788552 (engine roaring)
5788678 5790421 What the hell...?
5791348 5792886 (tires squealing)
5795561 5796801 (passing car honking horn)
5796895 5798353 (engine revving)
5798480 5799687 Keep all our systems<br />at green light,
5799815 5801398 and for Christ sakes,<br />get Sellars on the phone.
5801525 5802391 MAN:<br />Roger that.
5802526 5805397 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
5805530 5807863 Look at this city.
5810242 5812531 So beautiful.
5812619 5814989 It's become so peaceful.
5817958 5820577 I wish...
5820710 5823045 I had some good news<br />for Detroit.
5823131 5824588 I have very sad news.
5824715 5825831 Despite our best efforts
5825925 5828010 to save him,
5828094 5830554 Alex Murphy passed away<br />just hours ago.

6107882 6110876 The robotic part of him<br />is malfunctioning,

6318308 6319469 If I wanted to,
6319558 6321143 I could have killed you<br />a long time ago.

6324146 6325308 Don't!

6329152 6330860 and I could just kill them too.
6330945 6332563 And really, there's nothing<br />you could do about it,
6332697 6334565 because, let's face it...

6498118 6502035 from Omnicorp<br />parent company, OCP.
6502122 6505493 And although the government says<br />they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,
6505583 6508169 rumors continue to swirl<br />about his condition.
6508253 6511419 But we have obtained<br />exclusive video
6511547 6513039 taken by cell phone
6513175 6515418 that shows the people of Detroit
6515552 6517716 may have Alex Murphy<br />back on the streets
6517847 6520216 sooner than they think.
6520349 6523674 The real tragedy here is that
6523769 6528098 our president chose<br />to uphold the Dreyfus Act.
6528232 6531729 Now, I have no doubt<br />he was manipulated
6531861 6533899 by our biased media
6534029 6537196 and by whistle-blower<br />Dennett Norton.
6537283 6541407 I acknowledge we know<br />less than we thought.

6551298 6553131 The fact that<br />this mother (bleep)
