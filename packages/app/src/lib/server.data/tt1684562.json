        "3425000 3428000 And I feel like if I lean into reality",
        "3428000 3432000 Then maybe that's the way to go and most love stories don't end well",
        "3432000 3433000 Usually",
        "3433000 3435000 What do you mean?",

        "3544000 3545000 Okay, great.",
        "3545000 3546000 So, split screen.",
        "3546000 3551000 Right, do you think that it's like nostalgic super cool or do you think it's a gimmick?",
        "3551000 3554000 I think it could be super cool.",
        "3554000 3557000 Yeah, how do you want to use it?",
        "3557000 3559000 I mean, you know, tell me, tell me everything.",
        "3559000 3561000 Tell me, you know, about your vision.",
        "3561000 3567000 So, I like that they're on screen together, but they are in separate worlds, you know, visually and emotionally.",
        "3567000 3572000 So, you've got this very prominent divide between the lovers, and I want that.",
        "3572000 3576000 You want the divide?",
        "3576000 3579000 I want the divide, yes.",
        "3579000 3581000 Hmm.",
        "3581000 3586000 It's funny because I didn't get the impression that there was that much keeping them apart.",
        "3586000 3589000 Well, you haven't read the script.",
        "3589000 3596000 All I know so far is that the alien lady and the cowboy are having what seem to be pretty manageable problems.",
        "3596000 3599000 Jody? Jody? How's this?",
        "3599000 3603000 Valleterable problems. The aliens invaded Earth, and they left it in Tatum's.",
        "3603000 3606000 So, this whole thing, the studio pushing for the love congas all thing.",
        "3606000 3608000 I'm not buying it.",
        "3608000 3612000 Well, I have to admit that I'm surprised to hear you say that.",
        "3612000 3613000 Why?",
        "3613000 3620000 Well, I'm just a boy in a neon suit standing in front of a girl reminding her that Notting Hill is her favorite movie,",
        "3620000 3623000 and she watches Love Actually every year at Christmas.",
        "3623000 3627000 Well, you know, I watched it again this year, and I didn't love it, actually.",
        "3627000 3629000 Wow, that's worse than it's odd.",
        "3629000 3631000 I'm really, yeah, it's a really sad day for Notting Hill as well.",
        "3631000 3634000 They're happily ever after stuff. Unsubscribe me.",
        "3634000 3636000 I didn't get happily ever after from Notting Hill.",
        "3636000 3637000 What are you talking about? Of course you did.",
        "3637000 3638000 Did you?",
        "3638000 3642000 Yes, of course they're on the park bench. She's got her head in his knee. She's a regular girl.",
        "3642000 3645000 Maybe, but we don't know for sure. She's not going to go back to work in the street.",
        "3645000 3650000 All we know is that in the beginning, she's pretty much up for anything but kissing, and in the end,",
        "3650000 3653000 she's open to kissing him, and it gives us hope.",
        "3653000 3656000 You have got the Junior Robins movies so twisted.",
        "3656000 3657000 A little hope.",
        "3657000 3661000 That is Pretty Woman where she is a lady of the night, and this is Notting Hill where she's a very famous actress.",
        "3661000 3664000 Well, don't listen to me. What do I... Look, you're the director.",
        "3664000 3670000 You're going to make the right choice. I'm just saying, for people like me, who may not necessarily get the metaphor.",
        "3670000 3672000 You may not get the deeper metaphor, but you're going to see it.",
        "3672000 3677000 You're going to see this bright line between them that we're going to ache to see blur.",
        "3677000 3679000 You know, but maybe it can't.",
        "3679000 3681000 Maybe it doesn't.",
        "3681000 3685000 Right. Right. Yeah.",
        "3685000 3688000 But what do we know, right?",
        "3688000 3692000 Because all we know at this point is that the cowboy likes the alien.",
        "3692000 3694000 Does the alien like the cowboy?",
        "3694000 3695000 She's on the fence.",
        "3695000 3699000 Right. Because they got problems.",
        "3699000 3703000 Because she's an alien, and he's a cowboy, and that's a problem.",
        "3703000 3705000 But is it a problem they can't overcome?",
        "3705000 3709000 Here's a question. Are they even going to try?",
        "3709000 3711000 What do you think?",
        "3711000 3715000 Do you think they're going to try?",
        "3715000 3719000 I think...",
        "3719000 3723000 I think this was a great brainstorm.",
        "3725000 3727000 So...",
        "3727000 3730000 What did you decide about the split screen?",
        "3730000 3732000 I have a better idea.",
        "3732000 3734000 I think you need it.",
        "3734000 3740000 I think the connection between these characters is so strong that nothing can come between them.",
        "3740000 3743000 Joke.",
        "3743000 3769000 Jody?",
        "3769000 3770000 Hello?",
        "3770000 3774000 What's that guy on ice?",
        "3774000 3778000 What?",
        "3778000 3782000 There is a dead guy on ice at the hotel, girl.",
        "3782000 3784000 Wait. Sorry. What are you talking about?",
        "3784000 3787000 Well, if you think that doesn't make sense, don't order the fruit plate.",
        "3787000 3790000 You're seriously telling me, you've just seen a dead body.",
        "3790000 3793000 Yes, girl. On the rocks in the hotel.",
        "3793000 3795000 What hotel?",
        "3795000 3797000 The one I just saw you in, girl.",
        "3797000 3800000 Who is Kevin? It was in Kevin's room?",
        "3800000 3804000 Gayle? You asked me to do this, so please try and keep up.",
        "3804000 3806000 I know. I'm sticking.",
        "3806000 3808000 I went to Ryder's apartment like you told me.",
        "3808000 3814000 That's where Iggy with the sword and the silver cockatoo put me in the neon suit and they sent me to the man with the leopard print head.",
        "3814000 3817000 Now, he goes by the name of Doom.",
        "3817000 3820000 It was Dunes Goons who dirtyed my Shirley and gave me the Dundee.",
        "3820000 3821000 Dunes gols.",
        "3821000 3825000 And not in a fun way, Gayle. I think they were trying to kill me, Gayle.",
        "3825000 3830000 So, you can understand why I chased him with my scooter, but when the unicorn showed up, I had no choice.",
        "3830000 3832000 I had to hit their car with my body.",
        "3832000 3836000 The point is that that's how I got the Kevin's fruit plate and the dead guy on ice.",
        "3836000 3839000 Do you understand now? Does it make sense?",
        "3839000 3841000 It's absolutely clear as mud. Listen.",
        "3841000 3845000 Don't just step away, step away and calm down.",
        "3845000 3847000 I am going to handle everything.",
        "3847000 3849000 No more handling! I want the police!",
        "3849000 3850000 You're very aggressive.",
        "3850000 3852000 I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell. I want the police.",
        "3852000 3854000 You're not going to talk to the police.",
        "3854000 3856000 I'm sorry. I'm sorry to anyone about this.",
        "3856000 3858000 I'm crying. Please.",
        "3858000 3859000 Please, sir.",
        "3859000 3861000 Who's there? Who's there? Who's there?",
        "3861000 3863000 It's the police. I'm going to talk.",
        "3863000 3866000 No, no, no, no. Don't you...",
        "3866000 3869000 I'm not talking about any told.",
        "3873000 3874000 Sorry.",
        "3874000 3877000 Just making sure we're both here.",
        "3877000 3878000 I'm here, mate.",
        "3878000 3880000 I want to report a crime.",
        "3880000 3882000 Okay, an ice crime.",
        "3888000 3890000 Yeah, you're still getting a ticket, mate.",
        "3895000 3898000 I gotta tell Jody about the tech guy.",
        "3898000 3899000 How do you know what was dead?",
        "3899000 3902000 They've just been knocked out on ice.",
        "3902000 3905000 Yeah, ice baths are very good for inflammation.",
        "3905000 3907000 And are you forgetting that you were high?",
        "3907000 3910000 I... how can I keep fixating on that one point?",
        "3910000 3912000 You know what, let me just stop you right there.",
        "3912000 3914000 Whatever you told Jody last night,",
        "3914000 3915000 I just got her all fired up.",
        "3915000 3916000 Hey, that one.",
        "3916000 3920000 And now I have to build a truck for a 250 foot jump.",
        "3920000 3921000 In a day and a half.",
        "3921000 3922000 Sounds pretty cool, actually.",
        "3922000 3925000 And on top of that, the fight scene today,",
        "3925000 3927000 and Jody has decided that she wants to do it all in one take.",
        "3927000 3928000 A winner!",
        "3928000 3930000 Dad, did you tell me about the winner?",
        "3930000 3931000 Yeah, it's so cool.",
        "3931000 3932000 Right?",
        "3932000 3932000 Yeah.",
        "3932000 3933000 So good, he's into it.",
        "3933000 3934000 Hey, hey.",
        "3934000 3935000 Can I talk to you for so long?",
        "3935000 3937000 Okay, about the sequence today.",
        "3937000 3939000 Right, it's a show, again, it's pretty on the bench.",
        "3939000 3941000 Well, it's interesting you say that, because that's...",
        "3942000 3943000 That's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "3943000 3944000 Me too.",
        "3944000 3946000 Me too, because we don't even hear them.",
        "3946000 3946000 We don't need them.",
        "3946000 3949000 I had an epiphany last night, let me just tell you.",
        "3949000 3949000 That's nice.",
        "3949000 3950000 I'm so excited.",
        "3950000 3951000 Yeah.",
        "3951000 3953000 After we spoke, it all came to me.",
        "3953000 3953000 Really?",
        "3953000 3956000 Yeah, the third act, this sequence, all of it, I've been...",
        "3956000 3957000 After talking to you.",
        "3957000 3959000 Yeah, you know, I was shocked when you showed up, right?",
        "3959000 3962000 Yeah, well, it was shocking.",
        "3962000 3965000 But I just started to wonder if maybe you showed up just at the right time,",
        "3965000 3968000 and I've been going for this thing and the action,",
        "3968000 3972000 and I've never been able to get it like this feeling of the pursuit of love.",
        "3972000 3975000 And how far would you go for the one that you love?",
        "3975000 3980000 And, you know, and then, you know, I realized it's not very far with Ryder,",
        "3980000 3981000 because he's a drip.",
        "3981000 3982000 Right.",
        "3982000 3983000 And he runs weird.",
        "3983000 3983000 Right.",
        "3983000 3984000 And he can't do action.",
        "3984000 3986000 Well, you can.",
        "3987000 3987000 You can.",
        "3988000 3991000 Unlimited with you, I can do everything and everything with you,",
        "3991000 3992000 and it just made my brain just...",
        "3992000 3993000 Yeah.",
        "3994000 3995000 So cool.",
        "3995000 3997000 I don't need cuts, I don't need gimmicks, I don't need anything.",
        "3997000 4001000 I just need you to finish this movie,",
        "4001000 4003000 and maybe even make it a great movie, you know?",
        "4004000 4005000 Wow.",
        "4005000 4006000 What do you think?",
        "4006000 4008000 Do you want to work together?",
        "4008000 4010000 Shoot the shit out of Sydney, out for hours and four hours?",
        "4010000 4011000 Three hours and 52 minutes.",
        "4011000 4013000 Three hours and 52 minutes, huh?",
        "4014000 4015000 What are we waiting for?",
        "4015000 4016000 Okay, good.",
        "4016000 4017000 Good, okay.",
        "4017000 4019000 Venti, Venti, come on.",
        "4019000 4021000 I'm gonna get some dots on your face, because I need you, but not your face.",
        "4021000 4022000 Oh, God, yeah, just get rid of them.",
        "4022000 4024000 Yeah, I'm gonna stick right in his head on his...",
        "4024000 4026000 Okay, cool, okay, okay.",
        "4026000 4027000 Yeah, okay.",
        "4027000 4028000 Ready for a take?",
        "4028000 4029000 Make it rain, please.",
        "4038000 4042000 I'm trying to explain all the feelings that you're making me feel.",
        "4045000 4049000 You are not another tribe, you're a one-sterious will.",
        "4049000 4050000 Yeah, I'llmeier do it again.",
