        "3327000 3329000 Because you're such a wonderful person",
        "3329000 3331000 That you would say that, but trust me, it got heavy",
        "3331000 3333000 And we were, you know, we were so new",
        "3333000 3335000 So I figured that",
        "3335000 3338000 You know, spare you from all the stuff",
        "3338000 3342000 A lot of things you can't do",
        "3342000 3344000 Like what?",
        "3344000 3346000 Yeah, yeah, yeah",
        "3346000 3349000 It could have gone into bathroom stuff",
        "3349000 3351000 For instance",
        "3351000 3355000 I mean, I would have been really good at bathroom stuff",
        "3355000 3357000 What?",
        "3357000 3359000 Yeah, I think I would have been really helpful",
        "3359000 3361000 and gentle with you and sweet and discreet",
        "3361000 3363000 I would have closed my eyes",
        "3363000 3365000 Held my breath",
        "3365000 3367000 Gave you a sponge bath",
        "3367000 3368000 Excuse me",
        "3368000 3371000 It gave a great sponge bath",
        "3371000 3372000 Very thorough",
        "3372000 3374000 What?",
        "3374000 3376000 Mmmmmm",
        "3376000 3377000 Okay",
        "3377000 3379000 Okay, okay, so",
        "3379000 3381000 Thrilled about your new relationship with fruit",
        "3381000 3383000 And I hope you'll be very happy",
        "3383000 3385000 It's just a fling, it's not serious",
        "3385000 3387000 Trust me, I'm still",
        "3387000 3388000 I'm not by my ex",
        "3388000 3390000 Never, how she's supposed to do quality work",
        "3390000 3392000 Gave you keep harassing her all the time",
        "3392000 3393000 Errrrrrrrr",
        "3393000 3396000 Okay, can you go and grab your things?",
        "3396000 3397000 We have ready",
        "3397000 3398000 Okay, got a zip",
        "3398000 3399000 Yep",
        "3399000 3400000 What's going on?",
        "3400000 3403000 Seriously, cool, you look like you've been busy?",
        "3403000 3405000 Yeah, real busy, girl",
        "3405000 3407000 Yeah, good",
        "3407000 3408000 A lot of running around, you",
        "3408000 3411000 We'll get a drink and discuss that, but right now the studio",
        "3411000 3413000 So far up my house, I can taste them",
        "3413000 3414000 Maybe we need a third act",
        "3414000 3415000 Okay, yep",
        "3415000 3417000 You having problems with the third act?",
        "3417000 3419000 We're gonna go and do things right now",
        "3419000 3420000 I'm gonna go write it, I just",
        "3420000 3423000 It's like the studio are wanting me to contort the love story",
        "3423000 3425000 So that it all ends happily and everything's rosy",
        "3425000 3428000 And I feel like if I lean into reality",
        "3428000 3432000 Then maybe that's the way to go and most love stories don't end well",
        "3432000 3433000 Usually",
        "3433000 3435000 What do you mean?",
        "3435000 3437000 I strongly disagree with that, so",
        "3437000 3439000 We should keep chopping it up",
        "3439000 3441000 Yeah, should we?",
        "3441000 3443000 It's important, it's the ending",
        "3443000 3444000 Okay",
        "3444000 3445000 Okay",
        "3445000 3447000 Sir?",
        "3447000 3449000 Hi",
        "3449000 3450000 Yeah",
        "3450000 3453000 Hi, I hear that you're interested in a fruit platter",
        "3453000 3455000 Yes, I hear that",
        "3455000 3457000 I hear that you're interested in a fruit platter",
        "3457000 3459000 Yes, I hear that",
        "3459000 3461000 It's on",
        "3461000 3463000 Yeah",
        "3463000 3465000 Okay",
        "3465000 3467000 Sorry",
        "3467000 3469000 Yeah",
        "3469000 3471000 Okay",
        "3471000 3473000 Sorry",
        "3473000 3475000 Yeah",
        "3475000 3477000 Yeah",
        "3477000 3479000 Sorry",
        "3479000 3481000 Yeah",
        "3481000 3483000 Yeah",
        "3483000 3485000 Sorry",
        "3485000 3499000 No",
        "3499000 3507000 God",
        "3507000 3526000 colors that stove pan.",
        "3526000 3510000 Hello, what do a res",
        "3510000 3511000 Hello.",
        "3511000 3533000 What do you think about split screen?",
        "3533000 3534000 Jody?",
        "3534000 3535000 Yeah.",
        "3535000 3536000 Is this okay?",
        "3536000 3538000 I'm calling you set to call and...",
        "3538000 3539000 Yeah, that's fine.",
        "3539000 3541000 Yeah, we could chop it up.",
        "3541000 3542000 Let's chop it up.",
        "3542000 3544000 It's a good time not doing anything.",
        "3544000 3545000 Okay, great.",
        "3545000 3546000 So, split screen.",
        "3546000 3551000 Right, do you think that it's like nostalgic super cool or do you think it's a gimmick?",
        "3551000 3554000 I think it could be super cool.",
        "3554000 3557000 Yeah, how do you want to use it?",
        "3557000 3559000 I mean, you know, tell me, tell me everything.",
        "3559000 3561000 Tell me, you know, about your vision.",
        "3561000 3567000 So, I like that they're on screen together, but they are in separate worlds, you know, visually and emotionally.",
        "3567000 3572000 So, you've got this very prominent divide between the lovers, and I want that.",
        "3572000 3576000 You want the divide?",
        "3576000 3579000 I want the divide, yes.",
        "3579000 3581000 Hmm.",
        "3581000 3586000 It's funny because I didn't get the impression that there was that much keeping them apart.",
        "3586000 3589000 Well, you haven't read the script.",
        "3589000 3596000 All I know so far is that the alien lady and the cowboy are having what seem to be pretty manageable problems.",
        "3596000 3599000 Jody? Jody? How's this?",
        "3599000 3603000 Valleterable problems. The aliens invaded Earth, and they left it in Tatum's.",
        "3603000 3606000 So, this whole thing, the studio pushing for the love congas all thing.",
        "3606000 3608000 I'm not buying it.",
        "3608000 3612000 Well, I have to admit that I'm surprised to hear you say that.",
        "3612000 3613000 Why?",
        "3613000 3620000 Well, I'm just a boy in a neon suit standing in front of a girl reminding her that Notting Hill is her favorite movie,",
        "3620000 3623000 and she watches Love Actually every year at Christmas.",
        "3623000 3627000 Well, you know, I watched it again this year, and I didn't love it, actually.",
        "3627000 3629000 Wow, that's worse than it's odd.",
        "3629000 3631000 I'm really, yeah, it's a really sad day for Notting Hill as well.",
        "3631000 3634000 They're happily ever after stuff. Unsubscribe me.",
        "3634000 3636000 I didn't get happily ever after from Notting Hill.",
        "3636000 3637000 What are you talking about? Of course you did.",
        "3637000 3638000 Did you?",
        "3638000 3642000 Yes, of course they're on the park bench. She's got her head in his knee. She's a regular girl.",
        "3642000 3645000 Maybe, but we don't know for sure. She's not going to go back to work in the street.",
        "3645000 3650000 All we know is that in the beginning, she's pretty much up for anything but kissing, and in the end,",
        "3650000 3653000 she's open to kissing him, and it gives us hope.",
        "3653000 3656000 You have got the Junior Robins movies so twisted.",
        "3656000 3657000 A little hope.",
        "3657000 3661000 That is Pretty Woman where she is a lady of the night, and this is Notting Hill where she's a very famous actress.",
        "3661000 3664000 Well, don't listen to me. What do I... Look, you're the director.",
        "3664000 3670000 You're going to make the right choice. I'm just saying, for people like me, who may not necessarily get the metaphor.",
        "3670000 3672000 You may not get the deeper metaphor, but you're going to see it.",
        "3672000 3677000 You're going to see this bright line between them that we're going to ache to see blur.",
        "3677000 3679000 You know, but maybe it can't.",
        "3679000 3681000 Maybe it doesn't.",
        "3681000 3685000 Right. Right. Yeah.",
        "3685000 3688000 But what do we know, right?",
        "3688000 3692000 Because all we know at this point is that the cowboy likes the alien.",
        "3692000 3694000 Does the alien like the cowboy?",
        "3694000 3695000 She's on the fence.",
        "3695000 3699000 Right. Because they got problems.",
        "3699000 3703000 Because she's an alien, and he's a cowboy, and that's a problem.",
        "3703000 3705000 But is it a problem they can't overcome?",
        "3705000 3709000 Here's a question. Are they even going to try?",
        "3709000 3711000 What do you think?",
        "3711000 3715000 Do you think they're going to try?",
        "3715000 3719000 I think...",
        "3719000 3723000 I think this was a great brainstorm.",
        "3725000 3727000 So...",
        "3727000 3730000 What did you decide about the split screen?",
        "3730000 3732000 I have a better idea.",
        "3732000 3734000 I think you need it.",
        "3734000 3740000 I think the connection between these characters is so strong that nothing can come between them.",
        "3740000 3743000 Joke.",
        "3743000 3769000 Jody?",
        "3769000 3770000 Hello?",
        "3770000 3774000 What's that guy on ice?",
        "3774000 3778000 What?",
        "3778000 3782000 There is a dead guy on ice at the hotel, girl.",
        "3782000 3784000 Wait. Sorry. What are you talking about?",
        "3784000 3787000 Well, if you think that doesn't make sense, don't order the fruit plate.",
        "3787000 3790000 You're seriously telling me, you've just seen a dead body.",
        "3790000 3793000 Yes, girl. On the rocks in the hotel.",
        "3793000 3795000 What hotel?",
        "3795000 3797000 The one I just saw you in, girl.",
        "3797000 3800000 Who is Kevin? It was in Kevin's room?",
        "3800000 3804000 Gayle? You asked me to do this, so please try and keep up.",
        "3804000 3806000 I know. I'm sticking.",
        "3806000 3808000 I went to Ryder's apartment like you told me.",
        "3808000 3814000 That's where Iggy with the sword and the silver cockatoo put me in the neon suit and they sent me to the man with the leopard print head.",
        "3814000 3817000 Now, he goes by the name of Doom.",
        "3817000 3820000 It was Dunes Goons who dirtyed my Shirley and gave me the Dundee.",
        "3820000 3821000 Dunes gols.",
        "3821000 3825000 And not in a fun way, Gayle. I think they were trying to kill me, Gayle.",
        "3825000 3830000 So, you can understand why I chased him with my scooter, but when the unicorn showed up, I had no choice.",
        "3830000 3832000 I had to hit their car with my body.",
        "3832000 3836000 The point is that that's how I got the Kevin's fruit plate and the dead guy on ice.",
        "3836000 3839000 Do you understand now? Does it make sense?",
        "3839000 3841000 It's absolutely clear as mud. Listen.",
        "3841000 3845000 Don't just step away, step away and calm down.",
        "3845000 3847000 I am going to handle everything.",
        "3847000 3849000 No more handling! I want the police!",
        "3849000 3850000 You're very aggressive.",
        "3850000 3852000 I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell. I want the police.",
        "3852000 3854000 You're not going to talk to the police.",
        "3854000 3856000 I'm sorry. I'm sorry to anyone about this.",
        "3856000 3858000 I'm crying. Please.",
        "3858000 3859000 Please, sir.",
        "3859000 3861000 Who's there? Who's there? Who's there?",
        "3861000 3863000 It's the police. I'm going to talk.",
        "3863000 3866000 No, no, no, no. Don't you...",
        "3866000 3869000 I'm not talking about any told.",
        "3873000 3874000 Sorry.",
        "3874000 3877000 Just making sure we're both here.",
        "3877000 3878000 I'm here, mate.",
        "3878000 3880000 I want to report a crime.",
        "3880000 3882000 Okay, an ice crime.",
        "3888000 3890000 Yeah, you're still getting a ticket, mate.",
        "3895000 3898000 I gotta tell Jody about the tech guy.",
        "3898000 3899000 How do you know what was dead?",
        "3899000 3902000 They've just been knocked out on ice.",
        "3902000 3905000 Yeah, ice baths are very good for inflammation.",
        "3905000 3907000 And are you forgetting that you were high?",
        "3907000 3910000 I... how can I keep fixating on that one point?",
        "3910000 3912000 You know what, let me just stop you right there.",
        "3912000 3914000 Whatever you told Jody last night,",
        "3914000 3915000 I just got her all fired up.",
        "3915000 3916000 Hey, that one.",
        "3916000 3920000 And now I have to build a truck for a 250 foot jump.",
        "3920000 3921000 In a day and a half.",
        "3921000 3922000 Sounds pretty cool, actually.",
        "3922000 3925000 And on top of that, the fight scene today,",
        "3925000 3927000 and Jody has decided that she wants to do it all in one take.",
        "3927000 3928000 A winner!",
        "3928000 3930000 Dad, did you tell me about the winner?",
        "3930000 3931000 Yeah, it's so cool.",
        "3931000 3932000 Right?",
        "3932000 3932000 Yeah.",
        "3932000 3933000 So good, he's into it.",
        "3933000 3934000 Hey, hey.",
        "3934000 3935000 Can I talk to you for so long?",
        "3935000 3937000 Okay, about the sequence today.",
        "3937000 3939000 Right, it's a show, again, it's pretty on the bench.",
        "3939000 3941000 Well, it's interesting you say that, because that's...",
        "3942000 3943000 That's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "3943000 3944000 Me too.",
        "3944000 3946000 Me too, because we don't even hear them.",
        "3946000 3946000 We don't need them.",
        "3946000 3949000 I had an epiphany last night, let me just tell you.",
        "3949000 3949000 That's nice.",
        "3949000 3950000 I'm so excited.",
        "3950000 3951000 Yeah.",
