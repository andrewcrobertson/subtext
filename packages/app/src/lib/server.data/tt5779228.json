        "1291890 1295190 So what do you need from him to make this\nright?",
        "1295273 1299410 I simply want him to pay back the quart of\nmilk I lost that night. And we'll call it\neven.",
        "1299830 1301870 I can do that. What he can't do is raise a\nchild.",
        "1301990 1303690 Just one quart. Just one quart. Done.",
        "1303970 1305550 For every day I was in the pound.",

        "1317753 1323830 Odie. 1675 quarts of milk. Exactly right,\nOdie. We both came up with it at the exact\nsame time.",
        "1324510 1326590 Where am I gonna find that much milk?",
        "1326850 1331750 -Well, I suggest you go back to the place you double\n-crossed me. Lactose Farms.",
        "1332670 1339590 Wow. Well, good luck, Vic. I'll leave you\ntwo to work out the fire print. We'll just\nsee ourselves out. Odie?",
        "1340950 1343470 Uh, no. You're all going to do this.",
        "1343650 1346390 What? Why me? He's the one who abandoned\nyou.",
        "1346670 1348990 Yes, but this is more than a one-cat job.",
        "1349190 1352530 -Yeah, but I'm sure Vic has a whole crew of low\n-life cat burglars he could ask.",
        "1352613 1359490 Oh, I'm sure he does. But if I'm being\ncompletely honest, seeing how miserable\nyou make one another brings me endless\nsatisfaction.",
        "1359770 1363690 Oh, well, thank you for your honesty. And\nif I don't go?",
        "1364090 1366810 You can stay and have a playdate with\nRoland and Nolan.",
        "1367710 1370310 Okay, boys. Go play!",
        "1378230 1385230 Ma'am, I think this is an opportunity to\ntake a deep, cleansing breath and repeat\nyour anger management mantra.",
        "1391270 1392890 Anyone else have any objections?",

        "4045570 4047790 The eating you're about to see will not be\npretty.",
        "4047890 4051050 And if you have young children, this would\nbe a good time for them to leave the room.",
        "4064630 4071630 Oh, I know, I know. We're coming back.",
        "4094110 4096310 I just need to check something out first.",
        "4117260 4119300 He put a notch in the bark.",

        "4385100 4389100 Have you considered throwing a rope over a\nbranch and just swinging onto the passing\ntrain instead?",
        "4389260 4390180 You watch too much TV.",
        "4390380 4391600 I've never watched TV.",
        "4391760 4393540 Well, this weighs much better than your\nrope idea.",
        "4393700 4395380 Better than the versatile, reliable rope?",
        "4395520 4397400 Look, I've studied the science. I know\nwhat I'm doing.",
        "4397720 4400060 And you think you can battle these\nvillains on your own?",
        "4400143 4401960 Oh, yeah. I have a plan.",
        "4402680 4404260 Odie, make the order.",

        "5205180 5209200 but then I thought, well, what if they\nwanted to be outdoor pets? Do you want to\nbe free range?",
        "5210460 5215340 Oh, I really missed you guys and I gotta\nsay it's great to be together again, the\nwhole entire family.",
