<i>Three billion
human lives ended</i>

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,493
<i>on August 29, 1997.</i>

4
00:01:55,657 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire
called the war Judgment Day.</i>

5
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:03,710
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare:</i>

6
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,882
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

7
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,829
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet,</i>

8
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,005
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

9
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:34,835
<i>Their mission, to destroy the leader
of the human resistance,</i>

10
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,670
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

11
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,971
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984,</i>

12
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,726
<i>before John was born.</i>

13
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,432
<i>It failed.</i>

14
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,191
<i>The second was set to strike at John
himself when he was still a child.</i>

15
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:03,532
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior,</i>

16
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,909
<i>a protector for John.</i>

17
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,458
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

18
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,243
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

19
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,374

00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:52,926
Oh!

00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,762
Aagh! Get him off me!

00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,653
Agh!

Agh! Pull it out!

on electrical disturbance.

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,083
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

55
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,035
Ugh!

56
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,337
John!

57
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:14,047
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

58
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,642
John!

59
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,193
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

60
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,689
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

61
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,400
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

62
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,407
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

63
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:40,329
- Todd!
- What?

64
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,784
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

65
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,916
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

66
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,463
- Come on!
- John!

67
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,799
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

68
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,643
She's not my mother, Todd.

69
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,879
This next patient is interesting.

70
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,547
I've been following
the case for years.

71
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,750
A 29-year-old female,

72
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,718
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

73
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,969
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

74
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,723
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

75
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,519
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

76
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,571
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

77
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:00,989
which looked human, of course,

78
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,784
was sent back through time
to kill her.

79
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,110
That's original.

80
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,038
And also,
that the father of her child

81
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,081
was a soldier
sent back to protect her.

82
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,580
- No?
- He was from the future too.

83
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:18,586
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

84
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,667
And here we are.

85
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:22,548
Morning, Sarah.

86
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,851
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

87
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,638
Fine, Sarah.

88
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:41,024
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

89
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,196
Repeated escape attempts...

90
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,625
Let's move on, shall we?

91
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,667
Lewis.

92
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,468
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

93
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:02,757
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

94
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,387
Time to take you meds, Connor.

95
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:19,939
You take it.

96
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:23,310
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

97
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,311
I'm not taking it.

98
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,773
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

99
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,121
Yeah, zap her.

100
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:48,503
Last call, sugar.

101
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,140
Sweet dreams.

102
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,454
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

103
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,624
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

104
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,176
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

105
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:38,095
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

106
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:41,800
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

107
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,105
You gonna tell me what this is about?

108
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,182
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

109
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:54,646
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

110
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:58,107
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

111
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,033
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

112
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,157
Has that got something
to do with this?

113
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:08,417
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

114
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:12,336
Thanks for your cooperation.

115
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,082
Please insert
your stolen card now.

116
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,349
PIN number.

117
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:28,184
Hurry up.
This is taking too long.

118
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:29,762
Go, baby. Go, baby.

119
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,814
All right!

120
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:36,518
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

121
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:39,149
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

122
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:43,442
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

123
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,368
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

124
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,663
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

125
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,412
All right. Easy money. Come on!

126
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,037
Yes! Piece of cake.

127
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:05,424
- Is that her?
- Yes.

128
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:09,678
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

129
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,512
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

130
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,264
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

131
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,769
but she got shot and arrested.

132
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,442
No shit.

133
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:22,565
She's a total loser.

134
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:25,363
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

135
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:52,757
Sarah.

136
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,810
Sarah, wake up.

137
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,022
Kyle?

138
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,230
You're dead.

139
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,320
Where's our son, Sarah?

140
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,494
They took him away from me.

141
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:17,947
- He's the target now.
- I know!

142
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:20,032
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

143
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,537
I know.

144
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:24,499
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

145
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,914
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

146
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,257
I've lost him.

147
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,210
You're strong, Sarah.

148
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,762
- Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

149
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,556
On your feet, soldier!

150
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,185
I love you. I always will.

151
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,649
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

152
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:52,776
Remember the message?

153
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,949
"The future is not set."

154
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:00,787
"There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

155
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:22,384
Stay with me.

156
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:26,015
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

157
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:35,486
Kyle, don't go!

158
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:48,950
Kyle!

159
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,855
It's like a giant strobe light,

160
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:07,440
burning right to my eyes.

161
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,080
Somehow I can still see.

162
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:28,802
We know
the dream's the same every night.

163
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:32,343
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

164
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,762
Children look like burnt paper.

165
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:41,981
Black.

166
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:44,559
Not moving.

167
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:49,321
And then the blast wave hits them.

168
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,703
And they fly apart like leaves.

169
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:07,836
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

170
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:13,928
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

171
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:17,883
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

172
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,187
On August 29, 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

173
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,849
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

174
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,559
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

175
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,778
God! You think you're safe and alive.

176
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,152
You're already dead. Everybody!

177
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,779
Him. You. You're dead already.

178
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,737
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

179
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:43,915
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

180
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,036
Cos I know it happened!

181
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,708
It happened!

182
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:59,926
I feel much better now.

183
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:02,883
Clearer.

184
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:08,438
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

185
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,991
It's helped me to have a goal,

186
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:23,243
something to look forward to.

187
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:24,490
What is that?

188
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:30,835
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

189
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:33,583
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

190
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:36,882
and I could have visitors.

191
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,465
Well, it's been six months and...

192
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:45,507
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

193
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:48,217
I see.

194
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:56,484
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

195
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:59,937
Now you think they don't exist?

196
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:02,363
They don't exist.

197
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,156
I know that now.

198
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:06,155
But you've told me
on many occasions

199
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,704
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

200
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,076
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

201
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,580
They would have found something
at the factory.

202
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,787
I see.

203
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,842
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

204
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,471
No. Why would they?

205
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,633
Let's try a new position right there.

206
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:35,016
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

207
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,722
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centered.

208
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,599
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

209
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,900
Mr Dyson?

210
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,776
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

211
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,486
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

212
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,535
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

213
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,579
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

214
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,703
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

215
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,539
Mr Dyson,

216
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,777
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

217
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,960
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

218
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,714
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

219
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,216
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

220
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,592
"Don't ask."

221
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,397
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

222
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:23,686
Insert key.

223
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:26,861
Left on three, two, one, turn.

224
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,533
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

225
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:33,904
There you go.

226
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:04,186
So,
what do you think, Doctor?

227
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,014
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

228
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,439
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

229
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:13,980
I know how smart you are.

230
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,731
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

231
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:20,536
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

232
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,537
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

233
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,739
you'll just try to escape again.

234
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:32,422
You have to let me see my son.

235
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:34,875
Please.

236
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,673
Please.

237
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:42,841
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

238
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,800
If I could just make a phone call...

239
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,932
Afraid not. Not for a while.

240
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:52,149
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

241
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:54,647
that you stay here
for another six months.

242
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,731
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

243
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:05,570
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

244
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,031
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

245
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:12,460
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

246
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,706
You don't know what you're doing!

247
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,175
Model citizen.

248
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,135
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

249
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,929
He said he was going to the galleria?

250
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,176
Yeah.

251
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,006
The galleria?

252
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,428
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

253
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:17,111
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

254
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,821
No.

255
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,869
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

256
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,050
- John.
- Not now.

257
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:36,095
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

258
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,471
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

259
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:43,598
- Just go.
- Yeah.

260
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,850
I saw that kid...

261
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,184
Hey!

262
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:07,249
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

263
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:26,972
Hey!

264
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,145
Get down.

265
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,089
Mister, are you all right?

266
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:05,982
Come on!

267
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:47,567
Goddamn!

268
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:11,506
Agh!

269
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,075
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

270
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,206
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

271
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,641
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

272
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,890
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

273
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:53,940
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

274
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:08,745
Holy shit! You're really real.

275
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:12,624
I mean...

276
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:19,665
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

277
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:21,670
I'm a cybernetic organism:

278
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:24,423
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

279
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,355
This is intense.

280
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,278
Get a grip, John. OK.

281
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,942
You're not here to kill me.

282
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,075
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

283
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:55,873
My mission is to protect you.

284
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:58,576
Yeah? Who sent you?

285
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:00,869
You did.

286
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:02,421
35 years from now,

287
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:06,000
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

288
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,961
Oh, this is deep.

289
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:34,409
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

290
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,079
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

291
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:44,207
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

292
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,543
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

293
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,417
Where are we going?

294
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,376
We have to get out of the city
immediately

295
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:53,837
and avoid the authorities.

296
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:57,302
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

297
00:41:57,506 --> 00:42:01,477
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

298
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:04,351
- You sure?
- I would.

299
00:42:15,106 --> 00:42:17,700
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

300
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:21,371
...but I gotta warn them.

301
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,915
Shit! You got a quarter?

302
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:35,148
- Hello.
- <i>Janelle, it's me.</i>

303
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,134
- John?
- <i>Yeah. Is everything all right?</i>

304
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,498
- Are you guys OK?
- <i>Sure, honey, everything's OK.</i>

305
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:43,760
- Are you all right?
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

306
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:47,436
John, it's late.
Honey, I was beginning to worry about you.

307
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:50,186
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

308
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,811
I'm making beef stew.

309
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,000
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

310
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,688
John, where are you?

311
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,550
What the hell is the
goddamn dog barking at?

312
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,985
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

313
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:04,536
The dog's really barking.

314
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:07,097
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

315
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:13,495
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

316
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,705
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

317
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:20,066
I'm right here. I'm fine.

318
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,700
<i>John, are you sure you're all right?</i>

319
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,802
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

320
00:43:25,422 --> 00:43:27,641
Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

321
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:30,310
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

322
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:33,185
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

323
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:36,017
Where are you?

324
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,686
Your foster parents are dead.

325
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,681
No, no. I need a minute here.

326
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,065
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

327
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:25,613
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

328
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:27,611
Get real.

329
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:31,445
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

330
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:33,324
No, only an object of equal size.

331
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:35,951
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

332
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:39,877
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

333
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:42,249
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

334
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:44,047
But it can form solid metal shapes.

335
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:47,091
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

336
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,988
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

337
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:50,541
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

338
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:54,958
He killed
17 police officers that night.

339
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,708
Men with families...

340
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,676
...children.

341
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,516
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

342
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:12,809
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

343
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:19,273
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

344
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:21,353
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

345
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,815
We know this guy's involved.

346
00:47:25,024 --> 00:47:28,870
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

347
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:39,372
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

348
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,082
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

349
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,792
as time goes on.

350
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,673
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

351
00:47:45,877 --> 00:47:49,552
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

352
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:51,098
Sure.

353
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:54,051
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

354
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:55,351
Yes, sir.

355
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:59,060
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

356
00:47:59,264 --> 00:48:04,236
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

357
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:09,984
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

358
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:11,400
running guns.

359
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:14,453
Then there were some other guys.

360
00:48:14,654 --> 00:48:16,535
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

361
00:48:16,614 --> 00:48:19,834
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

362
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:23,625
Then she gets busted.

363
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:27,332
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

364
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:31,669
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

365
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:33,547
was all made-up bullshit.

366
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:36,178
I hated her for that.

367
00:48:39,511 --> 00:48:42,139
But everything she said was true.

368
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:45,391
She knew.

369
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:49,645
And nobody believed her.

370
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,323
Not even me.

371
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,111
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

372
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,664
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

373
00:49:00,864 --> 00:49:02,081
will be to copy Sarah Connor

374
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:03,923
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

375
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:05,960
Great. What happens to her?

376
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,913
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

377
00:49:09,122 --> 00:49:12,092
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

378
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:14,420
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

379
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:16,629
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

380
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:21,349
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

381
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,394
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

382
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,938
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

383
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:30,063
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

384
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,189
Let me go!

385
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:39,485
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

386
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,993
What?

387
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:50,794
You have to do what I say, huh?

388
00:49:50,995 --> 00:49:53,089
That's one of my mission parameters.

389
00:49:54,373 --> 00:49:57,876
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

390
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:01,429
Yes!

391
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:07,226
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

392
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,439
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

393
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,064
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

394
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:18,487
Dipshit?

395
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,524
Put your leg down.

396
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:27,433
- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

397
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:29,866
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

398
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:32,701
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

399
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:35,958
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

400
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:37,379
Get off of me!

401
00:50:43,586 --> 00:50:44,712
No!

402
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:48,261
Put the gun down, now!

403
00:50:48,466 --> 00:50:51,639
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

404
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:00,485
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

405
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:02,687
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

406
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,572
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

407
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:10,995
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

408
00:51:11,195 --> 00:51:13,289
You got that?

409
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:15,833
You just can't go around
killing people.

410
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:16,909
Why?

411
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,041
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

412
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:21,088
Why?

413
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,962
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

414
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,474
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

415
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:37,100
And I order you to help me.

416
00:52:43,282 --> 00:52:45,034
Hm!

417
00:54:02,816 --> 00:54:03,863
Hi!

418
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:08,117
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

419
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,573
They've been in there for an hour.

420
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,125
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

421
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:17,622
Oh, here come your friends now.

422
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,230
Well, that was productive.

423
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,684
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

424
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:25,435
How 'bout a beer?

425
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,066
Yeah, right!

426
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:54,596
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

427
00:55:54,797 --> 00:55:56,719
Must be my lucky day.

428
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:21,768
I think you're right
about number 24.

429
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:24,695
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

430
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:27,115
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,292
You!

432
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:49,424
You broke my arm.

433
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:52,222
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

434
00:58:52,422 --> 00:58:54,971
That's one. Now, don't move.

435
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,645
What are you gonna do?

436
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,317
Why do we stop now?

437
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:13,368
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

438
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:16,036
- Right.
- Swear?

439
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:17,613
What?

440
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:20,825
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

441
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:25,872
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

442
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:36,798
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

443
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:44,848
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

444
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:47,983
You crazy bastard!

445
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:54,523
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

446
00:59:58,318 --> 00:59:59,820
He'll live.

447
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,668
Son of a bitch!

448
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:19,467
Let's try to remain calm.

449
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:21,663
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

450
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:23,596
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

451
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,928
Open the door.
It ain't gonna happen.

452
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:27,978
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

453
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:29,806
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

454
01:00:30,014 --> 01:00:31,357
I don't believe you can do it.

455
01:00:31,557 --> 01:00:32,809
You're already dead, Silberman.

456
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:34,498
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

457
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:38,274
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

458
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:46,788
Back off!

459
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:48,285
Get back!

460
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,288
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

461
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,707
Don't move!

462
01:00:55,038 --> 01:00:58,008
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

463
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,881
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

464
01:01:01,086 --> 01:01:02,177
Not you!

465
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:03,880
Open the door.

466
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:09,135
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

467
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:27,861
Get her! Get her!

468
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:55,641
Sarah!

469
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:58,689
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

470
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,650
Let's go! Open it!

471
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,647
Get the other door!

472
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,113
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

473
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:13,825
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

474
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:40,516
No!

475
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:42,064
No!

476
01:02:44,141 --> 01:02:47,111
- No!
- Mom, wait!

477
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:48,608
Mom!

478
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:57,783
- Come back here!
- No! No!

479
01:02:58,404 --> 01:02:59,496
No!

480
01:02:59,697 --> 01:03:01,199
- Help her!
- Wait here.

481
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:02,909
Hurry UP!

482
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:05,085
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

483
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:06,378
Hold her.

484
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,627
He'll kill us all!

485
01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:33,521
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

486
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:40,532
Come with me, if you want to live.

487
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:42,955
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

488
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,887
Go.

489
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:43,754
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

490
01:04:58,684 --> 01:05:00,027
Get down.

491
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:18,336
No! Mom!

492
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,847
Out of the car!

493
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,436
Right now!

494
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:06,921
Go!

495
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:18,389
I'm out.

496
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,101
- Come on.
- Here.

497
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:31,735
Reload.

498
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:42,666
Last one!

499
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,416
Hang on.

500
01:07:17,774 --> 01:07:19,026
Ready!

501
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:25,956
John!

502
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,666
Here, drive.

503
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:30,343
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

504
01:08:30,551 --> 01:08:32,723
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

505
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:38,271
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

506
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:42,904
Cool.

507
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,197
Come here.

508
01:08:54,323 --> 01:08:55,950
I said I was OK.

509
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:59,879
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

510
01:09:00,996 --> 01:09:03,124
God dammit! You have to be
smarter than that.

511
01:09:03,332 --> 01:09:04,800
You almost got yourself killed.

512
01:09:06,168 --> 01:09:07,760
What were you thinking?

513
01:09:08,795 --> 01:09:11,298
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

514
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:12,849
Do you understand?

515
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:17,225
You're too important.
Do you understand?

516
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:21,224
But...

517
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:26,653
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

518
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:30,240
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

519
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,075
What's wrong with your eyes?

520
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,586
Nothing.

521
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:54,885
So, what's your story?

522
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:06,521
You OK?

523
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:08,147
Fine.

524
01:10:10,061 --> 01:10:13,156
Say, that's a nice bike.

525
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:37,297
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

526
01:10:45,136 --> 01:10:48,106
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

527
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:51,150
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

528
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:57,072
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

529
01:10:57,272 --> 01:10:58,319
Correct.

530
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,327
Does it hurt when you get shot?

531
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:11,211
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

532
01:11:13,746 --> 01:11:15,498
John, help me with the light.

533
01:11:15,748 --> 01:11:17,716
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

534
01:11:18,084 --> 01:11:21,384
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

535
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:25,091
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

536
01:11:25,758 --> 01:11:28,011
120 years with
my existing power cell.

537
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,980
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

538
01:11:31,347 --> 01:11:36,147
So you can be...
you know, more human?

539
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:38,570
Not such a dork all the time?

540
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:45,903
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

541
01:11:46,152 --> 01:11:49,156
that Skynet presets the switch to
READ only when we're sent out alone.

542
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,951
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

543
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:55,540
No.

544
01:11:57,329 --> 01:11:59,047
Can we reset the switch?

545
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:21,110
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

546
01:12:27,608 --> 01:12:28,450
Do it.

547
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:38,911
Now open the port cover.

548
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:44,378
Pull to break the seal.

549
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:51,881
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

550
01:12:55,593 --> 01:12:57,721
You can now access the CPU.

551
01:12:59,138 --> 01:13:00,606
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

552
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:03,350
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

553
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,106
Pull.

554
01:13:44,263 --> 01:13:45,355
Can you see the pin switch?

555
01:13:45,932 --> 01:13:47,184
No!

556
01:13:48,935 --> 01:13:50,858
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

557
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,653
"It", John, not "him".

558
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:57,822
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

559
01:13:58,652 --> 01:14:00,245
Listen to me. Listen.

560
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:02,781
We're better off on our own.

561
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:06,539
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

562
01:14:07,994 --> 01:14:09,086
Maybe.

563
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,292
I don't trust it.

564
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:15,460
But he's my friend, alright?

565
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,185
You don't know what it's like
to try kill one of these things.

566
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,250
And if something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance, so mo...

567
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,160
Look mom, if I'm ever supposed to
be this great military leader,

568
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:28,461
maybe you start listening to my
leadership ideas once in a while.

569
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,700
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

570
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:53,795
Alright, play it your way.

571
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,297
Was there a problem?

572
01:15:03,505 --> 01:15:04,882
No problem.

573
01:15:06,592 --> 01:15:07,808
None whatsoever.

574
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,960
Are we learning yet?

575
01:15:55,971 --> 01:15:58,941
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

576
01:16:02,852 --> 01:16:04,695
Just head south.

577
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:14,706
Keep it under 65.

578
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:17,534
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

579
01:16:18,368 --> 01:16:23,248
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

580
01:16:23,455 --> 01:16:26,880
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

581
01:16:27,084 --> 01:16:29,257
<i>You say, "No problemo."</i>

582
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:33,261
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

583
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:37,594
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."

584
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,221
<i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.

585
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,982
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

586
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,981
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

587
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:50,611
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

588
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:53,447
That's great. See? You're getting it.

589
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,573
<i>No problemo.</i>

590
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:09,132
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

591
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:10,674
I'll give you half.

592
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:12,794
Mom!

593
01:17:14,253 --> 01:17:15,550
Get some food.

594
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:20,013
No sense of humor.

595
01:17:26,015 --> 01:17:27,685
And that's another thing:

596
01:17:28,017 --> 01:17:29,717
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

597
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:34,614
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

598
01:17:34,856 --> 01:17:36,324
Smile once in a while.

599
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:37,909
Smile?

600
01:17:38,234 --> 01:17:40,612
Yeah. You know, smile.

601
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:41,992
Watch.

602
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:46,789
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

603
01:17:47,702 --> 01:17:49,169
Gimme a break.

604
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:53,173
Okay. Bad example.

605
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:57,011
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

606
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:18,318
That's good.

607
01:18:18,564 --> 01:18:21,693
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

608
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,850
Want some of my fries?

609
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,600
Do you need any help?

610
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,400
No.

611
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,200
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

612
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,000
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

613
01:18:54,932 --> 01:18:56,605
We're not gonna make it, are we?

614
01:18:59,269 --> 01:19:00,521
People, I mean.

615
01:19:03,523 --> 01:19:05,525
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

616
01:19:06,693 --> 01:19:09,321
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

617
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:12,408
Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

618
01:19:14,534 --> 01:19:18,880
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

619
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:22,549
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

620
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,584
Who is that?

621
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,922
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

622
01:19:31,216 --> 01:19:32,843
Why him?

623
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:35,304
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

624
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:36,764
of microprocessor.

625
01:19:37,513 --> 01:19:40,767
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

626
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:42,943
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

627
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:44,396
of military computer systems.

628
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:48,195
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

629
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:49,742
becoming fully unmanned.

630
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:53,071
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

631
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:55,656
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

632
01:19:55,864 --> 01:19:59,164
The system goes online
on August 4th, 1997.

633
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:02,291
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

634
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:05,214
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

635
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:09,591
It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am
Eastern time, August 29.

636
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,097
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

637
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:16,642
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

638
01:20:16,842 --> 01:20:19,345
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

639
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:22,602
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

640
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:25,059
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

641
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:27,065
will eliminate its enemies over here.

642
01:20:27,269 --> 01:20:28,771
Jesus!

643
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,511
How much do you know about Dyson?

644
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:37,825
I have detailed files.

645
01:20:39,405 --> 01:20:40,873
Want to know everything.

646
01:20:42,492 --> 01:20:45,871
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

647
01:20:57,756 --> 01:20:59,008
Miles!

648
01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:24,449
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

649
01:21:24,907 --> 01:21:26,658
This thing
is kicking my ass.

650
01:21:27,117 --> 01:21:30,872
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

651
01:21:32,789 --> 01:21:36,009
I can't. I'm on a roll.

652
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:53,101
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

653
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:54,818
I know. You told me.

654
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,813
It thinks and learns like we do.

655
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,695
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

656
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:04,911
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

657
01:22:07,196 --> 01:22:08,869
Why is that so important?

658
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:11,584
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

659
01:22:12,034 --> 01:22:14,162
I'm going crazy here.

660
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:17,628
Baby, I am this close.

661
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:19,712
Come here.

662
01:22:22,043 --> 01:22:25,889
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

663
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:29,305
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

664
01:22:31,803 --> 01:22:33,646
Meet the pilot.

665
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:38,397
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

666
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:42,317
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

667
01:22:42,646 --> 01:22:44,819
But it doesn't love you like we do.

668
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,662
I'm sorry. Really.

669
01:22:56,409 --> 01:23:00,004
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

670
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:04,759
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

671
01:23:34,987 --> 01:23:36,614
Wait in the car.

672
01:23:55,173 --> 01:23:57,050
Enrique!

673
01:23:57,259 --> 01:23:59,603
Are you here?

674
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:16,368
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

675
01:24:18,779 --> 01:24:24,582
And you... are always like a snake.

676
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:28,705
It's great
to see you, Connor!

677
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:29,994
I told you I would be back.

678
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:32,883
I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

679
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:33,926
Jolanda!

680
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:37,347
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

681
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,676
- Hey, big John. Como te va?
- What's up?

682
01:24:40,883 --> 01:24:42,601
Who's this big guy?

683
01:24:42,802 --> 01:24:47,773
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

684
01:24:47,973 --> 01:24:49,816
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

685
01:24:50,017 --> 01:24:52,440
Uncle Bob, huh?

686
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,523
OK. OK!

687
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:57,990
How are you?

688
01:24:58,191 --> 01:25:01,490
How are you?
You've grown so much.

689
01:25:01,694 --> 01:25:03,196
Drink?

690
01:25:07,491 --> 01:25:08,743
Uncle Bob?

691
01:25:09,827 --> 01:25:13,832
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

692
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,589
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

693
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,510
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

694
01:25:22,422 --> 01:25:23,548
I just came for my stuff.

695
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:26,226
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

696
01:25:26,426 --> 01:25:28,394
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

697
01:25:28,595 --> 01:25:31,098
Now, Enrique!

698
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,940
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

699
01:25:56,829 --> 01:25:59,252
One thing about my mom...

700
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:03,212
...she always plans ahead.

701
01:26:13,762 --> 01:26:14,729
Excellent.

702
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:29,491
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

703
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:32,537
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

704
01:26:32,738 --> 01:26:34,661
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

705
01:26:34,782 --> 01:26:37,786
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

706
01:26:38,077 --> 01:26:40,705
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

707
01:26:42,206 --> 01:26:45,585
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

708
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,925
See, I grew up in places like this,

709
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:56,933
so I thought
that's how people lived:

710
01:26:57,595 --> 01:27:00,849
riding around in helicopters,

711
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:03,485
learning how to blow shit up.

712
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:10,066
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

713
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:13,911
The other kids were into Nintendo.

714
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,214
Are you ever afraid?

715
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,757
No.

716
01:27:36,007 --> 01:27:37,224
Not even of dying?

717
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,393
No.

718
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:48,314
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

719
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,188
No.
I have to stay functional

720
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:53,486
until the mission is complete.

721
01:27:58,069 --> 01:28:00,037
Then it doesn't matter.

722
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:04,079
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

723
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,308
That's definitely you.

724
01:28:34,562 --> 01:28:36,689
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

725
01:28:36,897 --> 01:28:40,572
But there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

726
01:28:40,776 --> 01:28:43,950
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

727
01:28:44,905 --> 01:28:47,328
Mom screwed it up, of course.

728
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,581
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

729
01:28:49,785 --> 01:28:52,163
and me being this world leader.

730
01:28:52,955 --> 01:28:56,959
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

731
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:00,469
Here.

732
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:05,930
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

733
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:10,730
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

734
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:15,187
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

735
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,269
Man!

736
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:21,277
He hasn't even been born yet.

737
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,992
It messes with your head.

738
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,240
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

739
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:40,629
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

740
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:46,010
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

741
01:29:46,213 --> 01:29:47,635
She denies it totally, of course,

742
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,638
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

743
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:56,389
Why do you cry?

744
01:29:57,515 --> 01:29:59,313
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

745
01:29:59,517 --> 01:30:01,986
I don't know. We just cry.

746
01:30:02,937 --> 01:30:05,281
You know, when it hurts.

747
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:16,576
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

748
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:19,753
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

749
01:30:19,953 --> 01:30:21,375
- Get it?
- No.

750
01:30:22,748 --> 01:30:24,341
All right, my man!

751
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:27,760
- No problemo.
- Give me five.

752
01:30:30,296 --> 01:30:32,219
Just put out your hand, like this.

753
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:37,312
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

754
01:30:37,511 --> 01:30:39,559
All right!

755
01:30:42,475 --> 01:30:44,818
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

756
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:47,061
Five low.

757
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:48,772
Too slow.

758
01:30:51,941 --> 01:30:54,069
I'm just kidding. One more time.

759
01:30:54,277 --> 01:30:56,371
Good. Now try it. Good!

760
01:30:56,571 --> 01:30:58,323
Now do me. Give me five.

761
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,034
<i>Watching John
with the machine,</i>

762
01:31:02,242 --> 01:31:04,415
<i>it was suddenly so clear.</i>

763
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,590
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

764
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:11,465
<i>It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,</i>

765
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:15,094
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him</i>

766
01:31:15,297 --> 01:31:17,595
<i>or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

767
01:31:18,633 --> 01:31:23,355
<i>It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.</i>

768
01:31:25,098 --> 01:31:28,102
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,</i>

769
01:31:28,309 --> 01:31:32,655
<i>this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.</i>

770
01:31:33,648 --> 01:31:38,073
<i>In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.</i>

771
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,100
Come here, darling.

772
01:33:15,702 --> 01:33:17,921
Hey, let's try this one.

773
01:33:23,293 --> 01:33:24,839
There we go.

774
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:13,483
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

775
01:35:13,688 --> 01:35:16,692
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

776
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,652
Mom, wait!

777
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:35,842
"No fate."

778
01:35:37,169 --> 01:35:39,388
"No fate, but what we make."

779
01:35:41,548 --> 01:35:43,175
My father told her this.

780
01:35:46,178 --> 01:35:50,774
I mean, I made him memorize it
in the future as a message to her.

781
01:35:52,016 --> 01:35:57,193
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

782
01:35:57,396 --> 01:36:00,024
The future's not set.

783
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:03,657
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

784
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:08,366
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

785
01:36:09,824 --> 01:36:11,542
Oh, shit!

786
01:36:11,743 --> 01:36:13,541
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

787
01:36:13,745 --> 01:36:17,124
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

788
01:36:17,332 --> 01:36:19,209
She's gonna blow him away.

789
01:36:19,417 --> 01:36:21,294
Come on! Let's go!

790
01:36:21,503 --> 01:36:23,176
Let's go! Come on!

791
01:36:33,931 --> 01:36:36,935
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

792
01:36:37,142 --> 01:36:40,897
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

793
01:36:41,105 --> 01:36:45,610
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

794
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:48,195
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

795
01:36:48,403 --> 01:36:50,121
I don't care!

796
01:36:50,321 --> 01:36:52,119
Haven't you learned anything yet?

797
01:36:52,323 --> 01:36:54,496
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

798
01:36:57,370 --> 01:37:00,214
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

799
01:37:00,455 --> 01:37:03,504
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

800
01:37:03,709 --> 01:37:05,632
We hurt. We're afraid.

801
01:37:08,213 --> 01:37:12,468
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

802
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,760
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

803
01:37:52,964 --> 01:37:54,965
Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

804
01:38:12,315 --> 01:38:14,488
Danny, your time is up.

805
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,369
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

806
01:38:46,014 --> 01:38:47,231
Danny!

807
01:38:48,682 --> 01:38:50,309
Ugh!

808
01:38:58,984 --> 01:39:02,739
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

809
01:39:04,448 --> 01:39:05,495
Miles?

810
01:39:09,244 --> 01:39:10,666
Miles!

811
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:13,168
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

812
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,303
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

813
01:39:22,507 --> 01:39:23,633
Run!

814
01:39:23,842 --> 01:39:25,468
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

815
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:47,019
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

816
01:39:47,113 --> 01:39:50,617
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

817
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:54,500
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

818
01:39:54,704 --> 01:39:56,456
Get out of the way.

819
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,257
Don't hurt him!

820
01:39:59,959 --> 01:40:01,505
Get on the floor now!

821
01:40:03,795 --> 01:40:06,264
Just let the boy go.

822
01:40:06,464 --> 01:40:09,308
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

823
01:40:09,509 --> 01:40:11,978
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

824
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,307
- It's all your fault!
- What?

825
01:40:14,514 --> 01:40:16,516
I'm not gonna let you do it.

826
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:36,284
Shhh!

827
01:40:40,538 --> 01:40:41,755
Shhh.

828
01:41:08,607 --> 01:41:10,985
Shit! We're too late!

829
01:41:15,196 --> 01:41:16,197
Check them.

830
01:41:19,909 --> 01:41:23,413
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

831
01:41:24,372 --> 01:41:25,919
Look at me.

832
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:29,885
I almost...

833
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,008
I almost...

834
01:41:41,805 --> 01:41:45,855
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

835
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:49,153
I promise.

836
01:41:53,023 --> 01:41:58,200
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

837
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,080
I love you, John.

838
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,087
I always have.

839
01:42:08,538 --> 01:42:10,381
I know.

840
01:42:16,838 --> 01:42:18,886
Deep penetration.

841
01:42:20,633 --> 01:42:22,431
No shattered bone.

842
01:42:22,635 --> 01:42:25,433
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

843
01:42:36,356 --> 01:42:39,530
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

844
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:46,870
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

845
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,048
Oh, God! No!

846
01:43:15,518 --> 01:43:17,816
Oh, my God!

847
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:28,573
Oh, my God.

848
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:31,250
Now, listen to me very carefully.

849
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:36,960
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

850
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,000
<i>Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

851
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,900
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

852
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,800
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

853
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,100
<i>It's not every day that you find out</i>

854
01:43:51,219 --> 01:43:54,119
<i>you're responsible
for three billion deaths.</i>

855
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:57,300
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

856
01:43:58,809 --> 01:44:01,403
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

857
01:44:07,901 --> 01:44:12,497
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

858
01:44:16,242 --> 01:44:18,870
How were we supposed to know?

859
01:44:20,955 --> 01:44:22,582
Yeah!

860
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:24,292
Right.

861
01:44:25,209 --> 01:44:28,304
How were you supposed to know?

862
01:44:28,504 --> 01:44:32,098
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

863
01:44:32,298 --> 01:44:36,519
Men like you thought it up.

864
01:44:40,306 --> 01:44:43,355
You think you're so creative.

865
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,609
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

866
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:50,407
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

867
01:44:50,607 --> 01:44:52,860
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

868
01:44:53,068 --> 01:44:54,445
Mom!

869
01:44:55,404 --> 01:44:59,034
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

870
01:44:59,241 --> 01:45:01,282
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

871
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,128
But I thought...

872
01:45:04,329 --> 01:45:08,174
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

873
01:45:08,374 --> 01:45:11,924
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

874
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:14,802
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

875
01:45:15,006 --> 01:45:18,601
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

876
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:21,805
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

877
01:45:22,889 --> 01:45:26,734
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

878
01:45:26,933 --> 01:45:31,359
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

879
01:45:32,189 --> 01:45:35,033
Everything. I don't care.

880
01:45:37,027 --> 01:45:37,823
The chip.

881
01:45:38,445 --> 01:45:40,086
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

882
01:45:40,197 --> 01:45:41,699
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

883
01:45:41,906 --> 01:45:43,355
It must be from
the other one like you.

884
01:45:43,365 --> 01:45:47,745
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

885
01:45:47,953 --> 01:45:50,547
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

886
01:45:50,748 --> 01:45:52,967
Those lying motherfuckers.

887
01:45:53,167 --> 01:45:54,840
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

888
01:45:55,044 --> 01:45:57,172
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

889
01:45:57,379 --> 01:45:58,756
but it gave us ideas,

890
01:45:58,964 --> 01:46:01,842
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

891
01:46:04,093 --> 01:46:06,095
All my work was based on it.

892
01:46:06,304 --> 01:46:07,977
It must be destroyed.

893
01:46:10,308 --> 01:46:13,278
Can you get us in? Past security?

894
01:46:13,478 --> 01:46:16,402
I think so, yeah. When?

895
01:46:20,442 --> 01:46:21,409
Now?

896
01:46:25,656 --> 01:46:28,330
'The future,
always so clear to me,

897
01:46:28,534 --> 01:46:31,458
'had become
like a black highway at night.

898
01:46:31,662 --> 01:46:37,213
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

899
01:47:12,658 --> 01:47:17,164
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

900
01:47:18,914 --> 01:47:20,757
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

901
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:22,008
Hi!

902
01:47:22,418 --> 01:47:24,295
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

903
01:47:24,503 --> 01:47:27,677
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

904
01:47:27,881 --> 01:47:29,882
I need written authorization...

905
01:47:31,092 --> 01:47:34,813
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

906
01:47:45,773 --> 01:47:47,320
Come on. It's OK.

907
01:47:48,734 --> 01:47:50,175
It takes two keys to open the vault.

908
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:51,912
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

909
01:47:52,112 --> 01:47:54,786
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

910
01:47:56,408 --> 01:47:57,660
Gibbons?

911
01:48:00,912 --> 01:48:05,588
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

912
01:48:07,877 --> 01:48:09,129
Gibbons!

913
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,927
Oh, shit.

914
01:48:29,898 --> 01:48:31,946
My card should access this.

915
01:48:35,654 --> 01:48:37,782
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

916
01:48:39,032 --> 01:48:40,830
The silent alarm's been tripped.

917
01:48:46,955 --> 01:48:49,754
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

918
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:53,553
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

919
01:48:54,797 --> 01:48:56,219
No.

920
01:48:57,925 --> 01:49:01,098
We go all the way. OK?

921
01:49:03,388 --> 01:49:07,063
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

922
01:49:07,266 --> 01:49:08,707
I think it's that guy from the mall.

923
01:49:08,893 --> 01:49:09,815
It is!

924
01:49:10,019 --> 01:49:12,192
It's him and the woman.

925
01:49:13,523 --> 01:49:16,367
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

926
01:49:18,944 --> 01:49:22,198
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

927
01:49:26,868 --> 01:49:29,041
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

928
01:49:34,292 --> 01:49:36,259
John, fire in the hole!

929
01:49:48,431 --> 01:49:53,107
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

930
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,744
You have to wait a few
minutes until the gas clears.

931
01:50:05,363 --> 01:50:06,489
Put this on.

932
01:50:20,753 --> 01:50:23,006
All right, let's get to work.

933
01:50:44,942 --> 01:50:47,865
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

934
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:52,575
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

935
01:50:52,908 --> 01:50:54,831
Suspect 1 is white, female,

936
01:50:55,035 --> 01:50:58,039
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

937
01:50:58,246 --> 01:51:00,874
escaped last night from
Pescadero State Hospital.

938
01:51:01,374 --> 01:51:02,671
Suspect 2: white, male...

939
01:51:06,962 --> 01:51:11,012
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

940
01:51:11,258 --> 01:51:13,226
Everything behind my desk.

941
01:51:13,369 --> 01:51:15,369
All the processors on my left.

942
01:51:15,621 --> 01:51:17,874
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

943
01:51:31,778 --> 01:51:33,155
Could I...

944
01:51:33,655 --> 01:51:35,202
Excuse me...

945
01:51:37,408 --> 01:51:39,536
Could I borrow that thing?

946
01:51:48,877 --> 01:51:51,300
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

947
01:51:55,342 --> 01:51:59,596
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

948
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:03,476
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

949
01:52:54,689 --> 01:52:56,362
All right!

950
01:52:56,566 --> 01:52:58,193
7-2-5-6.

951
01:52:59,777 --> 01:53:00,699
Yes!

952
01:53:05,491 --> 01:53:06,788
Easy money.

953
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:12,923
Uh-oh.

954
01:53:15,626 --> 01:53:17,924
Oh, shit! Not good.

955
01:53:18,128 --> 01:53:19,300
Not good!

956
01:53:23,133 --> 01:53:26,387
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

957
01:53:26,595 --> 01:53:28,848
One more barrel, two more minutes.

958
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:35,737
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

959
01:53:35,937 --> 01:53:38,190
Piece of cake.

960
01:53:38,397 --> 01:53:39,819
- We got company.
- Police?

961
01:53:40,024 --> 01:53:43,244
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

962
01:53:43,444 --> 01:53:45,367
Go. I'll finish here.

963
01:53:46,822 --> 01:53:48,118
Come on.

964
01:53:49,324 --> 01:53:52,498
- I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

965
01:53:55,622 --> 01:53:56,874
Trust me.

966
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:12,179
<i>You at the window!</i>

967
01:54:12,388 --> 01:54:15,358
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

968
01:54:16,809 --> 01:54:20,109
- Holy shit!
- That's a damn mini-gun!

969
01:54:42,582 --> 01:54:44,755
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

970
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,337
Go! Go! Go!

971
01:55:34,049 --> 01:55:35,425
Fire!

972
01:55:52,733 --> 01:55:54,484
We go same time, to the left.

973
01:55:54,692 --> 01:55:57,286
One, two, three, go.

974
01:56:09,207 --> 01:56:11,755
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

975
01:56:19,466 --> 01:56:23,096
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

976
01:56:24,471 --> 01:56:25,814
Hold your fire!

977
01:56:51,454 --> 01:56:53,707
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

978
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:59,838
Time to go. Now.

979
01:57:00,046 --> 01:57:02,845
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

980
01:57:03,049 --> 01:57:06,018
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

981
01:57:30,616 --> 01:57:33,039
Mom! Mom!

982
01:58:10,988 --> 01:58:12,615
Aagh!

983
01:58:17,702 --> 01:58:18,498
Shit!

984
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:22,958
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

985
01:58:33,134 --> 01:58:34,010
Get down!

986
01:58:41,266 --> 01:58:42,518
Here.

987
01:59:08,251 --> 01:59:11,050
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

988
01:59:15,882 --> 01:59:18,601
Fall back! Everybody out!

989
01:59:18,802 --> 01:59:20,554
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

990
01:59:56,713 --> 01:59:57,930
<i>We got a war zone
down here!</i>

991
02:00:30,369 --> 02:00:31,871
Shut your eyes.

992
02:00:38,336 --> 02:00:41,339
Stay here. I'll be back.

993
02:00:49,554 --> 02:00:51,477
Get down on the floor, face down!

994
02:00:54,726 --> 02:00:55,773
Down on the floor now!

995
02:00:58,271 --> 02:00:59,613
OK, drop him!

996
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:39,317
Agh!

997
02:02:19,639 --> 02:02:21,391
Here, hold this.

998
02:02:33,694 --> 02:02:35,492
I think it's him!

999
02:02:37,865 --> 02:02:39,333
Holy shit!

1000
02:02:54,964 --> 02:02:55,840
Go!

1001
02:03:34,919 --> 02:03:36,011
Shit!

1002
02:03:49,098 --> 02:03:50,475
Get out.

1003
02:03:52,936 --> 02:03:54,438
Aagh!

1004
02:04:09,826 --> 02:04:13,626
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

1005
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:15,252
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1006
02:04:15,457 --> 02:04:16,958
All right.

1007
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:33,478
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

1008
02:05:31,403 --> 02:05:32,620
Yeah!

1009
02:05:34,990 --> 02:05:36,663
John! Stay down!

1010
02:06:02,308 --> 02:06:03,776
- Aagh!
- Mom!

1011
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:45,807
Hello?

1012
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:53,990
Goddamn! You all right...?

1013
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:03,498
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1014
02:07:05,992 --> 02:07:07,744
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1015
02:07:09,871 --> 02:07:10,667
Agh!

1016
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:13,007
Are you hurt?

1017
02:07:25,845 --> 02:07:29,645
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

1018
02:07:30,349 --> 02:07:31,191
Hurry!

1019
02:07:36,354 --> 02:07:39,198
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1020
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:42,945
Come on! Go!

1021
02:07:49,075 --> 02:07:50,952
What the hell...?

1022
02:07:57,416 --> 02:07:59,589
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1023
02:08:01,587 --> 02:08:02,884
Here. This'll work.

1024
02:08:09,178 --> 02:08:10,929
He's gaining.

1025
02:08:12,889 --> 02:08:15,688
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1026
02:08:15,892 --> 02:08:17,940
I can run faster than this!

1027
02:08:28,279 --> 02:08:29,575
Coming up, to the right.

1028
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,583
Watch it! Watch it!

1029
02:08:56,514 --> 02:08:58,435
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1030
02:09:06,147 --> 02:09:07,694
Take the off-ramp.

1031
02:09:17,742 --> 02:09:18,538
Shit!

1032
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:23,455
Hold on!

1033
02:10:09,457 --> 02:10:10,253
Don't stop!

1034
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,180
Go straight!

1035
02:10:22,261 --> 02:10:23,729
- Look out!
- Duck!

1036
02:10:38,985 --> 02:10:40,487
Get the hell outta here!

1037
02:10:46,451 --> 02:10:49,125
Get outta here! Let's go!

1038
02:12:06,317 --> 02:12:08,490
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

1039
02:12:58,575 --> 02:12:59,542
We don't have much time.

1040
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:23,435
Let's go.

1041
02:13:24,725 --> 02:13:26,272
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

1042
02:13:26,477 --> 02:13:28,445
Come on! Get up!

1043
02:13:42,325 --> 02:13:43,747
Hand me the shotgun.

1044
02:13:48,706 --> 02:13:50,834
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1045
02:13:51,918 --> 02:13:53,544
Hurry!

1046
02:13:57,255 --> 02:13:58,757
Come on, Mom.

1047
02:14:05,347 --> 02:14:07,566
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

1048
02:14:37,877 --> 02:14:39,504
This way. Come on!

1049
02:15:09,115 --> 02:15:11,664
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1050
02:15:11,868 --> 02:15:12,994
Go back.

1051
02:15:21,335 --> 02:15:23,462
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1052
02:15:24,087 --> 02:15:25,555
John, you've got to go now.

1053
02:15:25,755 --> 02:15:27,757
- John!
- Go! Now!

1054
02:15:27,966 --> 02:15:29,309
No!

1055
02:16:42,578 --> 02:16:44,205
Get up the steps.

1056
02:16:46,207 --> 02:16:47,379
Go on.

1057
02:16:53,838 --> 02:16:55,840
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

1058
02:17:21,448 --> 02:17:22,244
No!

1059
02:17:30,498 --> 02:17:32,717
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1060
02:17:34,085 --> 02:17:36,713
Grab it. Go. Go!

1061
02:17:47,347 --> 02:17:50,351
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

1062
02:17:50,559 --> 02:17:52,027
Come on!

1063
02:17:52,936 --> 02:17:54,529
Mom!

1064
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:56,903
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1065
02:18:32,974 --> 02:18:34,396
Agh!

1066
02:18:40,023 --> 02:18:40,944
Call to John.

1067
02:18:42,941 --> 02:18:44,067
No!

1068
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:45,827
I know this hurts.

1069
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,289
- Ugh!
- Call John.

1070
02:19:06,714 --> 02:19:08,637
Call to John now.

1071
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:12,057
Fuck you!

1072
02:22:23,858 --> 02:22:27,408
John? John!

1073
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,999
John? Help!

1074
02:22:33,743 --> 02:22:35,119
John!

1075
02:22:38,914 --> 02:22:40,587
John?

1076
02:22:42,918 --> 02:22:44,261
John!

1077
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:47,597
John.

1078
02:22:48,549 --> 02:22:50,051
John.

1079
02:22:52,635 --> 02:22:54,262
- Mom.
- Help me.

1080
02:22:55,555 --> 02:22:57,307
Help me.

1081
02:22:58,850 --> 02:22:59,851
Help me.

1082
02:23:00,059 --> 02:23:01,185
Out of the way, John!

1083
02:23:04,772 --> 02:23:05,648
<i>Shoo“</i>

1084
02:23:49,397 --> 02:23:50,819
Mom!

1085
02:24:00,575 --> 02:24:02,043
Get down!

1086
02:24:33,773 --> 02:24:35,241
No!

1087
02:25:36,415 --> 02:25:38,634
Get up. Come on.

1088
02:25:40,836 --> 02:25:42,383
Holy shit!

1089
02:25:42,588 --> 02:25:44,261
I need a vacation.

1090
02:25:58,770 --> 02:26:02,445
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

1091
02:26:05,985 --> 02:26:07,578
Will this melt in there?

1092
02:26:10,822 --> 02:26:12,415
Yes. Throw it in.

1093
02:26:17,287 --> 02:26:18,129
<i>Adios!</i>

1094
02:26:20,165 --> 02:26:22,338
And the chip.

1095
02:26:36,806 --> 02:26:38,228
It's over.

1096
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:41,815
No.

1097
02:26:45,356 --> 02:26:46,732
There's one more chip.

1098
02:26:51,736 --> 02:26:53,704
And it must be destroyed also.

1099
02:26:59,369 --> 02:27:00,746
Here.

1100
02:27:00,954 --> 02:27:04,958
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1101
02:27:10,587 --> 02:27:12,134
No.

1102
02:27:13,423 --> 02:27:14,219
No.

1103
02:27:17,594 --> 02:27:19,972
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1104
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:22,181
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

1105
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:24,267
- It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

1106
02:27:24,475 --> 02:27:26,944
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

1107
02:27:27,144 --> 02:27:29,897
- I must go away, John.
- No!

1108
02:27:30,565 --> 02:27:31,657
No, wait.

1109
02:27:31,858 --> 02:27:34,611
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1110
02:27:35,778 --> 02:27:37,826
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1111
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:39,827
It has to end here.

1112
02:27:41,157 --> 02:27:44,331
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

1113
02:27:44,536 --> 02:27:46,038
I order you not to go!

1114
02:27:52,586 --> 02:27:54,338
I know now why you cry.

1115
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:59,012
But it's something I can never do.

1116
02:28:34,124 --> 02:28:35,717
Good bye.

1117
02:30:15,178 --> 02:30:19,399
<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>

1118
02:30:19,725 --> 02:30:21,352
<i>Nothing much happened.</i>

1119
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:23,812
<i>Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>

1120
02:30:24,228 --> 02:30:25,821
<i>There was no Judgment Day.</i>

1121
02:30:26,814 --> 02:30:29,408
<i>People went to work
as they always do.</i>

1122
02:30:29,775 --> 02:30:31,402
<i>Laughed, complained,</i>

1123
02:30:31,610 --> 02:30:34,614
<i>watched TV, made love.</i>

1124
02:30:35,406 --> 02:30:37,659
<i>I wanted to run
through the street yelling</i>

1125
02:30:37,867 --> 02:30:39,460
<i>to grab them all and say,</i>

1126
02:30:39,701 --> 02:30:43,080
<i>"Every day
from this day on is a gift.</i>

1127
02:30:43,371 --> 02:30:44,714
<i>Use it well."</i>

1128
02:30:45,331 --> 02:30:47,709
<i>Instead, I got drunk.</i>

1129
02:30:48,043 --> 02:30:50,421
<i>That was 30 years ago.</i>

1130
02:30:50,962 --> 02:30:55,183
But the dark future which never came
still exists for me.

1131
02:30:55,675 --> 02:30:59,053
And it always will,
like the traces of a dream.

1132
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:05,105
John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.

1133
02:31:05,601 --> 02:31:07,979
Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate

1134
02:31:08,353 --> 02:31:10,526
his weapons are common sense

1135
02:31:11,482 --> 02:31:12,574
and hope.

1136
02:31:15,402 --> 02:31:17,244
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

1137
02:31:24,786 --> 02:31:25,628
How's that?

1138
02:31:25,828 --> 02:31:26,704
Thank you, Grandma.

1139
02:31:30,917 --> 02:31:32,510
<i>The luxury of hope</i>

1140
02:31:33,086 --> 02:31:35,588

1141

<i>Because if a machine can learn

1142
02:31:42,594 --> 02:31:44,437
