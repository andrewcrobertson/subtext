00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,560
LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.

2
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,000
THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE
ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.

3
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,680
THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND
HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,160
BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT
BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

5
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,
IN OUR PRESENT.

6
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,920
TONIGHT...

7
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,840
LOS ANGELES 1984
1:52a.m.

8
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,560
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

9
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
What the hell...?

10
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,400
Hey, my turn.

11
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,880
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

12
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Nice night for a walk?

13
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,320
Nice night for a walk.

14
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,280
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

15
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Nothing clean. Right.

16
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,240
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

17
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
Your clothes, give them to me.

18
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

19
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,760
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

20
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

21
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,360
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it! Go.

22
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

23
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,440
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

24
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,400
- Thursday.
- What year?

25
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,040
He's got my gun. Let's go.

26
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

27
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,760
Hi. I'm late.

28
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,720
So am I.

29
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,760
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

30
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,880
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,640
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

32
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
That's mine, but I didn't order fries.

33
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,080
- Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly-beef?

34
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,960
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

35
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm so sorry.

36
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,280
This isn't real leather, is it?

37
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,400
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

38
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,040
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

39
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,440
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

40
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,240
That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto.

41
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,680
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

42
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,120
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

43
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,320
The beam comes on - you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

44
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
You can't miss.

45
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

46
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,400
Hey, just what you see, pal.

47
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,040
The Uzi nine millimetre.

48
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,520
You know your weapons, buddy.

49
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,800
Any one of these is ideal
for home defence.

50
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,720
So which will it be?

51
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,280
- All.
- I may close early today.

52
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,520
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

53
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

54
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,040
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

55
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,200
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

56
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,480
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

57
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

58
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,400
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

59
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

60
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,680
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

61
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,080
Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
You're going to love this.

62
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
- What?
- ..compiled from several witnesses.

63
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,200
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother oftwo,

64
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,640
brutally shot to death this afternoon.

65
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
You're dead, honey.

66
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,920
..if you're into sound,

67
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,200
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

68
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,280
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

69
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,640
We've got graphic equalisers
and sound balancers that...

70
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,760
Sorry.

71
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Hello?

72
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,000
First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,

73
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,280
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

74
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,560
And then slowly... slowly pull
yourjeans offinch by inch.

75
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,760
Ginger, it's Matt.

76
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,840
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

77
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

78
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Who is this?

79
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,800
God. Sarah?

80
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,760
Jesus. I'm sorry.

81
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,400
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?

82
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Sure.

83
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,400
It's the creep.

84
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
Hello?

85
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

86
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,760
You fucking pigs. Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me.

87
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,560
Ed.

88
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

89
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,480
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

90
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.

91
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,240
You know, these work.

92
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,040
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

93
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,320
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

94
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,120
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

95
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Look at the name, Ed.

96
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,200
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

97
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,080
You're kidding.

98
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,720
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

99
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,040
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

100
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,200
So...

101
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,920
Better than mortal man deserves.

102
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,920
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

103
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,320
I thought you did.

104
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,240
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

105
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,520
You mind your mother.

106
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,480
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

107
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out ofit.

108
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,840
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.

109
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

110
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,080
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

111
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,160
I'll live.

112
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,440
I'll break his kneecaps.

113
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,760
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

114
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,280
God. It's disgusting.

115
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

116
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,880
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

117
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Damn it, Matt.

118
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,240
Shit.

119
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,320
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

120
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,640
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

121
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,680
That coffee's two hours cold.

122
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,040
I put a cigarette out in it.

123
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,520
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

124
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,080
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

125
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,440
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

126
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,320
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

127
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,400
Give me a cigarette.

128
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

129
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,760
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

130
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Same shit.

131
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,840
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

132
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

133
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

134
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,040
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

135
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,760
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

136
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,400
Well, how do I look?

137
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,720
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

138
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
This just in. Police have announced
the name ofthe victim

139
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,320
in the second oftwo murders
which took place today.

140
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,680
Incredibly, the names ofthe
two victims are virtually identical.

141
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,760
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...

142
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,040
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...

143
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,560
Don't touch it.

144
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,920
Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths

145
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,160
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

146
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,920
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

147
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,080
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

148
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,560
Hey. Four-fifty.

149
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,280
You have reached the Los Angeles
Police emergency number.

150
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,960
All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car
sent out to you, stay on the line.

151
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,520
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

152
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
Don't make me bust you up, man.

153
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,200
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

154
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,160
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

155
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,200
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

156
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,760
Wait for the beep.

157
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there.

158
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

159
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,760
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

160
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,320
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

161
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,680
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

162
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,840
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

163
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
It's her.

164
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

165
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

166
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,480
I won't. Can you tell me where you are?

167
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,400
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it. It's on Pico.

168
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

169
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,160
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

170
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,880
You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.

171
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,960
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

172
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,880
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

173
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,320
Come with me if you wanna live.

174
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,040
Come on!

175
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,400
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

176
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,680
Suspect vehicle - Iate model
grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

177
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,880
He's really moving - punching lights.

178
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

179
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,840
Hold it.

180
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,680
Hold on.

181
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,800
Are you injured? Are you shot?

182
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,080
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

183
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,560
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

184
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,880
Do you understand?

185
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,360
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

186
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm here to help you.

187
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

188
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,560
You've been targeted for termination.

189
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,360
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

190
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,640
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

191
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,320
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

192
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,800
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

193
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,720
It's not a man. A machine.

194
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,200
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

195
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,880
A machine? Like a robot?

196
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,360
Not a robot. A cyborg -
cybernetic organism.

197
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,200
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

198
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,800
Get your head down.

199
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,320
Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration
unit. Part man, part machine.

200
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,160
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

201
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,560
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.

202
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,840
Flesh, skin, hair, blood -
grown for the cyborgs.

203
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,680
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

204
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,160
I gotta ditch this car.

205
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,120
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

206
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,640
But these are new. They look human.

207
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,440
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

208
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,000
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

209
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,560
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

210
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,440
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

211
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,920
Are you saying it's from the future?

212
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,600
One possible future...
from your point of view.

213
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I don't know tech stuff.

214
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,480
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

215
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,560
- Right.
- Right.

216
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,560
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

217
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,520
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

218
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,000
That Terminator is out there.

219
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,840
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

220
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,480
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

221
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,320
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

222
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,760
Can you stop it?

223
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,840
I don't know.

224
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,160
With these weapons, I don't know.

225
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,240
All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...

226
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,240
Reese, why me?

227
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,800
Why does it want me?

228
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,480
There was a nuclear war.

229
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,160
A few years from now,

230
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,600
all this, this whole place, everything,

231
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,120
it's gone, just gone.

232
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,840
There were survivors.

233
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,920
Here, there.

234
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,440
Nobody even knew who started it.

235
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,120
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

236
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,680
Defence network computers.

237
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,360
New, powerful,

238
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,040
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

239
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,520
They say it got smart -
a new order of intelligence.

240
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,080
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

241
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,960
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

242
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,360
Extermination.

243
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,120
Did you see this war?

244
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,000
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

245
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,080
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

246
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,960
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

247
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,840
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

248
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,400
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

249
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,240
This was burned in by laser scanner.

250
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,920
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

251
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,520
Loading bodies.

252
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,200
The disposal units ran night and day.

253
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,280
We were that close to going out for ever.

254
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,760
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

255
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,840
To storm the wire of the camps.

256
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,400
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

257
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,480
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

258
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,760
His name was Connor. John Connor.

259
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,320
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

260
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,280
Drive.

261
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,920
Reese!

262
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,680
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

263
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,440
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

264
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,160
Get out of the car.

265
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,480
Drop to your knees.

266
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,760
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

267
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,120
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

268
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,720
Listen, are you sure it's them?

269
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,720
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

270
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,880
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

271
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,760
Ginger. Kiddo.

272
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,280
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

273
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,280
Tell him everything Reese told you,
Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

274
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,360
Yeah, I guess so.

275
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,920
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

276
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,640
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

277
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,240
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

278
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,680
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

279
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,480
That's the year 2027?

280
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,560
That's right. Then I was assigned...

281
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,320
- This is fucking great.
- ..under John Connor.

282
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,400
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...

283
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,720
Goddamn! Sorry.

284
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,200
..built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

285
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,280
I see.

286
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,960
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

287
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,240
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

288
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,520
A sort of retroactive abortion?

289
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,320
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

290
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

291
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,120
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

292
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,680
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

293
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,080
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.

294
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,400
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

295
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,320
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

296
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,040
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

297
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,520
The time displacement equipment?

298
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,320
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

299
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,360
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

300
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,040
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

301
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,120
I can't.

302
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,120
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

303
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,600
It's just him and me.

304
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,160
It's just him and me.

305
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,000
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.

306
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,880
Don't you have ray guns?

307
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,400
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

308
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,000
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

309
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,680
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.

310
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,120
OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?

311
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,600
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

312
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,440
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

313
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,400
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

314
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,960
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

315
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,600
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.

316
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,280
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

317
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,960
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.

318
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,840
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

319
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,640
- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

320
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,960
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.

321
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,760
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

322
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,840
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

323
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,920
Shut up!

324
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,600
You still don't get it, do you?

325
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,760
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

326
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,240
You can't stop him. He'll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

327
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,760
- Doc.
- Let go ofme!

328
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,840
Sorry.

329
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,040
He's crazy?

330
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,440
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

331
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,280
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.

332
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,560
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

333
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,760
This other man must've been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that.

334
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,320
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

335
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,040
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.

336
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,520
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

337
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,600
Thank you.

338
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,160
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

339
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,720
Be at least an hour
before your mother gets here.

340
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,880
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

341
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,960
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

342
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,200
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

343
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,200
Thank you.

344
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,720
- Good night.
- Good night.

345
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,120
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

346
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,680
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

347
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,360
Where is she?

348
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,040
It make take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

349
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,120
I'll be back.

350
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,400
Stay here.

351
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,040
Watch him.

352
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,280
Ed...

353
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,960
Sarah!

354
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,040
Reese.

355
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,400
This way.

356
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,880
KFLB news time. 4.36.

357
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,120
Top story - the largest single
law enforcement mobilisation

358
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,200
in California history
is currently underway.

359
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,040
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

360
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,320
Take this.

361
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,200
All right. Let's get this off the road.

362
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,000
- You cold?
- Freezing.

363
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,200
Reese?

364
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,440
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

365
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,920
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

366
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,560
White light.

367
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,640
Pain.

368
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,160
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

369
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,960
I caught one back there.

370
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,040
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

371
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,400
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

372
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,240
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

373
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,480
Jesus.

374
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,080
See? It passed right through the meat.

375
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,520
This is gonna make me puke.

376
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,680
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

377
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,160
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

378
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,920
He's about my height.

379
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,160
He has your eyes.

380
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,080
What's he like?

381
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,760
You trust him. He's got a strength.

382
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,400
I'd die for John Connor.

383
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,520
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

384
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,200
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

385
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,080
John never said much about him.

386
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,160
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

387
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,120
I don't wanna know.

388
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,520
So was it John that sent you here?

389
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,200
I volunteered.

390
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,960
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

391
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:24,640
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organise,

392
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,840
prepare from when he was a kid.

393
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,520
When you were in hiding before the war.

394
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,160
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

395
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,720
It's driving me crazy.

396
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,240
Are you sure you have the right person?

397
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,440
I'm sure.

398
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,320
Come on! Do I look like
the mother of the future?

399
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,800
I mean, am I tough? Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

400
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,560
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honour and I don't want it.

401
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,920
Any of it.

402
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,920
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorise it.

403
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,000
Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

404
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,600
I can't help you with what you must
soon face. The future is not set.

405
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,160
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

406
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,480
You must survive or I will never exist.

407
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,560
That's all.

408
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,960
It's a good field dressing.

409
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,040
You like it?

410
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,320
It's my first.

411
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,280
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

412
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,080
OK.

413
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,680
Talk to me some more.

414
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,880
About what?

415
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,560
Tell me about where you're from.

416
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,440
All right.

417
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,120
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

418
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,200
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

419
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,240
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

420
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,640
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

421
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,320
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

422
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:51,680
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.

423
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,000
Let's go.

424
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,720
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

425
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,760
Terminator!

426
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,160
I was dreaming about dogs.

427
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,240
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

428
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,080
Your world is pretty terrifying.

429
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,200
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

430
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,240
Fuck you, asshole.

431
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,200
God damn.

432
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,600
Thank you.

433
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,760
Is this enough?

434
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,840
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

435
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,840
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

436
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,960
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

437
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,880
I am dying for a shower.

438
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,160
We should check your bandage, too.

439
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,720
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

440
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,400
Keep this.

441
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,720
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

442
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
I need to know where to reach you.

443
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:16,960
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?

444
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,240
I am worried sick here.

445
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,720
OK. OK, here's the number.

446
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,040
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

447
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:32,440
It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.

448
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,360
- Got it?
- I've got it.

449
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,680
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

450
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,760
I love you, Mom.

451
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,320
I love you, too, sweetheart.

452
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,240
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

453
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,720
What have we got?

454
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:14,120
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

455
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,400
What's for dinner?

456
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,560
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

457
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,640
What is it?

458
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,200
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

459
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,080
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

460
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,200
Make sure there's none on the threads.

461
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,640
Like this.

462
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,200
Screw the end cap on.

463
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,800
Very gently.

464
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,120
You must've had a fun childhood.

465
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,320
That's good.

466
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,200
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

467
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,280
He'll find us, won't he?

468
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,400
Probably.

469
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,640
It'll never be over, will it?

470
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,440
Look at me. I'm shaking.

471
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,400
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

472
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,960
No, I'm not.

473
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,560
Kyle, the women in your time,

474
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,840
what are they like?

475
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,640
Good fighters.

476
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,320
That's not what I meant.

477
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,200
Was there someone special?

478
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,360
Someone...?

479
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,640
A girl, you know.

480
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,040
No.

481
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,240
Never.

482
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,240
Never?

483
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,760
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

484
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,760
So much pain.

485
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,160
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

486
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,480
So you feel nothing?

487
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,440
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

488
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,000
I didn't know why at the time.

489
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,880
It was very old, torn, faded.

490
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,640
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

491
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,680
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

492
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,160
I memorised every line,

493
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,240
every curve.

494
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,160
I came across time for you, Sarah.

495
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,320
I love you. I always have.

496
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,840
I shouldn't have said that.

497
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,000
Think fast.

498
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,880
Trade places.

499
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,280
Faster. Drive faster.

500
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,920
Kyle. Oh, my God.

501
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,120
You stay here.

502
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,960
Let's get outta here.

503
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,800
Get out.

504
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,080
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

505
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,800
Come on.

506
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,600
Help me. Get out. Get out.

507
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,160
Don't stop. Run.

508
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,120
Sarah.

509
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,000
Kyle.

510
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,000
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

511
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,960
No.

512
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,760
Wait.

513
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:34,440
What are you doing?

514
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,800
Cover, so he can't track us.

515
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,240
Come on.

516
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,560
No. Kyle. Come on.

517
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,360
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

518
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,120
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

519
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,560
On your feet. Move it.

520
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,640
Get back. Go back.

521
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,400
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

522
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,200
Run.

523
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,080
Run.

524
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,720
Come on, motherfucker.

525
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,320
No.

526
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,280
You're terminated, fucker.

527
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,280
Kyle.

528
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,320
Seven. November 10. Where was l?

529
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,120
What's difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

530
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,760
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

531
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,640
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

532
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,080
Fill her up.

533
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,880
Should I tell you about your father?

534
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,160
Boy, that's a tough one.

535
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:21,040
Will it effect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

536
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,720
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

537
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,800
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

538
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,640
I suppose I will tell you.

539
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,920
I owe him that.

540
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,360
Maybe it'll help if...

541
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:46,440
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,

542
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,760
we loved a lifetime's worth.

543
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:06,440
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

544
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,520
He is ashamed to ask you
for five dollars for this picture.

545
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:12,840
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

546
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,840
Pretty good hustle, kid.

547
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,440
What did he just say?

548
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,520
He said there's a storm coming in.

549
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,840
I know.
