1
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,018
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,029
What the hell...?

3
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,503
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,895
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,900
Nice night for a walk?

6
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,955
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,287
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,000
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,212
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

10
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:49,051
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

11
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,714
Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,448
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

13
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,576
<i>See that guy?</i>

14
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,835
Hold it right there.

15
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,837
He's rabbiting.
Hey! I said hold it!

16
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,168
Go!

17
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,676
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

18
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,549
What day is it? The date.
12th May.

19
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,513
Thursday.
What year?

20
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,028
He's got my gun. Let's go.

21
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,626
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

22
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,082
Hi. I'm late.

23
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,669
So am I.

24
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,176
I'm in it.
So am I.

25
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,889
Honey, can I have that coffee now?
Yes, sir.

26
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,443
OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
I ordered barbecued.

27
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,649
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

28
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,531
Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
OK, who gets the burly-beef?

29
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,534
Miss, we're ready to order now.
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,530
I'm so sorry.

31
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,577
This isn't real leather, is it?

32
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,045
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

33
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,213
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

34
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,769
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

35
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,771
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

36
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,484
The .45 long slide with laser sighting.

37
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,949
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

38
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,406
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

39
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,416
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

40
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,076
You can't miss.

41
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,083
Anything else?
Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

42
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,876
Hey, just what you see, pal.

43
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,420
The Uzi nine millimeter.

44
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,215
You know your weapons, buddy.

45
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,555
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

46
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,764
So which will it be?

47
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,434
All.
I may close early today.

48
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,947
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

49
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,108
You can't do that.
Wrong.

50
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,930
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

51
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:04,397
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

52
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,811
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

53
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,613
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

54
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,047
Sarah Connor?
Yes?

55
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,100
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

56
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,642
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

57
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:34,442
So incredible. You're not gonna believe
this. Sit, you're going to love this.

58
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,737
What?
<i>...compiled from several witnesses.</i>

59
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,077
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,</i>

60
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,582
<i>brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.</i>

61
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,539
You're dead, honey.

62
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,939
<i>...if you're into sound,</i>

63
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:05,452
<i>for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>

64
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,831
<i>We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>

65
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,492
<i>We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...</i>

66
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,317
sorry-

67
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,160
Hello?

68
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,373
<i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,</i>

69
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,962
<i>then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>

70
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:06,847
<i>And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans off inch by inch.</i>

71
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,761
Ginger, it's Matt.

72
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,849
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

73
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,266
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

74
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,729
Who is this?

75
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,319
God. Sarah?

76
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,107
<i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,073
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

78
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,820
Sure.

79
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,041
It's the creep.

80
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,702
Hello?

81
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,418
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

82
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:48,339
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

83
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,591
Ed.

84
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,933
What have you got?
Dead girl.

85
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,599
I can see that.
Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

86
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,611
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

87
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,567
You know, these work.

88
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,613
What's this?
Dead girl two.

89
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,449
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

90
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,700
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

91
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,868
Look at the name, Ed.

92
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,214
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

93
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,088
You're kidding me.

94
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,845
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

95
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,349
A one-day pattern killer.
I hate the weird ones.

96
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,814
So...

97
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,609
Better than mortal man deserves.

98
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:55,246
Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
Not lately. Did you check messages?

99
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,248
I thought you did.

100
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,878
Hi, Sarah, this is your <i>mom...</i>
There you are, young man.

101
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,213
You mind your mother.

102
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,967
<i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Somethings come up.</i>

103
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,388
<i>Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>

104
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:24,310
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up
to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>

105
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,484
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

106
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,117
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

107
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,195
I'll live.

108
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,455
I'll break his kneecaps.

109
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:43,537
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

110
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,752
God. It's disgusting.

111
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,548
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

112
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,635
We will. You, too.
OK.

113
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,803
Damn it, Matt.

114
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,321
Oh, shit.
Lieutenant!

115
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,992
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

116
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,082
What can I tell you? No comment.
But, Lieutenant...

117
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,642
That coffee's two hours cold.

118
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,807
I put a cigarette out in it.

119
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,317
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No. I got her answering machine.

120
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,773
Send a unit.
I sent a unit. There's no answer.

121
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,109
The apartment manager's not in.
Call her.

122
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,490
I just called her.
Call her again.

123
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,201
Give me a cigarette.

124
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:54,175
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

125
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:59,009
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need
love, too, so talk to it...</i>

126
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,810
Same shit.

127
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,234
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

128
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:16,648
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

129
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,618
Where are you going?
To make a statement.

130
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,950
Maybe make these jackals work for us
for a change.

131
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,663
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

132
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,419
Well, how do I look?

133
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,877
Like shit, boss.
Your mama.

134
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,173
<i>This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim</i>

135
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:42,386
<i>in the second of two execution
style murders which took place today.</i>

136
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,348
<i>Incredibly, the names of the
two victims are virtually identical.</i>

137
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:51,062
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...</i>

138
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,026
Can we change this?
Sarah Louise Connor...

139
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,778
Don't touch it!

140
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:02,406
<i>Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths</i>

141
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,664
<i>and no other connection between the
two victims has been established yet.</i>

142
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,202
<i>We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

143
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,627
Hey, you got a phone?
It's in the back.

144
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,092
Hey, $4.50.

145
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,552
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department emergency number.</i>

146
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:33,515
<i>All lines are busy. If you need a police
car sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>

147
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,159
Pugsley! Shoo!

148
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,955
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

149
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,604
Don't make me bust you up, man.

150
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,960
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

151
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,997
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.</i>

152
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,133
<i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.</i>

153
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,793
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

154
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,256
<i>Ginger, this is Sarah.
Pick up if you're there.</i>

155
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:21,271
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>

156
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,355
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

157
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,646
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

158
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,525
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

159
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,946
<i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>

160
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,034
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

161
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,470
<i>It's her.</i>

162
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,973
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

163
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,390
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

164
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,059
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

165
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,070
<i>I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.</i>
Yeah, I <i>know it. It's on</i> Pico.

166
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,777
Are you all right?
Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

167
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,819
I think there's a guy following me.
Now, listen carefully.

168
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,364
You're in a public place so
you'll be safe till we get there.

169
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,828
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

170
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,744
<i>I'll have</i> a <i>car there in</i> a <i>minute.</i>
<i>OK.</i>

171
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,986
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

172
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,682
Come with me if you wanna live.

173
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,817
Come on!

174
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,692
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

175
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,197
Suspect vehicle: late model
gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

176
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,698
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

177
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,658
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

178
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,034
Hold it!

179
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,094
Hold on.

180
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,736
Are you injured? Are you shot?

181
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,657
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

182
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,373
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

183
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,958
Do you understand?

184
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,500
Do you understand?
Yes! Please don't hurt me.

185
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,437
I'm here to help you.

186
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:31,199
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

187
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,076
You've been targeted for termination.

188
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,625
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic, approaching Overland.

189
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,766
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

190
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,644
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

191
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,182
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

192
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,726
It's not a man. A machine.

193
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,863
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

194
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,958
A machine? Like a robot?

195
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:26,622
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

196
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,712
No. He was bleeding.
Just a second.

197
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,132
Get your head down!

198
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,183
All right, listen.

199
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,722
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

200
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,984
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

201
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,772
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

202
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,035
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

203
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,741
Look, Reese, I don't know...
Pay attention.

204
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,201
I gotta ditch this car.

205
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,003
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

206
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,634
But these are new. They look human.

207
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,422
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

208
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,308
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

209
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:07,939
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

210
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,148
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

211
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,693
Are you saying it's from the future?

212
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,950
One possible future.

213
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,242
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

214
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,624
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

215
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,910
Right.
Right.

216
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,471
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

217
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,477
Just let me go.
Listen and understand.

218
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,390
That Terminator is out there.

219
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,232
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

220
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:59,116
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

221
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:05,156
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

222
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,209
Can you stop it?

223
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,805
I don't know.

224
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,926
With these weapons, I don't know.

225
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,743
<i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...</i>

226
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:35,666
Reese, why me?

227
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,294
Why does it want me?

228
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,091
There was a nuclear war.

229
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,888
A few years from now...

230
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,354
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

231
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,858
...it's gone. Just gone.

232
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,619
There were survivors.

233
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,780
Here, there.

234
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,043
Nobody even knew who started it.

235
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:22,460
It was the machines, Sarah.
I don't understand.

236
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,755
Defense network computers.

237
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:29,095
New, powerful...

238
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:34,517
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

239
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:39,731
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

240
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,652
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

241
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,449
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

242
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,864
Extermination.

243
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,755
Did you see this war?

244
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:25,985
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

245
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,196
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

246
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,362
H-Ks?
Hunter-killers.

247
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,283
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

248
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,704
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

249
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,045
This was burned in by laser scanner.

250
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:53,555
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

251
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,885
Loading bodies.

252
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,731
The disposal units ran night and day.

253
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,767
We were that close
to going out forever.

254
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,733
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

255
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,821
To storm the wire of the camps.

256
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:15,284
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

257
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,659
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

258
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:24,081
His name was Connor. John Connor.

259
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,718
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

260
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,487
Drive!

261
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,878
Reese!

262
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:29,877
Reese!

263
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:51,270
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

264
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,280
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

265
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,443
Get out of the car.

266
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,415
Drop to your knees.

267
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,202
Out of the car.
Drop to the ground.

268
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,448
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

269
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,619
Listen, are you sure it's them?

270
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,581
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

271
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,621
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

272
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,335
Ginger.

273
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:02,390
Kiddo.
Sarah...

274
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,723
Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
Hi, Sarah.

275
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,935
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

276
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,191
Yeah, I guess so.

277
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,822
You're a doctor?
Criminal psychologist.

278
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:22,202
Is Reese crazy?
That's what we're gonna find out.

279
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,907
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

280
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:57,459
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

281
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,716
That's the year <i>2027?</i>

282
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,968
<i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>

283
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,756
This is fucking great.
...under John Connor.

284
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,017
Who was the enemy?
A computer defense system built...

285
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,724
Goddamn. Sorry.

286
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:16,232
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

287
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,359
I see.

288
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:24,400
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

289
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,785
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

290
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,037
A sort of retroactive abortion?

291
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:35,077
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

292
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,746
He screwed it first...
Ed, shut up.

293
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,255
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

294
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,963
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

295
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:47,222
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

296
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,806
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

297
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,767
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

298
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,980
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

299
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,316
The time displacement equipment?

300
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,528
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

301
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,569
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

302
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,579
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

303
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,165
I can't.

304
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:21,255
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

305
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,092
It's just him and me.

306
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,366
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

307
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:20,416
<i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.</i>

308
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,544
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

309
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,378
<i>Ray</i> guns.
<i>Show me</i> a <i>piece of future technology.</i>

310
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,920
<i>You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.</i>

311
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,134
<i>Nothing dead will go.
Why?</i>

312
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,969
<i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>

313
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:40,888
<i>OK, OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...?</i>

314
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,476
<i>Surrounded by living tissue.
Oh, right.</i>

315
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,018
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

316
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,983
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

317
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,616
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

318
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,913
<i>Why were the other two women killed?
Most records were lost in the war.</i>

319
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,666
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.</i>

320
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,249
<i>Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.</i>

321
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,506
<i>The Terminator was
just being systematic.</i>

322
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,509
<i>Let's go back...
Look, you have heard enough.</i>

323
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,637
<i>I have answered your questions,
now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>

324
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,766
<i>I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you?</i>

325
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,769
<i>Who is in authority here?
Please...</i>

326
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,475
<i>Shut up!</i>

327
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,849
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

328
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:32,113
<i>He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.</i>

329
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,023
<i>You can't stop him.</i>

330
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,819
<i>He'll reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

331
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,954
<i>Doc.
Let go of me!</i>

332
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,409
sorry-

333
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,207
So Reese is crazy?

334
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:55,879
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

335
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:02,184
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

336
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,470
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

337
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,855
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

338
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,686
Feel that. Go ahead.

339
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:14,572
He punched through the windshield.
He was probably on PCP.

340
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,403
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

341
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,159
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

342
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,740
Here.
Thank you.

343
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,908
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

344
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,418
Be at least an hour before
your mother gets here from Big Bear.

345
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,671
I can't sleep.
Try.

346
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:36,086
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

347
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:41,883
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

348
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,009
Thank you.

349
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,317
Good night.
Good night.

350
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,787
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

351
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,126
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

352
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,415
Where is she?

353
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,173
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

354
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,223
I'll be back.

355
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,236
Are they terrorists?
Let's go, let's go!

356
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,280
Stay here.

357
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,050
Let's get outta here!

358
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,613
Watch him.

359
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,815
Ed...

360
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,025
Hey!

361
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,178
Sarah!

362
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,848
Reese.

363
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,933
This way.

364
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,393
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

365
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,276
<i>Top story of the hour: the largest

366
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,029

367
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:50,782
<i>Police in five counties are engaged

368
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,737
Take this.

369
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,542
All right,
let's get this off the road.

370
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,402
You cold?
Freezing.

371
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,547
Reese?

372
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:56,181
You got a first name?
Kyle.

373
01:04:56,351 --> 01:05:00,640
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

374
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,315
White light.

375
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,110
Pain.

376
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:16,653
It's like being born maybe.
Oh, my God.

377
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,491
I caught one back there.

378
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,826
You mean you got shot?
It's not bad.

379
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:28,171
We gotta get you to a doctor.
It's OK. Forget it.

380
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:33,006
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

381
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,266
Jesus.

382
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,311
See? It passed right through the meat.

383
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,104
This is gonna make me puke.

384
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,654
Would you just talk about something?
What?

385
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:59,286
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

386
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,706
He's about my height.

387
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,370
He has your eyes.

388
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,300
What's he like?

389
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:17,759
You trust him. He's got a strength.

390
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,342
I'd die for John Connor.

391
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:27,890
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

392
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:33,813
Don't suppose you know who the father is
<i>so</i> I won't tell him to get lost?

393
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,732
John never said much about him.

394
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,402
I know he dies before the war...
Wait.

395
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,117
I don't wanna know.

396
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,125
So was it John that sent you here?

397
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,373
I volunteered.

398
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,421
Why?
It was a chance to meet the legend.

399
01:06:55,512 --> 01:07:02,350
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

400
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,601
prepare from when he was a kid.

401
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,808
When you were in hiding before the war.

402
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:14,357
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

403
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,397
It's driving me crazy.

404
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,028
Are you sure you have the right person?

405
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,243
I'm sure.

406
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:29,125
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

407
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:35,800
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

408
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,715
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

409
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,348
Any of it.

410
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:51,857
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

411
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,902
"Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years."

412
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,188
I can't help you with
what you must soon face,

413
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,653
except to say the future is not set.

414
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,319
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

415
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,988
"You must survive or I will never exist."

416
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,789
That's all.

417
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,290
It's a good field dressing.

418
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,331
You like it?

419
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,504
It's my first.

420
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,174
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

421
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,679
OK.

422
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,278
Talk to me some more.

423
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,075
About what?

424
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,408
Tell me about where you're from.

425
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,370
All right.

426
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,794
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

427
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,885
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

428
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:13,059
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

429
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,766
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

430
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,981
The Terminators were the newest.

431
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:20,524
<i>The worst.</i>

432
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:35,168
<i>Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 meters north of your position.</i>

433
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,249
Let's go.

434
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:30,682
Reese. DN384...
Right. Let him in.

435
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,059
Terminator!

436
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,646
I was dreaming about dogs.

437
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,268
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

438
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,899
Your world is pretty terrifying.

439
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,609
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

440
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,119
Fuck you, asshole.

441
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,810
God damn.

442
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,353
Thank you.

443
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,227
Is this enough?

444
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:57,069
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

445
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,906
I'm coming.
We need a room.

446
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,075
All right.
With a kitchen.

447
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,709
Do you have one with a kitchen?

448
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,603
I am dying for a shower.

449
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:31,395
We should check your bandage, too.

450
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,648
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

451
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,529
Keep this.

452
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,972
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

453
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:12,311
<i>But I need to know where to reach you.</i>

454
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:17,605
<i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>

455
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,524
<i>I am worried sick here.</i>

456
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,444
OK. OK, here's the number.

457
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,829
You ready?
Yes. Go ahead.

458
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:33,666
<i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>

459
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,580
<i>Got it?
We got“.</i>

460
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:39,922
<i>I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.</i>

461
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,837
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

462
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,217
I love you, too, sweetheart.

463
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,528
Tiki <i>Motel.</i>
Give me your address there.

464
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,286
What have we got?

465
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:17,122
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

466
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,915
What's for dinner?

467
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,718
Plastique.
That sounds good.

468
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,253
What is it?

469
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:28,720
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

470
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,760
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

471
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,774
Make sure there's none on the threads.

472
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,407
Like this.

473
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,160
Screw the end cap on.

474
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,622
Very gently.

475
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,669
You must've had a fun childhood.

476
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,753
That's good.

477
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,762
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

478
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,195
He'll find us, won't he?

479
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,692
Probably.

480
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,920
It'll never be over, will it?

481
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:58,348
Look at me. I'm shaking.

482
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:04,654
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

483
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:09,655
No, I'm not.

484
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:23,670
Kyle, the women in your time,

485
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,924
what are they like?

486
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,095
Good fighters.

487
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,303
That's not what I meant.

488
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,310
Was there someone special?

489
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,893
Someone...?

490
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,688
A girl, you know.

491
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,561
No.

492
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,983
Never.

493
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,194
Never?

494
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:01,536
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

495
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,507
So much pain.

496
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:12,221
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

497
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:14,632
So you feel nothing?

498
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,728
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

499
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,439
I didn't know why at the time.

500
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:33,743
It was very old, torn, faded.

501
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:43,579
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

502
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,874
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

503
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,552
I memorized every line...

504
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,923
...every curve.

505
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,515
I came across time for you, Sarah.

506
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,730
I love you. I always have.

507
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,458
I shouldn't have said that.

508
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,553
Think fast.

509
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:29,936
Trade places.

510
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,285
Faster! Drive faster!

511
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,375
Kyle! Oh, my God.

512
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,956
Kyle.

513
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,590
Son-of-a-bitch!

514
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,273
You stay here.

515
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,428
Let's get outta here.

516
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,345
Get out.

517
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,456
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

518
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,547
Kyle, come on.

519
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,547
Help me! Get out. Get out.

520
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,998
Don't stop. Run!

521
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:31,711
Sarah!

522
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,377
Kyle.

523
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,221
Kyle. Kyle...

524
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:47,056
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

525
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:07,876
No!

526
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,711
No!

527
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:06,889
Wait.

528
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,351
What are you doing?

529
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,400
Cover, so he can't track us.

530
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:30,288
Come on! Come on.

531
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:34,126
No, Kyle! Come on!

532
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,624
Come on!
Leave me here.

533
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:52,140
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

534
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,646
On your feet!

535
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:56,439
Move it!

536
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,804
Get back. Go back.

537
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,131
Run, Sarah.
No.

538
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:47,592
Run!

539
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,018
Run!

540
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:55,141
Come on, motherfucker.

541
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,298
No.

542
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:50,459
You're terminated, fucker.

543
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:49,889
Kyle.

544
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:14,916
Tape seven. November 10. Where was I?

545
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:19,719
What's most difficult is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

546
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:24,425
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

547
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:28,345
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

548
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,807
Fill her up.

549
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,599
Should I tell you about your father?

550
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:16,017
Boy, that's a tough one.

551
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:22,066
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

552
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:27,070
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

553
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:30,331
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

554
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,871
I suppose I will tell you.

555
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,503
I owe him that.

556
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,261
Maybe it'll help if...

557
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:49,848
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

558
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,934
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

559
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:10,663
What did he just say?
He says you're very beautiful.

560
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:13,700
He is ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for this picture.

561
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:17,291
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

562
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:19,172
Pretty good hustle, kid.

563
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:38,107
What did he just say?

564
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:40,943
He said there's a storm coming in.

565
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:46,950
I know.
