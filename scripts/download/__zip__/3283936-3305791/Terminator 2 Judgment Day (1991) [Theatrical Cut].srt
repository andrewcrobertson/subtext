1
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:54,533
<i>Three billion human
lives ended on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:55,707 --> 00:02:00,577
<i>The survivors of the nuclear
fire called the war: Judgment Day.</i>

3
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:03,750
<i>They lived only to face a new nightmare:</i>

4
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:05,922
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

5
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,873
<i>The computer which
controlled the machines, Skynet,</i>

6
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,050
<i>sent two Terminators back through time.</i>

7
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>Their mission, to destroy the
leader of the human resistance,</i>

8
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,715
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

9
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,016
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me in the year 1984,</i>

10
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:48,772
<i>before John was born.</i>

11
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:50,478
<i>It failed.</i>

12
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:55,237
<i>The second was set to strike at
John himself when he was still a child.</i>

13
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,579
<i>As before, the resistance
was able to send a lone warrior,</i>

14
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,956
<i>a protector for John.</i>

15
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,521
<i>It was just a question of which
one of them would reach him first.</i>

16
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:27,304
I need your clothes, your
boots and your motorcycle.

17
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,436
You forgot to say please.

18
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,484
Ooh!

19
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:52,989
Oh!

20
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,825
Aagh! Get him off me!

21
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:12,717
Agh!

22
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,397
Pull it out! Pull it out!

23
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:20,270
Agh! Pull it out!

24
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,120

00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,273
on electrical disturbance.

50
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,155
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

51
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,109
Ugh!

52
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,414
-John!

53
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:14,232
John, get in there and
clean up that pigsty of yours.

54
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,719
-John!

55
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,464
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

56
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,767
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

57
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:34,586
-He won't even answer me anymore.
-Honey, move.

58
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,485
Would you get off your butt and help me?

59
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,408
-Todd!
-What?

60
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,863
He hasn't cleaned that
room of his in a month.

61
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:46,995
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

62
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,542
-Come on!
-John!

63
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,879
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

64
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,723
She's not my mother, Todd.

65
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,087
This next patient is interesting.

66
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,629
I've been following the case for years.

67
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,833
A 29-year-old female…

68
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,800
Diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

69
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,114
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

70
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,805
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

71
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,602
The delusional
architecture is fairly unique.

72
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,655
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

73
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,867
which looked human, of course,
was sent back through time to kill her.

74
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:05,194
That's original.

75
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,121
And also, that the father of her child

76
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,166
was a soldier sent back to protect her.

77
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,664
-No?
-He was from the future too.

78
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,671
The year 2029, if I remember correctly.

79
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,751
And here we are.

80
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:22,632
Morning, Sarah.

81
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:30,936
Good morning, Dr
Silberman. How's the knee?

82
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,723
Fine, Sarah.

83
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:41,109
She, uh... stabbed me in the
kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago.

84
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,299
Repeated escape attempts...

85
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,711
Let's move on, shall we?

86
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,547
Lewis, I don't like to see the
patients disrupting their rooms like this.

87
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,843
-See she takes her Thorazine.
-Sure. I'll take care of it.

88
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,510
Are you the legal
guardian of John Connor?

89
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:31,530
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

90
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,210
-Could I speak with him, please?
-You could if he were here.

91
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,130
He took off on his bike this
morning so he could be anywhere.

92
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,707
-Do you have a photograph of John?
-Yeah. Hold on.

93
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,012
You gonna tell me what this is about?

94
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,173
I just need to ask him a few questions.

95
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:54,554
He's a good-looking boy. Do
you mind if I keep this picture?

96
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:58,022
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

97
00:16:58,234 --> 00:16:59,941
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

98
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,102
Has that got something to do with this?

99
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,325
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

100
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,245
Thanks for your cooperation.

101
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,991
Please insert your stolen card now.

102
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,258
PIN number.

103
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,937
-Hurry up. This is taking too long.
-Go, baby. Go, baby.

104
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,724
All right!

105
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,428
-PIN number 9003.
-Where'd you learn this stuff from?

106
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,060
From my mom. My real mom, I mean.

107
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:43,352
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

108
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:46,279
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

109
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,573
-Yes!
-Hey, it worked.

110
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:52,323
All right. Easy money. Come on!

111
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,949
Yes! Piece of cake.

112
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,336
-Is that her?
-Yes.

113
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,591
-She's pretty cool, huh?
-No, she's a complete psycho.

114
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,424
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, okay?

115
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,810
She tried to blow up a computer
factory, but she got shot and arrested.

116
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,354
No shit.

117
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,478
She's a total loser.

118
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,276
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

119
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:44,375
It's like a giant strobe light

120
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,832
burning right through my eyes.

121
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,297
Somehow, I can still see.

122
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,142
Oh, God.

123
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,903
We know the dream's the same every night.

124
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,444
-Why do I have to...
-Please continue.

125
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,863
Children look like burnt paper.

126
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,082
Black.

127
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,660
Not moving.

128
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,423
And then the blast wave hits them.

129
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,806
And they fly apart like leaves.

130
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:46,938
Dreams of cataclysm, the end
of the world are very common.

131
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:53,031
It's not a
dream, you moron. It's real.

132
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,986
-I know the date it happens.
-I'm sure it feels very real to you.

133
00:19:57,204 --> 00:20:02,290
On August 29, 1997, it's gonna
feel pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

134
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,953
Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock

135
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,664
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?

136
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,883
God! You think you're safe and alive.

137
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,256
You're already dead. Everybody!

138
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:16,885
Him. You. You're dead already.

139
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,842
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

140
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,019
You're the one living in a
fucking dream, Silberman!

141
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,813
'Cause I know it happened! It happened!

142
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,031
I feel much better now.

143
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,988
Clearer.

144
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,545
Yes, your attitude has
been much improved lately.

145
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:59,097
It's helped me to have a goal,

146
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,350
something to look forward to.

147
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,597
What is that?

148
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,942
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

149
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,690
you would transfer me to
the minimum security wing

150
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,989
and I could have visitors.

151
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:20,573
Well, it's been six months and...

152
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,615
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

153
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,326
I see.

154
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:35,592
Let's go back to what you were
saying about those Terminator machines.

155
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:39,046
Now you think they don't exist?

156
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,473
They don't exist.

157
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,266
I know that now.

158
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:45,277
But you've told me on many occasions

159
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,813
about how you crushed
one in a hydraulic press.

160
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,185
If I had, there would
have been some evidence.

161
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:55,704
They would have found
something at the factory.

162
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,898
I see.

163
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,952
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

164
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,581
No. Why would they?

165
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,743
Let's try a new position right there.

166
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:14,127
The neuronal sensors are
correct, because it works.

167
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:16,833
-Right.
-Those neurons are all centered.

168
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,712
Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...

169
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,011
Mr. Dyson?

170
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,887
Mr. Dyson, the materials
team is running another...

171
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,597
-Mr. Dyson.
-Yes?

172
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,763
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

173
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,692
You have to sign for the... Uh... it.

174
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:36,816
-You have to sign it out.
-Okay. Come on. I'll get it.

175
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:39,652
Mr. Dyson,

176
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,827
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

177
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,073
-I mean, if you know...
-Know what?

178
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,826
Well, if you know where "it" came from.

179
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,460
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

180
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:51,705
"Don't ask."

181
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,510
-Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
-How's it going?

182
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,799
Insert key.

183
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,974
Left on three, two, one, turn.

184
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,773
-How are the wife and kids?
-Great. Thanks.

185
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,018
There you go.

186
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:43,302
So, what do you think, Doctor?

187
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,190
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

188
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:50,556
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

189
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,096
I know how smart you are.

190
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:56,357
I think you're just telling
me what I want to hear.

191
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,863
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

192
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:03,857
I think if I put you in minimum
security, you'll just try to escape again.

193
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,539
You have to let me see my son.

194
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,992
Please.

195
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:16,790
Please.

196
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,959
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

197
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,977
If I could just make a phone call...

198
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,051
Afraid not. Not for a while.

199
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,394
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board

200
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,765
that you stay here
for another six months.

201
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,850
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

202
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,690
-Get her off of me!
-You son of a bitch!

203
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,150
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

204
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:52,179
-You don't know what you're doing!
-Get some restraints in here now!

205
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,826
You don't know what you're doing!

206
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:03,295
Model citizen.

207
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,324
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

208
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,178
He said he was going to the galleria?

209
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,298
Yeah.

210
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,130
The galleria?

211
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,786
I'm gonna get some
quarters. I'll be back, all right?

212
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,237
-Oh, no!
-Girls, do you know John Connor?

213
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:57,947
No.

214
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:03,996
-Hey, do you know this guy?
-Nah, I don't know him.

215
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,178
-John.
-Not now.

216
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,223
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

217
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,599
-He's right over there.
-Split, man.

218
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,726
-Just go.
-Yeah.

219
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:30,314
I saw that kid... Hey!

220
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,621
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

221
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,102
Hey!

222
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,277
Get down.

223
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:26,225
Mister, are you all right?

224
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,118
Come on!

225
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,706
Goddamn!

226
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,655
Agh!

227
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,229
Okay. Time out. Stop the bike.

228
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:10,360
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

229
00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,797
Holy shit. Now, don't
take this the wrong way.

230
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,045
-But you are a Terminator, right?
-Yes.

231
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,095
-Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
-No?

232
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:47,902
Holy shit! You're really real.

233
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:51,780
I mean...

234
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:58,822
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

235
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,827
I'm a cybernetic organism:

236
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:03,580
living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

237
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,513
This is intense.

238
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:23,437
Get a grip, John. Okay.

239
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:28,101
You're not here to kill me.

240
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,233
I figured that part out for
myself. So what's the deal?

241
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:35,032
My mission is to protect you.

242
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,735
Yeah? Who sent you?

243
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,028
You did.

244
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,580
Thirty-five years from now,

245
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,159
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

246
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:48,121
Oh, this is deep.

247
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,254
So this other guy, he's a
Terminator like you, right?

248
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,929
Not like me. A T-1000,
advanced prototype.

249
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:03,056
-More advanced than you are?
-Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

250
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,393
-What the hell does that mean?
-Liquid metal.

251
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:09,267
Where are we going?

252
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:12,886
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

253
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,283
Listen, I got to stop by my
house. I want to pick up some stuff.

254
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:20,327
Negative. The T-1000 would
definitely try to reacquire you there.

255
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,201
-You sure?
-I would.

256
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,551
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks…

257
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,222
But I gotta warn them.

258
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,766
Shit! You got a quarter?

259
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:54,479
-Hello.
<i>-Janelle, it's me.</i>

260
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,905
-John?
<i>-Yeah. Is everything all right?</i>

261
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,535
-Are you guys okay?
<i>-Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

262
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,612
-Are you all right?
<i>-Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

263
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,290
John, it's late. I was
beginning to worry about you.

264
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,170
If you hurry home, we can sit
down and have dinner together.

265
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,665
I'm making beef stew.

266
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,963
Something's wrong. She's never this nice.

267
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,541
-John, where are you?

268
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,503
What the hell is the
goddamn dog barking at?

269
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,839
Hey, shut up, you
worthless piece of shit!

270
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,390
The dog's really barking.

271
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,551
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

272
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:32,232
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

273
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:34,385
Could he already be there?

274
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:36,514
Honey, are you okay?

275
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:38,943
I'm right here.
I'm fine.

276
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:40,758
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

277
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,657
- What's the dog's name?
-Max.

278
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,624
Janelle,
what's wrong with Wolfie?

279
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:49,166
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

280
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:52,040
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

281
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:54,872
Where are you?

282
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:58,542
Your foster parents are dead.

283
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,540
No, no. I need a minute here.

284
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:41,924
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

285
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:44,471
Anything it samples by physical contact.

286
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,469
Get real.

287
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,303
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

288
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,183
No, only an object of equal size.

289
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,848
Why not just become a
bomb or something to get me?

290
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,063
It can't form complex machines.

291
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,363
Guns and explosives have
chemicals, moving parts.

292
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,733
It doesn't work that way.

293
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:03,737
-But it can form solid metal shapes.
-Like what?

294
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,944
Knives and stabbing weapons.

295
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,331
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

296
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:12,783
at the West Highland
Police Station in 1984.

297
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,208
He killed 17 police officers that night.

298
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,958
Men with families

299
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,927
children.

300
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:29,766
These were taken at
a mall in Reseda today.

301
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:35,059
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

302
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,525
Look, I just sat here and told
you that your son is missing.

303
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,741
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

304
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:46,067
We know this guy's involved.

305
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:51,121
Doesn't that mean anything
to you? Don't you care?

306
00:40:55,503 --> 00:41:01,625
-We're wasting our time. Let's go.
-Sorry, guys.

307
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:06,045
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality as time goes on.

308
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,926
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

309
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,805
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

310
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,352
Sure.

311
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:16,306
Douglas, take her back
to her room, please.

312
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:17,605
Yes, sir.

313
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,314
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

314
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:26,490
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

315
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,238
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

316
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,656
running guns.

317
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,709
Then there were some other guys.

318
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,796
She'd shack up with
anybody she could learn from

319
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,089
so she could teach me how
to be this great military leader.

320
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,880
Then she gets busted.

321
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:49,588
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

322
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:55,803
It's like everything I'd been brought
up to believe was all made-up bullshit.

323
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:58,435
I hated her for that.

324
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,395
But everything she said was true.

325
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:07,648
She knew.

326
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:11,903
And nobody believed her.

327
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:15,580
Not even me.

328
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,503
Listen, we gotta get her out of there.

329
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,921
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now

330
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:26,176
will be to copy Sarah Connor and
wait for you to make contact with her.

331
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,217
Great. What happens to her?

332
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:31,172
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

333
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,349
Shit! Why didn't you tell
me? We gotta go right now!

334
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,677
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

335
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,888
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

336
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,609
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Damn it!

337
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,654
-Help! Help!
-This does not help our mission.

338
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,197
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

339
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:52,321
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

340
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:53,448
Let me go!

341
00:42:58,126 --> 00:43:01,745
-Why the hell did you do that?
-Because you told me to.

342
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,252
What?

343
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:13,054
You have to do what I say, huh?

344
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,349
That's one of my mission parameters.

345
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:20,137
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

346
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:23,690
Yes!

347
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,487
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

348
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:33,700
-You okay, kid?
-Take a hike, bozo.

349
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:38,326
-Let's get outta here, man.
-Fuck you, you little dipshit!

350
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:40,749
Dipshit?

351
00:43:42,795 --> 00:43:44,787
Put your leg down.

352
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:49,671
-Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
-Just trying to help this punk.

353
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,136
Grab this guy. I can't
believe he called me...

354
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:54,963
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

355
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:58,221
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

356
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,643
Get off me!

357
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,976
-No!

358
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:10,524
Put the gun down, now!

359
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,904
-Get outta here!
-Come on. Let's split!

360
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,749
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

361
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,952
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

362
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,836
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

363
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:33,260
You're not a Terminator
anymore, all right?

364
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,554
You got that?

365
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:38,098
You just can't go around killing people.

366
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,174
Why?

367
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,306
What do you mean, why? 'Cause you can't.

368
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:43,354
Why?

369
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:46,227
Because you just can't. Trust me on this.

370
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:55,740
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

371
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:59,366
And I order you to help me.

372
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,304
Hm!

373
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:26,137
Hi!

374
00:47:26,352 --> 00:47:30,392
-You have a Sarah Connor here?
-You're running late, aren't you?

375
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,848
They've been in there for an hour.

376
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,400
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

377
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:39,896
Oh, here come your friends now.

378
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,505
Well, that was productive.

379
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,963
-Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

380
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:47,714
How 'bout a beer?

381
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,344
Yeah, right!

382
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,876
-Hey, I got a full house.
-That's good, Lewis.

383
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,999
Must be my lucky day.

384
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,057
I think you're
right about number 24.

385
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,984
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

386
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:49,404
-Same time?
-Mm-hmm.

387
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,582
You!

388
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,714
You broke my arm.

389
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,512
There are 215 bones in the human body.

390
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:17,261
That's one. Now, don't move.

391
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,935
What are you gonna do?

392
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,607
Why do we stop now?

393
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,659
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna kill anyone, right?

394
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,327
-Right.
-Swear?

395
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:39,905
What?

396
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:43,124
Just put up your hand and
say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."

397
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:48,163
-I swear I will not kill anyone.
-All right. Let's go.

398
00:52:55,347 --> 00:52:59,091
Visiting hours is 10:00 to
4:00, Monday through Friday.

399
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:07,141
-What the hell are you doing?
-You son of a bitch! You shot me!

400
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,276
You crazy bastard!

401
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,817
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

402
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:22,113
He'll live.

403
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:38,964
Son of a bitch!

404
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,762
Let's try to remain calm.

405
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:43,895
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

406
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:45,891
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

407
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,358
-Open the door.
-It ain't gonna happen.

408
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,274
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

409
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,237
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.

410
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:53,780
I don't believe you can do it.

411
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,240
You're already dead, Silberman.

412
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:56,866
Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

413
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,569
-So don't fuck with me!
-Open the door. Open the door.

414
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:09,085
Back off!

415
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:10,582
Get back!

416
00:54:10,798 --> 00:54:12,848
I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!

417
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,004
Don't move!

418
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:20,305
-Drop the shit!
-Do it! Do it!

419
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:23,178
Get in the office. On
the floor, face down.

420
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,474
Not you!

421
00:54:24,686 --> 00:54:26,177
Open the door.

422
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,433
On the floor. Hold it
open. Face the wall!

423
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:50,160
Get her! Get her!

424
00:55:16,405 --> 00:55:17,941
Sarah!

425
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,990
-Hurry up! Open the door!
-The door's locked!

426
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:23,951
Let's go! Open it!

427
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:25,112
Get the other door!

428
00:55:26,582 --> 00:55:28,414
-She broke it off.
-Open it!

429
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,126
Let's go around! Come on! Move it!

430
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:02,819
No!

431
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:04,367
No!

432
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:09,414
-No!
-Mom, wait!

433
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:10,911
Mom!

434
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:20,087
-Come back here!
-No! No!

435
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:21,800
No!

436
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,503
-Help her!
-Wait here.

437
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:25,213
Hurry up!

438
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:27,389
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

439
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:28,682
Hold her.

440
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:31,931
He'll kill us all!

441
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:55,827
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

442
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,837
Come with me if you want to live.

443
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,303
It's okay, Mom. He's
here to help. It's okay.

444
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,196
Go.

445
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,064
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

446
00:58:21,006 --> 00:58:22,338
Get down.

447
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,647
No! Mom!

448
00:58:58,794 --> 00:59:00,160
Out of the car!

449
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:02,749
Right now!

450
00:59:27,572 --> 00:59:29,234
Go!

451
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:40,704
I'm out.

452
00:59:47,676 --> 00:59:49,417
-Come on.
-Here.

453
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:54,051
Reload.

454
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,982
Last one!

455
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:13,733
Hang on.

456
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,344
Ready!

457
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,275
John!

458
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:56,984
Here, drive.

459
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,800
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

460
01:01:52,884 --> 01:01:55,046
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

461
01:01:57,305 --> 01:02:00,594
-Can you even see anything?
-I see everything.

462
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,227
Cool.

463
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:10,520
Come here.

464
01:02:16,658 --> 01:02:18,274
I said I was okay.

465
01:02:19,244 --> 01:02:22,203
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

466
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:25,581
God damnit! You have
to be smarter than that.

467
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,217
You almost got yourself killed.

468
01:02:28,503 --> 01:02:30,085
What were you thinking?

469
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:33,623
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

470
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:35,174
Do you understand?

471
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,550
You're too important. Do you understand?

472
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,549
But...

473
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:48,979
I had to get you out
of that place. I'm sorry.

474
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:52,858
I didn't need your help. I
can take care of myself.

475
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,400
What's wrong with your eyes?

476
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,912
Nothing.

477
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,211
So, what's your story?

478
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:28,848
You okay?

479
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:30,475
Fine.

480
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,484
Say, that's a nice bike.

481
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:59,626
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

482
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,436
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

483
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,481
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

484
01:04:14,442 --> 01:04:19,403
I bet! Makes you a
more efficient killer, right?

485
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,650
Correct.

486
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,703
Does it hurt when you get shot?

487
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,125
I sense injuries. The
data could be called "pain".

488
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,626
John, help me with the light.

489
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,673
-Will these heal up?
-Yes.

490
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:44,299
Good. If you can't pass for a
human, you're not much good to us.

491
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,473
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

492
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:50,347
120 years with my existing power cell.

493
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:53,412
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with,

494
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,268
so you can be

495
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:00,854
you know, more human, and
not such a dork all the time?

496
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,950
My CPU is a neural net
processor, a learning computer.

497
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:10,872
The more contact I have
with humans, the more I learn.

498
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:12,698
Cool.

499
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:45,648
Are we learning yet?

500
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:01,630
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

501
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:07,385
Just head south.

502
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,396
Keep it under 65.

503
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,224
-We don't wanna be pulled over.
-Affirmative.

504
01:06:21,069 --> 01:06:25,939
No, no, no. You gotta
listen to the way people talk.

505
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:29,571
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

506
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:31,948
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

507
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:35,952
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

508
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:40,286
And if you want to shine them
on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

509
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,913
Hasta la vista, baby.

510
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,674
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

511
01:06:45,885 --> 01:06:48,673
And if someone gets
upset, you say, "Chill out."

512
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:53,303
-Or you can do combinations.
-Chill out, dick-wad.

513
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:56,139
That's great. See? You're getting it.

514
01:06:56,354 --> 01:06:58,266
<i>No problemo.</i>

515
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,783
Want some of my fries?

516
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:28,584
-Need any help?
-No.

517
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:32,171
-I got you!
-No, you didn't!

518
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,340
I did! I came round here and I got you!

519
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:38,098
No, you didn't!

520
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,097
We're not gonna make it, are we?

521
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:45,142
People, I mean.

522
01:07:48,156 --> 01:07:50,256
It's in your nature to
destroy yourselves.

523
01:07:51,326 --> 01:07:53,943
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

524
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:57,030
Break it up before
I wring both of your necks.

525
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:03,502
I need to know how Skynet
gets built, who's responsible.

526
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:07,172
The man most directly
responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.

527
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,208
Who is that?

528
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,927
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

529
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,466
Why him?

530
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:21,387
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary type of microprocessor.

531
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:25,391
-Go on. Then what?
-In three years,

532
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:29,160
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier of military computer systems.

533
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:32,881
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

534
01:08:33,034 --> 01:08:34,366
becoming fully unmanned.

535
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,695
Afterwards, they fly with a
perfect operational record.

536
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,281
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

537
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,789
The system goes
on-line on August 4, 1997.

538
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:46,916
Human decisions are
removed from strategic defense.

539
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:49,839
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

540
01:08:50,051 --> 01:08:54,216
It becomes self-aware at
02:14am Eastern time, August 29.

541
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,723
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

542
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,268
-Skynet fights back.
-Yes.

543
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:04,106
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

544
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:07,228
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

545
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,820
Because Skynet knows that
the Russian counterattack

546
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,754
will eliminate its enemies over here.

547
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,397
Jesus!

548
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:18,478
How much do you know about Dyson?

549
01:09:20,248 --> 01:09:21,989
I have detailed files.

550
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:25,117
I wanna know everything.

551
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:30,506
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

552
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,736
Wait in the car.

553
01:10:19,307 --> 01:10:21,173
Enrique!

554
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:23,725
Are you here?

555
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,210
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

556
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:48,706
And you... are always like a snake.

557
01:10:50,838 --> 01:10:52,938
It's great
to see you, Connor!

558
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:54,216
I told you I would be back.

559
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,008
I knew you
would. It's good to see you.

560
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,053
Jolanda!

561
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:01,471
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

562
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:04,800
-Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i>
-What's up?

563
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:06,854
Who's this big guy?

564
01:11:06,938 --> 01:11:11,899
He's cool, Enrique. He's
with me. He's, uh... Uncle Bob.

565
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,941
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

566
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,566
Uncle Bob, huh?

567
01:11:17,156 --> 01:11:19,648
Okay. Okay!

568
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:22,244
How are you?

569
01:11:22,328 --> 01:11:25,617
How are you? You've grown so much.

570
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:27,323
Drink?

571
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:32,870
Uncle Bob?

572
01:11:33,965 --> 01:11:37,959
Hey, Sarita! You're
pretty famous, all over the goddamn TV.

573
01:11:38,177 --> 01:11:40,715
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

574
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:43,638
Cops are
going nuts looking for you.

575
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:47,811
I just came for my stuff.

576
01:11:47,895 --> 01:11:50,353
I need clothes, food
and one of your trucks.

577
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:52,649
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

578
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:55,225
Now, Enrique!

579
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:00,068
-You two, you're on weapons detail.
-Come on. Let's go.

580
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,383
One thing about my mom

581
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:27,341
she always plans ahead.

582
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:38,860
Excellent.

583
01:12:49,707 --> 01:12:53,246
This is my best truck I got,
but the starter motor's gone.

584
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:55,248
You got time to change it out?

585
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:58,501
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till
dark to cross the border.

586
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:03,254
See, I grew up in places like this,

587
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,466
so I just thought
that's how people lived,

588
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:10,176
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.

589
01:13:15,066 --> 01:13:16,682
That's definitely you.

590
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:30,912
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks,

591
01:13:31,123 --> 01:13:34,787
but there was this one
guy, he was kinda cool.

592
01:13:35,002 --> 01:13:38,166
-He taught me engines.
-Hold here.

593
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:41,544
Mom screwed it up, of course.

594
01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:43,796
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day

595
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,378
and me being this world leader.

596
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:51,175
-That'd be all she wrote.
-Torque wrench, please.

597
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:54,685
Here.

598
01:13:55,731 --> 01:14:00,146
-I wish I could've met my real dad.
-You will.

599
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:04,947
Yeah, I guess. When
I'm, like, 45, I think.

600
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:09,406
I sent him back through time to 1984.

601
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,487
Man!

602
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:15,494
He hasn't even been born yet.

603
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,210
It messes with your head.

604
01:14:21,841 --> 01:14:24,458
-The other bolt.
-Oh. Here.

605
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:34,848
Mom and him were only
together for one night.

606
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:40,228
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

607
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:44,857
She denies it totally, of course, like
she got something stuck in her eye.

608
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,609
Why do you cry?

609
01:14:51,746 --> 01:14:53,533
-You mean people?
-Yeah.

610
01:14:53,748 --> 01:14:56,206
I don't know. We just cry.

611
01:14:57,168 --> 01:14:59,501
You know, when it hurts.

612
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:10,796
-Pain causes it?
-Uh... no. It's different.

613
01:15:11,015 --> 01:15:14,101
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

614
01:15:14,185 --> 01:15:15,596
-Get it?
-No.

615
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,561
All right, my man!

616
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:21,982
<i>-No problemo.</i>
-Give me five.

617
01:15:24,528 --> 01:15:26,440
Just put out your hand, like this.

618
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,533
All right! Now hit me. Give
me five. Do the same thing.

619
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,781
All right!

620
01:15:36,707 --> 01:15:39,040
Okay, that's good. Up high! High five!

621
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,285
Five low.

622
01:15:41,504 --> 01:15:42,995
Too slow.

623
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,292
I'm just kidding. One more time.

624
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,594
Good. Now try it. Good!

625
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:52,546
Now do me. Give me five.

626
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:56,258
<i>Watching John with the machine,</i>

627
01:15:56,477 --> 01:15:58,639
<i>it was suddenly so clear.</i>

628
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,813
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

629
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,688
<i>It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,</i>

630
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:09,317
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him</i>

631
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:11,832
<i>or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

632
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:17,579
<i>It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.</i>

633
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,383
<i>Of all the would-be fathers who
came and went over the years,</i>

634
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:26,880
<i>this thing, this machine, was
the only one who measured up.</i>

635
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:32,298
<i>In an insane world, it
was the sanest choice.</i>

636
01:17:05,337 --> 01:17:10,173
Come here, darling.

637
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:12,152
Hey, let's try this one.

638
01:18:17,534 --> 01:18:19,070
There we go.

639
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:07,852
She said you go
south with him like you planned.

640
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,929
-She'll meet you tomorrow.
-Mom!

641
01:20:11,148 --> 01:20:12,889
Mom, wait!

642
01:20:28,374 --> 01:20:30,081
"No fate".

643
01:20:31,418 --> 01:20:33,626
"No fate, but what we make."

644
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:37,414
My father told her this.

645
01:20:40,427 --> 01:20:45,013
I mean, I made him memorize it
in the future as a message to her.

646
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:51,432
Never mind. Now, okay,
the whole thing goes...

647
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:54,264
The future's not set.

648
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,897
There's no fate, but what
we make for ourselves.

649
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:02,607
-She intends to change the future.
-Yeah, I guess.

650
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,783
Oh, shit!

651
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,781
-Dyson.
-Yeah.

652
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,364
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

653
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,449
She's gonna blow him away.

654
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,535
Come on! Let's go!

655
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:17,416
Let's go! Come on!

656
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:31,176
-This is tactically dangerous.
-Drive faster.

657
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:35,139
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

658
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:39,852
-It might anticipate this move.
-I don't care. We gotta stop her.

659
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:42,437
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

660
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,363
I don't care!

661
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:46,362
Haven't you learned anything yet?

662
01:21:46,577 --> 01:21:49,027
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

663
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,504
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

664
01:21:57,588 --> 01:22:00,831
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

665
01:22:09,308 --> 01:22:11,516
Danny, your time is up!

666
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:14,515
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

667
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,465
Danny!

668
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:47,544
Ugh!

669
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:59,974
-Daddy!
-Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

670
01:23:01,693 --> 01:23:02,729
Miles?

671
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,901
Miles!

672
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,403
-Tarissa, run!
-Oh, my God!

673
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,538
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

674
01:23:19,753 --> 01:23:20,869
Run!

675
01:23:21,088 --> 01:23:22,704
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

676
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,150
-Daddy!
-Danny! Danny!

677
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:47,854
-Nobody fucking move!
-Don't hurt my daddy!

678
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:51,737
Get down on the floor,
bitch. Get down now!

679
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:53,693
Get out of the way.

680
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,494
Don't hurt him!

681
01:23:57,207 --> 01:23:58,743
Get on the floor now!

682
01:24:01,044 --> 01:24:03,502
Just let the boy go.

683
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:06,548
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

684
01:24:06,758 --> 01:24:09,216
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

685
01:24:09,428 --> 01:24:11,545
-It's all your fault!
-What?

686
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:13,755
I'm not gonna let you do it.

687
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:33,525
Shhh!

688
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:38,996
Shhh.

689
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:08,226
Shit! We're too late!

690
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:13,439
Check them.

691
01:25:17,162 --> 01:25:20,655
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

692
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:23,161
Look at me.

693
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:29,251
I almost... I almost...

694
01:25:39,059 --> 01:25:43,099
It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.
We'll figure something out. Okay?

695
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,397
I promise.

696
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:55,444
-You came here to stop me.
-Yeah, I did.

697
01:25:58,537 --> 01:26:00,324
I love you, John.

698
01:26:02,249 --> 01:26:04,332
I always have.

699
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,626
I know.

700
01:26:14,094 --> 01:26:16,131
Deep penetration.

701
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:19,676
No shattered bone.

702
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:22,679
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

703
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:36,777
-Who are you people?
-Show him.

704
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:44,118
Danny, I want you to come with
me right now. Show me your room.

705
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:00,297
Oh, God! No!

706
01:27:12,778 --> 01:27:15,065
Oh, my God!

707
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:25,822
Oh, my God.

708
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:28,499
Now, listen to me very carefully.

709
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:34,289
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

710
01:27:34,508 --> 01:27:38,548
<i>Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.</i>

711
01:27:38,762 --> 01:27:42,346
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

712
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:45,595
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

713
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:48,934
<i>It's not every day that you find out</i>

714
01:27:48,976 --> 01:27:51,848
<i>you're responsible
for three billion deaths.</i>

715
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,650
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

716
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:58,654
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

717
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:09,749
You're judging me on
things I haven't even done yet.

718
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:16,122
How were we supposed to know?

719
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:19,834
Yeah!

720
01:28:20,053 --> 01:28:21,544
Right.

721
01:28:22,472 --> 01:28:25,556
How were you supposed to know?

722
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:29,351
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

723
01:28:29,563 --> 01:28:33,773
Men like you thought it up.

724
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:40,609
You think you're so creative.

725
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:43,862
You don't know what it's
like to really create something,

726
01:28:44,077 --> 01:28:47,661
to create a life, to feel
it growing inside you.

727
01:28:47,873 --> 01:28:50,249
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

728
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,699
Mom!

729
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:56,288
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

730
01:28:56,506 --> 01:28:58,591
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

731
01:28:58,675 --> 01:29:00,382
But I thought...

732
01:29:01,595 --> 01:29:05,430
Aren't we changing things right
now, changing the way it goes?

733
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,179
That's right. There's no way I'm
gonna finish the new processor.

734
01:29:09,394 --> 01:29:12,057
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

735
01:29:12,272 --> 01:29:15,856
-I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
-That's not good enough.

736
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:19,060
-No one must follow your work.
-Right.

737
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:23,990
All right, then we have to
destroy all the stuff at the lab:

738
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,615
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

739
01:29:29,456 --> 01:29:32,290
Everything. I don't care.

740
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:35,127
The chip.

741
01:29:35,712 --> 01:29:37,380
-Do you know about the chip?
-What chip?

742
01:29:37,464 --> 01:29:39,090
They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

743
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:40,550
It must be from the other one like you.

744
01:29:40,634 --> 01:29:45,004
-The CPU from the first Terminator.
-Son of a bitch! I knew it!

745
01:29:45,221 --> 01:29:47,804
They told us not to
ask where they got it.

746
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:50,224
Those lying motherfuckers.

747
01:29:50,435 --> 01:29:52,228
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

748
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:56,014
I mean, it was smashed, it
didn't work, but it gave us ideas,

749
01:29:56,232 --> 01:29:59,100
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

750
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:03,355
All my work was based on it.

751
01:30:03,573 --> 01:30:05,235
It must be destroyed.

752
01:30:07,577 --> 01:30:10,536
Can you get us in? Past security?

753
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:13,660
I think so, yeah. When?

754
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:18,668
Now?

755
01:30:22,926 --> 01:30:25,589
<i>The future,
always so clear to me,</i>

756
01:30:25,804 --> 01:30:28,717
<i>had become like a
black highway at night.</i>

757
01:30:28,932 --> 01:30:34,473
<i>We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.</i>

758
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:14,426
Hi. Uh... Carl, right?

759
01:31:16,187 --> 01:31:18,356
Friends from out of
town. I just thought I'd...

760
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,273
Hi!

761
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,692
...take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.

762
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,940
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

763
01:31:25,155 --> 01:31:27,147
I need written authorization...

764
01:31:28,366 --> 01:31:32,076
-I insist.
-Don't even think about it.

765
01:31:43,048 --> 01:31:44,584
Come on. It's okay.

766
01:31:46,009 --> 01:31:49,303
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.

767
01:31:49,387 --> 01:31:52,050
The other one is in a
locker at the security station.

768
01:31:53,683 --> 01:31:54,924
Gibbons?

769
01:31:58,188 --> 01:32:02,853
Gibbons! Come on, man! You
can't leave the desk like that!

770
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,394
Gibbons!

771
01:32:07,906 --> 01:32:09,192
Oh, shit.

772
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:29,212
My card should access this.

773
01:32:32,931 --> 01:32:35,048
-What? What is it?
-Damn it.

774
01:32:36,309 --> 01:32:38,096
The silent alarm's been tripped.

775
01:32:44,234 --> 01:32:47,022
It's neutralized all the
codes in the entire building.

776
01:32:47,237 --> 01:32:50,821
Nothing will open anywhere
now. We have to abort.

777
01:32:52,075 --> 01:32:53,486
No.

778
01:32:55,203 --> 01:32:58,367
We go all the way. Okay?

779
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:04,331
You guys get started on
the lab. I can open this.

780
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:06,088
I think it's that guy from the mall.

781
01:33:06,172 --> 01:33:07,083
It is!

782
01:33:07,298 --> 01:33:09,460
It's him and the woman.

783
01:33:10,802 --> 01:33:13,636
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

784
01:33:16,224 --> 01:33:19,524
I have a personal entry
code for the lab. It may still work.

785
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:26,311
-It's no good.
-Let me try mine.

786
01:33:31,573 --> 01:33:33,530
John, fire in the hold!

787
01:33:45,712 --> 01:33:50,377
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

788
01:33:57,682 --> 01:34:00,015
You have to wait until the gas clears.

789
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:03,761
Put this on.

790
01:34:18,036 --> 01:34:20,278
All right, let's get to work.

791
01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:44,854
<i>All units in the
vicinity and all units able to respond,</i>

792
01:34:44,938 --> 01:34:48,227
<i>a 2-11 in progress
at 2144 Kramer Street,</i>

793
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:49,602
<i>the Cyberdyne building.</i>

794
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,479
<i>Suspect one is white female,</i>

795
01:34:51,694 --> 01:34:55,028
<i>identified as last name
Connor, first name Sarah.</i>

796
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,948
<i>Escaped last night from
Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

797
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,903
<i>Suspect two, white male
fitting description of the individual</i>

798
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:04,989
<i>wanted for the murder
of police officers in 1984.</i>

799
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:07,558
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely...</i>

800
01:35:59,512 --> 01:36:03,105
All right! 7-2-5-6.

801
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,511
Yes!

802
01:36:10,315 --> 01:36:11,601
Easy money.

803
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:17,736
Uh-oh.

804
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:22,737
Oh, shit! Not good.

805
01:36:22,952 --> 01:36:24,113
Not good!

806
01:36:27,957 --> 01:36:31,200
-How we doing?
-Primer cord is set.

807
01:36:31,419 --> 01:36:33,661
One more barrel, two more minutes.

808
01:36:35,715 --> 01:36:40,551
-How do we set them off?
-Remote control.

809
01:36:40,762 --> 01:36:43,004
Piece of cake.

810
01:36:43,222 --> 01:36:44,633
-We got company.
-Police?

811
01:36:44,849 --> 01:36:48,058
-How many?
-All of 'em, I think.

812
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,181
Go. I'll finish here.

813
01:36:51,647 --> 01:36:52,933
Come on.

814
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:57,314
-I'll take care of the police.
-Wait! You swore!

815
01:37:00,448 --> 01:37:01,689
Trust me.

816
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:16,995
<i>You at the window!</i>

817
01:37:17,215 --> 01:37:20,174
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

818
01:37:21,636 --> 01:37:24,925
-Holy shit!
-That's a damn mini-gun!

819
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:49,574
-Come on!
-Oh, shit!

820
01:37:49,789 --> 01:37:51,155
Go! Go! Go!

821
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,246
Fire!

822
01:38:57,565 --> 01:38:59,306
We go same time, to the left.

823
01:38:59,525 --> 01:39:02,108
One, two, three, go.

824
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,578
All right, in order to get
that out, you have to...

825
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,919
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

826
01:39:29,305 --> 01:39:30,637
Hold your fire!

827
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:58,532
-Ready to rock?
-Ready.

828
01:40:02,046 --> 01:40:04,663
Time to go. Now.

829
01:40:04,882 --> 01:40:07,670
-Take this. They'll use gas.
-Come on.

830
01:40:07,885 --> 01:40:10,844
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

831
01:40:35,454 --> 01:40:37,867
Mom! Mom!

832
01:41:15,828 --> 01:41:17,444
Aagh!

833
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:23,376
Shit!

834
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,788
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

835
01:41:37,975 --> 01:41:38,840
Get down!

836
01:41:46,108 --> 01:41:47,349
Here.

837
01:42:13,094 --> 01:42:15,882
I don't know how much
longer I can hold this.

838
01:42:20,726 --> 01:42:23,434
Fall back! Everybody out!

839
01:42:23,646 --> 01:42:25,387
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

840
01:43:01,559 --> 01:43:03,709
<i>We
got a war zone down here!</i>

841
01:43:35,217 --> 01:43:36,708
Shut your eyes.

842
01:43:43,184 --> 01:43:46,177
Stay here. I'll be back.

843
01:43:54,403 --> 01:43:56,315
Get down on the floor, face down!

844
01:43:59,575 --> 01:44:00,675
Down on the floor now!

845
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,452
Okay, drop him!

846
01:44:42,952 --> 01:44:44,159
Agh!

847
01:45:24,493 --> 01:45:26,234
Here, hold this.

848
01:45:38,549 --> 01:45:40,336
I think it's him!

849
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,177
Holy shit!

850
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:00,685
Go!

851
01:46:39,777 --> 01:46:40,858
Shit!

852
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:55,324
Get out.

853
01:46:57,795 --> 01:46:59,286
Aagh!

854
01:47:14,687 --> 01:47:18,476
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

855
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:20,102
-You got it?
-Yeah.

856
01:47:20,317 --> 01:47:21,808
All right.

857
01:47:36,041 --> 01:47:38,328
-Chopper's coming in!
-It's him.

858
01:48:36,268 --> 01:48:37,475
Yeah!

859
01:48:39,855 --> 01:48:41,517
John! Stay down!

860
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:08,631
-Aagh!
-Mom!

861
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:50,665
Hello?

862
01:49:56,765 --> 01:49:58,848
Goddamn! You all right...

863
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,357
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

864
01:50:10,863 --> 01:50:12,604
-Take the shotgun.
-Okay.

865
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,867
Are you hurt?

866
01:50:30,716 --> 01:50:34,505
-Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
-We need your truck.

867
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,053
Hurry!

868
01:50:41,226 --> 01:50:44,060
-Come on. Hurry.
-Get in.

869
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:47,806
Come on! Go!

870
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:55,813
What the hell...

871
01:51:02,289 --> 01:51:04,451
-I'm bleeding bad.
-Keep pressure on it.

872
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,746
Here. This'll work.

873
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:15,792
He's gaining.

874
01:51:17,763 --> 01:51:20,551
-Step on it!
-This is the vehicle's top speed.

875
01:51:20,766 --> 01:51:22,803
I can run faster than this!

876
01:51:33,153 --> 01:51:34,439
Coming up, to the right.

877
01:51:37,115 --> 01:51:38,447
Watch it! Watch it!

878
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:03,690
-Drive a minute.
-Where the hell are you going?

879
01:52:11,024 --> 01:52:12,560
Take the off-ramp.

880
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:23,452
Shit!

881
01:52:27,457 --> 01:52:28,322
Hold on!

882
01:53:14,338 --> 01:53:15,171
Don't stop!

883
01:53:23,889 --> 01:53:25,050
Go straight!

884
01:53:27,142 --> 01:53:28,599
-Look out!
-Duck!

885
01:53:43,867 --> 01:53:45,358
Get the hell outta here!

886
01:53:51,333 --> 01:53:53,996
Get outta here! Let's go!

887
01:55:11,204 --> 01:55:13,366
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

888
01:56:03,465 --> 01:56:04,665
We don't have much time.

889
01:56:27,531 --> 01:56:28,364
Let's go.

890
01:56:29,616 --> 01:56:31,284
Come on, Mom. We gotta get outta here.

891
01:56:31,368 --> 01:56:33,325
Come on! Get up!

892
01:56:47,217 --> 01:56:48,628
Hand me the shotgun.

893
01:56:53,598 --> 01:56:55,715
Put your weight on me, Mom.

894
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:58,426
Hurry!

895
01:57:02,148 --> 01:57:03,639
Come on, Mom.

896
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,448
-Agh!
-Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

897
01:57:27,632 --> 01:57:29,419
This way. Come on.

898
01:57:40,854 --> 01:57:43,392
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

899
01:57:43,607 --> 01:57:44,723
Go back.

900
01:57:53,074 --> 01:57:55,191
-Go. Run.
-No! We gotta stick together.

901
01:57:55,827 --> 01:57:57,284
John, you've got to go now.

902
01:57:57,495 --> 01:57:59,487
-John!
-Go! Now!

903
01:57:59,706 --> 01:58:01,038
No!

904
01:59:14,322 --> 01:59:15,938
Get up the steps.

905
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:19,112
Go on.

906
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:27,575
Come on, Mom. I got you. Come on.

907
01:59:53,194 --> 01:59:54,027
No!

908
02:00:02,245 --> 02:00:04,453
Grab the chain. Grab it.

909
02:00:05,832 --> 02:00:08,449
Grab it. Go. Go!

910
02:00:19,095 --> 02:00:22,088
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

911
02:00:22,307 --> 02:00:23,764
Come on!

912
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:28,640
Mom! Mom! Mom!

913
02:01:04,724 --> 02:01:06,135
Agh!

914
02:01:11,773 --> 02:01:12,684
Call to John.

915
02:01:14,692 --> 02:01:15,808
No!

916
02:01:16,361 --> 02:01:17,568
I know this hurts.

917
02:01:18,571 --> 02:01:21,029
-Ugh!
-Call John.

918
02:01:38,466 --> 02:01:40,378
Call to John now.

919
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:43,798
Fuck you!

920
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:59,160
John? John!

921
02:05:00,543 --> 02:05:02,751
John? Help!

922
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:06,872
John!

923
02:05:10,678 --> 02:05:12,340
John?

924
02:05:14,682 --> 02:05:16,014
John!

925
02:05:18,144 --> 02:05:19,351
John.

926
02:05:20,313 --> 02:05:21,804
John.

927
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,016
-Mom.
-Help me.

928
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:29,061
Help me.

929
02:05:30,615 --> 02:05:31,605
Help me.

930
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:33,074
Get out of the way, John.

931
02:05:33,159 --> 02:05:34,024
Shoot!

932
02:06:17,787 --> 02:06:19,198
Mom!

933
02:06:28,965 --> 02:06:30,422
Get down!

934
02:07:02,165 --> 02:07:03,622
No!

935
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,018
Get up. Come on.

936
02:08:09,232 --> 02:08:10,768
Holy shit!

937
02:08:10,983 --> 02:08:12,645
I need a vacation.

938
02:08:27,166 --> 02:08:30,830
-Is it dead?
-Terminated.

939
02:08:34,382 --> 02:08:35,964
Will this melt in there?

940
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:40,802
Yes. Throw it in.

941
02:08:45,685 --> 02:08:46,518
Adiós!

942
02:08:48,562 --> 02:08:50,724
And the chip.

943
02:09:05,204 --> 02:09:06,615
It's over.

944
02:09:09,166 --> 02:09:10,202
No.

945
02:09:13,754 --> 02:09:15,120
There's one more chip.

946
02:09:20,136 --> 02:09:22,093
And it must be destroyed also.

947
02:09:27,768 --> 02:09:29,134
Here.

948
02:09:29,353 --> 02:09:33,347
I cannot self-terminate. You
must lower me into the steel.

949
02:09:38,988 --> 02:09:40,524
No.

950
02:09:41,824 --> 02:09:42,657
No.

951
02:09:45,995 --> 02:09:48,362
-I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
-No!

952
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:50,573
No, it'll be okay. Stay with us.

953
02:09:50,791 --> 02:09:52,657
-It'll be okay.
-I have to go away.

954
02:09:52,877 --> 02:09:55,335
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

955
02:09:55,546 --> 02:09:58,289
-I must go away, John.
-No!

956
02:09:58,966 --> 02:10:00,047
No, wait.

957
02:10:00,259 --> 02:10:03,002
-You don't have to do this.
-I'm sorry.

958
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,217
No, don't do it! Don't go!

959
02:10:06,482 --> 02:10:08,218
It has to end here.

960
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:14,429
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

961
02:10:20,988 --> 02:10:22,729
I know now why you cry.

962
02:10:25,242 --> 02:10:27,404
But it's something I can never do.

963
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:04,112
Goodbye.

964
02:12:43,464 --> 02:12:45,831
