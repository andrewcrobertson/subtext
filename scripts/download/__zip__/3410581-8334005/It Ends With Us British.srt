3
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,239
Hey. Come here. I got you.

4
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,701
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, you're gonna be okay.

5
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,162
I'm so sorry
you couldn't be here, honey.

6
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,290
I don't know what we're gonna do.
What are we gonna do?

7
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,464
Okay.

8
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,924
Oh, God. We have to pick flowers.

9
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,133
We do, yeah.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,261
I can't believe we're picking flowers
for your father's funeral.

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,554
I know. I know.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,182
I don't know why you moved.
I don't understand it.

13
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,476
I mean, if I had
that job that you had--

14
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,062
Oh, boy,
I would've killed for that job.

15
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,899
I appreciate your support
and enthusiasm, Mom. I really do.

16
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,734
I love you.
I'm gonna go set my stuff down.

17
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,818
Okay.

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,654
- It's lilies.
- What?

19
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,781
The flowers for a funeral.
They're--

20
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,032
Oh, lilies.

21
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,118
I'm so...
I'm so glad you're home.

22
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,870
Me too.

23
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,296
He really loved you.

24
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,173
Who?

25
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,550
Your father.

26
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,138
I know. I...

27
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,389
Yeah, I know.

28
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,894
How's the eulogy coming, hon?

29
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:51,440
It is one of the most
beautiful things I've never written.

30
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,318
Just say five things
you loved about your father.

31
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,778
Mama, it's... it's not a grocery list.

32
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,072
Just five... five things.

33
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,366
Simple.

34
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,701
From the heart.

35
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,204
You're gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

36
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,582
We're here to honour

37
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,752
the prestigious,
generous Andrew Bloom.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,214
Deeply beloved mayor
of this fair town.

39
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,427
Husband of the highly adored
Jenny Bloom.

40
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,556
And father to
the wonderful and sweet Lily.

41
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,184
Lily, come on up
to the stage, darling.

42
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,237
Hello.
Thank you all for joining us.

43
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,368
In honour of my father's life,
I would like to share with you

44
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,828
the... the five things that
I love most about him.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,921
He...

46
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,525
I'm sorry.

47
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,997
It's a strong chair.

48
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,041
Is it?

49
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,629
I'm... I'm sorry.

50
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,965
It's... It's been a day.

51
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,555
Will you please
get down from there?

52
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,850
I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

53
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,935
It's making me nervous
sitting so close to the edge.

54
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,939
Please?

55
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,194
Cherry on top?

56
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,031
I'm okay.

57
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,534
You gotta be--

58
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,056
I once read that
maraschino cherries

59
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,434
stay in your stomach
for, like, seven years.

60
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,895
Or cause cancer. I forget which.

61
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,483
I didn't know that
about maraschino cherries.

62
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,612
Yeah, I may have made that up,

63
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,114
but they're pretty gross.

64
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,908
Yeah, they're definitely gross.

65
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,659
So, what happened?

66
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,536
Sorry?

67
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,915
What was that over--
I didn't mean to, but...

68
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,585
Was it a woman?

69
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,253
Or man? I--

70
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,924
It was a chair, wasn't it?

71
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
Yes.

72
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,597
So, what floor you live on?

73
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,765
You first.

74
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,227
Top floor, right next to
my sister and her husband.

75
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,897
What do you do for a living?

76
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,607
Neurosurgeon.

77
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,654
Is that funny?

78
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,865
- Jesus. You're serious.
- Yeah.

79
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,743
- Really?
- Wow.

80
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,912
Oh, my God.
Please. I'm so sorry.

81
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,873
No, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You've spent way too--

82
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,792
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,962
You've spent way too much time in school
to have me laughing like this.

84
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,505
I'm terrible. I'm sorry.

85
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,882
I... I thought you were a crypto bro.

86
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,884
- You thought I was a crypto bro?
- No, no, no.

87
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,969
Yeah, no, well, I don't know,

88
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,762
or like
a really expensive prostitute.

89
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,138
Well, I am expensive.

90
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,432
You can forget about
kissing on the mouth.

91
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,356
Why haven't I seen you before?

92
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,861
Well, mostly because I've never
required brain surgery.

93
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,697
But also
'cause I don't live here, so...

94
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,907
So, you just
broke into my building?

95
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,450
You have a really nice view.

96
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:37,828
I do.

97
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,793
What's your name?

98
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,628
Lily.

99
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,214
- You?
- Ryle.

100
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,424
Ryle what?

101
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,884
Kincaid.

102
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,594
You just made that up just now.

103
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,053
Why would I make up
my last name?

104
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,972
- Well, I mean-- Fine.
- What's your last name?

105
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,641
It's fine. We don't need to...
We don't need to do this.

106
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,852
- I'm just asking your last name.
- It was really nice meeting you.

107
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,187
- Thank you. Just be careful.
- Okay.

108
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,522
It would be courteous
to give me back your last name.

109
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,690
I'm not gonna stalk you.

110
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,026
No, it's just really--
It's sort of embarrassing.

111
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,110
What is it?

112
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,820
Bloom.

113
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,780
- Your name is Lily Bloom?
- Yes.

114
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,240
It... It actually gets worse.

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,242
- Yeah. Yeah, no. It... It does.
- No way. Not possible.

116
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,327
Than Lily Bloom?

117
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,494
I don't wanna talk about it,

118
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,829
'cause it's really
kind of embarrassing.

119
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,623
I'm obsessed with flowers. I--

120
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,917
And I'm about to open
my first flower shop.

121
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,001
Flower shop?

122
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,628
Yeah, it's a lifelong dream,
so...

123
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,594
Stop. I told you.

124
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,055
No, Lily Bloom the florist.

125
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,974
No, doesn't sound
made up at all.

126
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,893
Hey, you could always use your middle name

127
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,269
if it doesn't work out.

128
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,148
- No, Violet.
- Trust me.

129
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,399
- Petunia.
- No, stop.

130
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,484
Of the valley.

131
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,654
- Toadflax.
- Blossom.

132
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,489
Goddamn, your parents hate you.

133
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,616
Well, I mean,
we may never know for sure,

134
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,077
'cause my dad
died on Monday, so...

135
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,870
Yeah, that's actually
why I came up here,

136
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,956
to have a good cry and,

137
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,791
hopefully,
meet a wealthy neurosurgeon.

138
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,960
So...

139
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:10,796
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,676
I could've made it back,
you know,

141
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,761
to see him before he died,
but I...

142
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,058
I didn't.

143
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,854
Damn.

144
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
Yeah.

145
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,070
Well, you know, naked truths
aren't always pretty.

146
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,041
I watched
a little boy die tonight.

147
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,794
He was only six years old.

148
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,921
His brother found a gun
in his parents' bedroom,

149
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,424
and it went off by accident.

150
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,926
Tried everything.

151
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,682
No one should have to--

152
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,185
I can't imagine

153
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,187
what that's gonna do
to that little boy who lived.

154
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,817
Destroy him for life.
That's what it'll do.

155
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,074
All right, give me another one.

156
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,620
Naked truth. I like that.

157
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,249
- Go on.
- Okay.

158
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,877
I... I don't know...

159
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,176
The first guy
I had sex with was homeless.

160
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,260
Stop it.

161
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,429
Yeah, no, really.
In high school, yeah.

162
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,181
Tell me more.

163
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,307
I actually think we're supposed to say

164
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,476
"temporarily un-homed," or "displaced."

165
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,560
I shouldn't have said--

166
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,853
Now you're
avoiding the question.

167
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,188
I'm not.
There's nothing to tell.

168
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,314
I want the good stuff.

169
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,274
Okay, I was friends with
this boy named Atlas.

170
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:58,278
And he was
kind and incredibly capable

171
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,864
and, you know,
he just got a shit hand.

172
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,658
You're making me jealous
of a homeless man.

173
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,243
Oh, my.

174
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,245
Okay, that's enough. That's--

175
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,788
Your turn.

176
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,374
Oh, no, I think I'm done.
Can't top that.

177
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,459
That was
both sexy and disturbing.

178
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,712
Okay, just shock me. Say--
I mean, you can say anything.

179
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,005
I wanna have sex with you.

180
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,011
- What? I mean--
- You said to shock you.

181
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:24,847
What?

182
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,186
How many-- I'm sorry.

183
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,313
How many women
has this worked on?

184
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,857
I'm not a relationship person.

185
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,608
- Yeah, I gathered that.
- Never been good at them.

186
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,110
But how do you know

187
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,529
if you've never tried
having a relationship or carbs?

188
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,613
How do you know
it doesn't work for you?

189
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,073
Carbs? I never said I didn't eat carbs.

190
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,908
Come on, you don't look
like a reckless snacker.

191
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,993
Well, thank you.

192
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,412
Love isn't for me.

193
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,873
Lust is nice though.

194
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,252
- I feel like you're missing out.
- Am I?

195
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,882
You haven't
answered my question.

196
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,426
Forgot what the question was.

197
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,678
How many women
has this worked on?

198
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,015
All of them.

199
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,815
Well, I...

200
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,818
I can't-- I'm...

201
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,906
I'm gonna have
to break your record.

202
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,407
I'm the kind of girl
you take home to mama.

203
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,618
How far would you go?

204
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,791
I'm not sure.
I'm an unreliable narrator.

205
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,545
You could try me.

206
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,032
Too far?

207
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,535
No.

208
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,043
This?

209
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,004
Depends what happens next.

210
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,592
Shit.

211
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,472
Yeah.

212
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,809
No, I'm not supposed to--

213
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,106
Okay, prep the OR. Tell Tom he's cutting.

214
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,607
I'm gonna supervise.

215
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,109
All right, I'll be there in ten.

216
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,197
- Holy shit.
- I know. I'm sorry.

217
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,784
No, I mean, holy shit.
I... I... I just now realised

218
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,788
you're actually a neurosurgeon.

219
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,915
- I tried to warn you.
- No, congratulations.

220
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,667
- That's... That's amazing.
- Yeah.

221
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,670
I-- This is-- You know, I--

222
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,923
I'll see you around.

223
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,342
Will you?

224
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,428
No.

225
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,859
It was nice meeting you, Lily Blossom Bloom.

226
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,112
It was nice meeting you,
Ryle Siegfried Kincaid.

227
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,240
I like that.

228
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,611
Oh, shit.

229
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,178
Thank you.

230
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,281
Thank you.

231
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,200
I don't know
what you're talking about.

232
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,594
So, why are you at that house?

233
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,764
My mom kicked me out.

234
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:24,725
Why?

235
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,312
Because...

236
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,940
she likes dating guys
who beat the shit out of her.

237
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,779
What happened to your hand?

238
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,115
God, I can smell him from here.

239
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,744
It got in the way.

240
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,668
Look, my parents don't get
home from work till around 5:00,

241
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,214
so if you wanna shower or...

242
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,924
I don't know, wash clothes or--

243
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,717
- I don't mind.
- Yeah.

244
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,719
Sure.

245
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,348
Your enthusiasm's contagious.

246
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,609
<i>Did you feel the earthquake
this weekend?</i>

247
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,693
<i>Yeah!</i>

248
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,946
<i>- You did?
- Yeah!</i>

249
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,572
Hey.

250
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,908
Thanks for the clothes.

251
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,910
Yeah, of course.

252
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,079
My dad won't even
know they're gone.

253
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,498
He doesn't usually
wear jeans much, so...

254
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,506
My parents aren't gonna
be home for an hour or so,

255
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,967
if you wanna watch TV
or something.

256
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,277
So, what do you wanna do
after you graduate?

257
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,573
I'm... signed up to go to
basic training in May.

258
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,074
Basic training. What is--

259
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,660
In the Marines.

260
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,621
Wow.

261
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,301
I'm sorry. I'm--

262
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,262
I'm sorry.
It's just the... the clothes--

263
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,346
My dad's clothes,

264
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,140
they make you kind of
look like Ned Flanders a little.

265
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:33,187
Your clothes kind of
make you look like a carrot.

266
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,938
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

267
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,617
- Mom...
<i>- If it doesn't work out--</i>

268
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,327
Mom, you do know a challenge
only excites me.

269
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,870
<i>I... I... I said, "If."</i>

270
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,372
<i>"A flower sales statistic that
shocks many new store owners..."</i>

271
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,208
Mom, what makes you think
it's not gonna work out?

272
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,959
"...a whopping 45%
of all flowers die..."

273
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,044
<i>Mom.</i>

274
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,129
Mom, are you reading this
from Google?

275
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,589
Of course I am.
How would I know that?

276
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,883
I'm worried about you.
Google is worried about you.

277
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,760
Well, you're both too late.
I'm picking up the keys now.

278
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,886
<i>Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

279
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,888
<i>- I love you. You can do this.</i>
- Wait. Sir! Sir! Hi.

280
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,473
<i>- Make it bold and brave.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

281
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,433
You sound crazy.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

282
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,519
Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

283
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,355
- I... I just moved here.
- Okay, sweetheart. Good luck.

284
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,484
Thank you.

285
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:23,881
Hi.

286
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,761
- Hello.
- Hi.

287
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,514
- Sorry. Hi. Yeah. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

288
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,057
I can't--

289
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,934
- Oh, wait.
- I can't hear you. Hi.

290
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,103
Hi. Can I help you?

291
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,479
Can I help you?

292
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,606
Excuse me?

293
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,232
The "help wanted" sign
out front?

294
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,650
You have a "help wanted" sign
out front.

295
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,069
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't put that out there.

296
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,530
- I just, yeah, got this place.
- I figured. It's pretty old.

297
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,907
And I walk by this place
every day,

298
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,491
and I'm just obsessed with it.

299
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,910
I've always wanted
to see inside,

300
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,746
and I was wondering, like,
"Who's gonna come along?"

301
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,789
- And it's you, yeah?
- No, it's me. Yeah, hi.

302
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,625
- Are you the owner?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm Lily.

303
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,751
- Allysa.
- Nice to meet you.

304
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:04,296
Sorry. Disgusting.
Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

305
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,674
Well, yeah,
are you looking for any help?

306
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,219
Well, I'm not hiring just yet.

307
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,179
I just... I just got the keys
a few days ago,

308
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,263
and I'm still sort of, you know,

309
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,266
figuring out
what I'm doing, so--

310
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,228
May I just ask,
what is this place going to be?

311
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,354
A flower shop.

312
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:24,942
I'm so sorry.

313
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,277
I have an issue with--

314
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,988
My face says it all.
I just hate flowers.

315
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,323
You hate flowers?

316
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,699
- I do.
- Okay.

317
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,077
Like, why don't you just
give me something that's living

318
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,120
rather than something
that's on its way to dying?

319
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,288
And then it's gonna create
more work for me,

320
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,748
and I'm gonna
have to deal with that,

321
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,459
but again,
it's a solo perspective.

322
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,504
It's-- I find flower shops
depressing. It's just me.

323
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,256
I do wish you luck.
I'm so sorry.

324
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,258
I agree. I find them depressing.

325
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,843
Because I feel like...

326
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,221
I don't know, it's like
the beauty of what a flower is--

327
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,305
This is ridiculous.

328
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:59,017
The beauty of what a flower is
has been lost, right? It's... It's...

329
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,520
It's like we order them
like takeout now-- It's... It's...

330
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,604
- Yes.
- Right?

331
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,147
It's what you're talking about.

332
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,234
It's highlighting the pain
and the tension and the--

333
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,820
You know,
the fact that it's fleeting

334
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,321
and it's storytelling and--

335
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,781
I don't know,

336
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,283
that's actually what I find
beautiful about it, and--

337
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,909
That's what I'm
trying to do here, so--

338
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,537
That's absolutely beautiful. I'm--

339
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:22,165
If that's what you're doing,
yeah, sign me up. Wonderful.

340
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,500
Thanks, thanks.

341
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,169
Well...

342
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:27,504
Yeah, I really do
wish you the best...

343
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,630
Thank you.

344
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,092
...and I'll just be lurking
around in the neighbourhood.

345
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,594
Hopefully, I made
my first customer.

346
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:36,388
- Yeah. Yeah. Great. It's so gorgeous.
- Hope to see you--

347
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,182
Yeah. Bye.

348
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,059
Hey, I...

349
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,770
I don't know, this--

350
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,274
I do need help.
Do you want a job?

351
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,984
This is exactly what I wanted

352
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,319
to happen to me
when I walked in here.

353
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,071
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Okay.

354
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,489
- Wonderful. Great.
- Okay.

355
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,699
I have to be out
by 5:00 p.m. tonight.

356
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,783
I do have a dinner.

357
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,118
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

358
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,038
I just started working here.

359
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,290
- Okay, perfect.
- Great.

360
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,334
I'm gonna just need to wipe off
a surface for this girl.

361
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,627
Here. There you go.

362
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,837
- That's--
- Thank you so much.

363
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,256
It's a real <i>Ghostbusters</i>
situation in here, huh?

364
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,427
Hey. Frame it.

365
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,765
Did you see that?

366
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,476
Oh, my God. It's still attached.

367
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,019
Oh, God, I can't watch.

368
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,318
Yeah. Yeah.

369
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:55,759
You're like Dr Frankenstein,
but with flowers.

370
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,470
Okay. No, no, no.
We got it. We got it. We got it.

371
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,264
I don't have it. Hold on.

372
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,349
- Okay, here. Here we go.
- Hold on. My husband's calling.

373
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,517
Can I ask him to help us?

374
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,810
- Yes. No, please. Genius.
- Or is that weak?

375
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,103
- You got it?
- Nope.

376
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,312
- <i>Babe.
-</i> Not at all.

377
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,147
<i>- Babe, the game's over. Where you at?
-</i> Hi, honey<i>. Sweetheart.</i>

378
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,858
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at the shop with my boss.

379
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,609
And we need some help
hanging something up.

380
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,735
<i>I don't like
when you say "boss."</i>

381
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:14,820
- Babe.
<i>- You should be the boss.</i>

382
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,613
<i>Let's buy the place
and make you the boss.</i>

383
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,990
Honey, you're on speaker.

384
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,241
- Yeah. Just--
<i>- Hi.</i>

385
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:20,325
- Just--
- Hi.

386
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,661
I want you to know that they're
gonna be wearing onesies.

387
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,787
Because the bar gives free beer
to the people...

388
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,872
<i>I can see you.</i>

389
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,331
...who wear onesies
to the Bruins game,

390
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,624
but they don't always wear that.

391
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,418
<i>- I'm across the street.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,420
<i>Oh, my God,
babe, you are stunning.</i>

393
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,921
Can you bring my brother in too?

394
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,673
Okay, I can't take responsibility

395
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:35,757
for either of the people

396
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,718
who are about to come in here,
just so you know.

397
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,887
- Hi.
- Hi.

398
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:42,723
You look great.

399
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,850
- This is Lily.
- Hi. Lily. Hi. Nice to meet you.

400
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,060
- This is my husband, Marshall.
- I didn't mean the boss thing.

401
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,395
That's my brother Ryle.

402
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,197
Hi. Hi.

403
00:28:58,864 --> 00:28:59,865
- Hi.
- Lily.

404
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,200
Lily Bloom.

405
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,409
Yes. Yes.

406
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,745
- You guys know each other?
- No.

407
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,079
- A little bit.
- No, we--

408
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,706
We met a few months ago.

409
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,083
We shared each other's
naked truths.

410
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,002
- That's-- Okay.
- No, that's--

411
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,086
We're adults.

412
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,922
- That was a bad choice of words.
- You said it.

413
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:17,007
You said "naked truths" first.

414
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,134
- No, we just talked.
- You're lying.

415
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,053
That's what we're calling it
these days, "We talked"?

416
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:23,138
- 'Cause we talk all the time.
- Great.

417
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,431
We talk, like...
We talk, like, three to five times a week.

418
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,516
Wonderful.

419
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,518
Can I show you
the work that I've done here?

420
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:28,602
We should talk?
We can talk tonight.

421
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,811
No, we could hang this.

422
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,938
No, let me take you over here.

423
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,022
Let me talk to your sister
over here.

424
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,983
- Okay.
- I mean, it is really good.

425
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:39,613
We meet again.

426
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,490
It's good to see you.

427
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,076
So, this is the flower shop

428
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,495
that my sister works at
'cause she's bored, huh?

429
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:49,331
We like to say "inspired" here,

430
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,792
but, yeah, this is--

431
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,502
You know, I-- Yeah.

432
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:56,046
Yeah.

433
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,675
Looks like we will be seeing

434
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,593
a little more of
each other then.

435
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,011
Is that so?

436
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:04,388
Babe, these are incredible.

437
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,973
Thank you very much.

438
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,726
You're even more terrifying
in the daytime.

439
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:10,894
Same.

440
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,604
Okay, guys, idea.

441
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,149
Let's go have
some dumb fun today.

442
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,537
I've gone up
to the roof a few times.

443
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,122
Hoping you might be up there.

444
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,292
<i>I wanna see you again.</i>

445
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,424
Well, now you see me.

446
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,302
You know what I mean.

447
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:47,973
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

448
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,560
But that's a bad idea, right?

449
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,313
Because of my sister,
because of your business.

450
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,731
Go, Lily!

451
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,232
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

452
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,776
Yep. Of course.
This is you right here, babe.

453
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,242
No. Hey.

454
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,952
She's off-limits.
No, she's mine.

455
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,037
I see you.

456
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,080
- Hey.
- It's true.

457
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,832
So, we'll just be friends then?

458
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,417
I like it.

459
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,421
Yeah, friends.

460
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,635
- To friendship.
- Yeah.

461
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,057
It's the weekend somewhere.
Let's go.

462
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,309
Oh, no. Please don't leave, sir.
Our Uber's about to leave.

463
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,894
I love you.
I'm gonna head home, honey.

464
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,771
No. no, no. It's brunch in Singapore.
Come on, Lily.

465
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,564
- Let me walk you home.
- No, it's fine.

466
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,483
- I... I live around the corner.
- It's on the way.

467
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,944
- You live where we live.
- Semantics.

468
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:43,028
Okay, fine, but only 'cause

469
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:44,446
you'd feel really bad
if I got murdered.

470
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,698
Okay, don't fish
where I swim, Ryle.

471
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,450
I love you.
See you tomorrow, Lil.

472
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,495
I appreciate you walking me,
but you really didn't--

473
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,038
I can't stop thinking about you.

474
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,624
I'm right here.

475
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,545
Well, that's the problem.

476
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,799
I thought we agreed
to be friends.

477
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,259
We did.

478
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,136
But that was, like, hours ago.

479
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:12,349
Can I just kiss you?

480
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,310
- Oh, my God. You are pushy.
- Just once. Just once.

481
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,229
That's all I need
to get you out of my system.

482
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,730
- That's it? That'll do it?
- One kiss.

483
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,858
Okay, well, good luck with that.

484
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:21,942
Is that a yes?

485
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:24,736
Just once?

486
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,780
Just once.

487
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,328
Okay.

488
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,168
Okay.

489
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,816
Did that get me
out of your system?

490
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,071
I'm gonna walk
myself home, okay?

491
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,157
Bye, friend.

492
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,088
<i>- Is this enough over here?
- Yeah.</i>

493
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,173
Can you grab, like,
a little right there?

494
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,257
Okay.

495
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,759
You're just protecting the roots,
you know, from the snow

496
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,261
or in case it freezes over or anything.

497
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,972
I mean, the roots are the most
important part of the plant.

498
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,516
- Really?
- Yeah.

499
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,684
I didn't know that about roots.
That's cool.

500
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:39,770
Here, you want some?

501
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,191
Thank you. Yeah, I'll take that.

502
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,443
What made you wanna
start growing things?

503
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,738
When I take really good care
of these plants,

504
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,658
they reward me
with flowers and vegetables.

505
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:55,577
And when I don't,
they just shrivel up and die.

506
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:57,788
Kinda like us.

507
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,007
What about that oak tree?

508
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,719
It doesn't need anybody to grow.

509
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,429
Because it's capable
of taking care of itself.

510
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,600
No matter what,
it will keep standing.

511
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,893
Strong and sturdy...

512
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,483
and yeah, it survives
because it's a goddamn oak tree.

513
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,179
You embarrassed me.

514
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,391
- You like the attention.
- Lily's asleep upstairs.

515
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,437
Honey, please. Please, don't!

516
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,523
I heard what happened
last night...

517
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,402
with your dad and your mom.

518
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,239
I don't-- Okay, yeah.

519
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,950
Does that happen a lot?

520
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,174
I'm sorry.

521
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,317
Hey, Lily.

522
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,903
Do you wanna do the honours?

523
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,656
No. You go ahead.
I wanna take it in from here.

524
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,200
I was hoping you'd say that.
Okay.

525
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,496
Okay.

526
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,747
Hold on!

527
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,627
Oh, my God.

528
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,630
- This is insane.
- Congratulations.

529
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,590
I couldn't have
done it without you.

530
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,675
Oh, my gosh.

531
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,219
I don't know what
I was thinking. Thank God.

532
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,179
It's incredible.

533
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,558
It's perfect. It's you.
It's perfect. It's great.

534
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,309
What if we don't
get any customers?

535
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,311
No, don't do that.
Your mom's coming.

536
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,396
Oh, my mom.

537
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,564
She's flying in
to be a customer.

538
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,732
Yeah, I mean-- Yeah, but how
depressing would that be

539
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,901
if the only customer
we have is my mom?

540
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,444
Well, Marshall's coming
this afternoon.

541
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,280
So that's two, so you're good.

542
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,493
Okay, here we go.

543
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,538
- Wow.
- Yeah.

544
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,666
This doesn't even look like
the same shop. Congratulations.

545
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,001
How's it going so far?

546
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,587
I mean, we literally
just opened, but--

547
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:55,465
So, that means your brother's
the first official customer?

548
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,801
You have to buy something
to be considered a customer.

549
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,761
Right now you're just loitering.

550
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,638
Good morning, Lily.

551
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:02,890
Good morning.

552
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,684
All right. I'll take these.

553
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,353
Do you deliver?

554
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,441
- Is that for a girl?
- It is.

555
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,234
She might send them back,
knowing her.

556
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,112
Right. Okay.

557
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,156
That little card, fill out
the message on the front

558
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,241
and then the back you put the
person's name and the address.

559
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,367
Okay.

560
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,869
So, are you bringing
this mystery girl

561
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,245
to my birthday party on Friday?

562
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,040
'Cause I kind of, like, need to
plan for that sort of thing.

563
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,334
I don't know.
Are you going, Lily?

564
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:32,669
Yeah, of course.

565
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,921
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

566
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,797
She has to go.
She's my best friend.

567
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,718
- All right.
- Thank you.

568
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,598
- What do I owe you?
- Fifty-one even.

569
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:46,850
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

570
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,352
- This is a big moment.
- Sure is.

571
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,772
Thank you so much
for your service-- business.

572
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:54,233
Thank you. Yeah.

573
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,276
Hey, congrats.

574
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,986
Get out. Thank you.

575
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,155
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

576
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,365
Goodbye.

577
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,827
Oh, my God. He's such a dumbass.

578
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:10,415
He put the name of our shop
as the delivery address.

579
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,043
Weird first customer.

580
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,324
Lily.

581
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,452
- Hello. Happy birthday.
- Oh, my goodness.

582
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,788
- You came. You look great.
- I missed something important.

583
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,207
- What is everything?
- This is my-- It's a long story.

584
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,750
Welcome to our casa.

585
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,669
You guys, this-- I mean, your house--
This is...

586
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,172
- I can't believe this is your house.
- This is our humble abode.

587
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,424
I just wanted to do something low-key
for baby girl over here.

588
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:01,508
Oh, my God.

589
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,678
And to think I did not even
marry him for the money.

590
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,263
- You're not in it for the money.
- I'm not.

591
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,639
- You're my ride or die.
- Yeah.

592
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,517
When we first met I was dead broke,
and I was driving a Toyota Camry.

593
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,811
You still drive a Toyota Camry though.
Right?

594
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:15,189
- The greatest automobile on earth.
- Yes, he does. Also...

595
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,899
Can't convince me otherwise.

596
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,692
He thinks it makes him relatable.

597
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,278
- It really does.
- I'm a man of the people, okay?

598
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,988
Happy birthday. I'm gonna go grab a drink.

599
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,823
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thank you. Okay.

600
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,701
Yeah, you are a man of the people.

601
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

602
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,676
You didn't like the flowers?

603
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,053
Stop flirting with me.

604
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,223
Hi, may I have a scotch please? Thank you.

605
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,350
I can't do that.

606
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,355
I thought we were friends.

607
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:57,439
We are friends.

608
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,027
Okay.

609
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,446
Excuse me. You're on my hand. Thank you.

610
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,544
- Hi.
- Come on.

611
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,587
- What?
- What are you doing?

612
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,131
Nothing.

613
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,884
You gotta... You gotta stop.
You have to stop this.

614
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,428
- Please.
- What?

615
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,266
Just the, you know, staring at me
like that and the--

616
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,392
I'm just looking at you.

617
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,727
Okay. You're just looking at me.

618
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:37,354
Stop showing up at my flower shop

619
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,189
- and sending me flowers.
- My sister works there.

620
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:42,067
Stop walking through this party,
following me around.

621
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,570
- You're making me feel like--
- Can you just shut up for one second?

622
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,155
Okay.

623
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,449
I like you.

624
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,159
What, are you five?

625
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,206
I'm trying here.

626
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,333
Go on.

627
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:11,430
Do you wanna go somewhere more private?

628
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,349
To talk?

629
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:18,854
To talk.

630
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:21,064
Okay.

631
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,253
No. No, no, no, stop.

632
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,006
You want me to stop?

633
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,885
No.

634
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:52,429
No.

635
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,267
But yes. I don't wanna have sex.
Not tonight.

636
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,853
I know, I know.

637
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:04,149
But I don't do casual,
and I know that's how you do it,

638
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:07,194
but I won't change my mind.
And I'm sorry.

639
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,655
I can't do this.

640
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,749
You okay? What are you doing?

641
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,335
Getting ready for bed.

642
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:24,837
We're going to sleep.

643
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,840
Sorry, we're what?

644
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,342
Going to sleep.

645
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,720
My God.

646
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,473
Do you mind?

647
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,105
Well, do you have something I can wear?

648
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,193
I don't think you've
ever done this before.

649
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:30,694
It was sexier in my head.

650
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,533
Pants?

651
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,306
You've got it.

652
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:09,316
Smart-ass.

653
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,749
Good night, Lily Bloom.

654
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:52,317
Ryle, I'm very nice,
so I brought you coffee.

655
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,572
- Hi.
- No.

656
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,657
Oh, no.

657
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,327
I understand. It's not as bad as it looks.

658
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,246
- It looks pretty bad.
- It kind of is.

659
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:07,583
Okay. None of my business. Okay.

660
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:11,003
What-- I'm... I'm gonna go.

661
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,672
Let me just say one thing.

662
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:17,718
This man runs through women like candy.

663
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,720
- This is different.
- Is it? Wonderful.

664
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,889
Well, just in case it obviously is not,

665
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:26,476
let me say that if you're looking for
nothing from him, that's a great option.

666
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,561
Okay.

667
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,939
But if you're looking for romance
and you want a relationship,

668
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,442
this is not the person,
and it's not about you.

669
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,526
And I love you.

670
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:35,861
- Yeah.
- But let me just say--

671
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:36,945
Date me.

672
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:39,656
What?

673
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,283
Date me.

674
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:42,993
I've-- I don't--

675
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,664
What... What does that mean? I--

676
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:50,000
Okay, no. I'm gonna leave.

677
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,880
And I'm so sorry,
but I was just bringing coffee,

678
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,841
and now, I'm so embarrassed.

679
00:45:58,509 --> 00:45:59,635
You can't have any of that.

680
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,053
That's for you.

681
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:02,804
I'm outta here.

682
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:06,141
A normal person would just leave
and go to therapy.

683
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,771
What are you talking about?

684
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,065
<i>I wanna try.</i>

685
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:21,406
<i>I wanna try.</i>

686
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,870
<i>Come on. You think you can do this?</i>

687
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,463
<i>I have no idea.</i>

688
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,098
<i>But I definitely wanna kiss you again.</i>

689
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,517
<i>Well, that I can do.</i>

690
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:53,897
<i>Okay.</i>

691
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,400
<i>But don't make me regret this.</i>

692
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,538
Hey.

693
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,089
Good morning.

694
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:48,971
You've already brushed your teeth.
That's not fair.

695
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,474
So sorry. I gotta go in early.

696
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,268
Am I gonna see you tonight?

697
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,649
No. Not tonight. My mom's in town.

698
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:03,235
She's obsessed with trying
this new restaurant, Root.

699
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:05,195
It's her dying wish to take me there.

700
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:06,405
Your mom's in town?

701
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:10,576
Yeah. Yeah, no, she's not actually dying.

702
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:13,954
- It's-- I was just saying that.
- It's just, you didn't...

703
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,123
You didn't tell me that.

704
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,211
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd wanna know.

705
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:23,547
Is there room for one more?

706
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:26,842
What?

707
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,719
Wait, you wanna meet my mom?

708
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:29,803
Is that a problem?

709
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:32,181
I mean, I don't think it's a good idea.

710
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,350
- Ouch.
- No.

711
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,102
No. I mean--

712
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,730
It's not because of you.

713
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,481
It is because of her. This woman--

714
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,067
I just wanna meet the mother
of the woman I love.

715
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,545
Hey!

716
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:07,257
Hey. Sorry, you forgot this. Bye.

717
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,552
Wait, wait, this isn't mine.

718
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,387
I know.

719
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,600
I happen to love you too.

720
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,777
You're gonna be late.

721
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:29,029
Get over me, my gosh!

722
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:30,948
I'm taken!

723
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,346
Did you make this?

724
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:55,973
Yeah.

725
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:59,309
Carved it from a branch
from your old oak tree.

726
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,395
In case you forget.

727
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:04,731
Strong and sturdy.

728
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,194
Thank you.

729
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:24,543
Gross. I bet she has rabies now.

730
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,008
Get up.

731
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:34,469
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- Stop. No, no.

732
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,221
Come on.

733
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,201
Do you like to cook?

734
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,036
Yeah. I love it.

735
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:01,330
Necessity is the mother of invention.

736
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,499
Smells great. What is it?

737
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:08,170
Hot chocolate cookies.
Dark chocolate with burnt marshmallows.

738
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:09,963
That's good.

739
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:13,300
My mom would splurge on
Swiss Miss for us at Christmas.

740
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:14,593
That was her favourite.

741
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:26,063
So, did you... did you kiss me earlier
because you really wanted to,

742
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,650
or was it mostly just to
get back at Katie?

743
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:33,612
I just--

744
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,949
I really need some clarity here.

745
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:46,875
I wanted to.

746
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,641
That's my dad.

747
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,101
- That is my dad. You have to go.
- What?

748
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:06,270
- You... You have to go right now.
- Don't forget the cookies.

749
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,813
Okay. Okay. I got it. You gotta go right now.

750
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,648
- Out the back door. Please, go.
- Twelve minutes, okay?

751
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,108
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

752
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:17,990
- Hey!
- Hi!

753
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,408
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

754
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,243
- You all right? How was your day? Good?
- Yeah.

755
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:22,327
Yeah, great.

756
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:23,954
Good. Busy?

757
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,247
Yeah...

758
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:26,999
Busy's good.

759
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:32,838
I made cookies.

760
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:35,132
Yep.

761
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:36,967
- Yeah, I'm starting to--
- Wow.

762
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:38,677
Pigs are flying.

763
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:39,761
Yeah.

764
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,514
Wish I didn't love you so much.

765
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:43,891
Yeah, same.

766
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,143
Okay. You gonna save me some?

767
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:47,436
- Yeah, of course.
- You promise?

768
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:48,979
Yeah, I promise you.

769
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,068
- My goodness.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

770
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:56,612
- Hi. We're just meeting her.
- Yeah, sure.

771
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:59,198
- Yeah. I am sorry in advance.
- No.

772
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:00,449
Yeah, no, no. Prepare yourself.

773
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:01,533
Hi! Hi, Mama!

774
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,244
- I love this place!
- It's beautiful, right?

775
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,205
Oh, my God! It looks beautiful.

776
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,415
- Let's order cocktails.
- Let's. Yes. Yeah.

777
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

778
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,837
Mom, this is... this is my friend, Ryle,
yeah, who I now sleep with. So--

779
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:17,591
- Ryle Kincaid. Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- It's so nice to meet you.

780
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,010
- You know you said that out loud?
- I do know I said that out loud.

781
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,970
Allysa, you know, who I work with?

782
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,180
This is her brother.

783
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,766
- Yes! Now I see a resemblance, sure.
- Yeah.

784
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:29,228
- Well, we both favour our mother.
- Here it goes.

785
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:31,772
That's what everybody says
about me and Lily.

786
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,440
You know, I see it.

787
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,525
Yes.

788
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:36,652
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

789
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,613
- How lucky are you, Lily?
- The luckiest.

790
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:40,989
How lucky am I?

791
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,407
Oh, my God.

792
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,827
Would you excuse me? I have a thing.
I like to wash my hands a lot and--

793
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:47,246
- Give me one--
- Get out of here.

794
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:48,622
- I will. All right. All right. Bye-bye.
- Leave us be.

795
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:55,963
- Oh, my God.
- Mom, you know, we don't need to do that.

796
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:59,383
You never told me you were dating
the most beautiful man.

797
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,802
He's got a good personality
to make up for it, though, so--

798
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:03,595
Okay. Okay. Okay.

799
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:04,972
Who is he? Where's he work?

800
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,974
- Don't do that. Don't.
- What does he do? Don't do what?

801
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,976
Hey, I am-- I'm your mother.

802
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,144
Boston Grace Hospital.

803
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,146
- Oh, no.
- Stop.

804
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,773
- Welcome to Root.
- No, please, don't.

805
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:17,442
- Can I get you something to drink?
- God. Please. Thank you. I need alcohol.

806
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:20,654
I would like to try a negroni.
I hear they're delicious.

807
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:22,781
- They are. I'll get you a negroni.
- Thank you.

808
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,241
And what can I get you?

809
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,679
I'll-- Surprise me.

810
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:54,479
So, what'd I miss?

811
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,398
Are you by any chance a doctor?

812
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:59,943
I am. I'm actually gonna be performing
a once-in-a-lifetime operation soon.

813
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:02,196
Oh, my Lord. Is it dangerous?

814
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,864
It's a risky surgery.

815
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,950
It's amazing though. He's amazing.

816
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,035
They're five years old.

817
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,203
Thank you so much.

818
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,795
So tell me about Boston.

819
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:21,757
They were the best years of my life.

820
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,886
- The food is really amazing there...
- Yeah?

821
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:27,262
...and the harbour.

822
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:29,640
My uncle would take me
fishing there sometimes.

823
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,600
Sounds like you miss it.

824
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:33,310
Yeah.

825
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,771
I'm gonna move there after the Marines.

826
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,524
Everything's better in Boston.

827
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:42,319
Except the girls.

828
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,489
Boston doesn't have you.

829
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,328
I'm gonna miss you.

830
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:55,874
Same.

831
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:59,044
I don't know how you did it.

832
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,423
But somehow,
you became my favourite person.

833
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:09,596
Same.

834
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:30,367
Hey.

835
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,451
What?

836
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,078
Are you sure?

837
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,247
Yeah. Yeah.

838
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:50,929
I don't have a condom.

839
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,390
- I have one.
- You do?

840
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,934
It's health class.

841
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,316
I've... I've never done this before.

842
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,694
- It's okay. I'm no expert.
- Okay.

843
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,905
- I've only done it once.
- Okay.

844
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,489
- Okay.
- Okay.

845
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,999
I've been studying them since they
were born, since I've been a resident--

846
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:21,251
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

847
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,961
- Okay, honey. Okay.
- Yeah.

848
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:25,589
You get to know each other.
I'll be right back.

849
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:50,155
Lily Bloom.

850
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:53,534
Atlas.

851
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:58,539
You look--

852
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,624
Yeah, you-- You... You...

853
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:01,917
God, thank you.

854
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,419
I mean, my mom didn't recognise you, so--

855
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:08,549
- It's probably for the best.
- God, right? Yeah.

856
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,386
What have you been up to?

857
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,304
Just working. Living.

858
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:15,389
Yeah, same.

859
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:18,809
Yeah. Did you go to the military or what--

860
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:21,728
Yeah, yeah. No, I did... I did eight--
Yeah, eight years.

861
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:23,897
- Wow.
- Yeah. I got out and moved to Boston.

862
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:25,983
What are--

863
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:29,361
What are...
What are you doing in... in Boston?

864
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,572
Are you... You visiting here, or--

865
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:32,781
I live here.

866
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,579
Yeah. Where everything's better.

867
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:44,501
Is that your-- your guy?

868
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:48,881
Yeah, that's... That's Ryle.
He's, yeah, he's... he's really special.

869
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:50,424
I think you'd really like him.

870
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:52,634
- I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah, thank you.

871
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,803
Do you have anyone, or are you married?

872
00:59:54,803 --> 00:59:57,806
Or do you have a girlfriend
or, you know, anything?

873
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,266
- Yeah. I got Cassie.
- Yeah?

874
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:00,350
Yeah, she's great.

875
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:03,604
That's so good.

876
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,065
You look so well.

877
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:09,067
I... I don't wanna get you in trouble
or anything.

878
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,527
Well, how do I find you?

879
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:12,738
If I wanted to find you.

880
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:15,324
I... I mean, I... I opened my flower shop.

881
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,242
Lily Bloom's.

882
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:21,205
- Of course you did.
- Yeah. Over in... in Back Bay.

883
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:24,791
So, you know,
you can look me up sometime, or...

884
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,673
- Yeah. Well, I... I gotta-- Well, you know.
- Yeah.

885
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,800
- I'm working, so...
- Okay. Get out of here.

886
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,303
- Yeah, I'm gonna go. All right.
- Okay.

887
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,713
- ...once-in-a-lifetime operation.
- Lily?

888
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:12,923
What are you drinking?

889
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:14,299
I'll have wine, please.

890
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,093
You are not getting wine.
You're in a onesie.

891
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:17,928
- You don't get free wine with a onesie.
- Fair point.

892
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:19,847
- Whatever you're having, I'll have it.
- Bingo!

893
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,890
Three beers and a water for my ladylove.

894
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,433
Wait, did you just say "water"?

895
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:28,730
Okay, yeah.

896
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,440
We didn't plan on telling you here--

897
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,733
Stop it.

898
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:33,902
You know.

899
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,863
I'm gonna be a dad!

900
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:39,825
- And I'm gonna be the mom.
- Yes!

901
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:42,327
I'm gonna be a dad!

902
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,913
- I knew it.
- No, no.

903
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,915
This is fucking crazy! I know!

904
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,126
- I'm so happy for you. I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

905
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,963
- I'm a papa.
- I'm just so happy for you.

906
01:01:52,963 --> 01:01:54,339
You're gonna be the best mama.

907
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:55,465
Oh, my God.

908
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:57,593
To Allysa,
who's 11 months younger than me,

909
01:01:57,593 --> 01:02:00,304
and you still teach me every day
what being a grown-up looks like.

910
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:01,388
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

911
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,472
Cheers.

912
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:04,975
Eleven months? You guys,
I didn't know you were so close in age.

913
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,352
Oh, yeah. Three kids in three years.

914
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:08,896
Makes you feel bad for our mom.

915
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:10,647
Three? You guys have a sibling?

916
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:17,696
Yeah. Yeah, we had an older brother, Emerson.

917
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,491
And he died when we were younger.

918
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,789
I'm so sorry.

919
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,667
- Let's go. Goal!
- Yeah!

920
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,272
Good morning.

921
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:54,650
You like frittata?

922
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,776
What is happening?

923
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,530
No, no, I feel like I'm in a porno.
What... What is this?

924
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:02,324
I did not know you could cook.

925
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,201
I can't.

926
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,204
Well, good, 'cause I was
starting to get a little intimidated.

927
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:08,914
It was, you know,
a little too good to be true.

928
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:10,958
- That's for you. Yeah.
- That's mine. Thank you.

929
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,503
I like a little hair of the dog.
Don't be shy.

930
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:16,547
It's actually--

931
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:19,550
This is just to celebrate my big surgery tomorrow.

932
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:23,762
Oh, my God, I'm--

933
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:25,639
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

934
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,141
- I don't know what I was thinking. I--
- It's fine.

935
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,310
It's not fine. I'm sorry.

936
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:33,063
- Hey. I am sorry.
- Hey, what's that mean? The heart.

937
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,608
Oh, God, it's nothing. I just--

938
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,569
You know, one of those
silly things you do.

939
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:41,613
No, it's not nothing.
Every tattoo means something.

940
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:43,115
I know. No, no.

941
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,701
This is just like one of those
silly things you do in high school,

942
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:47,870
and I don't know why I still have it.

943
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:51,498
No.

944
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,543
It's one of my favourite parts of you.

945
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:00,674
Okay. Baby?

946
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:02,843
I have to tell you something.

947
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:04,636
Your frittata's burning.

948
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,724
It's gonna be perfect.

949
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:09,808
Okay.

950
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:13,604
Well, what are some of your
other favourite parts about me?

951
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:23,572
Your glabella.

952
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:33,665
- Your flagina.
- Oh, no! Stop!

953
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:40,297
- Oh, shit!
- I told you. I'm sorry. I did tell you.

954
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,759
- No, no. Baby, you need a potholder.
- Oh, my God! Shit!

955
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,469
You're gonna stick your hand in there?

956
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:57,272
Hey, baby.

957
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:02,945
- Hey, hey. You're okay.
- What was that?

958
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,863
What was that? No, no.

959
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,573
- Can you give me a second, please?
- Hey. Hey.

960
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,450
- Just give me a second.
- Oh, shit!

961
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,452
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

962
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:13,038
- Oh, my God. Your hand.
- No, don't worry about my hand.

963
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:15,207
Baby, your surgery.

964
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:18,752
You okay?

965
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,754
I think so. I don't know.

966
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:22,714
Let me see it.

967
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,134
- Shit, I'm--
- I know. I'm hurt.

968
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,719
I knew we'd make a mess.

969
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:30,389
- I'm so sorry.
- It was an accident.

970
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:32,182
No. I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...

971
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,060
- What did we do?
- It was an accident.

972
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,439
I'm okay.

973
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,027
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

974
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,196
- Thank you for coming. Sorry I'm late.
- Stop.

975
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:48,365
- I'm a disaster.
- No, here. I think I got everything.

976
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,367
Yeah, no, no, thank you. Okay.

977
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,618
How was the wedding?

978
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,787
- Also a disaster.
- No.

979
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:56,582
- It's fine. It's fine. It was a little, just--
- How's a wedding a disaster?

980
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:59,710
Well, I mean, their marriage is
probably the disaster, but they're fine.

981
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,838
- They're lovely. They deserve each other.
- But the flowers were beautiful?

982
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:04,464
Yes, the flowers were off the char--

983
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:07,301
I'm so sorry. How was your--

984
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:10,053
How was your surgery?
How did your sweet hand hold up?

985
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,097
- It was awesome.
- Really?

986
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,432
- Yeah.
- Really?

987
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,934
Yeah. There was this moment--

988
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,521
Allysa and Marshall messed up.

989
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:20,939
We're going to Root.

990
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:23,025
The place we went to with your mom.

991
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,653
- There was this moment, and I--
- Well, hold-- Why? Why?

992
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:27,738
I don't know.

993
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,781
I know, but I was dying
to try the new place...

994
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,617
- Yeah, but they heard...
- ...and we've already been there.

995
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:34,077
- ...how we talked about it and--
- Yeah, but we could just call them.

996
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,495
- No. They're already there.
- No, I know.

997
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:37,039
- They ordered 14 appetisers.
- I really wanted to...

998
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,082
- You know my sister.
- ...try the new place. I know. I'm sorry.

999
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,835
- I will take you there next week.
- You know I love food. That's all.

1000
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,420
- You know I'm a creature of habit.
- That's all it is.

1001
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,922
- I'll get the same thing I got last time.
- Okay.

1002
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,382
Yeah, I mean, it's perfect.
The food... The food is so good, so--

1003
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,470
Hey. Hey.

1004
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,180
What?

1005
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:54,515
- Hi.
- Hi.

1006
01:06:55,432 --> 01:06:57,684
I'm sorry. It's been a...
It's been a week.

1007
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:01,396
I don't need to be complaining to you.
You've been through it.

1008
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:02,898
Yeah.

1009
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:05,234
Tell me. I wanna hear everything.

1010
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:06,652
- Okay.
- Okay.

1011
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,499
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1012
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:21,625
- Hey.
- Hi!

1013
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,918
- What's up?
- I'm so sorry we're late.

1014
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:24,378
Just sit down. Don't worry about it.

1015
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:25,671
- Can I have this?
- Yeah. Of course.

1016
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,423
- We've ordered so much food.
- We're so sorry.

1017
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:29,800
- Yeah, it's... it's my fault.
- Oh, baby.

1018
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,134
I didn't--

1019
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:32,803
Ryle told me something happened,

1020
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:35,055
but he didn't tell me
it was looking like this.

1021
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:36,431
Look at you, honey.

1022
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:37,599
- It's fine. It doesn't even...
- Yeah.

1023
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,684
It doesn't even hurt.

1024
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,185
It was a mess. You should have seen her.

1025
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:41,979
Yeah. I mean, his hand.
And he got hurt too.

1026
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,481
- So we're-- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

1027
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:48,819
- I feel bad. It was... It was a beautiful mess.
- Yeah.

1028
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,655
Wait, so, dude,
what happened with the surgery?

1029
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:54,616
Probably the greatest day of my life.

1030
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,827
Twenty-seven hours.

1031
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,495
- Twenty-seven hours?
- Yeah.

1032
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:01,206
The only thing I've done for 27 hours
is day-trade and play Call of Duty.

1033
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,541
Do you guys have baby names?

1034
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:05,085
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- And go on a DraftKings bender.

1035
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:08,589
- Baby names?
- Yeah, sorry. I was, yeah, thinking.

1036
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,674
We're thinking something strong.

1037
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,302
- We're gonna do big-time authors.
- This riff...

1038
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:14,386
R. L. Stine.

1039
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:16,345
Judy Blume.

1040
01:08:16,345 --> 01:08:18,055
That is going to be
the demise of our marriage.

1041
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,265
- How we doing, folks?
- Hi.

1042
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:21,475
- How are you liking your appetisers?
- Wonderful.

1043
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:24,145
I've had one bite of one thing and this is
already my favourite restaurant.

1044
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:26,523
- What'd you go for?
- The Brussels sprouts.

1045
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:27,983
Brussels sprouts.

1046
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,734
What about you? What do you like?

1047
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,613
I'm-- Impossible to choose.

1048
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:34,363
My regards to the chef.

1049
01:08:34,363 --> 01:08:36,950
Thank you. Appreciate it.
It's actually my mother's recipe.

1050
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,702
That's very beautiful.

1051
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,287
- It's my first restaurant. Yeah.
- Love that.

1052
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:43,165
And I love the creativity,
dude, seriously.

1053
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:45,042
- So...
- I'm an entrepreneur as well, so I get it.

1054
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,792
What's... What's your...
What's your deal? What's your thing?

1055
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:50,464
Right now we're looking to allocate
capital in local Boston businesses,

1056
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:52,381
and a place like this
would just be amazing.

1057
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:55,594
Not to be too forward,
but what are margins right now?

1058
01:08:55,594 --> 01:08:58,721
I mean, the place is jumping.
Thirteen, 14, 15 percent?

1059
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:00,682
But I love the story about your mom.

1060
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,685
You do a Series A and scale this thing up.

1061
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:07,104
- Honey.
- Did I offend him?

1062
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,443
No, just keep saying "allocating capital."

1063
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,319
- The chef was the asshole.
- I have been holding it for so long.

1064
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:15,197
I'm gonna go pee really quick.
I'll be right back.

1065
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,282
- Do you want me to come?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

1066
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,825
- Are you--
- No, no, you... You guys keep talking.

1067
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:19,952
I'll be right back.

1068
01:09:31,587 --> 01:09:33,799
- Come on.
- What happened?

1069
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:37,928
Come on, tell me. What happened?

1070
01:09:37,928 --> 01:09:40,930
Nothing. I-- We... I...
He burned his hand, and I fell.

1071
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,643
I know. I know.
It's... It was an accident, though. It was--

1072
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,310
- That was an accident?
- Yes.

1073
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:52,317
Leave him.

1074
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,487
- God.
- You gotta leave him.

1075
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:58,282
- I am not your mother, Atlas.
- Leave him. Come on.

1076
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,493
Are you turning into yours?

1077
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,374
- Let me out of here.
- Lily.

1078
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:11,253
- Let me out now.
- Lily.

1079
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,337
Stop.

1080
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,302
Wait, what is this?

1081
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:20,554
Atlas! Stop.

1082
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:23,182
Touch her again, I'll cut your hand off
and shove it down your throat,

1083
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:25,851
- you piece of shit.
- Atlas, stop! Stop.

1084
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:27,853
Stop.

1085
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:30,480
So this is Atlas.

1086
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,316
- Baby, hey.
- The homeless boy...

1087
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,484
- Come on. Stop.
- ...you wasted your virginity on?

1088
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:39,656
Guys, stop it! Stop it!

1089
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,493
- Please! Please stop it. Stop!
- Hey! Break it up.

1090
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:45,204
- No! Please.
- Come on.

1091
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:47,748
- Please, stop. No!
- Get out of my restaurant!

1092
01:10:47,748 --> 01:10:51,168
- Stop! Let's get out of here.
- Get out of my restaurant!

1093
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,337
- Stop, please, please. Let's go.
- Come on.

1094
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,589
- Get out!
- Stop it, now!

1095
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:00,636
Ryle?

1096
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:01,970
Excuse me. Ryle.

1097
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,350
Ryle. Ryle, wait.

1098
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,852
- Ryle, please, wait.
- What was he doing in the bathroom, Lily?

1099
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:10,103
What was he doing in the bathroom?

1100
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,939
He saw my eye,
and I think he saw your hand.

1101
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,608
And he knows it was an accident.
And I told him it was an accident. He...

1102
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,611
Lily.

1103
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:20,656
What?

1104
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:25,494
I don't--

1105
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:26,787
I don't know him.

1106
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:28,789
I mean, we... we... We were kids.

1107
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,332
- I don't know him now.
- Anyone but him.

1108
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,252
Anyone but him.

1109
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:36,797
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you. Anyone but him.

1110
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:43,470
Promise me.

1111
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,139
Okay.

1112
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,016
- Okay?
- Okay.

1113
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:50,310
Yeah.

1114
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,770
I don't know.

1115
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:54,648
Okay.

1116
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:57,150
Okay, okay, okay.

1117
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,902
I've never been here before.

1118
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:05,826
- You have me. You have all of me.
- I know. I know. I know.

1119
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,495
- So, if I'm not what you want, you just--
- No, no, no. You're fine.

1120
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,080
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1121
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:12,416
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1122
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,751
Stop. Stop.

1123
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:17,254
- Stop.
- I love you, Lily.

1124
01:12:17,254 --> 01:12:19,923
I know. I know. I know. I know.

1125
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,925
I know.

1126
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,595
I love you, Lily.

1127
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:28,432
I love you, too.

1128
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:39,568
No, please stop. No, please, please.

1129
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,778
Lily! Open the door.

1130
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,739
- You gotta leave right now.
- Lily!

1131
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,199
- I'm coming!
- Open the door!

1132
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,326
- Leave right now. Put your clothes on.
- Who's in there?

1133
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,119
- He's coming. Come on.
- Hey! Open--

1134
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:26,698
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you for coming by.

1135
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:27,783
We appreciate it.

1136
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:29,743
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1137
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,078
Thanks so much for stopping in.

1138
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:32,454
- It's busy.
- Yeah.

1139
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,626
I think that's the last of it.

1140
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:39,002
How you doing, mama?

1141
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,671
I'm doing.

1142
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:44,258
- I'm doing.
- You in that little dress.

1143
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,342
Do you mind if I--

1144
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:49,054
- If I see the baby for a moment?
- Oh, yeah. Have a visit.

1145
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:51,557
Hi, bubba. How you doing? You getting big.

1146
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:53,058
Hey, question.

1147
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,979
If we're not allowed
to go back to that restaurant...

1148
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:58,063
Yeah.

1149
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:01,400
...why is he allowed to
come to this store?

1150
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,532
- I don't--
- Coffee.

1151
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:11,451
- Okay.
- I'm getting coffee. Would you like some?

1152
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:13,996
No, I'm good. Thank you.

1153
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,456
- Excuse me. Hi. Hey. Excuse me.
- Hi.

1154
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:18,458
Thank you.

1155
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:20,127
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

1156
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:24,506
Hi.

1157
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:26,842
Hi.

1158
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:29,636
This is incredible.

1159
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:31,013
Yeah, thanks.

1160
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:33,432
Kind of exactly how I imagined it.

1161
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:37,060
Yeah, yours too.

1162
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,271
Thanks.

1163
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:41,857
Look at us.

1164
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:46,320
So, look, I...

1165
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,116
I came by the next day after the fight,

1166
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:56,580
but he was here. And I... I just didn't think
that was a good idea.

1167
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,501
I just... I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

1168
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:03,337
- I was out of my mind...
- Yeah.

1169
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:05,088
...and... and acted like a jackass and...

1170
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:07,007
I just feel really bad and I'm sorry.

1171
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:09,009
Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. It's...

1172
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,845
Yeah. It was a misunderstanding. So--

1173
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,598
Well, I don't... I don't know. I mean, no, it wasn't.

1174
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,266
I don't think it was.

1175
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,899
Why are you here now?
I gave you my address months ago.

1176
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,275
What are you... What are you doing?

1177
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,610
I came the next day.

1178
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,453
I drive this street a lot.

1179
01:15:44,837 --> 01:15:45,838
Yeah.

1180
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:53,554
I'm sorry.

1181
01:15:57,599 --> 01:15:58,767
Are you happy?

1182
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:02,771
Yeah.

1183
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:06,066
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1184
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,151
I couldn't be happier.

1185
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:11,446
Are you?

1186
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,159
No.

1187
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,374
Sorry.

1188
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:36,680
That your phone?

1189
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,764
Yeah.

1190
01:16:40,475 --> 01:16:41,476
What are you doing?

1191
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,776
That's my number. In case you need it.

1192
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,365
Okay, well, I won't, so...

1193
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,618
But thank you.

1194
01:16:57,618 --> 01:16:58,785
I hope you don't.

1195
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:09,838
Hey, that--

1196
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:12,466
That thing that he said about that--

1197
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,218
You know, with us. It wasn't--

1198
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:16,470
<i>It wasn't wasted.</i>

1199
01:17:17,638 --> 01:17:19,014
I know.

1200
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,267
I was there.

1201
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:38,951
Hi.

1202
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:45,916
- Hey.
- Hey.

1203
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:53,382
That smells good.

1204
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:54,550
Thank you.

1205
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:00,514
Are you happy?

1206
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:07,104
Are you okay?

1207
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,481
Yeah. I'm just--

1208
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:11,525
I'm just curious.

1209
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,447
I wasn't.

1210
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,326
Lily, you make me happy.

1211
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:23,829
Are you happy?

1212
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,250
I mean, I don't think anyone's
happy all the time, but...

1213
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:31,211
I don't know if I like the sound of that.

1214
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:32,838
No, no. It's just, you know--

1215
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:36,300
Of course I deal with, you know, my stuff

1216
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:41,054
and, you know, life, and ticking clock

1217
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:43,223
- and, you know, all those decisions that--
- Right.

1218
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:45,517
that women have to worry about.

1219
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:48,187
But, I think I'm an innately happy person.

1220
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:53,150
It's probably just a coping mechanism
I learned from my mom. So...

1221
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,234
Your mom?

1222
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,323
My dad used to hit her.

1223
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:11,001
Shit, I'm so sorry.

1224
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:13,712
You never told me that.

1225
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:17,382
That's not something people talk about.

1226
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:20,135
Did he ever hurt you?

1227
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,097
No. He nearly killed Atlas though.

1228
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:31,563
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1229
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:37,611
Oh, God.

1230
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,490
I'm so embarrassed. I--

1231
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,326
That mess at the restaurant.

1232
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,622
I didn't know.
That must have been so hard on you.

1233
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:49,706
Yeah.

1234
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,001
Baby, all I wanna do in my life
is protect you.

1235
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,169
You know that, right?

1236
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:57,089
When you hurt yourself by accident,

1237
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:00,133
when you stub your toe, I blame myself.

1238
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:03,679
It's like it's my fault
that the wall was there.

1239
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:04,763
Stop.

1240
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:07,224
I'm the luckiest goddamn man
on this planet.

1241
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,104
And I could clean up. Trust me.

1242
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:13,939
Okay. I'm not trying to hear about that.

1243
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:16,859
- You don't wanna hear about that? Just a little bit?
- No. No.

1244
01:20:17,651 --> 01:20:19,903
Yeah, I'm a ripped neurosurgeon
for Christ's sake.

1245
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,780
When was the last time
you saw someone who looked like me

1246
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,574
that wasn't on a daytime soap?

1247
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:26,451
I mean, come to think of it,
yeah, I-- No, I haven't.

1248
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,120
- Yeah.
- And I'm rich.

1249
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:29,830
And humble.

1250
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:33,584
We can work on that.

1251
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:35,961
God, I love you.

1252
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:39,548
I know. I love you too.
That's the problem.

1253
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:42,801
<i>It's a big problem.</i>

1254
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,637
<i>It's a really big problem.</i>

1255
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:07,409
Stop.

1256
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,753
Look at her. She's like a little alien.

1257
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,923
Yeah, she's perfect.

1258
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:26,178
Do you want to hold her?

1259
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:30,599
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

1260
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:31,892
Here you go.

1261
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:33,060
Okay.

1262
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:37,564
- Hi.
- There we go. Right there.

1263
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:41,276
- You're so beautiful. Hi.
- Wow.

1264
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:42,528
You're a mama.

1265
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:43,862
Yeah.

1266
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:45,739
My sister's a mama.

1267
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:47,157
And you're an uncle.

1268
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:55,123
Wow. You did it.

1269
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,253
This is just hormones. Don't look at me.

1270
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,089
Do you guys want kids? Well--

1271
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,716
- No pressure. We're not...
- I'm putting you on the spot right now.

1272
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:07,636
I mean, it would be great
for childcare and stuff like that.

1273
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,348
I'm not gonna make her
put on a white dress

1274
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:12,766
and have my babies.

1275
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,644
Unless she wants to.

1276
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:18,981
Then I would marry her tonight.

1277
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:26,071
- Oh, shit. He's serious.
- Oh, my gosh.

1278
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,782
Ryle, you are--
You're drunk on baby smell.

1279
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,659
No, no, no. I am serious as an aneurysm.

1280
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,495
Oh, God. Please don't do
neurosurgeon humour when you're propos--

1281
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,580
I mean, if you are.

1282
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,956
Is that-- Is this--

1283
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:37,791
- He's going around.
- I mean, if that's what you--

1284
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,459
- Give me the baby.
- This is out of it--

1285
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:40,961
- Please stop.
- Yeah. Wait.

1286
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:42,754
No, no. No, no, stop.

1287
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:44,923
- He's doing it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1288
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:46,717
Okay. Okay. What--

1289
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:49,344
Can we just--

1290
01:22:50,053 --> 01:22:51,680
Can you get the baby? We have a baby.

1291
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,973
- We can take that. That's ours.
- Give me.

1292
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:54,683
- Here you go.
- Here you go, baby.

1293
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:57,644
You get back down there.
You get back down there right this second.

1294
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:06,403
Will you marry me, Lily Blossom Bloom?

1295
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:10,824
Yeah?

1296
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:11,992
Okay.

1297
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:14,745
- This is just-- I'm just--
- He did it.

1298
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:16,330
This is a miracle.

1299
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,165
Oh, thank God.

1300
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,334
Oh, my God.

1301
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:32,304
- But we'll do a proper wedding one day.
<i>- You got married without me.</i>

1302
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:34,681
And I continue to be very sorry,

1303
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:36,558
but at some point
you're gonna have to forgive me.

1304
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:37,976
I will wear you down.

1305
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:39,895
- My wife will wear you down.
<i>- Not possible.</i>

1306
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:42,105
I don't think you should ever forgive her.
Just saying.

1307
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:44,650
Okay. That's enough of that.
Hold on, can you charge my phone?

1308
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:47,444
<i>I haven't been dreaming about
your wedding day your whole life,</i>

1309
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,154
<i>I've been dreaming about it my whole life.</i>

1310
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,490
<i>And I'm sorry, I just feel cheated.</i>

1311
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,701
Yeah, okay. Got it. Thanks, Mom.
Okay, we're gonna find a way to move on.

1312
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,703
<i>If I don't get to watch you
walk down the aisle,</i>

1313
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:59,122
<i>I will not be denied watching you squirm.</i>

1314
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:01,458
<i>- You wanna make it up to me?</i>
- Yes, please.

1315
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:04,878
<i>Make me a grandbaby. No, three. Three.
Make it triplets.</i>

1316
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,215
All right, can you just-- Can we move past
this conversation, please?

1317
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,468
You okay?

1318
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:13,679
<i>What happened?</i>

1319
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,098
- Mom, I'll call you right back, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

1320
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:17,182
Yeah, no, hang up.

1321
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:21,395
Hey, what happened?

1322
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,609
Hey, you okay?

1323
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:35,784
I dropped your phone,

1324
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:39,788
and the case fell off.

1325
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:52,301
And I found this.

1326
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:00,225
I called the number...

1327
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:13,280
- It wasn't--
- You promised me.

1328
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:15,866
- I know.
- I would never lie to you.

1329
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:17,159
I know. It's nothing.

1330
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,244
- It's nothing?
- Yeah.

1331
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:20,913
Yeah.

1332
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:23,749
- It's nothing?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.

1333
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:25,792
Yeah.

1334
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:29,630
Okay?

1335
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:39,014
It's nothing.

1336
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:42,267
- Okay.
- Okay.

1337
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:51,276
Ryle.

1338
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:54,696
Ryle, baby, I promise
I didn't mean to see him.

1339
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:56,615
- I promise. Please.
- Stop! No, no, no.

1340
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:58,283
- No. I promise, please.
- Lily, stop!

1341
01:25:58,283 --> 01:26:00,035
No, it's-- Please, just listen to me.

1342
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,496
- Please. I didn't know he was coming.
- You promised me, Lily. Stop.

1343
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,248
- Just talk to me. Please. Just--
- Stop!

1344
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:06,375
- You stop. Please. Don't--
- Stop!

1345
01:26:12,798 --> 01:26:14,716
Hey. Just try to be still.

1346
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:16,718
Just try to be still.

1347
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,224
It's all done. I'm here.

1348
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:23,475
- Stop.
- I'm here.

1349
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:25,310
Hey.

1350
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,980
What-- What happened?

1351
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:30,732
You fell down the stairs.

1352
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:34,820
No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch it.

1353
01:26:35,696 --> 01:26:37,573
Yeah, you tripped and--

1354
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:40,784
And I... I... I tried to catch you.

1355
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:43,412
- No, Ryle, no.
- You're... You're okay. You're okay.

1356
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:47,499
- Don't.
- It hurts.

1357
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:49,001
I know it hurts. You're okay.

1358
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,586
- Okay.
- You're okay.

1359
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:54,506
Do you know who you are?

1360
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:56,758
Lily Bloom.

1361
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:58,135
Okay. Where are you?

1362
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:00,929
- Our apartment.
- Okay. Who am I?

1363
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:03,849
My husband.

1364
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:06,894
And what am I doing right now?

1365
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:09,521
Helping me.

1366
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:14,193
How many fingers am I holding up?

1367
01:27:16,528 --> 01:27:17,529
- Five.
- Five.

1368
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:19,615
- And now? Okay.
- Two.

1369
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:21,617
Tell me it's nothing.

1370
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:26,914
It's nothing.

1371
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:29,875
Yeah, come.

1372
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:32,961
Thank you.

1373
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:38,717
Am I okay?

1374
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:40,302
You're okay. You're okay.

1375
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:42,012
Okay.

1376
01:28:32,938 --> 01:28:34,356
Lily! Oh, my God.

1377
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:36,692
Did you see it? Did you see the magazine?

1378
01:28:36,692 --> 01:28:38,485
You did it! Look at this!

1379
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:40,320
Top ten. We're in the top ten!

1380
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,573
- We're in the top-- You did it.
- Wait, where is it?

1381
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:44,867
Where's the genius? Right there.
Look, look, look.

1382
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:46,201
- Right there. There's you!
- Oh, my God.

1383
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,870
Oh, my God. I'm gonna call Ryle

1384
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,622
and then tell him
to get, like, 50 copies of this thing.

1385
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,029
Hey.

1386
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:23,989
Hey.

1387
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:32,664
You saw?

1388
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,251
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thank you.

1389
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:39,755
I didn't know it was a big deal,
"Best in Boston."

1390
01:29:39,755 --> 01:29:41,173
Best in Boston.

1391
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:48,722
Hello.

1392
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:52,142
Okay.

1393
01:29:56,563 --> 01:29:57,898
I love this tattoo.

1394
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:01,235
Hey, remind me what that means again.

1395
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:04,863
What?

1396
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:07,658
I told you.

1397
01:30:08,617 --> 01:30:10,118
Really doesn't mean anything?

1398
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:15,374
Did you read it yet?

1399
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,001
Yeah, did you?

1400
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:21,255
Will you read it to me?

1401
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:23,841
- I don't like that kinda stuff.
- Please.

1402
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:25,884
No. Baby, I made dinner,
and it's gonna get cold.

1403
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:29,972
- Read it.
- And I don't love this kinda stuff, okay?

1404
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:35,352
"Number seven, Lily Bloom's.

1405
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:38,814
- An avant-garde floral shop--" What?
- No, no. Skip to number one.

1406
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:41,650
Our favourite restaurant.

1407
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,450
Look, baby, I--

1408
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:52,452
Read it.

1409
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:01,461
"The top pick should
come as no surprise--"

1410
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:03,130
No, go to the end.

1411
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:07,259
"The owner, Atlas Corrigan,

1412
01:31:07,259 --> 01:31:10,846
spoke to the sweet origin story behind
his farm-to-table hot spot, Root.

1413
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:13,348
When I was a kid, I carved a..."

1414
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:19,313
- Carved what?
- Baby, I don't wanna read--

1415
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:20,397
Keep reading.

1416
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:27,529
"...small hollow heart
from an oak tree for a girl.

1417
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:29,948
So the name was meant to represent
something she said to me,

1418
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:31,825
which I'm gonna keep between us.

1419
01:31:31,825 --> 01:31:34,494
But there was no other name for Root.
It was...

1420
01:31:35,871 --> 01:31:36,872
always for her."

1421
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:37,956
Baby--

1422
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:40,918
Just go to this last paragraph.

1423
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:42,669
It gets better.

1424
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:47,299
- I don't wanna--
- Read it.

1425
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:55,557
"When asked if he had seen the girl
since they were kids,

1426
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:57,518
- Corrigan replied--"
-"...Corrigan replied...

1427
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:00,604
'Yes. Next question.'"

1428
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:12,533
Do you love him?

1429
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:14,868
I did.

1430
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:15,953
Do you love him now?

1431
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:17,663
I love you.

1432
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:19,164
That wasn't my question.

1433
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:33,512
I don't know.

1434
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:55,534
Thank you.

1435
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:09,131
Sorry, baby.

1436
01:33:10,132 --> 01:33:11,717
- Come on. Let's have dinner.
- No.

1437
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:13,218
Okay. Please.

1438
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:16,638
Hey, no, no, no. Not now. Please. Just--

1439
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:19,349
Please. Hey. Stop, please.

1440
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:21,226
Baby, stop. Stop.

1441
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:24,605
- You want me to stop?
- Not now. Hey, stop it.

1442
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:26,273
Stop it.

1443
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:27,691
- Hey.
- Stop!

1444
01:33:27,691 --> 01:33:29,651
- Hey.
- Stop, please. Please, stop.

1445
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:30,777
Hey!

1446
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:31,904
- Hey.
- Stop.

1447
01:33:33,947 --> 01:33:35,199
Stop it.

1448
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,285
Stop! Stop. Hey!

1449
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,329
Don't. Stop. Stop. Hey.

1450
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:42,831
- What are you doing? Stop. Stop.
- Hey.

1451
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:44,875
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1452
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:47,169
- Baby. Hey.
- Stop. Stop.

1453
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:50,047
Hey.

1454
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:52,508
I love you.

1455
01:33:54,927 --> 01:33:57,054
I don't think I've shown you
how much I love you.

1456
01:33:57,054 --> 01:33:58,263
You have.

1457
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:00,307
- You have.
- No.

1458
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:02,100
You have.

1459
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:04,144
- Baby...
- Please.

1460
01:34:04,144 --> 01:34:06,104
You have, baby. You have.

1461
01:34:06,313 --> 01:34:07,439
Okay.

1462
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:15,239
Okay. Okay.

1463
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,327
- I love you so much.
- I love you, baby.

1464
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:22,246
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

1465
01:34:22,913 --> 01:34:25,791
Baby. Baby, please stop.

1466
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,292
Please stop.

1467
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:30,462
Please. Hey. Hey, stop. Stop.

1468
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:32,047
Hey. Stop. Look at me.

1469
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:34,716
- I love you so much.
- Look at me. No, no. Look at me.

1470
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:37,094
And I want you to know
that I love you enough.

1471
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:38,762
- You have. Hey. Hey.
- No.

1472
01:34:38,762 --> 01:34:40,764
Look at me. Look at me. I love you.

1473
01:34:40,764 --> 01:34:42,474
Baby, look at me. Please look at me.

1474
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:44,309
- Please look at me.
- That tattoo.

1475
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:47,145
Please look at me.
Please look at me. Please.

1476
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,147
Please. Please. I love you.

1477
01:34:49,147 --> 01:34:50,983
I love you. I love you. Please.

1478
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:52,818
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

1479
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:54,528
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

1480
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:56,238
Stop! Stop!

1481
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,097
I don't think I'm showing you
how much I love you.

1482
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:25,142
<i>- Yes, you have.
- No.</i>

1483
01:35:25,142 --> 01:35:26,351
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

1484
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,495
- Hands.
- Yes, chef.

1485
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,333
I was never gonna become her.

1486
01:36:33,877 --> 01:36:35,379
You're not becoming her.

1487
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:37,840
Don't even think about that.

1488
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:40,259
Okay?

1489
01:36:42,135 --> 01:36:43,470
- Yeah.
- You're not.

1490
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:56,316
Is that what I think it is?

1491
01:36:59,987 --> 01:37:01,071
Yeah.

1492
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:09,162
I wanna tell you something.
I don't know if it's the right time--

1493
01:37:09,288 --> 01:37:10,581
Sorry for the delay.

1494
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,333
Been really busy tonight.

1495
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:17,546
So, we have a certain examination
for these situations.

1496
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:21,550
It's called the SANE exam.
It's completely optional, of course--

1497
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:24,219
He didn't--

1498
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:26,847
No, I wasn't-- It's--

1499
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:27,931
Did he try?

1500
01:37:29,308 --> 01:37:31,727
I don't need the exam. Thank you. Yeah.

1501
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:34,438
May I?

1502
01:37:34,438 --> 01:37:36,356
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1503
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:42,070
Does this hurt?

1504
01:37:43,697 --> 01:37:44,781
This?

1505
01:37:44,781 --> 01:37:46,992
No, it's just the skin. Yeah.

1506
01:37:47,242 --> 01:37:48,577
So, usually,

1507
01:37:49,453 --> 01:37:52,956
I'd give you an X-ray on this collarbone
to make sure that it isn't fractured,

1508
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:56,293
but, given your situation,
we're gonna clean it up,

1509
01:37:56,293 --> 01:37:59,213
and the nurse is gonna come in
and give you a tetanus shot.

1510
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:02,132
I-- I don't understand.

1511
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:05,219
We don't give X-rays to pregnant women
unless it's vital.

1512
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:06,845
Okay?

1513
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:11,308
Yeah.

1514
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,392
- Right. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1515
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:13,477
Okay.

1516
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:37,042
There's no Cassie, is there?

1517
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:38,752
No.

1518
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:42,339
No, there isn't.

1519
01:38:45,968 --> 01:38:47,135
It's--

1520
01:38:48,053 --> 01:38:49,137
It's the place.

1521
01:38:56,144 --> 01:38:57,646
Kitchen, living room.

1522
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:00,899
Hey, let me grab you some clothes.

1523
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:12,244
Thank you.

1524
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:13,996
My dad won't even notice they're gone.

1525
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,334
Bedroom's all yours.

1526
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,378
- No, I'm not gonna take your bedroom.
- No. Please.

1527
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,380
I have to get up early
for work anyway, so...

1528
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:26,383
I love that couch. It's a good couch.

1529
01:39:27,384 --> 01:39:29,469
So, stay as long as you want.

1530
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:31,305
Thank you.

1531
01:39:31,597 --> 01:39:32,973
Okay. Now, get some rest.

1532
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:36,351
See you tomorrow.

1533
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:44,044
Hey.

1534
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:45,712
Hi.

1535
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:56,807
I wasn't sure if you were hungry,
so I went with a few fan favourites.

1536
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:05,190
What song do you want at your funeral?

1537
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,778
If you had to pick one.

1538
01:41:10,696 --> 01:41:11,947
Have you not thought about this?

1539
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:13,615
What song you're gonna play at my funeral?

1540
01:41:13,615 --> 01:41:14,700
Yeah.

1541
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:19,496
At my funeral,
I'm thinking Creed, "With Arms Wide Open".

1542
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:21,290
- You know, <i>"With arms wide..."</i>
- Yeah.

1543
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,000
...as the casket's being lowered.

1544
01:41:33,844 --> 01:41:35,137
You're gonna be okay.

1545
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:40,475
It doesn't feel like it.

1546
01:41:41,476 --> 01:41:42,477
I know.

1547
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:44,730
But you are.

1548
01:41:46,148 --> 01:41:48,817
I think it's a little different this time.

1549
01:41:52,654 --> 01:41:54,448
If I can't even take care of myself,

1550
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:59,536
then how am I, you know,
supposed to take care of a baby?

1551
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,803
That night I went
to that old abandoned house,

1552
01:42:16,803 --> 01:42:19,389
I didn't go there because
I needed a place to stay,

1553
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:21,475
I went there to kill myself.

1554
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:26,480
And I was sitting
on the living room floor,

1555
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,815
and I saw you in your bedroom window.

1556
01:42:28,815 --> 01:42:29,983
The light came on,

1557
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:32,694
and you poked your head
through that curtain,

1558
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:36,240
and as soon as I saw your face,
I couldn't do it.

1559
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:40,285
The next day, you brought me food,
you fed me...

1560
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:48,585
I mean, you saved--

1561
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:53,465
You saved my life
is what I'm trying to say.

1562
01:42:55,259 --> 01:42:56,343
That's who you are.

1563
01:42:57,219 --> 01:43:03,225
And if you decide to keep it,
you are going to be an amazing mother.

1564
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:07,896
And that baby is so lucky.

1565
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:14,528
You've got this.

1566
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:42,931
Lily.

1567
01:44:18,258 --> 01:44:20,385
If you ever find yourself in the position
to love somebody again,

1568
01:44:20,385 --> 01:44:21,887
just fall in love with me.

1569
01:44:29,102 --> 01:44:30,938
Yeah. Okay.

1570
01:45:07,307 --> 01:45:08,809
I'm so sorry.

1571
01:45:11,562 --> 01:45:16,650
I've been watching him my entire life,
and I've seen...

1572
01:45:18,902 --> 01:45:24,658
how afraid he is
of opening his heart to anyone,

1573
01:45:26,743 --> 01:45:28,412
ever since he was a kid.

1574
01:45:30,372 --> 01:45:34,710
And I think I felt
that he was dying inside.

1575
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:39,339
Just dying inside, little by little,

1576
01:45:41,216 --> 01:45:42,718
until he met you.

1577
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:48,223
And I'm not making any excuses...

1578
01:45:50,058 --> 01:45:51,059
I never--

1579
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,646
I never thought he was capable of this.

1580
01:46:01,737 --> 01:46:05,782
Would it... Would it be okay
if I asked what happened to Emerson?

1581
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:08,243
Of course.

1582
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:14,082
You deserve to know, and it's our family.

1583
01:46:21,548 --> 01:46:23,217
My father had a gun.

1584
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:28,222
Ryle and Emerson were
playing in the house,

1585
01:46:28,805 --> 01:46:31,391
you know, pretending to be cowboys,

1586
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:33,602
and they found it.

1587
01:46:35,229 --> 01:46:37,231
And Ryle was six years old.

1588
01:46:37,898 --> 01:46:39,942
He was a six-year-old boy.

1589
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:44,821
He didn't even know
that it was a real gun.

1590
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:46,490
He thought that it was pretend

1591
01:46:48,492 --> 01:46:51,662
until it was too late.

1592
01:46:55,249 --> 01:46:57,084
- Emerson was our brother...
- I'm so sorry.

1593
01:46:57,084 --> 01:46:58,836
...his best friend.

1594
01:47:02,089 --> 01:47:03,757
He's never been the same since.

1595
01:47:03,757 --> 01:47:04,842
Yeah.

1596
01:47:07,427 --> 01:47:09,513
To be at that funeral...

1597
01:47:19,064 --> 01:47:21,900
I really did used to love flowers.

1598
01:47:24,194 --> 01:47:25,529
Listen to me.

1599
01:47:26,321 --> 01:47:28,031
As his sister,

1600
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:32,286
I wish more than anything
that you could find a way to forgive him.

1601
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:37,040
But, as your best friend,

1602
01:47:38,542 --> 01:47:43,213
Lily, if you take him back,
I will never speak to you again.

1603
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:50,804
I'm so sorry.

1604
01:47:51,847 --> 01:47:54,183
You're the best friend I ever had.

1605
01:47:55,184 --> 01:47:56,810
I'll be an even better aunty.

1606
01:48:02,107 --> 01:48:03,233
Sweetheart.

1607
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:47,903
- This side?
- That side.

1608
01:48:47,903 --> 01:48:50,572
Yeah, if I hold it in like this,
I think it'll be a little easier.

1609
01:48:50,572 --> 01:48:53,200
- Righty tighty, I think.
- Yep. Come on.

1610
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,284
I'm sorry.

1611
01:48:54,284 --> 01:48:55,369
No, no. You got it.

1612
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:57,496
Your dad always did this stuff.

1613
01:48:57,496 --> 01:48:59,706
I'm sure you built a thing or two
in your life.

1614
01:48:59,706 --> 01:49:02,668
No. No, no. That was always his domain.

1615
01:49:06,129 --> 01:49:08,298
It doesn't wanna go in there.

1616
01:49:14,054 --> 01:49:15,681
Why did you stay with him?

1617
01:49:23,897 --> 01:49:25,983
It would've been harder to leave.

1618
01:49:30,529 --> 01:49:31,780
And I loved him.

1619
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:34,950
Yeah, me too.

1620
01:49:37,202 --> 01:49:38,495
I think I got it.

1621
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,542
And that's the heartbeat.

1622
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:46,837
Look at that. Do you wanna know?

1623
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:49,089
- You can tell already?
- I can.

1624
01:49:52,885 --> 01:49:54,553
Okay.

1625
01:49:54,553 --> 01:49:55,637
Yeah.

1626
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:58,473
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1627
01:49:58,473 --> 01:49:59,558
Okay.

1628
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:02,686
Can you see that?

1629
01:50:03,312 --> 01:50:04,855
That's her little head.

1630
01:50:11,737 --> 01:50:12,821
Hi.

1631
01:50:13,697 --> 01:50:15,324
Hi, baby girl.

1632
01:50:16,575 --> 01:50:17,951
"Her," huh?

1633
01:50:22,998 --> 01:50:24,166
Hi.

1634
01:50:25,918 --> 01:50:27,669
Hi, my baby girl.

1635
01:50:52,736 --> 01:50:53,820
Hi.

1636
01:51:06,124 --> 01:51:07,251
It's always--

1637
01:51:11,171 --> 01:51:12,172
Thank you.

1638
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:25,602
Is she kicking?

1639
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:28,564
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1640
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:35,279
All right.

1641
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:37,239
Sturdy.

1642
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:39,491
- Here you go. Grab this side.
- All right.

1643
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:42,327
Thank you.

1644
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:45,539
I can clean all this up, so...

1645
01:51:45,539 --> 01:51:46,707
Okay.

1646
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:06,310
Do you wanna feel, before you go?
If you want?

1647
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:10,189
Is she kicking now?

1648
01:52:10,981 --> 01:52:12,983
Always. Yeah.

1649
01:52:13,817 --> 01:52:14,818
Yes.

1650
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:16,361
Yeah. Okay.

1651
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,073
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

1652
01:52:22,951 --> 01:52:24,244
Here. Here.

1653
01:52:26,663 --> 01:52:27,664
There she is.

1654
01:52:27,664 --> 01:52:28,749
Yeah.

1655
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:33,795
Big old noggin. You feel that?
That's her little heel. You feel that?

1656
01:52:34,922 --> 01:52:37,424
She's kinda stretching. Yeah.

1657
01:52:45,015 --> 01:52:46,183
Come home.

1658
01:52:49,228 --> 01:52:50,771
Look, I won't--

1659
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:53,190
It will never happen again.

1660
01:52:54,024 --> 01:52:56,193
I promise. I will... I will get help.

1661
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:00,030
Please come home.

1662
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:10,958
- I'm s--
- You're gonna be late for work.

1663
01:54:21,486 --> 01:54:24,072
Come. You wanna join us?

1664
01:54:27,534 --> 01:54:29,203
Got room for one more.

1665
01:54:30,495 --> 01:54:31,872
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1666
01:54:33,248 --> 01:54:36,293
I know. I got you. I got you.

1667
01:54:39,338 --> 01:54:41,131
- Hey.
- Wanna hold her?

1668
01:54:43,217 --> 01:54:44,218
Yeah.

1669
01:54:44,218 --> 01:54:48,222
- Here you go. Like that.
- Hey. Hi.

1670
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:50,182
Mommy's got you.

1671
01:54:50,182 --> 01:54:51,767
- Yeah.
- Mommy's got you.

1672
01:54:51,767 --> 01:54:54,228
Still here.

1673
01:54:54,228 --> 01:54:55,729
I know, I know.

1674
01:54:55,729 --> 01:54:56,813
I know. It's okay.

1675
01:54:57,731 --> 01:54:59,191
Keep her cosy.

1676
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:01,735
- Hi.
- There we go.

1677
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:04,738
- Hi, beautiful.
- There we go.

1678
01:55:05,405 --> 01:55:06,573
I'm your daddy.

1679
01:55:06,573 --> 01:55:09,743
Yeah. Yes, you are.

1680
01:55:10,577 --> 01:55:11,745
Yeah.

1681
01:55:13,288 --> 01:55:14,665
What should we call her?

1682
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:18,502
I was thinking we could name her
after your brother.

1683
01:55:25,926 --> 01:55:28,679
- Emerson.
- Yeah. Emerson.

1684
01:55:29,096 --> 01:55:31,306
That way, we can call her Emmy.

1685
01:55:33,976 --> 01:55:35,310
What do you think?

1686
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:40,148
I think that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1687
01:55:42,901 --> 01:55:44,319
Thank you.

1688
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:53,370
It's okay. It's okay. Daddy's got you.

1689
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:55,539
Daddy's got you, Emmy.

1690
01:55:56,915 --> 01:55:57,916
Hi.

1691
01:55:59,084 --> 01:56:02,045
Hi, beautiful. I'm your daddy.

1692
01:56:07,968 --> 01:56:09,595
I'm gonna keep you safe, Emmy.

1693
01:56:11,305 --> 01:56:13,098
I'm gonna keep you safe.

1694
01:56:21,523 --> 01:56:22,858
I want a divorce.

1695
01:56:25,444 --> 01:56:27,988
Hey. Let's not.

1696
01:56:27,988 --> 01:56:29,448
Hey, yes.

1697
01:56:29,781 --> 01:56:31,116
Yeah.

1698
01:56:32,284 --> 01:56:33,368
Yeah.

1699
01:56:35,204 --> 01:56:37,247
It's not for you or me. It's for her.

1700
01:56:38,707 --> 01:56:40,375
Yeah, you know.

1701
01:56:41,627 --> 01:56:42,753
Look at her.

1702
01:56:42,753 --> 01:56:46,673
What if, one day, she came to you
and said, "My boyfriend hit me"?

1703
01:56:46,673 --> 01:56:48,050
What would you...

1704
01:56:49,676 --> 01:56:51,136
What would you say to her?

1705
01:56:54,515 --> 01:56:58,268
Or if she said, "Daddy, my husband
pushed me down the stairs,

1706
01:56:58,268 --> 01:57:01,188
but he said it was an accident,
so it's fine."

1707
01:57:04,066 --> 01:57:07,736
Or if she said her husband held her down
and she begged him to stop,

1708
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,072
but he swore he'd never do it again?

1709
01:57:13,158 --> 01:57:14,826
What would you tell her?

1710
01:57:17,454 --> 01:57:19,498
If the person she loved...

1711
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,417
was--

1712
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:26,004
was hurting her,
what would you say to her?

1713
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:38,141
I would beg her to leave him.

1714
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:41,019
Yeah.

1715
01:57:42,437 --> 01:57:44,273
And I'd beg her never to go back.

1716
01:57:53,282 --> 01:57:56,410
Wanna go to your mama?
You have such a good mama.

1717
01:57:56,410 --> 01:57:57,494
Here.

1718
01:58:01,456 --> 01:58:04,126
I got you, bug. I got you. Yes, my love.

1719
01:58:04,126 --> 01:58:05,878
Okay. I'm gonna--

1720
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,451
Yeah.

1721
01:58:39,203 --> 01:58:41,705
There you go, bug. Mama's got you.

1722
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,125
Mama's got you.

1723
01:58:47,461 --> 01:58:48,754
Yeah.

1724
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:51,715
Yeah.

1725
01:58:53,133 --> 01:58:55,802
Stops right here, bubba, with you and me.

1726
01:58:59,264 --> 01:59:00,849
It ends with us.

1727
01:59:02,893 --> 01:59:03,936
Okay?

1728
01:59:06,522 --> 01:59:07,856
It ends with us.

1729
01:59:11,276 --> 01:59:13,070
Yeah. Yeah.

1730
01:59:32,506 --> 01:59:33,507
Thank you.

1731
01:59:34,091 --> 01:59:35,509
Mama, I love you.

1732
01:59:38,053 --> 01:59:39,346
I'm so proud of you.

1733
01:59:48,146 --> 01:59:49,940
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1734
01:59:50,524 --> 01:59:52,150
- Be right back.
- Okay.

1735
01:59:57,739 --> 01:59:59,658
Let's go meet your grandpa.

1736
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:04,621
Okay.

1737
02:00:15,174 --> 02:00:16,508
Goodbye, Pops.

1738
02:00:20,637 --> 02:00:21,638
Okay.

1739
02:00:24,975 --> 02:00:26,476
That's enough of that.

1740
02:00:29,313 --> 02:00:30,439
Come on.

1741
02:01:20,864 --> 02:01:22,241
Yeah. You got it.

1742
02:02:13,208 --> 02:02:14,459
- Hi.
- Hi.

1743
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:17,421
How've you--

1744
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:18,839
Was that your daughter?

1745
02:02:20,048 --> 02:02:21,550
Yeah, that's Emmy.

1746
02:02:22,092 --> 02:02:24,928
I saw you guys before.
I just-- I didn't--

1747
02:02:25,554 --> 02:02:26,555
Yeah.

1748
02:02:28,974 --> 02:02:30,392
She's beautiful.

1749
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,352
Thanks.

1750
02:02:34,354 --> 02:02:36,190
Are you still with...

1751
02:02:36,773 --> 02:02:37,900
No.

1752
02:02:38,317 --> 02:02:40,402
No, no, it's... it's just us.

1753
02:02:45,073 --> 02:02:46,074
Wow.

1754
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:54,750
- Are you with anyone?
- How's the store?

1755
02:02:59,129 --> 02:03:00,297
No.

1756
02:03:03,008 --> 02:03:04,051
Not yet.
