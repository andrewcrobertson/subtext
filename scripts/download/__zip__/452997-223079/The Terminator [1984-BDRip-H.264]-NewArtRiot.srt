1
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,297
What the hell?

2
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,999
Goddamn son of a bitch.

3
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:18,044
What the hell?

4
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,076
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,505
Me.

6
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,282
Come on.

7
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,680
What's wrong with this picture?

8
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,925
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,003
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,837
Washday tomorrow.

11
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:48,471
Nothing clean, right?

12
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,140
Nothing clean. Right.

13
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,344
I think this guy's a couple cans
short of a six-pack.

14
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,874
Your clothes.

15
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,185
Give them to me... now.

16
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,746
Fuck you, asshole!

17
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,148
Hey, sugar, how about it?

18
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:38,219
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

19
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,526
She's always after me.

20
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,192
I don't... I don't...

21
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:47,558
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

22
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,698
He the guy?

23
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,327
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

24
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,963
Hey! I said hold it!

25
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,166
Go!

26
00:07:57,808 --> 00:08:00,709
That son of a bitch
took my pants!

27
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,285
What day is it? The date!

28
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,656
The 12th of May. Thursday.

29
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,786
- What year?
- What?

30
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,034
He's got my gun! Let's go!

31
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,630
3831, they lost the suspect.

32
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,944
Guard it for me, big buns.

33
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:09,086
I'm late.

34
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,683
So am I.

35
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,967
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

36
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,603
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

37
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,806
Yes, sir.

38
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:07,176
Who gets the burly beef?

39
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,581
I ordered barbecued beef.

40
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,483
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

41
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,010
He gets the barbecued beef.
Mine's the chili beef deluxe.

42
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,715
Who gets the burly beef?

43
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:15,451
Miss, we're ready to order now.

44
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:16,924
Yes, ma'am.

45
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,122
I'm so sorry.

46
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,994
Oh, lord.

47
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,925
This isn't real leather, is it?

48
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:28,459
This special sucks.

49
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:31,473
Nice going, kid.
Ought to give you the tip.

50
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,968
Look, in a hundred years,
who's going to care?

51
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,416
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

52
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,688
That's Italian.

53
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,285
You can go pump or auto.

54
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,631
The.45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

55
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,362
These are brand-new.
We just got them in.

56
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,562
That's a good gun.

57
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,496
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on...

58
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,564
and you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.

59
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:06,768
You can't miss.

60
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,339
Anything else?

61
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,246
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

62
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:14,943
Just what you see, pal.

63
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,449
The Uzi 9mm.

64
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,252
You know your weapons, buddy.

65
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,622
Any one of these is ideal
for home defense.

66
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,887
So which will it be?

67
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,056
All.

68
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:31,532
I may close early today.

69
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,865
There's a fifteen-day wait
on the handguns...

70
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,030
but the rifles
you can take right now.

71
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,969
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

72
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,896
Hi, baby. Yeah, it's me.

73
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,929
Listen, I need you
to come pick me up.

74
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:13,339
My bike just broke down.

75
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,867
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

76
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,649
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

77
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:15,760
Sarah Connor?

78
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,279
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

79
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:35,586
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. Sort of.

80
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,253
It's so incredible.
You're not gonna believe this.

81
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:42,355
Sit down.
You are going to love this.

82
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:44,229
- Shh!
- What?

83
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,928
...has been compiled
from several witnesses.

84
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:50,200
Once again, Sarah Connor,
thirty-five, mother of two...

85
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,730
brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.

86
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,402
You're dead, honey.

87
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:47,502
Sorry.

88
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:05,589
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one...

89
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,389
and then run my tongue
down your neck...

90
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,896
to your bare, gleaming
breasts...

91
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,955
and then slowly...

92
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,230
slowly pull your jeans off,
inch by inch.

93
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,704
Ginger, it's Matt!

94
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:23,005
And lick your belly in circles,
further and further down...

95
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:26,410
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

96
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:27,744
Who is this?

97
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:36,517
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought you were...

98
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:38,184
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

99
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,852
Sure, Bunky.

100
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,523
It's the creep.

101
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:50,428
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one...

102
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,001
You fucking pigs!

103
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,168
Wait till I get my hands on you!

104
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,201
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

105
00:21:59,213 --> 00:22:00,373
Ed.

106
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,911
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

107
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,317
I can see that.

108
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,685
Sarah Ann Connor,
secretary, thirty-five...

109
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:11,156
shot six times
at less than ten feet.

110
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:12,682
Large caliber weapon.

111
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:14,250
You know, these work.

112
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,424
What's this?

113
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:20,797
Dead girl two, sent over from
Valley division this afternoon.

114
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,801
I'm sure there's a point
to all of this.

115
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,306
Look at the name, Ed.

116
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:32,242
Sarah Louise Connor.
Is this right?

117
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,210
You're kidding me.

118
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,979
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over.

119
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:40,885
A one-day pattern killer.

120
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:42,479
I hate the weird ones.

121
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:48,087
So?

122
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,859
Better than mortal man deserves.

123
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,330
Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?

124
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,843
No, not lately.
Did you check messages?

125
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:05,469
I thought you did.

126
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,951
Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...

127
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:15,012
There you are, young man.

128
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:17,023
You mind your mother.

129
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:23,355
Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.

130
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:26,833
Something's come up.
I can't make it tonight.

131
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,528
Just can't get out of it.

132
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,503
Look, I'm really sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

133
00:23:30,537 --> 00:23:33,370
Call you in a day or so, OK?
Sorry. Bye.

134
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:38,470
That bum.
So what if he has a Porsche?

135
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:39,638
He can't treat you like this.

136
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,443
It's Friday night,
for Christ's sake!

137
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,077
I'll live.

138
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,848
I'll break his kneecaps.

139
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:51,886
Well, Pugsley still loves me,
don't you, baby?

140
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:55,753
God. It's disgusting.

141
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:00,899
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
You and Matt have a good time

142
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,663
We will. You, too.

143
00:24:07,841 --> 00:24:09,331
Damn it, Matt!

144
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:07,798
Oh, shit.

145
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,359
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings...

146
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:11,700
occurred
in the same order...

147
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:13,035
as their listings
in the phone book?

148
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:15,131
Now, what can I tell you guys?
No comment.

149
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,074
But we've got two murders...

150
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:30,581
That coffee's two hours cold.

151
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,783
I put a cigarette out in it.

152
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,192
Did you reach the next girl yet?

153
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:38,322
No. I keep getting
an answering machine.

154
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:39,854
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

155
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:42,129
There's no answer at the door,
and the manager's not home.

156
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,659
- Call her.
- I just called her.

157
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,399
Call her again.

158
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,929
Give me a cigarette.

159
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:00,208
Hi there.

160
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:01,811
Fooled you.

161
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:05,312
You're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's OK.

162
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:07,952
Machines need love, too,
so talk to it.

163
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:14,492
Same shit.

164
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,530
I can hear it now.

165
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,266
He's going to be called
the goddamn "Phone Book Killer."

166
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:23,002
I hate these press cases.

167
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,169
Especially
the weird press cases.

168
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:29,643
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

169
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,877
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

170
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:34,443
If I can get on the tube
by eleven o'clock...

171
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,785
maybe she'll call us.

172
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:39,553
Well, how do I look?

173
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:40,889
Like shit, boss.

174
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,326
Your mama.

175
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:43,988
Lieutenant!

176
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,691
This just in.

177
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,358
Police have announced
the name of the victim...

178
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,334
in the second of
two execution-style murders...

179
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:51,029
which took place today.

180
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,473
The names of the two victims
are virtually identical.

181
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:58,272
Two hours ago,
35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor...

182
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:00,779
was pronounced dead at the scene
in her Santa Monica apartment...

183
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:01,973
Can we change this?

184
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,140
Sarah Louise Connor was slain...

185
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:04,774
Don't touch it!

186
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:06,944
...earlier today in her home.

187
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,419
Now, police
are refusing to speculate...

188
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,218
on the apparent similarity
between these shooting deaths...

189
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,487
and no other connection
between the two victims...

190
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,790
has been established as of yet.

191
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:19,696
We'll have more on this story
as it comes in.

192
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:22,565
A spectacular fire
fueled by solvents, oils...

193
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,433
and other flammable liquids...

194
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,166
swept through an oil company
on North Spring Street...

195
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:30,403
just northeast of Chinatown
Wednesday night.

196
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,584
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back!

197
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,616
Hey! Four fifty.

198
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,263
This is the Los Angeles Police
Department emergency number.

199
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:37,496
Emergency number.

200
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:39,026
All our lines are busy.

201
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,632
If you need a police car sent,
please stay on the line.

202
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,902
Two-eleven in progress...

203
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:46,673
corner of Third and Cameron.

204
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:48,806
Pugsley, shoo! Go on.

205
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,968
I'm going to make a belt
out of you.

206
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:07,157
Don't make me bust you up, man!

207
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,216
Hi there. Fooled you.

208
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,412
Hi there. Fooled you.

209
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:13,687
You're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's OK.

210
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,490
Machines need love, too,
so talk to it...

211
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:19,259
and, Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

212
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:20,596
Wait for the beep.

213
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,396
Ginger, this is Sarah!
Pick up if you're there!

214
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:28,567
I'm at this place on
Pico Boulevard called Technoir.

215
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,405
I'm really scared.

216
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:32,877
I think that
there's somebody's after me.

217
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:35,904
I hope that you play
this back soon.

218
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:38,645
I need you and Matt to come and
pick me up as soon as possible.

219
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:41,051
The police
keep transferring me around.

220
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:42,679
I'm gonna give them another try.

221
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:47,091
The number here is 555-9175.

222
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:49,117
Call me, kiddo.
I need your help.

223
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,477
It's her.

224
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:08,775
It's her.

225
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:10,908
Sarah Connor?
It's Lieutenant Traxler.

226
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,511
Lieutenant, don't put me
on hold or transfer me!

227
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:17,079
I won't. Just relax.
Where are you?

228
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:18,988
In this bar called Technoir.

229
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:21,960
I know. It's on Pico.
Are you all right?

230
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,656
Yeah, but I don't want to leave.

231
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:25,357
I think there's a guy
following me.

232
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:26,763
All right, now listen,
Miss Connor.

233
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,926
Now listen carefully.
You're in a public place...

234
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,459
so you'll be safe till
we get there, but stay visible.

235
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,971
Don't go outside
or even to the rest room.

236
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:34,974
I'll have a car there
in a hot minute.

237
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:01,591
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

238
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:43,759
Come with me
if you want to live.

239
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:53,832
Come on!

240
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,843
This is 1-L19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

241
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:12,612
Suspect vehicle...
late model gray Ford...

242
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,176
headed westbound on Seventh.

243
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,415
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

244
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:18,047
I'm going to need
an ambulance...

245
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,684
at Seventh and Broadway
right now.

246
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:23,188
Hold it!

247
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,126
All units watch
for a late-model gray Ford...

248
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:33,195
last seen westbound
on Seventh and Broadway.

249
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:41,135
Hold on.

250
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,785
Are you injured?

251
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:56,288
Are you shot?

252
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:03,859
Do exactly what I say!

253
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:05,837
Exactly!

254
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:09,569
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

255
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:10,769
Do you understand?

256
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:13,869
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Yes!

257
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,778
Please, don't hurt me.

258
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,530
I'm here to help you.

259
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,935
I'm Reese, Sergeant Techcom,
BN38416...

260
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:40,370
assigned to protect you.

261
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:42,101
You've been targeted
for termination.

262
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:52,141
Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.

263
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:54,016
This is 1-L19.

264
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:56,248
Westbound on Olympic
approaching Overland.

265
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:03,361
This is a mistake.

266
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:04,863
I didn't do anything.

267
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,592
No, but you will.

268
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:08,827
It's very important
that you live.

269
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:10,495
This isn't true.

270
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,299
How could that man
just get up after you...

271
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:15,307
He's not a man... a machine.

272
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:18,902
A Terminator.
A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.

273
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:29,385
A machine?

274
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:31,083
Like a robot?

275
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:34,525
Not a robot. A cyborg.

276
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,754
A cybernetic organism.

277
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:38,730
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

278
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:43,168
Get your head down!

279
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,537
All right, listen.

280
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:31,641
The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

281
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,049
part man, part machine.

282
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:35,679
Underneath, it's a hyperalloy
combat chassis...

283
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,919
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored... very tough.

284
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:42,689
But outside,
it's living human tissue...

285
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:47,222
flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

286
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:49,166
- Look, I don't know what...
- Pay attention!

287
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:51,193
I got to ditch this car.

288
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:59,310
The 600 series had rubber skin.

289
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:02,314
We spotted them easy,
but these are new.

290
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:03,815
They look human...

291
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:06,181
sweat, bad breath, everything.

292
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,584
Very hard to spot.

293
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,145
I had to wait till he moved
on you before I could zero him.

294
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:13,019
Look...

295
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:14,959
I am not stupid, you know.

296
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:17,053
They cannot make things
like that yet.

297
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,462
Not yet.

298
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,159
Not for about forty years.

299
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:25,830
Are you saying
it's from the future?

300
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:28,931
One possible future.

301
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:31,569
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

302
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:35,737
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

303
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,976
- Right.
- Right.

304
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:48,223
Cyborgs don't feel pain.

305
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:51,788
I do. Don't do that again.

306
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:55,665
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand!

307
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,135
That Terminator is out there.

308
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:01,401
It can't be bargained with.

309
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,237
It can't be reasoned with.

310
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:08,145
It doesn't feel
pity or remorse or fear.

311
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,708
And it absolutely
will not stop ever!

312
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:14,219
Until you are dead.

313
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,720
Can you stop it?

314
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,659
I don't know.

315
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:35,940
With these weapons,
I don't know.

316
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:55,289
All units. Gray Ford suspect
vehicle has been found...

317
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,728
in a parking structure
at Fourth and Beaudry.

318
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:44,404
Why me?

319
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:48,303
Why does it want me?

320
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,647
There was a nuclear war...

321
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,653
a few years from now.

322
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:05,920
All this...

323
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:07,990
this whole place, everything...

324
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:10,566
it's gone.

325
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,938
Just gone.

326
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,737
There were survivors.

327
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:19,176
Here, there.

328
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:23,175
Nobody even knew who started it.

329
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,753
It was the machines, Sarah.

330
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,654
I don't understand.

331
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,817
Defense network computers...

332
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,154
New... powerful

333
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,159
Hooked into everything.

334
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,792
Trusted to run it all.

335
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:46,568
They say it got smart...

336
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:50,234
a new order of intelligence.

337
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:51,800
Then it saw all people
as a threat...

338
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,812
not just the ones
on the other side.

339
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:58,046
Decided our fate
in a microsecond...

340
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,586
extermination.

341
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:17,757
Did you see this war?

342
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:35,111
I grew up after it
in the ruins...

343
00:46:35,152 --> 00:46:38,315
starving, hiding from HKs.

344
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:40,290
- HKs?
- Hunter-Killers...

345
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:44,327
patrol machines
built in automated factories.

346
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,056
Most of us were rounded up...

347
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:49,623
put in camps
for orderly disposal.

348
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,131
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

349
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:00,341
Some of us were kept alive...

350
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:03,108
to work...

351
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,910
loading bodies.

352
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,710
The disposal units
ran night and day.

353
00:47:08,753 --> 00:47:11,881
We were that close
to going out forever.

354
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:18,028
But there was one man
who taught us to fight...

355
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:20,656
to storm the wire
of the camps...

356
00:47:20,698 --> 00:47:25,192
to smash those
metal motherfuckers into junk.

357
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:27,295
He turned it around.

358
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:28,805
He brought us back
from the brink.

359
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:31,569
His name is Connor...

360
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:33,270
John Connor.

361
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,743
Your son, Sarah.

362
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,674
Your unborn son.

363
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:28,958
Drive!

364
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:01,918
- They'll kill you.
- You in the Cadillac!

365
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:03,324
Let me see your hands now!

366
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,490
Get out of the car!

367
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:13,534
Drop to your knees!

368
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:14,970
Out of the car.

369
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:16,495
Drop to the ground.

370
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:49,329
Sarah,
try to drink some of this.

371
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,703
Listen, are you sure it's them?

372
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:57,839
Maybe I should look
at the bodies.

373
00:50:57,882 --> 00:51:00,043
No. They've been identified.
There's no doubt.

374
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:01,949
Oh, God.

375
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:13,620
Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.

376
00:51:13,664 --> 00:51:14,858
Hi, Sarah.

377
00:51:14,899 --> 00:51:17,629
I want you to tell him
everything Reese told you.

378
00:51:17,668 --> 00:51:19,033
Do you feel up to that?

379
00:51:19,069 --> 00:51:21,162
I guess so.

380
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:24,400
You're a doctor?

381
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,001
Criminal psychologist.

382
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,375
Is Reese crazy?

383
00:51:28,412 --> 00:51:31,982
That's what
we're gonna find out.

384
00:52:56,332 --> 00:53:00,029
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

385
00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:04,197
With the 132nd, under Perry.

386
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,936
From 21 to 27.

387
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,843
That's the year 2027?

388
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:11,870
That's right.
And I was assigned...

389
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:13,348
This is fucking great.

390
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:15,817
...the last two years
under John Connor.

391
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:17,114
Who was the enemy again?

392
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,054
A computer defense system
built for...

393
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,648
Damn. Sorry.

394
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:25,149
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

395
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:26,662
I see.

396
00:53:26,696 --> 00:53:30,325
And this computer
thinks it can win...

397
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:33,335
by killing
the mother of its enemy.

398
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,600
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived...

399
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,971
a sort of retroactive abortion?

400
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,303
That guy Silberman
cracks me up.

401
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,040
Last week, he had this guy
in here that burned his Afghan.

402
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,877
Screwed it first,
then he set it on fire.

403
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:46,973
Shut up.

404
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,177
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

405
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:51,744
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

406
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:53,346
It had no choice.

407
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:56,256
Their defense grid was smashed.

408
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:57,782
We'd won.

409
00:53:57,827 --> 00:54:00,694
Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

410
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,756
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

411
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,995
Is that when you
captured the lab complex...

412
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,798
and found that...
What is it called?

413
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:11,170
The time displacement equipment?

414
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:15,541
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

415
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:18,513
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

416
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,516
How are you supposed get back?

417
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,415
I can't.

418
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,915
Nobody goes home.

419
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:30,654
Nobody else comes through.

420
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:34,693
It's just him... and me.

421
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:21,644
It's just him... and me.

422
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:27,018
Why didn't you bring
any weapons...

423
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,953
something more advanced?

424
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:32,651
Don't you have ray guns?

425
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:34,249
Ray guns.

426
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,659
Show me a piece
of future technology.

427
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:38,560
You go naked.

428
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:40,861
Something about the field
generated by a living organism.

429
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:43,493
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

430
00:56:43,535 --> 00:56:45,730
I didn't build
the fucking thing!

431
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:50,265
OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...

432
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,571
Surrounded by living tissue!

433
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,975
Right.

434
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:54,274
This is great stuff.

435
00:56:54,313 --> 00:56:56,281
I could make a career
out of this guy.

436
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:57,976
You see how clever
this part is?

437
00:56:58,017 --> 00:56:59,746
How it doesn't require
a shred of proof?

438
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:01,548
Most paranoid delusions
are intricate...

439
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:03,521
but this is brilliant.

440
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:06,353
Why were the other
two women killed?

441
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:09,156
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

442
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:11,719
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

443
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:15,666
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

444
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:18,135
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

445
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,762
Well, let's go back to...

446
00:57:19,805 --> 00:57:22,899
Look, you have heard enough!
I have answered your questions!

447
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:25,000
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

448
00:57:25,044 --> 00:57:27,069
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

449
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:28,704
Then why am I talking to you?

450
00:57:28,747 --> 00:57:30,408
Because I can help you.

451
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:32,440
Who is in authority here?
Shut up!

452
00:57:32,484 --> 00:57:36,045
You still don't get it, do you?

453
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:37,851
He'll find her.

454
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,755
That's what he does!

455
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:41,487
That's all he does!

456
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:43,461
You can't stop him!

457
00:57:43,495 --> 00:57:45,326
He'll wade through you,
reach down her throat...

458
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:47,229
and pull her fucking heart out!

459
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:48,494
Doc.

460
00:57:48,534 --> 00:57:49,865
Let go of me...

461
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:54,672
Sorry.

462
00:57:59,878 --> 00:58:01,607
So, Reese is crazy?

463
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:05,139
In technical terminology...
he's a loon.

464
00:58:05,184 --> 00:58:09,553
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

465
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:11,522
Our TAC guys wear these.

466
00:58:11,557 --> 00:58:13,718
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

467
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:16,227
This other individual must have
worn one under his coat.

468
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:17,990
Feel that. Go ahead.

469
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:21,732
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

470
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:23,701
He was probably on PCP.

471
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:26,795
Broke every bone in his hand
and wouldn't feel it for hours.

472
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:28,602
There was this guy once...
See this scar?

473
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,835
- Here.
- Thank you.

474
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:32,639
There's a couch
in this other room.

475
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:35,203
Why don't you stretch out
and try to get some sleep?

476
00:58:35,247 --> 00:58:38,011
It'll be an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

477
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,042
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

478
00:58:41,086 --> 00:58:45,147
It may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

479
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:48,853
You'll be perfectly safe.

480
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:51,761
We got 30 cops in this building.

481
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:53,287
Thank you.

482
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:01,161
Good night.

483
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:18,089
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

484
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:20,421
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

485
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:22,552
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

486
00:59:22,594 --> 00:59:23,686
Where is she?

487
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:25,697
Look, it may take a while.

488
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,926
If you want to wait,
there's a bench over there.

489
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,744
I'll be back.

490
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:10,131
What the hell was that?

491
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:19,677
Gunshot!

492
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:30,554
What is it, terrorists?

493
01:00:30,596 --> 01:00:32,063
Let's go! Let's go!

494
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:37,662
Stay here.

495
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:54,684
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

496
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,381
He's got an automatic weapon!

497
01:00:57,856 --> 01:00:59,847
Move it, move it!

498
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,700
What the hell
happened to the lights?

499
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,032
Watch him.

500
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:40,726
Automatic weapons!

501
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:42,290
Lock and load! Let's go!

502
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,452
Fire! Fire!

503
01:03:05,016 --> 01:03:06,483
This way.

504
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:49,026
KFLB Newstime 4:36.

505
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,358
In the top story of the hour...

506
01:03:51,396 --> 01:03:54,058
the largest single
law enforcement mobilization...

507
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:56,533
in California history
is currently underway.

508
01:03:56,568 --> 01:03:58,160
Police in
five southern counties...

509
01:03:58,203 --> 01:04:00,296
are engaged in a massive manhunt
for an unident...

510
01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:05,065
Take this.

511
01:04:07,946 --> 01:04:10,574
All right,
let's get this off the road.

512
01:04:41,813 --> 01:04:45,112
- You cold?
- Freezing.

513
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:03,094
You got a first name?

514
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:05,364
Kyle.

515
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:07,428
Kyle...

516
01:05:07,472 --> 01:05:10,100
what's it like
when you go through time?

517
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:14,100
White light.

518
01:05:17,115 --> 01:05:18,605
Pain.

519
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,087
It's like being born maybe.

520
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:25,954
Oh, my God.

521
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,857
I caught one back there.

522
01:05:28,893 --> 01:05:31,760
You mean you got shot?

523
01:05:31,796 --> 01:05:33,058
It's not bad.

524
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:35,531
We got to get you to a doctor.

525
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:37,535
It's OK. Forget it.

526
01:05:37,569 --> 01:05:40,538
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?

527
01:05:40,572 --> 01:05:42,699
Take this off.

528
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:56,350
Jesus.

529
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,049
See, it passed
right through the meat.

530
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,354
This is going to make me puke.

531
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:03,656
Would you talk about something?

532
01:06:03,695 --> 01:06:05,060
What?

533
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:07,428
I don't know.
Anything. Just talk.

534
01:06:07,465 --> 01:06:09,592
Tell me about my son.

535
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:12,603
He's about my height.

536
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:18,098
He has your eyes.

537
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,072
What's he like?

538
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:25,582
You trust him.

539
01:06:25,617 --> 01:06:27,983
He's got a strength.

540
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:30,817
I'd die for John Connor.

541
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:37,187
Well... at least now
I know what to name him.

542
01:06:37,228 --> 01:06:40,129
I don't suppose
you know who the father is...

543
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:43,031
so I won't tell him
to get lost when I meet him.

544
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:45,535
John never said much about him.

545
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,538
I know he dies before the war...

546
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:49,062
Wait!

547
01:06:50,575 --> 01:06:52,668
I don't want to know.

548
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,544
So, was it John
that sent you here?

549
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:58,071
I volunteered.

550
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,744
Why?

551
01:07:00,785 --> 01:07:04,551
It was a chance
to meet the legend...

552
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:06,523
Sarah Connor.

553
01:07:06,557 --> 01:07:11,756
Taught her son to fight,
organize...

554
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:14,060
prepare from when he was a kid.

555
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:16,589
When you were in hiding
before the war...

556
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:22,198
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet...

557
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,639
in the past tense.

558
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:25,973
It's driving me crazy.

559
01:07:29,614 --> 01:07:32,515
Are you sure
you have the right person?

560
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,017
I'm sure.

561
01:07:34,052 --> 01:07:35,519
Come on.

562
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:38,351
Do I look like
the mother of the future?

563
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:42,526
Am I tough, organized?

564
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,051
I can't even
balance my checkbook.

565
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:50,891
Look, Reese,
I didn't ask for this honor...

566
01:07:50,935 --> 01:07:53,563
and I don't want it!
Any of it!

567
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:59,501
Your son gave me a message
to give to you.

568
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,171
Made me memorize it.

569
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:05,308
Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.

570
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,443
I can't help you with
what you must soon face...

571
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:10,079
except to say that
the future is not set.

572
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:12,749
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

573
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:16,556
You must survive,
or I will never exist.

574
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,391
That's all.

575
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:22,566
That's a good field dressing.

576
01:08:24,102 --> 01:08:26,070
You like it?

577
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:28,402
It's my first.

578
01:08:31,709 --> 01:08:34,542
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

579
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,552
Talk to me some more.

580
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:58,034
About what?

581
01:08:58,069 --> 01:09:00,560
Tell me about where you're from.

582
01:09:03,074 --> 01:09:04,564
All right.

583
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:08,602
You stay down by day...

584
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:11,114
but at night
you can move around.

585
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:14,778
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

586
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:19,522
But they're not too bright.

587
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:23,049
John taught us ways
to dust them.

588
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:26,494
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

589
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,259
The Terminators
were the newest...

590
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:29,732
the worst.

591
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:41,875
Traversing your sector
in search mode.

592
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:45,006
750 meters north
of your position.

593
01:09:45,049 --> 01:09:47,415
Understand. 750 meters north.

594
01:09:49,053 --> 01:09:50,645
Let's go.

595
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,519
Intercept. Over.

596
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:55,252
Take it easy.
Finish your sweep.

597
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:57,522
They are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.

598
01:09:57,561 --> 01:09:59,028
Avoid contact.

599
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:00,963
Repeat, avoid contact.

600
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:02,522
We'll get them later.

601
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,557
Roger, Echo Leader.

602
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:12,303
Sector niner,
what's your status?

603
01:10:12,343 --> 01:10:14,072
Situation normal.

604
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,544
We're coming in.

605
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,575
Roger.

606
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:33,029
Firebase,
what's your status? Over.

607
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:37,797
Reese. BN384.

608
01:10:37,835 --> 01:10:39,325
Right. Let him in.

609
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:46,510
Any infiltrators
at the shopping mall?

610
01:10:46,544 --> 01:10:49,513
No problem.
They were clean.

611
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:52,516
We're cutting short
the patrol. Over.

612
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,042
Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.

613
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:13,223
Terminator!

614
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,404
I was dreaming about dogs.

615
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:37,039
We use them
to spot Terminators.

616
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:39,743
Your world is pretty terrifying.

617
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:22,820
Buddy, you got a dead cat
in there, or what?

618
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:32,293
Fuck you, asshole.

619
01:14:51,455 --> 01:14:53,184
God damn!

620
01:14:53,257 --> 01:14:55,691
Thank you.

621
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,593
Is this enough?

622
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:04,100
Yeah, it's enough.

623
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:07,035
I don't want to ask
where you got it.

624
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,274
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

625
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:16,370
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

626
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:18,005
Do you have one
with a kitchen?

627
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:36,088
I am dying for a shower.

628
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,569
We should check
your bandage, too.

629
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:43,732
Later. I'm going out
for supplies.

630
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:49,942
Keep this.

631
01:16:15,973 --> 01:16:17,736
No, I can't tell you
where I am, Mom.

632
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:19,742
I was told not to say.

633
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,437
Honey, I need to know
where I can reach you.

634
01:16:21,478 --> 01:16:24,174
You tell me to hide up at
the cabin like some fugitive...

635
01:16:24,214 --> 01:16:27,149
and you won't tell me
what's going on?

636
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:29,084
I am worried sick, dear.

637
01:16:32,656 --> 01:16:33,602
Here's the number. Ready?

638
01:16:33,637 --> 01:16:34,549
Here's the number. Ready?

639
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,558
Yes. Go ahead.

640
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:41,552
It's 408-555-1439.

641
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,565
Room nine. Got it?

642
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,827
I've got it.

643
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,164
I've got to go.

644
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:49,569
I'm sorry I can't
tell you more right now.

645
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,095
I love you, Mom.

646
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,101
I love you, too, sweetheart.

647
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:11,955
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address.

648
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,621
What have we got?

649
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,626
Mothballs.

650
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,099
Corn syrup.

651
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,608
Ammonia.

652
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,610
What's for dinner?

653
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,111
Plastique.

654
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,114
That sounds good.

655
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,547
What is it?

656
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,550
Nitroglycerin, basically.

657
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,552
It's a bit more stable.

658
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,111
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

659
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:55,064
Make sure there's none
on the threads.

660
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:57,265
Like this.

661
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,371
Screw the end cap on.

662
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,612
Very gently.

663
01:18:07,483 --> 01:18:10,008
You must have had
a fun childhood.

664
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:15,557
That's good.

665
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,320
All right.
Six more like that...

666
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,328
and I'll get started
on the fuses.

667
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,137
He'll find us, won't he?

668
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,567
Probably.

669
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,597
It'll never be over, will it?

670
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:08,577
Look at me. I'm shaking.

671
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,580
Some legend, huh?

672
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:15,072
You must be
pretty disappointed.

673
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:18,609
No. I'm not.

674
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,532
The women in your time...

675
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,559
what are they like?

676
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:39,041
Good fighters.

677
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,066
That's not what I meant.

678
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,739
Was there someone special?

679
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:49,715
Someone?

680
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:51,583
A girl. You know.

681
01:19:57,593 --> 01:19:59,083
Never.

682
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,086
Never?

683
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,961
I'm sorry.

684
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,995
I'm so sorry.

685
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:16,639
So much pain.

686
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,375
Pain can be controlled.

687
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:21,610
You just disconnect it.

688
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,675
So you feel nothing?

689
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,652
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

690
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,728
I didn't know why at the time.

691
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:38,130
It was very old...

692
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,762
torn...

693
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:43,294
faded.

694
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,739
You were young like you are now.

695
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:53,373
You seemed just a little sad.

696
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:58,352
I always wondered what you
were thinking at that moment.

697
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:02,255
I memorized every line...

698
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,225
every curve.

699
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,857
I came across time
for you, Sarah.

700
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,890
I love you.

701
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,028
I always have.

702
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:35,747
I shouldn't have said that.

703
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:07,943
Think fast!

704
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,233
Trade places!

705
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,948
Faster! Drive faster!

706
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,740
Oh, my God!

707
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,391
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

708
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,737
You stay here.

709
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,762
Let's get out of here.

710
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,864
Get out.

711
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,726
Kyle! Come on! Get up!

712
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:55,430
He's coming! Kyle!

713
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,869
Come on!

714
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,840
Help me! Get out!

715
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,504
Get out!

716
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,479
Come on!

717
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,252
Faster!

718
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,532
Don't stop! Run!

719
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,139
We did it, Kyle.

720
01:30:55,182 --> 01:30:56,672
We got it.

721
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:16,456
Wait!

722
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,468
What are you doing?

723
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:25,903
Cover... so he can't track us.

724
01:32:36,316 --> 01:32:39,843
Come on!

725
01:32:39,886 --> 01:32:41,353
No, Kyle!

726
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:44,115
Come on!

727
01:32:44,157 --> 01:32:45,852
Leave me here.

728
01:32:45,892 --> 01:32:47,325
Get up!

729
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:58,928
Move it, Reese!

730
01:32:58,972 --> 01:33:01,702
On your feet, soldier!

731
01:33:01,741 --> 01:33:05,268
On your feet! Move it!

732
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,241
Back. Go back.

733
01:34:53,586 --> 01:34:55,781
Run, Sarah.

734
01:34:55,822 --> 01:34:57,517
Run!

735
01:35:02,895 --> 01:35:04,419
Come on, motherfucker.

736
01:38:57,429 --> 01:38:59,761
You're terminated, fucker.

737
01:40:19,711 --> 01:40:22,111
Tape 7, November 10.

738
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:23,774
Where was I?

739
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:27,076
What's most difficult for me
is trying to decide...

740
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:29,019
what to tell you
and what not to.

741
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:30,919
But I guess
I have a while yet...

742
01:40:30,956 --> 01:40:33,857
before you're old enough
to even understand these tapes.

743
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:35,587
They're more for me
at this point...

744
01:40:35,627 --> 01:40:38,960
just so that
I can get it straight.

745
01:41:14,933 --> 01:41:16,195
Fill her up.

746
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:23,003
Should I tell you
about your father?

747
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:25,202
Boy, that's a tough one.

748
01:41:26,712 --> 01:41:29,237
Will it affect your decision
to send him here...

749
01:41:29,281 --> 01:41:32,182
knowing that he is your father?

750
01:41:32,217 --> 01:41:36,153
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

751
01:41:36,188 --> 01:41:39,715
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

752
01:41:43,261 --> 01:41:46,196
I suppose I will tell you.

753
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:48,722
I owe him that.

754
01:41:50,736 --> 01:41:53,705
Maybe it'll help if...

755
01:41:53,739 --> 01:41:58,574
you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

756
01:42:00,746 --> 01:42:03,544
we loved a lifetime's worth.

757
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:17,729
What did he just say?

758
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:19,731
He says
you're very beautiful...

759
01:42:19,765 --> 01:42:21,164
and he's ashamed to ask you...

760
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:23,099
for five American dollars
for his picture...

761
01:42:23,135 --> 01:42:26,730
but if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

762
01:42:26,772 --> 01:42:28,399
Pretty good hustle, kid.

763
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,390
What did he just say?

764
01:42:47,426 --> 01:42:50,224
He said
there's a storm coming in.

765
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:56,223
I know.
