1
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,023
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,039
What the hell...?

3
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,513
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,900
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,910
Nice night for a walk?

6
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,958
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:39,296
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,006
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:44,218
I think this guy's a couple of cans
short of a six-pack.

10
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:49,056
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

11
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,724
Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:38,457
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

13
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,586
See that guy?

14
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,837
Hold it right there.

15
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,839
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it!

16
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,174
Go!

17
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,679
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

18
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,559
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

19
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,519
- Thursday.
- What year?

20
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,035
He's got my gun. Let's go.

21
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,629
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

22
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,092
Hi. I'm late.

23
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,678
So am I.

24
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,182
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

25
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,899
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,444
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

27
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,655
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

28
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,533
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly-beef?

29
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,536
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,540
I'm so sorry.

31
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,586
This isn't real leather, is it?

32
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,051
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

33
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:28,223
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

34
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,775
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

35
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,781
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

36
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,493
The .45 long slide with laser sighting.

37
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,955
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

38
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,416
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

39
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,418
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

40
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,086
You can't miss.

41
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:04,092
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

42
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,886
Hey, just what you see, pal.

43
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,430
The Uzi nine millimeter.

44
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,225
You know your weapons, buddy.

45
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,561
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

46
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,774
So which Will it be?

47
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,444
- All.
- I may close early today.

48
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,948
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

49
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,118
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

50
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,940
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

51
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:04,403
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

52
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,822
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

53
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:12,619
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

54
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,049
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

55
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:23,106
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

56
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,651
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

57
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:34,451
So incredible. You're not gonna believe
this. Sit, you're going to love this.

58
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,746
- What?
- <i>...compiled from several witnesses.</i>

59
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,082
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,</i>

60
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,585
<i>brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.</i>

61
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,545
You're dead, honey.

62
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,949
<i>...if you're into sound,</i>

63
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:05,453
<i>for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>

64
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,833
<i>We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>

65
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,502
<i>We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...</i>

66
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,319
Sorry.

67
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:52,167
Hello?

68
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,379
<i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one,</i>

69
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,967
<i>then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>

70
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:06,848
<i>And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans off inch by inch.</i>

71
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:09,768
Ginger, it's Matt.

72
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:13,855
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

73
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,275
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

74
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,735
Who is this?

75
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,322
God. Sarah?

76
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,117
<i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:29,078
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

78
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,830
Sure.

79
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,043
It's the creep.

80
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:37,712
Hello?

81
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,424
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

82
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:48,348
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

83
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,601
Ed.

84
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,939
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

85
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:59,609
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

86
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,613
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

87
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,573
You know, these work.

88
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,619
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

89
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,455
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

90
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,709
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

91
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,878
Look at the name, Ed.

92
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,216
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

93
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,094
You're kidding me.

94
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,847
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

95
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:33,351
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

96
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,816
So...

97
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,611
Better than mortal man deserves.

98
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,248
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

99
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,250
I thought you did.

100
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:05,884
- <i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>
- <i>There you are,</i> young <i>man.</i>

101
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,219
You mind your mother.

102
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:15,977
<i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.</i>

103
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,397
<i>Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>

104
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:24,319
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up
to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>

105
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,490
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

106
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:33,119
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

107
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:36,205
I'll live.

108
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:38,458
I'll break his kneecaps.

109
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,546
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

110
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,758
God. It's disgusting.

111
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,554
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

112
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,641
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

113
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,813
Damn it, Matt.

114
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:00,331
- Oh, shit.
- Lieutenant!

115
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:04,002
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

116
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:07,088
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

117
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,644
That coffee's two hours cold.

118
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,814
I put a cigarette out in it.

119
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,318
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

120
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:31,779
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

121
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:34,115
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

122
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,492
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

123
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,203
Give me a cigarette.

124
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:54,177
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

125
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:59,015
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need
love, too, so talk to it...</i>

126
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:05,813
Same shit.

127
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,235
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

128
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:16,657
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

129
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,620
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

130
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,955
Maybe make these jackals work for us
for a change.

131
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:27,668
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

132
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,421
Well, how do I look?

133
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,883
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

134
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,179
<i>This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim</i>

135
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:42,391
<i>in the second of two execution
style murders which took place today.</i>

136
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,354
<i>Incredibly, the names of the
two victims are virtually identical.</i>

137
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:51,067
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...</i>

138
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,028
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise Connor...

139
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,780
Don't touch it!

140
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:02,411
<i>Police are refusing to speculate on the
similarity between the shooting deaths</i>

141
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:06,666
<i>and no other connection between the
two victims has been established yet.</i>

142
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,211
<i>We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

143
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,638
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

144
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,098
Hey, $4.50.

145
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,557
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department emergency number.</i>

146
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:33,521
<i>All lines are busy. If you need a police
car sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>

147
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,170
Pugsley! Shoo!

148
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,964
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

149
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,606
Don't make me bust you up, man.

150
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,962
<i>Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.</i>

151
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,006
<i>But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.</i>

152
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:10,136
<i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.</i>

153
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,804
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

154
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,266
<i>Ginger, this is Sarah.
Pick up if you're there.</i>

155
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:21,272
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>

156
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:26,360
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

157
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,655
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

158
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,534
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

159
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,955
<i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>

160
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,040
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

161
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,476
<i>It's her.</i>

162
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,979
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

163
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,399
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

164
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,068
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

165
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:12,072
- <i>I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i> I <i>know it. It's on</i> Pico.

166
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,783
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

167
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,829
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

168
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,373
You're in a public place so
you'll be safe till we get there.

169
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,834
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

170
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,754
<i>- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.</i>

171
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,988
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

172
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,692
Come with me if you wanna live.

173
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,827
Come on!

174
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,694
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

175
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:05,199
Suspect vehicle: late model
gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

176
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,701
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

177
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,663
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

178
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,041
Hold it!

179
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,100
Hold on.

180
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,741
Are you injured? Are you shot?

181
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:56,667
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

182
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,379
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

183
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,964
Do you understand?

184
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:06,510
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Please don't hurt me.

185
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,446
I'm hereto help you.

186
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:31,201
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

187
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,078
You've been targeted for termination.

188
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,634
This is one-L-19. Westbound
on Olympic, approaching Overland.

189
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,767
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

190
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:59,646
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

191
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:03,191
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

192
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,736
It's not a man. A machine.

193
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,865
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

194
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:21,960
A machine? Like a robot?

195
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:26,632
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

196
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:29,718
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

197
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,139
Get your head down!

198
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,185
All right, listen.

199
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:24,731
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

200
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:28,986
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat
chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

201
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:33,782
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

202
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:38,036
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

203
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:40,747
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

204
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:42,207
I gotta ditch this car.

205
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,009
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

206
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:54,636
But these are new. They look human.

207
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,432
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

208
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:02,310
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

209
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:07,941
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

210
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:12,154
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

211
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:16,700
Are you saying it's from the future?

212
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,952
One possible future.

213
00:42:19,953 --> 00:42:23,248
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

214
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,626
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

215
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:28,920
- Right.
- Right.

216
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:42,476
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

217
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:46,480
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

218
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:50,400
That Terminator is out there.

219
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:54,237
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

220
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:59,117
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

221
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:05,165
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever, until you are dead.

222
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,219
Can you stop it?

223
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,808
I don't know.

224
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:26,937
With these weapons, I don't know.

225
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:47,749
<i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure...</i>

226
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:35,672
Reese, why me?

227
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,301
Why does it want me?

228
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,101
There was a nuclear war.

229
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,898
A few years from now...

230
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:59,362
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

231
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:04,868
...it's gone. Just gone.

232
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,621
There were survivors.

233
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:10,790
Here, there.

234
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,045
Nobody even knew who started it.

235
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:22,469
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

236
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,764
Defense network computers.

237
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,100
New, powerful...

238
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:34,522
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

239
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:39,736
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

240
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,658
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

241
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,454
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

242
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:52,874
Extermination.

243
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,765
Did you see this war?

244
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:25,991
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

245
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:29,202
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

246
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,372
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

247
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,293
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

248
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:40,714
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

249
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:45,051
This was burned in by laser scanner.

250
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:53,560
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

251
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,895
Loading bodies.

252
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,733
The disposal units ran night and day.

253
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:02,777
We were that close
to going out forever.

254
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,743
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

255
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,828
To storm the wire of the camps.

256
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,290
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

257
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:19,669
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

258
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:24,090
His name was Connor. John Connor.

259
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:28,720
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

260
00:49:18,496 --> 00:49:19,497
Drive!

261
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:27,881
Reese!

262
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,883
Reese!

263
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,279
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

264
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,282
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

265
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,453
Get out of the car.

266
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,417
Drop to your knees.

267
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,212
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

268
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,453
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

269
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:45,625
Listen, are you sure it's them?

270
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,586
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

271
00:50:48,753 --> 00:50:51,631
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

272
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:57,345
Ginger.

273
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,392
- Kiddo.
- Sarah...

274
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,728
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

275
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:09,941
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

276
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,193
Yeah, I guess so.

277
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,824
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

278
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:22,203
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

279
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:50,917
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

280
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:57,465
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

281
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,718
That's the year 2027?

282
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,970
<i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>

283
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:06,766
<i>- This is fucking great.
- ...under John Connor.</i>

284
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,019
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built...

285
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,730
Goddamn. Sorry.

286
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:16,234
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

287
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,361
I see.

288
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:24,409
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

289
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:27,787
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

290
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,039
A sort of retroactive abortion?

291
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,086
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

292
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,755
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

293
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:40,258
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

294
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,969
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

295
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,223
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

296
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,811
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

297
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,772
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

298
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:59,986
Is that when you captured the lab
complex and found... What is it called?

299
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,321
The time displacement equipment?

300
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:06,534
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

301
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,579
Connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place.

302
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,581
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

303
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,167
I can't.

304
00:54:15,668 --> 00:54:21,257
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

305
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,094
It's just him and me.

306
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,368
<i>It's just him and me.</i>

307
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:20,418
<i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.</i>

308
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,546
<i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>

309
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,383
- <i>Ray</i> guns.
<i>- Show me a piece of future technology.</i>

310
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,929
<i>You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.</i>

311
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:34,140
<i>- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?</i>

312
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,975
<i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>

313
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:40,897
<i>OK, OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...?</i>

314
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,482
<i>- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.</i>

315
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:47,028
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

316
00:56:47,194 --> 00:56:49,989
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

317
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,618
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

318
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:59,916
<i>- Why were the other two women killed?
- Most records were lost in the war.</i>

319
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:02,668
<i>Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.</i>

320
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:06,255
<i>Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.</i>

321
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,508
<i>The Terminator was
just being systematic.</i>

322
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:12,511
<i>- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.</i>

323
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:15,640
<i>I have answered your questions,
now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>

324
00:57:15,806 --> 00:57:19,769
<i>- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?</i>

325
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,771
<i>- Who is in authority here?
- Please...</i>

326
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,481
<i>Shut up!</i>

327
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:26,859
<i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>

328
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:32,114
<i>He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.</i>

329
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:34,033
<i>You can't stop him.</i>

330
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,828
<i>He'll reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out!</i>

331
00:57:37,995 --> 00:57:40,957
<i>- Doc.
- Let go of me!</i>

332
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:45,419
Sorry.

333
00:57:50,841 --> 00:57:52,218
So Reese is crazy?

334
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,888
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

335
00:57:56,722 --> 00:58:02,186
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

336
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,480
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

337
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,857
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

338
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:08,693
Feel that. Go ahead.

339
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,573
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

340
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,410
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

341
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:19,161
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

342
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,746
- Here.
- Thank you.

343
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:25,918
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

344
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,421
Be at least an hour before
your mother gets here from Big Bear.

345
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:31,674
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

346
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,095
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

347
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:41,892
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

348
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,020
Thank you.

349
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:52,319
- Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,796
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

351
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:13,132
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

352
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,425
Where is she?

353
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:18,179
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

354
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,233
I'll be back.

355
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:22,243
- Are they terrorists?
- Let's go, let's go!

356
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,290
Stay here.

357
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,056
Let's get outta here!

358
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:09,623
Watch him.

359
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,817
Ed...

360
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:21,028
Hey!

361
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:49,181
Sarah!

362
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,850
Reese.

363
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:56,939
This way.

364
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,399
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

365
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,278

368
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:55,748
Take this.

369
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:00,544
All right,
let's get this off the road.

370
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:35,412
- You cold?
- Freezing.

371
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,552
Reese?

372
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:56,183
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

373
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:00,646
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

374
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,317
White light.

375
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,113
Pain.

376
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,662
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

377
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,498
I caught one back there.

378
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,836
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

379
01:05:24,711 --> 01:05:28,173
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

380
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:33,011
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

381
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,276
Jesus.

382
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,320
See? It passed right through the meat.

383
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,114
This is gonna make me puke.

384
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,659
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

385
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,288
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

386
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,708
He's about my height.

387
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:08,380
He has your eyes.

388
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,302
What's he like?

389
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:17,764
You trust him. He's got a strength.

390
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,351
I'd die for John Connor.

391
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,900
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

392
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:33,822
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

393
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:36,742
John never said much about him.

394
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,411
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

395
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,123
I don't wanna know.

396
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:47,127
So was it John that sent you here?

397
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:49,379
I volunteered.

398
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:54,426
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

399
01:06:55,511 --> 01:07:02,351
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

400
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,603
prepare from when he was a kid.

401
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,813
When you were in hiding before the war.

402
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:14,363
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

403
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,406
It's driving me crazy.

404
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,038
Are you sure you have the right person?

405
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,249
I'm sure.

406
01:07:25,415 --> 01:07:29,127
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

407
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:35,801
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

408
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:42,724
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

409
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,351
Any of it.

410
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:51,858
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

411
01:07:53,193 --> 01:07:55,904
"Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

412
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,198
I can't help you with
what you must soon face,

413
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,659
except to say the future is not set.

414
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,328
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

415
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:05,998
You must survive or I will never exist."

416
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:08,792
That's all.

417
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:13,297
It's a good field dressing.

418
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,341
You like it?

419
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:18,510
It's my first.

420
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:25,183
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

421
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,689
OK.

422
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:43,285
Talk to me some more.

423
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:48,081
About what?

424
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,418
Tell me about where you're from.

425
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,380
All right.

426
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:01,803
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

427
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,891
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

428
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:13,065
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

429
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:16,777
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

430
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:18,987
The Terminators were the newest.

431
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,530
<i>The worst.</i>

432
01:09:30,582 --> 01:09:35,170
<i>Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 meters north of your position.</i>

433
01:09:40,133 --> 01:09:41,259
Let's go.

434
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:30,684
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

435
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,069
Terminator!

436
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,648
I was dreaming about dogs.

437
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,277
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

438
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:30,906
Your world is pretty terrifying.

439
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:13,615
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

440
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,124
Fuck you, asshole.

441
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,812
God damn.

442
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:46,356
Thank you.

443
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:53,238
Is this enough?

444
01:14:53,905 --> 01:14:57,075
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

445
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:04,916
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

446
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,085
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

447
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,712
Do you have one with a kitchen?

448
01:15:24,769 --> 01:15:27,605
I am dying for a shower.

449
01:15:29,232 --> 01:15:31,401
We should check your bandage, too.

450
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:34,654
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

451
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,535
Keep this.

452
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,981
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

453
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,317
<i>But I need to know where to reach you.</i>

454
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:17,614
<i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>

455
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,533
<i>I am worried sick here.</i>

456
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,454
OK. OK, here's the number.

457
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,831
- You <i>ready?</i>
- Yes. Go ahead.

458
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:33,671
<i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>

459
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,590
<i>- Got it?
- I've got it.</i>

460
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,928
<i>I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.</i>

461
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,846
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

462
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,227
I love you, too, sweetheart.

463
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,534
- <i>Tiki Motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

464
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,288
What have we got?

465
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,132
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

466
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:18,925
What's for dinner?

467
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:22,720
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

468
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,264
What is it?

469
01:17:25,181 --> 01:17:28,726
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

470
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:30,770
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

471
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,784
Make sure there's none on the threads.

472
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,413
Like this.

473
01:17:50,373 --> 01:17:52,167
Screw the end cap on.

474
01:17:54,085 --> 01:17:55,628
Very gently.

475
01:17:58,381 --> 01:18:00,675
You must've had a fun childhood.

476
01:18:04,387 --> 01:18:05,763
That's good.

477
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:09,767
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

478
01:18:21,237 --> 01:18:23,198
He'll find us, won't he?

479
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,702
Probably.

480
01:18:45,803 --> 01:18:47,931
It'll never be over, will it?

481
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,358
Look at me. I'm shaking.

482
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:04,656
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

483
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:09,661
No, I'm not.

484
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:23,675
Kyle, the women in your time,

485
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:25,927
what are they like?

486
01:19:28,012 --> 01:19:30,098
Good fighters.

487
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,308
That's not what I meant.

488
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:36,312
Was there someone special?

489
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,899
Someone...?

490
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,694
A girl, you know.

491
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:45,571
No.

492
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:49,993
Never.

493
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:53,204
Never?

494
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:01,546
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

495
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:06,509
So much pain.

496
01:20:07,885 --> 01:20:12,223
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

497
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,642
So you feel nothing?

498
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:22,734
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

499
01:20:24,652 --> 01:20:26,446
I didn't know why at the time.

500
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:33,745
It was very old, torn, faded.

501
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:43,588
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

502
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,884
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

503
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,554
I memorized every line...

504
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,932
...every curve.

505
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,521
I came across time for you, Sarah.

506
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,736
I love you. I always have.

507
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,464
I shouldn't have said that.

508
01:22:57,346 --> 01:22:58,556
Think fast.

509
01:24:28,604 --> 01:24:29,939
Trade places.

510
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,287
Faster! Drive faster!

511
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:37,381
Kyle! Oh, my God.

512
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:12,958
Kyle.

513
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:29,600
Son-of-a-bitch!

514
01:26:45,282 --> 01:26:46,283
You stay here.

515
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:11,434
Let's get outta here.

516
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:16,355
Get out.

517
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:36,459
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

518
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:47,553
Kyle, come on.

519
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:51,557
Help me! Get out. Get out.

520
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,000
Don't stop. Run!

521
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,717
Sarah!

522
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,386
Kyle.

523
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:42,227
Kyle. Kyle...

524
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:47,066
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

525
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:07,878
No!

526
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:09,713
No!

527
01:32:05,602 --> 01:32:06,895
Wait.

528
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:13,360
What are you doing?

529
01:32:14,236 --> 01:32:17,406
Cover, so he can't track us.

530
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:30,294
Come on! Come on.

531
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:34,131
No, Kyle! Come on!

532
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,633
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

533
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:52,149
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

534
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,651
On your feet!

535
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:56,445
Move it!

536
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,810
Get back. Go back.

537
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:46,138
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

538
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:47,598
Run!

539
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,020
Run!

540
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,147
Come on, motherfucker.

541
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,304
No.

542
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:50,465
You're terminated, fucker.

543
01:39:48,648 --> 01:39:49,900
Kyle.

544
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:14,925
Tape seven. November 10. Where was I?

545
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:19,721
What's most difficult is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

546
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:24,434
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

547
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:28,355
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

548
01:41:05,475 --> 01:41:06,810
Fill her up.

549
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,608
Should I tell you about your father?

550
01:41:13,775 --> 01:41:16,027
Boy, that's a tough one.

551
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:22,075
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

552
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:27,080
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

553
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:30,333
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

554
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:35,880
I suppose I will tell you.

555
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:39,509
I owe him that.

556
01:41:41,928 --> 01:41:44,264
Maybe it'll help if...

557
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:49,853
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

558
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:53,940
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

559
01:42:06,828 --> 01:42:10,665
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

560
01:42:10,832 --> 01:42:13,710
He is ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for this picture.

561
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:17,297
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

562
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,174
Pretty good hustle, kid.

563
01:42:36,524 --> 01:42:38,109
What did he just say?

564
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,945
He said there's a storm coming in.

565
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:46,951
I know.

566
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:54,949
