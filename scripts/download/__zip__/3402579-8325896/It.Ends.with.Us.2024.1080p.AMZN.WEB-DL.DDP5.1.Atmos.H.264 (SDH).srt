I don't live here, so...

you know, to see him
before he died, but I...

181

die tonight.

187
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,144
He was only six years old.

188
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,146
His brother found a gun
in his parents' bedroom,

189
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,016
and it went off by accident.

190
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:57,252

and incredibly capable and,

214

-Yes.

-No, please. Genius.

-Nope. Not at all.

MARSHALL (on speaker): Babe.
Babe, the game's over.

535
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,289
-Where you at?
-Hi, honey.

536
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:09,357
-Where are you?
-Sweetheart, I'm at the shop

537
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,826
with my boss,
and we need some help

538
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,894
hanging something up.

539
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:12,994

when you say "boss."

-Babe.

place and make you the boss.

wearing onesies...

547

-Oh, I can see you.
-...because the bar gives

548

-Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.

You guys know each other?

00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,312
-No.
-RYLE: A little bit.

572
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,916
-No, we...
-We met a few months ago.

573
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,783
We shared each other's
naked truths.

574
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:10,118
-Ew. Oh, that's...
-LILY: Oh.

-MARSHALL: We're adults.

577

-That's what that was.
-You said "naked truths" first.

578
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:17,725
No. I mean, it was just,

579
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,726
-we just talked.
-You're lying.

580
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,094
Oh, that's what we're
calling it these days,

581
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,496
"we talked"?
'Cause we talk. All the time.

-We talk, like, we talk,

a week.

the work that I've done here?

585
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:27,735
-Oh, sh-- we should talk?
-LILY: No, no, no, you guys--

'cause she's bored, huh?

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,024
Oh, we like to say
"inspired" here, um,

595
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,826

Yeah.

598
00:29:57,032 --> 00:29:59,068
Looks like we will be seeing

599

01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:03,304
What was that? No, no.

1383
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,439
Can you give me
a second, please?

1384
01:05:04,472 --> 01:05:05,506
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-Just give me a second.

1385
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,607
-(glass crunches)
-Oh, shit!

1386
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:09,410
-(Ryle groaning)
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1387
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:12,246
-Oh, my God. Your hand.
-No, don't worry about my hand.

1388
01:05:12,747 --> 01:05:14,315
Baby, your surgery.

1389
01:05:16,185 --> 01:05:18,020
-(breathes heavily)
-You okay?

1390
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,955
I think so. I don't know.
(sniffles)

1391
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:22,390
Let me see it.

1392
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,692
-Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
-I know. I'm hurt.

1393
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,161
I knew we'd make a mess.

1394
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,663
-(stammers)
-I'm so sorry.

1395
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:30,531
-It was an accident.
-No. I didn't, I didn't...

1396
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,266
-It was an...
-How did we--

1397
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,335
-What did we do?
-It was an accident.

1398
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:39,942
I'm okay. (sniffles)

1399
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:42,376
-(vehicle door opens)
-LILY: God, I'm so sorry.

1400
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,012
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

1401
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:45,080
-Hey. Stop.
-Sorry I'm late.

1402
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:46,148
I'm a disaster, by the way.

1403
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,281
No, here.
I think I got everything.

1404
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:48,549
-Yeah, no, no, thank you.
-(sighs)

1405
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,085
-Okay.
-How was the wedding? (sighs)

1406
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,320
-(sighs) Also a disaster. Uh...
-No.

1407
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:53,721
(chuckles)
It's fine. It's fine.

1408
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,423
-How's a wedding a disaster?
-It was a little, just--

1409
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:56,825
Well, I mean, their marriage is

1410
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:58,793
probably the disaster,
but they're fine,

1411
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,528
they're lovely,
and they deserve each other.

1412
01:06:00,561 --> 01:06:01,830
But the flowers were beautiful?

1413
01:06:01,864 --> 01:06:04,867
Yes, the flowers were
off the char-- I'm so sorry.

1414
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,767
-Hmm?
-I'm so sorry.

1415
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,502
How was your--
how was your surgery?

1416
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:09,805
How did your sweet hand
hold up?

1417
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:11,339
-It was awesome.
-Really?

1418
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:12,607
-Yeah.
-Really? (chuckles)

1419
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,709
Yeah.
There was this moment whe--

1420
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:16,277
Um... (smacks lips)

1421
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,378
Allysa and Marshall messed up.

1422
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,714
-We're going to... to Root.
-Uh-huh.

1423
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:21,516
The place we went to
with your mom.

1424
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:23,417
Um, there was this moment,
and I...

1425
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:25,053
Well, hold-- Why?

1426
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:26,621
-Why... (stammers)
-I don't know.

1427
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,656
I know, but I was dying
to try the new place,

1428
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:30,591
-and we've already been there.
-Yeah, but they-they heard

1429
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,360
-how we talked about it and...
-Yeah, but we could just

1430
01:06:32,393 --> 01:06:33,761
-call them.
-No. They're already there.

1431
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,463
They ordered, like,
14 appetizers.

1432
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:36,764
No, I know. Oh, I really
wanted to try the new place.

1433
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:38,066
-You know my sister.
-I know. I'm sorry.

1434
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,600
I know. I'll-- Hey, I will
take you there next week.

1435
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,502
You know I love food.
That's all. That's all it is.

1436
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:42,838
And you know
I'm a creature of habit.

1437
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:44,206
I'll get the same exact thing
that I got last time.

1438
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,606
Okay. Yeah, I mean,
it's perfect. The food--

1439
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,843
The food is so good, so...
(sighs)

1440
01:06:49,211 --> 01:06:51,512
Hey. Hey.

1441
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:52,815
What?

1442
01:06:52,848 --> 01:06:54,582
-Hi.
-Hi.

1443
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:56,384
I'm sorry. It's been a--
it's been a week.

1444
01:06:56,417 --> 01:06:58,786
Um, I don't need to be
complaining to you.

1445
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:01,656
You've been through it.
Um... yeah.

1446
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,358
Tell me.
I want to hear everything.

1447
01:07:04,392 --> 01:07:06,061
-Okay.
-Okay.

1448
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,870
-(lively chatter)
-(soft music playing)

1449
01:07:16,637 --> 01:07:18,439
-ALLYSA: Oh. -Hi.
-MARSHALL: Oh.

1450
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,242
-Hey.
-Hey.

1451
01:07:20,275 --> 01:07:21,676
-Hi. -What's up?
-I'm so sorry we're late.

1452
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:23,111
ALLYSA: No, don't-- Just
sit down. Don't worry about it.

1453
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:24,246
Can I have this?
Can I-- Is it okay?

1454
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:25,479
-Oh. Yeah. Of course.
-Thank you.

1455
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:26,647
-We've ordered so much food.
-We're so sorry.

1456
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,917
-Um, yeah, it's, it's my fault.
-Oh, baby.

1457
01:07:28,951 --> 01:07:31,320
I didn't-- Ryle told me
something happened,

1458
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:32,587
-but he didn't tell me...
-What's up?

1459
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,323
-Oh, shit.
-...it was looking like this.

1460
01:07:34,355 --> 01:07:36,490
-Look at you, honey.
-(stammers) It's fine.

1461
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:37,826
-Doesn't even--
it doesn't even hurt. -Yeah.

1462
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,427
No, it was a mess.
You should have seen it.

1463
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,728
Yeah. I mean, his hand.
I mean, he got hurt, too.

1464
01:07:40,761 --> 01:07:42,231
-So we're-- Yeah.
-No, it's--

1465
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:43,631
-I'm-I'm fine.
-(Lily chuckles)

1466
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,433
I feel bad. It was...
(inhales sharply)

1467
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:47,102
-Mmm.
-It was a beautiful mess.

1468
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,904
Yeah. (chuckling)

1469
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:50,771
MARSHALL: Wait, so, so, dude,
what happened with the surgery?

1470
01:07:50,806 --> 01:07:54,375
Probably the greatest day
of my life.

1471
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,111
27 hours.

1472
01:07:56,144 --> 01:07:57,545
-27 hours?
-Yeah.

1473
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:59,348
Dude, the only thing
I've done for 27 hours

1474
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,448
is day-trade
and play "Call of Duty."

1475
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:01,749
-Do you guys have baby names?
-(laughs)

1476
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:02,951
Sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt. I... (chuckles)

1477
01:08:02,985 --> 01:08:04,319
-And go on a DraftKings bender.
-(chuckles)

1478
01:08:04,353 --> 01:08:06,121
-ALLYSA: Baby names?
-LILY: Yeah, sorry.

1479
01:08:06,154 --> 01:08:07,622
-MARSHALL: Oh, yeah, um...
-I was, yeah, thinking.

1480
01:08:07,655 --> 01:08:09,358
We're thinking... we're
thinking something strong.

1481
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,425
We're gonna do
big-time authors.

1482
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:13,061
-This riff...
-R.L. Stine.

1483
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:14,795
-(laughs)
-Judy Blume.

1484
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,164
ALLYSA: ...is going to be
the demise of our marriage.

1485
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:17,866
-ATLAS: How we doing, folks?
-MARSHALL: H.P. Lovecraft.

1486
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,733
ALLYSA: Uh, hi.

1487
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:19,968
How are you liking
your appetizers?

1488
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:21,769
Oh, wonderful.
I've had one bite of one thing,

1489
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:23,138
and this is already
my favorite restaurant.

1490
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:25,640
-What'd you go for?
-The, um, brussels sprouts.

1491
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,976
Ah, brussels sprouts.
What about you?

1492
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,378
What do you like?

1493
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,412
Oh, I'm-- I--
Impossible to choose.

1494
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,514
-Give my regards to the chef.
-(chuckles)

1495
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:34,682
Thank you. Appreciate it.

1496
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:35,984
It's actually
my mother's recipe.

1497
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:37,585
-ALLYSA: Oh. Oh, my...
-Hmm. That's very beautiful.

1498
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:39,487
-It's my first restaurant.
-MARSHALL: Love that.

1499
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,890
Yeah. And I love the
creativity, dude, seriously.

1500
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:43,392
-So, um...
-I'm an entrepreneur as well,

1501
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:44,860
so I get it.

1502
01:08:44,893 --> 01:08:45,861
What's-- what's your-- what's
your deal? What's your thing?

1503
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:47,296
MARSHALL:
Right now, we're looking

1504
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:48,897
(fading): to allocate capital
in local Boston businesses,

1505
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:51,666
and a place like this
would just be amazing.

1506
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:54,502
Not to be too forward,
but what are margins right now?

1507
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,204
I mean, the place is jumping.

1508
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,705
13, 14, 15%?

1509
01:08:57,738 --> 01:08:59,740
I love the story
about your mom.

1510
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:02,777
You could do a Series A
and scale this thing up...

1511
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:04,413
(gasps)

1512
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:06,447
-ALLYSA: Honey.
-MARSHALL: Did I offend him?

1513
01:09:07,448 --> 01:09:10,551
No, just keep saying
"allocating capital."

1514
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:11,920
I have been holding it
for so long.

1515
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:13,688
I'm gonna go pee really quick.
I'll be right back.

1516
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:16,425
-Do you want me to come with?
-Oh, no, I'm good. I'm good.

1517
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:17,926
-Are you...?
-No, no. You guys keep talking.

1518
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,161
I'll be right back.

1519
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:32,107
Come on.

1520
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,208
What happened?

1521
01:09:35,444 --> 01:09:36,979
Come on, tell me.
What happened?

1522
01:09:37,012 --> 01:09:38,447
Nothing. I-- We-- I...

1523
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,115
We burned his hand, and I fell.

1524
01:09:41,016 --> 01:09:42,317
I know. I know. It's--

1525
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:43,718
It was an accident, though.
It was...

1526
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:45,220
-That was an accident?
-Yes. Y--

1527
01:09:45,253 --> 01:09:47,189
(shushes)

1528
01:09:47,222 --> 01:09:48,789
(sighs)

1529
01:09:50,491 --> 01:09:52,427
Leave him.

1530
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:54,562
-(chuckles) God.
-You got to leave him.

1531
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:56,932
-I am not your mother, Atlas.
-Leave him. Leave him.

1532
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:00,768
Are you turning into yours?

1533
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,808
-Let me out of here.
-Lily.

1534
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:09,643
Let me out now.

1535
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:11,279
-Lily.
-Stop.

1536
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:14,916
(Lily sighs)

1537
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,886
-Wait, what is this?
-(grunts)

1538
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:20,088
-LILY: Atlas! Stop.
-You touch her again,

1539
01:10:20,122 --> 01:10:21,957
I'll cut your hand off
and shove it down your throat,

1540
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,092
-you piece of shit.
-Stop! Atlas, stop!

1541
01:10:24,126 --> 01:10:25,559

What was he doing
in the bathroom, Lily?

1560
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,037
What was he doing
in the bathroom with you?

1561
01:11:09,071 --> 01:11:10,638
He saw my eye,
and I think he saw your hand.

1562
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:11,940
And-and he knows
it was an accident.

1563
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:14,209

an accident, and he know...
