1
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,087
What the hell? Goddamn son of a bitch...

2
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,155
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,101
What the hell?

4
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,823
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:09,794
Me.

6
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:13,866
Come on.

7
00:05:14,134 --> 00:05:17,004
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

8
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:28,113
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:34,886
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:39,441
Washday tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,310
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:44,429
I think this guy's a couple
cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:45,907
Your clothes.

14
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,726
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,187
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:24,169
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,375
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:31,844
She's always after me.

19
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,046
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:38,711
Hey, buddy. Did you just
see a real bright light?

21
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:42,430
See that guy?

22
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,716
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:47,753
- Hey! I said hold it!
- Go!

24
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,790
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:39,604
- What day is it? The date!
- 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:42,007
- What year?!
- What?

27
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:56,855
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,393
<i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>

29
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,649
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:59,221
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:01,507
So am I.

32
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,368
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

33
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,793
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

34
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,934
Yes, sir.

35
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,663
- Okay, who gets the burly beef?
- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,966
- I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries.
- He gets the barbecued beef.

37
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,752
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- Okay, who gets the burly beef?

38
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,405
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

39
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:08,506
Aah!

40
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,812
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

41
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,932
This isn't real leather, is it?

42
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,283
This special sucks.

43
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,822
Nice going, kid. Ought
to give you the tip.

44
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:28,761
Look at it this way... in a hundred
years, who's going to care?

45
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,703
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

46
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:44,877
That's Italian. You
can go pump or auto.

47
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:48,597
The .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

48
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:52,150
These are brand-new. We just
got them in. That's a good gun.

49
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,387
Just touch the trigger, the beam
comes on, and you put the red dot

50
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:58,206
where you want the bullet
to go. You can't miss.

51
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,559
Anything else?

52
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:04,062
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

53
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,164
Just what you see, pal.

54
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,183
The Uzi 9mm.

55
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:14,822
You know your weapons, buddy. Any one
of these is ideal for home defense.

56
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,876
So, uh... which will it be?

57
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:20,094
All.

58
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:22,663
I may close early today.

59
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:27,268
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

60
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,354
You can't do that.

61
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,039
Wrong.

62
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:00,217
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

63
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:03,956
Listen, I need you to come pick
me up. My bike just broke down.

64
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:07,425
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

65
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:12,647
Hey, man, you got a
serious attitude problem.

66
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:08,453
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

67
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,267
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

68
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:26,637
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

69
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,518
It's so incredible. You're
not gonna believe this.

70
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,602
Sit down. You are
going to love this.

71
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:35,446
- Shh!
- What?

72
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,013
<i>Has been compiled
from several witnesses.</i>

73
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:41,219
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
thirty-five, mother of two,</i>

74
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,637
<i>brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.</i>

75
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,847
- You're dead, honey.
<i>- In other late-breaking news,</i>

76
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,966
<i>teamster representatives
have issued a statement...</i>

77
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,984
<i>Yes, friends, if you're into
stereo and you're into sound,</i>

78
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:05,988
<i>for the greatest sound around you, come to
Bob's Stereo at 25000 Sepulveda Boulevard.</i>

79
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:10,027
<i>Yes, we've got woofers, tweeters, the newest
in digital audio and compact laser discs.</i>

80
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:14,164
<i>We've got graphic equalizers and sound
balancers that adjust the sound to fit...</i>

81
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,104
Sorry.

82
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,069
Hello.

83
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:56,373
<i>First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one,</i>

84
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,911
<i>and then run my tongue down your
neck to your bare, gleaming breasts,</i>

85
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:06,417
<i>and then slowly, slowly pull
your jeans off... inch by inch.</i>

86
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:09,902
Ginger, it's Matt!

87
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,224
<i>And lick your belly in circles
further</i> and further down,

88
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,461
<i>and then pull your panties</i>
off with my teeth.

89
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,517
Who <i>is</i> this?

90
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,866
I... I, uh... Sarah?

91
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:27,371
<i>Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought you were...</i>

92
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,674
- Can I talk to Ginger, please?
- Sure, Bunky.

93
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,111
It's the creep.

94
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,047
Hello.

95
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:41,385
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one...

96
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:47,290
You fuckin' pigs! Wait till
I get my hands on you!

97
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,693
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

98
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,694
Ed.

99
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,033
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

100
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,803
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

101
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,807
shot six times at less than ten
feet. Large caliber weapon.

102
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,441
You know, these work.

103
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,544
What's this?

104
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:12,148
Dead girl 2, sent over from
Valley Division this afternoon.

105
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:18,739
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
- Look at the name, Ed.

106
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:23,660
Sarah Louise... Connor.
Is this right?

107
00:22:24,996 --> 00:22:26,396
You're kidding me.

108
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:29,166
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over the place.

109
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,056
A one-day pattern killer.

110
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:33,445
I hate the weird ones.

111
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,609
So...

112
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,413
Better than mortal man deserves.

113
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:55,158
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

114
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:56,993
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

115
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:03,367
<i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>

116
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,857
There you are, young man.

117
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:10,415
- You mind your mother.
<i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>

118
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:15,462
<i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
Uh, something's come up,</i>

119
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:17,964
<i>and it looks like I won't
be able to make it tonight.</i>

120
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,501
<i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm
really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>

121
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,504
<i>Call you in a day or so,
okay? Sorry. Bye.</i>

122
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:29,375
That bum. So what if
he has a Porsche?

123
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:32,847
He can't treat you like this. It's
Friday night, for Christ's sake!

124
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,982
I'll live.

125
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,551
I'll break his kneecaps.

126
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,289
Well... Pugsley still loves
me, don't you, baby?

127
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:47,093
God. It's disgusting.

128
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,713
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
- Okay.

129
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,916
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will. You, too.

130
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:55,002
Okay.

131
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,890
Damn it, Matt!

132
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,064
Oh, shit.

133
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:01,932
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings

134
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,236
occurred in the same order as
their listings in the phone book?

135
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,538
Now, what can I tell you
guys? No comment.

136
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,407
But, lieutenant, we've
got two murders...

137
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,921
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,857
I put a cigarette out in it.

139
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,461
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine.

140
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,903
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

141
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,432
There's no answer at the door, and
the apartment manager's not home.

142
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,308
Call her.

143
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,517
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

144
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,629
Give me a cigarette.

145
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:50,899
<i>Hi there.</i>

146
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:56,371
<i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to
a machine, but don't be shy, it's okay.</i>

147
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,697
Same shit.

148
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:11,369
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called
the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

149
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:16,607
I hate these press cases,
especially the weird press cases.

150
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,729
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

151
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,264
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

152
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:27,519
If I can get on the tube by eleven
o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

153
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,121
Well...

154
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,307
- How do I look?
- Like shit, boss.

155
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:33,775
Your mama.

156
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,145
Lieutenant!

157
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:38,330
<i>This just in. Police have
announced the name of the victim</i>

158
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:42,317
<i>in the second of two execution-style
murders which took place today.</i>

159
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:46,788
<i>Incredibly, the names of the two
victims are virtually identical.</i>

160
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:50,935
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>

161
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,028
<i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i>
- Can we change this?

162
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:54,588
- Sure.
<i>- Sarah Louise Connor was slain by an...</i>

163
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:58,066
- Don't touch it!
<i>- unknown gunman earlier today in her home.</i>

164
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:00,885
<i>Now, police are refusing to speculate
on the apparent similarity</i>

165
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:04,622
<i>between these shooting deaths, and no
other connection between the two victims</i>

166
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,824
<i>has been established as of yet.</i>

167
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:10,529
<i>Of course, we'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

168
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:15,534
<i>A spectacular fire fueled by solvents,
oils, and other flammable liquids</i>

169
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,269
<i>swept through an oil company
on North Spring Street</i>

170
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:21,173
<i>just northeast of Chinatown
Wednesday night...</i>

171
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:46,157
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back! Hey! 4.50.

172
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,750
<i>You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department emergency number.</i>

173
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:32,256
<i>All our lines are busy. If you
need a police car sent out to you,</i>

174
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:33,773
<i>please stay on the line.</i>

175
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,128
<i>2-11 in progress at Bob's Liquor,
corner of third and Cameron.</i>

176
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,223
Pugsley, shoo! Go on. I'm going
to make a belt out of you.

177
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,636
Whoa!

178
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,873
Don't make me bust you up, man!

179
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,586
<i>Hi there. Ha ha ha. Fooled you.</i>

180
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,855
<i>You're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's okay.</i>

181
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,458
<i>Machines need love
too, so talk to it,</i>

182
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,478
<i>and Ginger, that's me, or
Sarah will get back to you.</i>

183
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,129
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

184
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,749
<i>Ginger, this is Sarah!
Pick up if you're there!</i>

185
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:20,985
<i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Technoir. I'm really scared.</i>

186
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,636
I think that there's
somebody's after me.

187
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:26,618
Uh, I hope that you
play this back soon.

188
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,981
<i>I need you and Matt to come and
pick me up as soon as possible.</i>

189
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,867
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give them another try.

190
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:38,075
<i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>

191
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,999
<i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>

192
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,009
It's her.

193
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,130
- Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
- <i>Look, Lieutenant,</i> don't put me on hold

194
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,234
- and don't transfer me to another department!
- Don't worry. I won't. Now, just relax.

195
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,307
- Can you tell me where you are?
<i>- I'm in this bar called Technoir.</i>

196
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,061
Yeah, I know. It's on Pico.
Are you all right?

197
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:16,465
Yeah, but I don't want to leave.
I think there's a guy following me.

198
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,975
All right, now, listen, Miss
Connor, now, listen carefully,

199
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,557
you're in a public place, so
you'll be safe till we get there,

200
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,398
but stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the rest room.

201
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,804
<i>- I'll have a car there in a hot minute.</i>
- Okay.

202
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,563
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

203
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,842
Come with me if you want to live.

204
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,002
Come on!

205
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,877
This is 1-L19. I got a
hit-and-run felony.

206
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,365
Suspect vehicle... late model gray
Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

207
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,801
He's really moving, punching
lights all the way.

208
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,189
I'm going to need an ambulance
at 7th and Broadway right now.

209
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,358
Hold it!

210
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,964
<i>All units watch for a
late-model gray Ford,</i>

211
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,517
<i>last seen westbound
on 7th and Broadway.</i>

212
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,441
Hold on.

213
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:47,489
Are you injured? Are you shot?

214
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,292
No!

215
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:56,297
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

216
00:38:56,765 --> 00:39:00,636
Don't move unless I say. Don't
make a sound unless I say.

217
00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:02,338
Do you understand?

218
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:06,558
- Do you understand?!
- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.

219
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:28,530
I'm here to help you. I'm
Reese, Sergeant Techcom,

220
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:33,418
DN38416, assigned to protect you.
You've been targeted for termination.

221
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:42,144
<i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>

222
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:47,882
This is 1-L19. Westbound on
Olympic approaching Overland.

223
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:55,668
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

224
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:59,347
No, but you will. It's very
important that you live.

225
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:03,417
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...

226
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,888
He's not a man. A machine.

227
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:10,339
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.

228
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:19,635
A machine?

229
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,186
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

230
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:27,033
A cybernetic organism.

231
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,992
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

232
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,512
Get your head down!

233
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:22,693
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

234
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,364
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

235
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:31,185
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

236
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,620
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

237
00:41:33,956 --> 00:41:38,109
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

238
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,677
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...

239
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:42,914
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.

240
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:52,140
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.

241
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,776
But these are new.
They look human...

242
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:58,863
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

243
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,833
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

244
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,498
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

245
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:12,585
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

246
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:19,433
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

247
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,021
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

248
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:27,158
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

249
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:29,411
- Right.
- Right.

250
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:40,838
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

251
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,590
Don't do that again.

252
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:45,093
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

253
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,748
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.

254
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,020
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

255
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:59,324
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.

256
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:03,061
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!

257
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:05,913
Until you are dead.

258
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,242
Can you stop it?

259
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,930
I don't know.

260
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,518
With these weapons, I don't know.

261
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:46,572
<i>All units. All units. Gray Ford
suspect vehicle's been found</i>

262
00:43:46,573 --> 00:43:49,240
<i>in a parking structure
at 4th and Beaudry.</i>

263
00:44:31,332 --> 00:44:32,566
Reese.

264
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:35,620
Why me?

265
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:39,674
Why does it want me?

266
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:48,249
There was a nuclear war...

267
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:52,253
A few years from now.

268
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,324
All this...

269
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:59,895
This whole place. Everything.

270
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:02,129
It's gone.

271
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:05,467
Just gone.

272
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,736
There were survivors.

273
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:10,355
Here. There.

274
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,960
Nobody even knew who started it.

275
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:20,030
It was the machines, Sarah.

276
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:25,436
- I don't understand.
- Defense network computers.

277
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,841
New... powerful...

278
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:34,846
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.

279
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:40,467
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

280
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:45,691
Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,
not just the ones on the other side.

281
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:49,661
Decided our fate in
a microsecond...

282
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:52,997
extermination.

283
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:09,512
Did you see this war?

284
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:24,677
No. I grew up after it...

285
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,981
In the ruins. Starving...

286
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:30,400
- Hiding from HKs.
- HKs?

287
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:35,521
Hunter-killers. Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

288
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:41,012
Most of us were rounded up, put
in camps for orderly disposal.

289
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,531
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

290
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,741
Some of us were
kept alive... to work...

291
00:46:54,608 --> 00:47:00,062
Loading bodies. The disposal
units ran night and day.

292
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,500
We were that close
to going out forever.

293
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:09,839
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

294
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:15,712
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.

295
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,883
He turned it around. He brought
us back from the brink.

296
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,094
His name was Connor. John Connor.

297
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,222
Your son, Sarah.

298
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,292
Your unborn son.

299
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:20,353
Drive!

300
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,245
Reese!

301
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:51,533
No, Reese! No! No!
No! They'll kill you.

302
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,954
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands now!

303
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,058
Get out of the car!

304
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:04,598
Drop to your knees!

305
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:07,733
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

306
00:50:36,363 --> 00:50:38,063
Sarah...

307
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,734
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

308
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:48,424
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...
maybe I should look at the bodies.

309
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:51,327
No. They've been identified,
and there's no doubt.

310
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,562
Oh, God.

311
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,231
God!

312
00:50:55,298 --> 00:50:57,400
Ginger!

313
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:02,071
Sarah.

314
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:05,742
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

315
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,795
I want you to tell him
everything that Reese told you.

316
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:12,432
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

317
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,735
You're a doctor?

318
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:19,856
- Criminal psychologist.
- Is Reese crazy?

319
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:22,353
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

320
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:51,246
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

321
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:58,120
With the 132nd, under
Perry. From '21 to '27.

322
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:03,041
- That's the year 2027?
- That's right. And I was assigned...

323
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:04,710
This is fucking great.

324
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:07,098
The last two years
under John Connor.

325
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:10,432
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for...

326
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:12,951
Oh, damn. Sorry.

327
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:16,321
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdine systems.

328
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:17,823
I see.

329
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:24,363
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy,

330
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:28,083
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived,

331
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,452
a sort of retroactive abortion?

332
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:33,254
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

333
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:36,081
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

334
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:38,060
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.

335
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,245
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

336
00:53:40,313 --> 00:53:43,215
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

337
00:53:43,282 --> 00:53:47,536
It had no choice. Their
defense grid was smashed.

338
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:51,757
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

339
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:55,110
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

340
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:59,064
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?

341
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:02,234
Uh... the time
displacement equipment?

342
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:06,605
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

343
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:10,075
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

344
00:54:10,242 --> 00:54:12,260
How are you supposed get back?

345
00:54:12,386 --> 00:54:13,954
I can't.

346
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:17,633
Nobody goes home.

347
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,174
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.

348
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:12,780
It's just him and me.

349
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:20,304
Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?

350
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,308
Don't you have ray guns?

351
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,142
Ray guns.

352
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,745
Show me a piece of
future technology.

353
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:32,055
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

354
00:56:32,117 --> 00:56:34,285
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

355
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:38,623
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- Okay, okay. But this...

356
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,227
- Cyborg, if it's metal...
- Surrounded by living tissue!

357
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:43,478
Oh. Right, right...

358
00:56:44,346 --> 00:56:47,281
This is great stuff. I could
make a career out of this guy.

359
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:50,216
You see how clever this part is? How
it doesn't require a shred of proof?

360
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:54,288
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant.

361
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,974
Why were the other
two women killed?

362
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,169
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

363
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:05,077
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.

364
00:57:05,103 --> 00:57:08,744
They just knew the city. The
Terminator was just being systematic.

365
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:12,583
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...
- Look, you have heard enough!

366
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:16,143
I have answered your questions!
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

367
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:19,597
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

368
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:21,666
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here?

369
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:23,501
- Reese...
- Shut up!

370
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,637
You still don't get it, do you?

371
00:57:26,805 --> 00:57:30,240
He'll find her.
That's what he does!

372
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:34,045
That's all he does!
You can't stop him!

373
00:57:34,048 --> 00:57:38,284
He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!

374
00:57:38,316 --> 00:57:41,068
- Doc.
- Let... let go of me!

375
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,090
Sorry.

376
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:54,648
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...

377
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:56,383
He's a loon.

378
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,155
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

379
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:04,625
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll
stop a twelve-gauge round.

380
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:09,371
This other individual must have been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.

381
00:58:11,032 --> 00:58:13,066
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

382
00:58:13,134 --> 00:58:15,753
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand

383
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,651
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...

384
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:20,191
- You see this scar?
- Here.

385
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:21,726
Thank you.

386
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:26,214
There's a couch in this other room. Why don't
you stretch out and try to get some sleep?

387
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,762
It'll be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

388
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:31,753
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

389
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,073
Well, it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

390
00:58:37,442 --> 00:58:42,247
You'll be perfectly safe. We got
thirty cops in this building.

391
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:44,481
Thank you.

392
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:52,489
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:59:06,804 --> 00:59:08,813
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

394
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:10,998
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

395
00:59:11,024 --> 00:59:13,678
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

396
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:16,462
- Where is she?
- Look, it may take a while...

397
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:18,792
if you want to wait, there's
a bench over there.

398
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:31,646
I'll be back.

399
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,475
What the hell was that?

400
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,085
Gunshot!

401
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:22,765
- What is it, terrorists?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

402
01:00:27,018 --> 01:00:28,920
Stay here.

403
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:43,640
Let's get out of here!

404
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:46,647
- Come on! Come on!
- He's got an automatic weapon!

405
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,275
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

406
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:03,954
What the hell happened
to the lights?

407
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,027
Watch him.

408
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:33,384
Automatic weapons!
Lock and load! Let's go!

409
01:02:01,445 --> 01:02:02,945
Fire! Fire!

410
01:02:17,294 --> 01:02:18,962
Ed.

411
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:21,198
Hey!

412
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:49,109
Sarah!

413
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:52,062
Reese!

414
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,418
This way.

415
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,401
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

420
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:56,142
Take this.

421
01:03:58,979 --> 01:04:01,281
All right, let's get
this off the road.

422
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,882
- You cold?
- Freezing.

423
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,181
Reese...

424
01:04:52,316 --> 01:04:54,384
You got a first name?

425
01:04:54,752 --> 01:04:55,868
Kyle.

426
01:04:56,136 --> 01:05:00,607
Kyle... what's it like
when you go through time?

427
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:05,278
White light.

428
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:09,483
Pain.

429
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:16,439
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

430
01:05:17,507 --> 01:05:19,543
I caught one back there.

431
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,247
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

432
01:05:24,815 --> 01:05:28,218
- We got to get you to a doctor.
- It's okay. Forget it.

433
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:31,221
What do you mean,
forget it? Are you crazy?

434
01:05:31,989 --> 01:05:33,707
Take this off.

435
01:05:45,453 --> 01:05:46,935
Jesus.

436
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:49,538
See, it passed right
through the meat.

437
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:54,794
Oh, this is going to make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?

438
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:55,949
What?

439
01:05:55,975 --> 01:05:59,999
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

440
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,852
He's about my height.

441
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:08,608
He has your eyes.

442
01:06:11,846 --> 01:06:13,847
What's he like?

443
01:06:14,114 --> 01:06:18,252
You trust him. He's got a strength.

444
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,938
I'd die for John Connor.

445
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,344
Well... at least now I know
what to name him.

446
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:31,103
I don't suppose you
know who the father is,

447
01:06:31,129 --> 01:06:34,025
so I won't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.

448
01:06:34,068 --> 01:06:36,502
John never said much about him.

449
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,639
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait!

450
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,343
I don't want to know.

451
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:47,513
So, was it John that sent you here?

452
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,549
I volunteered.

453
01:06:50,784 --> 01:06:51,917
Why?

454
01:06:52,185 --> 01:06:57,457
It was a chance to meet the
legend... Sarah Connor.

455
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:02,512
Taught her son to fight, organize,

456
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,898
prepare from when he was a kid.

457
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,417
When you were in hiding
before the war...

458
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,490
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

459
01:07:14,558 --> 01:07:17,193
- It's driving me crazy.
- Aah!

460
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,766
Are you sure you have
the right person?

461
01:07:23,134 --> 01:07:24,801
I'm sure.

462
01:07:25,469 --> 01:07:28,907
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

463
01:07:30,975 --> 01:07:35,879
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

464
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:44,271
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this
honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

465
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:52,228
Your son gave me a message to
give to you. Made me memorize it.

466
01:07:53,196 --> 01:07:56,283
"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.

467
01:07:56,350 --> 01:08:01,021
I can't help you with what you must soon face
except to say that the future is not set.

468
01:08:01,022 --> 01:08:03,674
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

469
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:08,613
You must survive, or I will
never exist". That's all.

470
01:08:11,815 --> 01:08:14,000
It's a good field dressing.

471
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:18,956
You like it? It's my first.

472
01:08:22,726 --> 01:08:25,761
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

473
01:08:29,466 --> 01:08:30,933
Okay.

474
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,562
Talk to me some more.

475
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:48,202
About what?

476
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:51,970
Tell me about where you're from.

477
01:08:54,174 --> 01:08:55,741
All right.

478
01:08:57,277 --> 01:09:01,947
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.

479
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:06,187
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

480
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:13,742
But they're not too bright. John
taught us ways to dust them.

481
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:17,145
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

482
01:09:17,213 --> 01:09:20,749
The Terminators were the
newest... The worst.

483
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,444
<i>Traversing your sector
in search mode.</i>

484
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:35,680
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

485
01:09:35,815 --> 01:09:38,884
<i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>

486
01:09:40,452 --> 01:09:42,020
Let's go.

487
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:44,004
<i>Intercept. Over.</i>

488
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:48,609
<i>There are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.</i>

489
01:09:48,677 --> 01:09:53,015
<i>Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid
contact. We'll get them later.</i>

490
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:55,367
<i>Roger, echo leader.</i>

491
01:10:00,522 --> 01:10:05,093
<i>- Sector niner, what's your status?
- Situation normal.</i>

492
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:24,412
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

493
01:10:27,049 --> 01:10:30,835
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

494
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,392
<i>Any infiltrators at
the shopping mall?</i>

495
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:43,298
<i>No problem. They were clean. We're
cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>

496
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:47,652
<i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.</i>

497
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,212
Terminator! Terminator!

498
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,791
I was dreaming about dogs.

499
01:13:24,927 --> 01:13:27,329
We use them to spot Terminators.

500
01:13:28,596 --> 01:13:31,265
Your world is pretty terrifying.

501
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,708
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?

502
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:23,635
Fuck you, asshole.

503
01:14:42,254 --> 01:14:44,155
Goddamn!

504
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:46,691
Thank you.

505
01:14:50,729 --> 01:14:53,264
Uh, is this enough?

506
01:14:53,932 --> 01:14:57,236
Yeah, it's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.

507
01:15:03,308 --> 01:15:05,143
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

508
01:15:05,144 --> 01:15:07,079
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

509
01:15:07,612 --> 01:15:09,413
Do you have one with a kitchen?

510
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:23,212
Mmm.

511
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:27,415
I am dying for a shower.

512
01:15:29,218 --> 01:15:31,436
We should check your bandage, too.

513
01:15:32,103 --> 01:15:34,839
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

514
01:15:39,427 --> 01:15:41,112
Keep this.

515
01:16:06,689 --> 01:16:10,225
No, I can't tell you where I am,
mom. I was told not to say.

516
01:16:10,226 --> 01:16:12,425
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>

517
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,872
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

518
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:20,176
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>

519
01:16:20,769 --> 01:16:22,604
Okay.

520
01:16:23,772 --> 01:16:26,707
- Okay, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

521
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:30,418
<i>It's 408-555...</i>

522
01:16:30,444 --> 01:16:32,636
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.

523
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:34,962
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.

524
01:16:35,088 --> 01:16:36,916
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

525
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:41,655
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more
right now. I love you, mom.</i>

526
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,994
I love you, too, sweetheart.

527
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:03,426
<i>- Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

528
01:17:06,213 --> 01:17:07,780
What have we got?

529
01:17:11,218 --> 01:17:12,935
Mothballs.

530
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,680
Corn syrup.

531
01:17:15,823 --> 01:17:19,059
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

532
01:17:19,827 --> 01:17:22,862
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.

533
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,464
What is it?

534
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:28,901
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

535
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:31,138
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

536
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,119
Make sure there's
none on the threads.

537
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:48,655
Like this.

538
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,526
Screw the end cap on.

539
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:56,295
Very gently.

540
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:01,501
You must've had a fun childhood.

541
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:06,172
That's good.

542
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:10,977
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.

543
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,722
He'll find us, won't he?

544
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,027
Probably.

545
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:48,097
It'll never be over, will it?

546
01:18:56,407 --> 01:18:58,843
Look at me. I'm shaking.

547
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:05,032
Some legend, huh? You must
be pretty disappointed.

548
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,602
No. I'm not.

549
01:19:18,612 --> 01:19:20,179
Kyle...

550
01:19:21,115 --> 01:19:25,751
The women in your time...
what are they like?

551
01:19:27,955 --> 01:19:29,890
Good fighters.

552
01:19:30,257 --> 01:19:32,358
That's not what I meant.

553
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,662
Was there someone special?

554
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:43,268
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.

555
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,938
No.

556
01:19:48,592 --> 01:19:50,159
Never.

557
01:19:51,795 --> 01:19:53,362
Never?

558
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,771
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

559
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,859
So much pain.

560
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,666
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

561
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:14,884
So you feel nothing?

562
01:20:19,974 --> 01:20:23,042
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.

563
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:29,815
I didn't know why at the
time. It was very old...

564
01:20:30,718 --> 01:20:34,253
Torn... faded.

565
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:43,797
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.

566
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,953
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.

567
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,914
I memorized every line,

568
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,365
every curve.

569
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:01,464
I came across time for you, Sarah.

570
01:21:02,499 --> 01:21:07,020
I love you. I always have.

571
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:26,539
I shouldn't have said that.

572
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,648
Think fast!

573
01:24:28,754 --> 01:24:30,455
Trade places!

574
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:44,636
Faster! Drive faster!

575
01:25:34,186 --> 01:25:35,720
Kyle!

576
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:38,022
Oh, my God!

577
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,375
Kyle.

578
01:26:27,673 --> 01:26:29,624
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

579
01:26:45,057 --> 01:26:46,825
You stay here.

580
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,200
Let's get out of here.

581
01:27:15,237 --> 01:27:16,971
Get out.

582
01:27:33,523 --> 01:27:36,775
Kyle. Come on, get up.

583
01:27:42,915 --> 01:27:44,828
He's coming.

584
01:27:44,854 --> 01:27:47,719
Kyle? Come on!

585
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,276
Help me! Get out! Get out!

586
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:54,174
Get out!

587
01:28:03,435 --> 01:28:05,019
Come on!

588
01:28:11,076 --> 01:28:12,927
Faster!

589
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,816
Don't stop! Run!

590
01:30:30,482 --> 01:30:32,416
Sarah!

591
01:30:32,884 --> 01:30:34,535
Kyle!

592
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:42,960
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

593
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:47,381
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

594
01:31:06,985 --> 01:31:08,536
No!

595
01:31:08,604 --> 01:31:10,538
No!

596
01:32:05,727 --> 01:32:07,528
Wait!

597
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:17,304
- What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.

598
01:32:27,232 --> 01:32:32,069
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

599
01:32:33,205 --> 01:32:37,158
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.

600
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:38,760
Get up!

601
01:32:47,969 --> 01:32:52,940
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!

602
01:32:53,007 --> 01:32:56,560
On your feet! Move it!

603
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:10,217
Back. Go back.

604
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:46,571
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

605
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,172
Run!

606
01:34:51,643 --> 01:34:53,211
Run!

607
01:34:53,478 --> 01:34:55,563
Come on, motherfucker.

608
01:36:48,476 --> 01:36:50,760
No, no.

609
01:38:48,795 --> 01:38:51,063
You're terminated, fucker.

610
01:39:48,654 --> 01:39:50,223
Kyle.

611
01:39:52,327 --> 01:39:58,280
<i>6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super
Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i>

612
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,997
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

613
01:40:15,965 --> 01:40:20,269
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

614
01:40:20,537 --> 01:40:24,891
But I guess I have a while yet before you're
old enough to even understand these tapes.

615
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:29,096
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.

616
01:40:59,543 --> 01:41:02,979
<i>- Gasolina, por favor.
- ¿Cuánto?</i>

617
01:41:03,447 --> 01:41:07,550
<i>- Llena el tanque.</i>
- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>

618
01:41:11,187 --> 01:41:16,359
Should I tell you about your
father? Boy, that's a tough one.

619
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:22,499
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

620
01:41:24,267 --> 01:41:26,966
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

621
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:30,839
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

622
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:39,682
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.

623
01:41:41,985 --> 01:41:44,521
Maybe it'll help if...

624
01:41:44,588 --> 01:41:49,526
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...

625
01:41:51,595 --> 01:41:54,164
We loved a lifetime's worth.

626
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,121
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo pena decirle</i>

627
01:42:01,122 --> 01:42:06,492
<i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>

628
01:42:07,026 --> 01:42:10,962
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...

629
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:14,400
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,

630
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,270
but if he doesn't, his
father will beat him.

631
01:42:17,438 --> 01:42:19,472
Pretty good hustle, kid.

632
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:23,209
<i>- Cuatro
- Sí, sí.</i>

633
01:42:24,177 --> 01:42:25,578
<i>Gracias.</i>

634
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,081
<i>¡Miren, miren!</i>

635
01:42:31,034 --> 01:42:34,220
<i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>

636
01:42:36,455 --> 01:42:38,424
What did he just say?

637
01:42:38,892 --> 01:42:41,544
He said there's a storm coming in.

638
01:42:45,482 --> 01:42:47,149
I know.
