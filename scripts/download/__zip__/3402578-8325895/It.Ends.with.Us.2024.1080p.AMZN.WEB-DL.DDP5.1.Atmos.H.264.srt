1
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:54,082
Hey. Come here.
I got you.

2
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,384
I'm so sorry.

3
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,651
Hey, you're
gonna be okay.

4
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,288
I'm so sorry you couldn't
be here, honey.

5
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,889
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

6
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:03,058
What are we gonna do?

7
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,597
Okay.

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,532
Oh, God,
we have to pick flowers.

9
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,868
-We do, yeah.
-I can't believe

10
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,337
we're picking flowers
for your father's funeral.

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,671
I know. I know.

12
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,408
I don't know why you moved.
I don't understand it.

13
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,642
I mean, if I had that job
that you had--

14
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,979
Oh, boy, I would've killed
for that job.

15
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,747
I appreciate your support
and enthusiasm, Mom.

16
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,684
I really do. I love you.
I'm gonna go set my stuff down.

17
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,652
-Okay.
-It's lilies.

18
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,022
-What?
-The flowers for a funeral.

19
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,857
-They're...
-Oh, lilies.

20
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,127
I'm so--
I'm so glad you're home.

21
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,063
Me, too.

22
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:32,180
He really loved you.

23
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:33,215
Who?

24
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,716
Your father.

25
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,188
I know. I, um--

26
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:42,090
Yeah, I know.

27
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,361
How's the eulogy coming, hon?

28
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,728
Mm, it is, um,

29
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,564
one of the most beautiful
things I've never written.

30
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,534
Just say five things
you loved about your father.

31
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,904
Mama, it's, uh--
it's not a grocery list.

32
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:58,974
Just fi-- five things.

33
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:00,708
Simple.

34
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,311
From the heart.
You're gonna be great.

35
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,713
It's gonna be great.

36
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,317
We're
here to honor the prestigious,

37
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,820
generous Andrew Bloom.

38
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:15,656
Deeply beloved mayor
of this fair town.

39
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,995
Husband of the highly adored
Jenny Bloom.

40
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:23,832
And father to the wonderful
and sweet Lily.

41
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,734
Lily, come on up
to the stage, darling.

42
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,245
Uh, hello.
Thank you all for joining us.

43
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:42,583
Uh, in honor of
my father's life, I would, um,

44
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,752
like to share with you the--
the five things

45
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,856
that I love most about him.

46
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,164
He, um...

47
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,184

Is it?

61
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,021
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

62
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:03,391
It's-it's been a day.

63
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:09,497
Will you please
get down from there?

64
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,933
Um, I'm good. Thanks.

65
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,202
You're just making me nervous
sitting so close to the edge.

66
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,440
Please?

67
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:23,411
Cherry on top?

68
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,282
I'm okay.

69
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,485
You gotta be...

70
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:52,040
I once read that
maraschino cherries

71
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,609
stay in your stomach
for like seven years.

72
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:56,811
Or cause cancer.
I forget which.

73
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,817
I didn't know that
about maraschino cherries.

74
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,121
Yeah, I may have
made that up, but...

75
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,556
they are pretty gross.

76
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,358
Yeah, they're
definitely gross.

77
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,926
So, what happened?

78
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,296
Sorry?

79
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,265
What was that over--
I didn't mean to, but...

80
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,202
Was it a woman?

81
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,539
Or man? I...

82
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,207
It was a chair, wasn't it?

83
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:30,045
Yes.

84
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,714
So, what floor you live on?

85
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:34,849
You first.

86
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:38,286
Top floor, right next to
my sister and her husband.

87
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,621
Wow.

88
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,623
What do you do for a living?

89
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:42,691
Neurosurgeon.

90
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,595
Is that funny?

91
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,999
-Jesus. You're serious.
-Yeah.

92
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,968
-Oh, really?
-Wow.

93
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,970
Oh, my God. Wait.
I'm so sorry.

94
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,505
No, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

95
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,675
You have spent way too--
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,444
You've spent
way too much time in school

97
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:04,814
to have me laughing like this.
I'm terrible.

98
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,682
I'm sorry. I-I thought
you were a crypto bro.

99
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,384
You thought I was
a cr-- a crypto bro?

100
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,219
N-No, no, no.
Yeah, no, well, I don't know,

101
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,954
or like
a really expensive prostitute.

102
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,889
-Well, I am expensive.
-Um--

103
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:17,759
You can forget about
kissing on the mouth.

104
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,462
Um...

105
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,998
Why haven't I seen you before?

106
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,370
Well, mostly because I've
never required brain surgery.

107
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,872
But also 'cause
I don't live here, so...

108
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,907
So, you just
broke into my building?

109
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:35,176
You have a really nice view.

110
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,644
I do.

111
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,952
What's your name?

112
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,388
Lily.

113
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:47,756
You?

114
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,457
-Ryle.
-Ryle what?

115
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:51,059
Kincaid.

116
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,627
You just made that up
just now.

117
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,829
Why would I make up
my last name?

118
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:54,996
I-- Well, I mean, fine.

119
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,598
What's your last name?

120
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,533
It's fine. We don't need to--
We don't need to do this.

121
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,401
I'm just asking your last name.

122
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,769
No, it was really nice
meeting you.

123
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:02,103
-You asked...
-Thank you. Just be careful.

124
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,338
Okay. It would be courteous
to give me back

125
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,840
-your last name.
-Oh.

126
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,207
I'm not gonna stalk you.

127
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,410
No, it's just really--
It's sort of embarrassing.

128
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,845
What is it?

129
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,912
Bloom.

130
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,914
-Your name is Lily Bloom?
-Yes.

131
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,449
It, um-- it actually
gets worse. Yeah.

132
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,819
-No way. Not possible.
-Yeah, no. It d--

133
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:17,952
-It does.
-Than Lily Bloom?

134
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,053
I don't really want
to talk about it,

135
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:20,555
'cause it's really kind of
embarrassing.

136
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,223
I'm obsessed with flowers. I--

137
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:24,092
Yeah. And I'm about
to open my first

138
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,193
-flower shop.
-Flower shop?

139
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,429
Yeah, it's a lifelong dream,
so...

140
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,635
It's not-- Stop.

141
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,969
I told you.

142
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:36,571
No, Lily Bloom the florist.

143
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:40,208
No, it doesn't
sound made-up at all.

144
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,210
Hey, you could always
use your middle name

145
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,511
if it doesn't work out.

146
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,615
-No, Violet.
-Trust me.

147
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,783
-Petunia.
-No, stop.

148
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,920
-Of the valley.
-Wor--

149
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,922
-Toadflax.
-Blossom.

150
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,522
Goddamn,
your parents hate you.

151
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:56,524
Well, I mean,
we may never know for sure,

152
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,294
'cause my dad died on Monday,
so, um...

153
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:01,329
Yeah, that's actually
why I came up here,

154
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,431
to, uh, have a good cry
and hopefully meet

155
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:06,034
a wealthy neurosurgeon.

156
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,735
So...

157
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:10,205
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,375
I could've made it back, um,

159
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:17,312
you know, to see him
before he died, but I...

160
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,350
I didn't.

161
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,154
Damn.

162
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,991
Yeah.

163
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,529
Well, you know, naked truths
aren't always pretty.

164
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,342
I watched a little boy
die tonight.

165
00:11:48,343 --> 00:11:50,144
He was only six years old.

166
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,146
His brother found a gun
in his parents' bedroom,

167
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,016
and it went off by accident.

168
00:11:55,818 --> 00:11:57,252
Tried everything.

169
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,158
No one should have to...

170
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,027
I can't imagine
what that's gonna do

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,062
to that little boy who lived.

172
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:11,934
Destroy him for life.

173
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,468
That's what it'll do.

174
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,175
All right,
give me another one.

175
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,279
Naked truth. I like that.

176
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,615
Go on.

177
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,051
Okay. I...

178
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,153
I don't know, uh...

179
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,894
The first guy
I had sex with was homeless.

180
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,695
-Stop it.
-Yeah, no, really.

181
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,096
In high school, yeah.

182
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,364
-Tell me more.
-I actually think

183
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,766
we're supposed to say
"temporarily un-homed,"

184
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,135
or-or, um, or "displaced."
I shouldn't have...

185
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,503
Now you're just
avoiding the question.

186
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,370
...um, said--

187
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:50,505
I'm not.
There's nothing to tell.

188
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:51,840
Tell me--
I want the good stuff.

189
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,541
I-- Okay, I was friends
with this boy named Atlas.

190
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:57,412
And he was kind
and incredibly capable and,

191
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,949
you know,
he just got a shit hand.

192
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:01,649
You're making me jealous
of a homeless man.

193
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:03,418
Oh, my.

194
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, that's enough.
That's--

195
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,056
Your turn.

196
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,623
Oh, no,
I think I'm done.

197
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:11,060
Can't top that. That was
both sexy and disturbing.

198
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:13,394
Okay, just shock me.

199
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:14,930
Say-- I mean,
you can say anything.

200
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:16,698
I want to have
sex with you.

201
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,301
What? What?

202
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,805
-Well, you said to shock you.
-I mean...

203
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,238
What?

204
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,278
Uh, how many--
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,413
How many women
has this worked on?

206
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,182
I'm not
a relationship person.

207
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:35,683
-Yeah, I gathered that.
-Never been good at them.

208
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:38,286
Well, um, but how do you know
if you've never tried

209
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,587
having a relationship or carbs?
How do you--

210
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,722
How do you know
it doesn't work for you?

211
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,223
Carbs? I never said
I didn't eat carbs.

212
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,959
Come on, you don't look like
a reckless snacker.

213
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,793
Well, thank you.

214
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,362
Love isn't for me.

215
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:49,898
Lust is nice, though.

216
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,802
I feel like
you're missing out.

217
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,870
Am I?

218
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,108
You haven't answered
my question.

219
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,542
I forgot what
the question was.

220
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,212
How many women
has this worked on?

221
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:06,915
All of them.

222
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,219
Oh.

223
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,491
Well, I...

224
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,460
I can't-- I'm...

225
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,630
I'm gonna have to break
your record.

226
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,667
I'm the kind of girl
you take home to mama.

227
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,268
How far would you go?

228
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,342
I'm not sure.
I'm an unreliable narrator.

229
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:37,946

My mom kicked me out.

284
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:23,959
Why?

285
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,263
'Cause...

286
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,799
she likes dating guys
that beat the shit out of her.

287
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,570
What happened to your hand?

288
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,074
God, I can
smell him from here.

289
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:43,111
It got in the way.

290
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,650
Look, um, my parents
don't get home from work

291
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,454
till around 5:00, so if you...

292
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,189
want a shower or...

293
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:57,325
I don't know, wash clothes or--
I don't mind.

294
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,759
Yeah.

295
00:20:58,793 --> 00:20:59,928
Sure.

296
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,398
Your enthusiasm's contagious.

297
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,476
Did you feel the earthquake

298
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:15,643
-this, uh, this weekend?
-Yeah!

299
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:16,845
You did?

300
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,814
-Yeah!
-Wow, a lot of...

301
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:19,848
Hey.

302
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,217
Thanks for the clothes.

303
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,453
Yeah, of course.

304
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,954
My dad won't even know
they're gone.

305
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,689
He doesn't usually
wear jeans much, so...

306
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,398
Um, my parents aren't gonna
be home for an hour or so,

307
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:39,434
if you want to watch TV
or something.

308
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,303
You know, it's--
it was a 7.2 earthquake,

309
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,071
and it was located in Mexicali,

310
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:44,539
which is just south
of the U.S. border.

311
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:46,241
Uh, and when something
like that happens,

312
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:47,943
everyone thinks the same thing,
"Oh, my God.

313
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:50,011
My Precious Moments."

314
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:57,352
So, uh, what do you
want to do after you graduate?

315
00:21:58,053 --> 00:21:59,187
I'm, um...

316
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:01,755
signed up to go
to basic training in May.

317
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,225
Basic training? What is...

318
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:05,961
In the Marines.

319
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:06,995
Oh.

320
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,030
Wow.

321
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,309
I'm sorry.

322
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:22,643
I'm... I'm sorry.

323
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,446
It's just the-- the clothes,
my dad's clothes,

324
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:28,250
they make you kind of look like
Ned Flanders a little.

325
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:32,020
Your clothes kind of make you
look like a carrot.

326
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:34,256
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

327
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:44,166
Mom?

328
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,534
If it doesn't work out...

329
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,435
Mom, you do know
a challenge only excites me.

330
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:48,769
I-I-I said "if."

331
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,071
"A flower sales statistic

332
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,306
-that shocks many new floral..."
-Mom.

333
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,208
Mom, what makes you think
it's not gonna work out?

334
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,911
-"...a whopping 45% of all..."
-Mom.

335
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,180
Mom, are you reading this
from Google?

336
00:22:58,213 --> 00:22:59,747
Of course I am.
How would I know that?

337
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,917
I'm worried about you.
Google is worried about you.

338
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,585
Well, you're both too late.
I'm picking up the keys now.

339
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:04,752
Okay. Okay.

340
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,154
-Okay, I love you.
-Wait. Sir! Sir!

341
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,788
You can do this.
Make it bold and brave.

342
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,191
Okay, Mom.
You sound crazy.

343
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,426
I'll talk to you later, bye.
Hi. I'm so sorry.

344
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,661
I'm so sorry.

345
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,529
-I, uh... I just moved here.
-Okay, sweetheart.

346
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:15,864
Good luck.

347
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,834
Thank you.

348
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,698
Hi.

349
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,536
Hello?

350
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,672
-Hi. Sorry.
-Oh! I'm so sorry.

351
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,107
No. Sorry. I can't...

352
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,774
-I can't...
-Oh, wait.

353
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,010
I can't hear you. Hi.

354
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:37,112
-I'm so sorry.
-Hi. Can I help you?

355
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,514
-Can I help you?
-Excuse me?

356
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,316
The "help wanted" sign
out front?

357
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,684
You have
a "help wanted" sign out front.

358
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:43,918
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

359
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:45,120
Yeah, I didn't,
I didn't put that out there.

360
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,321
-I just-- Yeah.
-I figured.

361
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,656
-I just got this place.
-It's pretty old.

362
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:49,090
And I walk by this place
every day,

363
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:50,725
and I'm just obsessed with it.

364
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,960
I've always wanted
to see inside,

365
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,161
and I was wondering, like,

366
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,863
"Who's gonna come along?"
And...

367
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:57,032
-It's you, yeah?
-No, it's me. Yeah, hi.

368
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,733
-Are you the owner?
-Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm Lily.

369
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,868
-Allysa.
-Nice to meet you.

370
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,002
Sorry, ooh, disgusting.

371
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,304
Hi. Nice to meet you.

372
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:03,471
Yeah.

373
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:04,939
Well...

374
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,409
yeah, are you looking
for any help?

375
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:09,311
Well, I'm not hiring just yet.

376
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,179
I just, um, I just got the keys
a few days ago,

377
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:12,380
-and I'm still sort of...
-Yeah.

378
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:14,349
...you know, figuring out
what I'm doing.

379
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,484
-So...
-Um, may I just ask:

380
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:18,386
What is this place
going to be?

381
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,487
A flower shop.

382
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,759
I'm so sorry, um...

383
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:27,529
I have an issue with--
My face says it all.

384
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:29,264
I just hate flowers.

385
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,365
You hate flowers?

386
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,200
-I do.
-Oh. Okay.

387
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,069
Like, why don't you just
give me something that's living

388
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:36,204
rather than something
that's on its way to dying?

389
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,305
And then it's gonna create
more work for me

390
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,808
and I'm gonna have
to deal with that.

391
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,609
But again,
it's a solo perspective.

392
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:43,645
It's-- I find
flower shops depressing.

393
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,580
It's just me.
I do wish you luck.

394
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:46,848
-I'm so sorry.
-I agree.

395
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,249
I find them depressing.

396
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,418
Uh, because I feel like...
uh...

397
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:53,288
I don't know, it's like the
beauty of what a flower is--

398
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:54,422
This is ridiculous.

399
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:57,192
The beauty of what a flower is
has been lost. Right?

400
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,560
It's-it's, um...

401
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:00,628
It's like we order them like
takeout now. It's-it's...

402
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,863
-Yes.
-Right?

403
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,131
You know? So it's what
you're talking about.

404
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,734
It's highlighting the pain
and the, the tension

405
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,135
and the...

406
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,903
You know.
The fact that it's fleeting,

407
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:11,239
and it's storytelling and...
I don't know.

408
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,108
That's actually what I find
beautiful about it and--

409
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:14,943
I don't know, that's what
I'm trying to do here, so...

410
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,278
Uh, that's
absolutely beautiful. I'm...

411
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:18,947
If that's what you're doing...

412
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,015
Yeah. Sign me up. Wonderful.

413
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,917
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

414
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,386
Well, um...

415
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,588
Yeah, I really do
wish you the best, and...

416
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:28,590
-Thank you.
-Um...

417
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:30,058
I'll just be lurking

418
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,292
-around in the neighborhood.
-Yeah.

419
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:32,761
Well, hopefully
I made my first customer.

420
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:33,995
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, great.

421
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:35,530
-Oh. It's so gorgeous.
-Hope to see you, um...

422
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:37,365
-Yeah. Bye.
-Okay.

423
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,402
Hey, I...

424
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,538
I don't know, this...

425
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,006
I do need help.

426
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,142
-Do you want a job?
-This is exactly

427
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:49,377
what I wanted to happen to me
when I walked in here.

428
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,445
Yes.

429
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,312
Oh, God. Okay.

430
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:52,647
Wonderful.

431
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,082
-Okay.
-Great. Um, I have to be out

432
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:55,818
by 5:00 p.m. tonight.
I do have a dinner.

433
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:57,318
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

434
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,054
I just started working here.

435
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,223
-Okay, perfect.
Okay. -Great! Um...

436
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:03,491
I'm gonna just need to wipe off

437
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,926
-a surface for this girl.
-Here. Here, here.

438
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,027
There you go. Right?

439
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,929
-That's, um...
-Thank you so much.

440
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:10,231
It's a real "Ghostbusters"
situation in here, huh?

441
00:27:12,902 --> 00:27:14,936
-Hey.
-Aw.

442
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:16,638
Frame it.

443
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:17,807
Oh!

444
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,874
Did you see that?

445
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:21,242
Oh, my God,
it's still attached.

446
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:23,144
-Got it.
-God, I can't watch.

447
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:24,646
Oh.

448
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,151
Yeah. Yeah!

but with flowers.

460
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,244
-Oh. Whoo!
-Okay. No, no.

461
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:57,378
We got it, we got it.
We got it.

462
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:58,546
I-I don't have it.

463
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,882
Hold on. Oh, hold on.

464
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,749
-My husband's calling.
-Okay. Here we go.

465
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:02,818
-Can I ask him to help us?
-Yes.

466
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:03,919
-Or is that weak?
-No, please. Genius.

467
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:05,553
-You got it? No?
-Nope. Not at all.

468
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,088
Babe.
Babe, the game's over.

469
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,289
-Where you at?
-Hi, honey.

470
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:09,357
-Where are you?
-Sweetheart, I'm at the shop

471
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,826
with my boss,
and we need some help

472
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,894
hanging something up.

473
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:12,994
I don't like
when you say "boss."

474
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,395
-You should be the boss.
-Babe.

475
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,663
Let's just buy the
place and make you the boss.

476
00:28:15,697 --> 00:28:16,899
Honey, you're on speaker.

477
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:18,166
-Oh. Hi.
-Yeah. Um...

478
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,467
-Hi.
-Just-- just, uh...

479
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,401
I want you to know

480
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:21,603
that they're gonna be
wearing onesies...

481
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:22,905
-Oh, I can see you.
-...because the bar gives

482
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:23,906
free beer to the people
who wear onesies

483
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,139
-to the Bruins game.
-Okay.

484
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,407
-I'm across the street. Hey.
-But they don't

485
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,342
always wear that.

486
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,143
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. Oh, my God, babe,

487
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:30,345
you are stunning.

488
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:31,513
Can you bring
my brother in, too?

489
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,047
Great.
I can't take responsibility

490
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,250
for either of the people
who are about to come in here,

491
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:36,651
just so you know.

492
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,087
-Hi.
-Hi.

493
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:42,056
-Mwah. You look great.
-This is Lily.

494
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,191
-Hi. Lily. Hi.
-Oh, hey.

495
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,225
-Nice to meet you.
-You guys are friends.

496
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,793
This is, uh,
my husband Marshall.

497
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:47,262
That's my brother Ryle.

498
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,638
Hi.

499
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:58,306
-Hi.
-Hi.

500
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,207
Lily.

501
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,676
-Lily Bloom.
-Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.

502
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,077
You guys know each other?

503
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,312
-No.
-A little bit.

504
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,916
-No, we...
-We met a few months ago.

505
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:08,783
We shared each other's
naked truths.

506
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:10,118
-Ew. Oh, that's...
-Oh.

507
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:11,686
-Uh, no, that's... That was...
-Okay. Got it.

508
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,388
-That was a bad choice of words.
-We're adults.

509
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:16,124
-That's what that was.
-You said "naked truths" first.

510
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:17,725
No. I mean, it was just,

511
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,726
-we just talked.
-You're lying.

512
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,094
Oh, that's what we're
calling it these days,

513
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,496
"we talked"?
'Cause we talk. All the time.

514
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,865
-Great. Wonderful.
-We talk, like, we talk,

515
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:24,232
like, three to five times
a week.

516
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,501
Can I show you
the work that I've done here?

517
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:27,735
-Oh, sh-- we should talk?
-No, no, no, you guys--

518
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,404
-We could hang this.
-We could talk tonight.

519
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,172
-No, let me take you over here.
-You guys don't need-- Okay.

520
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,808
If you could try
to take me seriously. Okay.

521
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:38,814
We meet again.

522
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:40,715
It's good to see you.

523
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:43,551
So, this is the flower shop

524
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,486
that my sister works at
'cause she's bored, huh?

525
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,024
Oh, we like to say
"inspired" here, um,

526
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,826
but yeah, this is, um...

527
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,694
You know, I, uh... Yeah.

528
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:55,096
Yeah.

529
00:29:57,032 --> 00:29:59,068
Looks like we will be seeing

530
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,869
a little more
of each other, then.

531
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,136
Is that so?

532
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,844
Ah, you're even more terrifying
in the daytime.

533
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:10,745
-Same.
-Okay, guys?

534
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:11,779
Idea.

535
00:30:12,982 --> 00:30:15,316
Let's go have
some dumb fun today.

536
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,893
♪ We've come a long ♪

537
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:26,294
♪ Long way together... ♪

538
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,896

00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,710
You know what I mean.

546
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,348
Okay, let's go, let's go.

547
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,817
Mm!

548
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:50,485
That's a bad idea, right?

549
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,321
Because of my sister,
because of your business...

550
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:54,923
Go, Lily!

551
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:56,357
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

552
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:57,725
-Whoo!
-Yep, it's yours.

553
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,193
This is you right here, babe.

554
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:02,363
Mm-hmm.

555
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:05,667
No, hey.

556
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,734
Uh-uh.

557
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:07,903
She's off-limits. No.

558
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:09,404
She's mine. I see you.

559
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,572
-Hey.
-It's true.

560
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,142
So we'll just be friends, then?

561
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:14,442
-Yeah.
-I like it.

562
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:17,512
Hey.

563
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,881
Yeah, friends.

564
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,285
-To friendship.
-Yeah.

565
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:28,057
It's the weekend somewhere.

566
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,158
Let's go, let's go.

567
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,425
Oh, no, it--
Please don't leave, sir.

568
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,592
-Our Uber's about to leave.
-I love you.

569
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:32,995
-I'm gonna head home.
-No, no, no, no, no.

570
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,195
It's brunch in Singapore.
Come on.

571
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,563
-I have to sleep.
-Let me walk you home.

572
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:37,398
No, it's fine. I--
I live right around the corner.

573
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:38,466
-I'm fine.
-It's on the way.

574
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:39,767
You live where we live.

575
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,703
-Semantics.
-Okay, fine, but only

576
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,404
'cause you'd feel really bad
if I got murdered.

577
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,473
Okay, don't fish
where I swim, Ryle.

578
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:47,241
I love you.
See you tomorrow, Lil.

579
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,344
I appreciate you walking me,
but you really...

580
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:53,082
I can't stop
thinking about you.

581
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:54,983
I'm right here.

582
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,220
Well, that's the problem.

583
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:03,058
I thought we agreed
to be friends.

584
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,492
We did.

585
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:08,362
But that was, like, hours ago.

586
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:11,232
Can I just kiss you?

587
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,202
-Oh, my God.
-Just once.

588
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,402
-You are pushy.
-Just once.

589
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,770
That's all I need
to get you out of my system.

590
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,107
-Oh, that's it. That'll do it?
-One kiss.

591
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,942
Okay, well,
good luck with that.

592
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:21,409
Is that a yes?

593
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:23,778
Just once?

594
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:25,981
Just once.

595
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:32,553
Okay.

596
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:38,559
Okay.

597
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,050
Did that get me
out of your system?

598
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:08,090
I'm gonna walk myself home,
okay?

599
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:09,657
Bye, friend.

600
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,738
Is this enough over here?

601
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:25,207
Yeah. Maybe add, like,

602
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,607
-a little right there.
-Okay.

603
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:27,910
You're just
protecting the roots, you know,

604
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:30,645
from the snow or in case
it freezes over or anything.

605
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,248
I mean, the roots are the most
important part of the plant.

606
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:34,983
-Really?
-Yeah.

607
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:36,151
I didn't know that
about roots.

608
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:37,552
That's cool.

609
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:39,154
-Here, you want some?
-Oh.

610
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,524
Thank you.
Yeah, I'll take that.

611
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:45,894
What made you want
to start growing things?

612
00:33:45,928 --> 00:33:48,563
When I take really good care
of these plants,

613
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:51,399
they reward me
with flowers and vegetables.

614
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:54,937
And when I don't,
they just shrivel up and die.

615
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:57,572

I want to take it in from here.

I was hoping you'd say that.
Okay.

649
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:01,762
Okay.

650
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:03,966

Oh, I don't know what
I was thinking. Thank God.

Oh, it's incredible.

What if we don't get
any customers?

660
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:24,419
No, don't do that.

661
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,321
-Your mom's coming.
-Oh, my mom.

662
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,655
She's flying in
to be a customer.

663
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,623
Yeah, I mean, yeah, but
how depressing would that be

664
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,625
if the only customer we have
is my mom?

665
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,494
Well, Marshall's coming
this afternoon.

666
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,496
So that's two,
so you're good.

667
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,735
Okay, here we go.

668
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:43,405
-Wow.
-Yeah.

669
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:45,440
This doesn't even look like
the same shop.

670
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:47,175
Congratulations.

671
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:48,410
How's it going so far?

672
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:50,879
I mean, we literally
just opened, but...

673
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:54,782
So that means your brother's
the first official customer?

674
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:57,285
Oh, you have to buy something
to be considered a customer.

675
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:59,287
Right now
you're just loitering.

676
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,555
-Good morning, Lily.
-Good morning.

677
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:02,858
All right.

678
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,659
I'll take these.

679
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,063
Do you, uh, deliver?

680
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:09,865
Is that for a girl?

681
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:11,900
It is.

682
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:14,436
She might send them back,
knowing her.

683
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,104
Right. Um, okay.

684
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:18,073
That little card, fill out
the message on the front

685
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:19,074
and then the back,

686
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:20,741
you put the person's name
and the address.

687
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:21,675
Okay.

688
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:22,911
So, are you bringing
this mystery girl

689
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:24,379
to my birthday party on Friday?

690
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,714
'Cause I kind of, like, need
to plan for that sort of thing.

691
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:27,983
I don't know.

692
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:29,885
Are you going, Lily?

693
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:32,120
Yeah, of course.

694
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:33,055
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

695
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:35,190
She has to go.
She's my best friend.

696
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:37,859
All right.

697
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,693
Thank you.

698
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,097
What do I owe you?

699
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,865
Oh, um, $51 even.

700
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,167
Here you go.

701
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,068
Thank you.

702
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,502
This is a big moment.

703
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:49,938
Sure is. Thank you so much
for your service...

704
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:51,239
uh, business.

705
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:53,909
Um, thank you. Yeah.

706
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:55,243
Hey, congrats.

707
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:57,412
Get out. Thank you.

708
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:59,481

Oh, my God.

711
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,053
He's such a dumbass.

712
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:09,357
He put the name of our shop
as the delivery address.

713
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,726

You guys, this...
I mean, your house...

732
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:56,404
This is... I can't believe
this is your house.

733
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:57,539
This is our humble abode.

734
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:58,607
I just wanted to do
something low-key

735
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,342
-for baby girl over here.
-Oh, my God.

736
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:01,642
-Mwah.
-Mwah.

737
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,578
And to think I did not even
marry him for the money.

738
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:04,913
You're not in it for the money.

739
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:06,348
-I'm not.
-You're my ride-or-die.

740
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:07,781
-Yeah.
-When we first met,

741
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:09,783
I was dead broke, and I was
driving a Toyota Camry.

742
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:11,987
You still drive
a Toyota Camry, though, right?

743
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,355
-Yes, he does.
-The greatest

744

Can't convince me otherwise.

746
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,758
He thinks it makes him
relatable.

747
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:18,994
It really does.

748
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:20,595
I'm a man
of the people, okay?

749
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:22,130
Happy birthday.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

750
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,697

00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,330
Well, do you have something
I can wear?

816
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:28,109
I don't think
you've ever done this before.

817
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:30,445
It was sexier in my head.

818
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,581
Hmm.

819
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,617

822
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:25,133
Good night, Lily Bloom.

823
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:51,693
Ryle, I'm very nice,
so I brought you coffee--

824
00:44:51,726 --> 00:44:53,461
Oh.

825
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:54,762
Hi.

826
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:58,299
-No. Oh, no.
-Mmm.

827
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,068
I understand. It's not...

828
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:01,236
It's not as bad
as it looks.

829
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:02,303
-It looks pretty bad.
-It's, um...

830
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:04,072
-It kind of is.
-Okay.

831
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:07,877
None of my business.
Uh, okay.

832
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,711
What-- Um, I'm gonna go.

833
00:45:11,145 --> 00:45:12,614
Let me just say one thing.

834
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:16,651
This man runs through women
like candy.

835
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:17,853
This is different.

836
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:18,954
Oh, is it? Wonderful.

837
00:45:18,988 --> 00:45:20,956
Well, just in case
it obviously is not,

838
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,591
let me say that
if you're looking for, meh,

839
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,793
nothing from him,
that's a great option.

840
00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:27,028
-Okay.
-But if you're looking

841
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,999
for romance,
and y-you want a relationship,

842
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,600
this is not the person,
and it's not about you.

843
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:33,468
And I love you.

844
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,736
-Yeah.
-But let me just say...

845
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:35,770
Date me.

846
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,073
What?

847
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:41,109
Date me.

848
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:44,412
I've-- I don't...

849
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,815
Uh, what--
What does that mean? I...

850
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:48,449
Okay, no.

851
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:49,517
I'm gonna leave.

852
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:51,820
And I'm so sorry,

853
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:56,892
but I was just bringing coffee,
and now I'm so embarrassed.

854
00:45:56,926 --> 00:45:58,726

Hey.

882

Mmm.

883
00:48:37,785 --> 00:48:39,188
Mmm.

884
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,556
Mmm. Good morning.

885
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:46,327
Mmm, mm-mm. You've already
brushed your teeth.

886
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,964
That's not fair.

887
00:48:48,997 --> 00:48:50,132
-Mmm.
-I'm so sorry.

888
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:52,101
I got to go in early.

889
00:48:52,134 --> 00:48:53,701
Am I gonna see you tonight?

890
00:48:55,104 --> 00:48:57,005
Oh.

891
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,272
No. Not tonight.

892
00:48:58,306 --> 00:48:59,741
My mom's in town.

893
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:02,343
She's obsessed with trying
this new restaurant, Root.

894
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,312
It's her dying wish
to take me there.

895
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:06,081
Your mom's in town?

896
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,448
Yeah.

897
00:49:07,482 --> 00:49:09,852
Yeah, no, she's not
actually dying.

898
00:49:09,885 --> 00:49:11,385
-It's...
-Oh.

899
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:13,889
-I was just saying that.
-Oh, it's just, you didn't, uh,

900
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:15,523
you didn't tell me that.

901
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,493
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

902
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:20,863
I didn't think
you'd want to know.

903
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:22,898
Is there room for one more?

904
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,633
-Wait.
-What?

905
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,003
Wait, you want to meet my mom?

906
00:49:28,036 --> 00:49:29,104
Is that a problem?

907
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:31,672
I mean, I don't think
it's a good idea.

908
00:49:32,975 --> 00:49:34,977
-Ouch.
-No.

909
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,278
No, I mean...

910
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:38,646
-It's not because of you.
-Mmm.

911
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,515
It is because of her.
This woman, this woman...

912
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:43,417
I just want to meet the mother
of the woman I love.

913
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:03,972
Hey! Hey.

914
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:06,008
Sorry, you forgot this.

915
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:08,076
Bye.

916
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,179
Wait, wait, this isn't mine.

917
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:11,746
I know.

918
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,616
I happen to love you, too.

919
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:26,061
You're gonna be late.

920
00:50:26,094 --> 00:50:28,763
Get over me, my gosh!

921
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:30,531
I'm taken.

922
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:54,122
Did you make this?

923
00:50:54,156 --> 00:50:55,790
Yeah.

924
00:50:55,824 --> 00:50:58,894
Carved it from a branch
from your old oak tree.

925
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:00,661
In case you forget.

926
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:04,398
Strong and sturdy.

927
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:08,804
Thank you.

928
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:24,286
Gross. I bet
she has rabies now.

929
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:30,192
Get up.

930
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:31,260
I mean, he is pretty smelly.

931
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,128
-Get up. Get up.
-Stop. No, no.

932
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:34,997
Get up. Come on.

933
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:56,484
Do you like to cook?

934
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:57,920
Yeah. I love it.

935
00:51:57,953 --> 00:52:00,454
Necessity is
the mother of invention.

936
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:02,124
Hmm.

937
00:52:02,157 --> 00:52:03,491
Smells great. What is it?

938
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:04,692
Hot chocolate cookies.

939
00:52:04,725 --> 00:52:06,228
Dark chocolate
with burnt marshmallows.

940
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:08,796
Ooh. Good.

941
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,699
My mom would splurge on
Swiss Miss for us at Christmas.

942
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:13,801
-Hmm.
-That was her favorite.

943
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:23,644
So, did you, um,
did you kiss me earlier

944
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:25,646
because you really wanted to,

945
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,683
or was it mostly just
to get back at Katie?

946
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:32,787
I just...

947
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:36,657
I really need
some clarity here.

948
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:46,401
I-I wanted to.

949
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,749
-That-That's my dad.
-What?

950
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:02,951
That is my dad. You have to go.

951
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:04,552
-What? -No, you--
you have to go right now.

952
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:05,753
Don't forget the cookies.
12 minutes.

953
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,222
Okay. Okay. I got it.
You got to go right now.

954
00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:08,589
-12 minutes, okay?
-Out the back door. Please go.

955
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:09,925
Go. Go, go, go.

956
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,231
Hey.

957
00:53:16,264 --> 00:53:17,732
-Hi.
-How are you doing, honey?

958
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:18,867
-Good.
-You all right?

959
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,268
-How was your day? Good?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:22,904
-Yeah, great.
-Good. Good. Busy?

961
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:24,672
Yeah. Um...

962
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,574
Busy's good.

963
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:32,981
Um, I made cookies.

964
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:34,216
Yep.

965
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:36,485
-Yeah. Or I'm starting to.
-Wow.

966
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,153
-Pigs are flying.
-Yeah.

967
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,522
Wish I didn't love you so much.

968
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:43,392
Yeah, same.

969
00:53:43,425 --> 00:53:44,826
Okay. You gonna save me some?

970
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,328
-Yeah, of course.
-Promise?

971
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:47,963
Yeah, I promise you.

972
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:52,401
Whoa.
My God, look at this.

973
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:53,701
-Yeah, it's amazing.
-Hi.

974
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,270
Hi. Yeah,
we're just meeting her.

975
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:56,338
-Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
-Yeah.

976
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:57,605
I am sorry in advance.

977
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:59,074
-No.
-Yeah, no, no. Prepare yourself.

978
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:01,609
-Hi. Hi, Mama.
-I love this place.

979
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,744
-It's beautiful, right?
-Oh, my God.

980
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:04,880
It looks beautiful.

981
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:06,614
-Let's order cocktails.
-Yeah. Let's.

982
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:07,782
-Hi.
-Yeah. Yes. Um...

983
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:08,850
-Hi.
-Mom, this is--

984
00:54:08,884 --> 00:54:10,986
this is my friend, Ryle,
yeah, who I, uh,

985
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,888
who I now sleep with.
So, ha ha.

986
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:14,856
Uh, Ryle Kincaid.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

987
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,224
-It's so nice to meet you.
-Okay.

988
00:54:16,258 --> 00:54:17,392
You know you said that
out loud?

989
00:54:17,426 --> 00:54:18,827
I do know
I said that out loud.

990
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,661
Allysa, you know,
who I work with.

991
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:21,729
Uh-huh?
-This is her brother.

992
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:22,898
-Oh, yes.
-Mm-hmm.

993
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:25,000
-Yeah.
-Now I see a resemblance, sure.

994
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:26,902
Oh, well, we both
favor our mother.

995
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:28,103
-Oh.
-Oh, here it goes.

996
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:30,839
That's what everybody says
about me and Lily.

997
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,374
Oh, you know, I see it.

998
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,810
Oh, yes. The apple does not
fall far from the tree.

999
00:54:34,843 --> 00:54:37,479
How lucky are you, Lily?

1000
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:38,712
The luckiest.

1001
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,614
How lucky am I?

1002
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:41,749
Oh, my God.

1003
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:43,118
Would you excuse me?

1004
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,886
I-I have a thing. I like to
wash my hands a lot and...

1005
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,388
-Yeah, yeah. Get out of here.
-I will.

1006
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:47,688
-Leave us be.
-All right. All right.

1007
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:49,690
Bye-bye.

1008
00:54:50,826 --> 00:54:52,660
O-Oh, my God.

1009
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:54,830
Mom, uh, you know,
we don't need to do that.

1010
00:54:54,863 --> 00:54:56,531
You never told me
you were dating

1011
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:58,300
-the most beautiful man.
-Well, he's--

1012
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,036
He's got a good personality to
make up for it, though, so...

1013
00:55:01,069 --> 00:55:02,636
Oh, g-- okay, okay.

1014
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,972
Uh, who is he?
Where's he work?

1015
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:05,140
-What does he do? What?
-Don't do that. Don't.

1016
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:08,176
Don't do what?
Hey, I am-- I'm your mother.

1017
00:55:09,244 --> 00:55:10,711
Boston Grace Hospital.

1018
00:55:10,744 --> 00:55:11,980
-Oh, no.
-Stop.

1019
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:13,148
-No, please don't. Please.
-Welcome to Root.

1020
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,549
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

1021
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,551
God. Please. Thank you.
I need alcohol. Now.

1022
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:18,487
Oh, I-I would like
to try a Negroni.

1023
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,588
I hear they're delicious.

1024
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,654
They are.
I'll get you a Negroni.

1025
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:21,823
Thank you.

1026
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,691
And what can I get you?

1027
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:45,080
Oh, I'll-- Uh, surprise me.

1028
00:55:52,487 --> 00:55:53,721
So, what'd I miss?

1029
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:55,590
Um, are you
by any chance a doctor?

1030
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:57,159
I am. I'm actually
gonna be performing

1031
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,060
a once-in-a-lifetime
operation soon.

1032
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:01,530
Oh, my Lord.
Is it dangerous?

1033
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:03,231
It's a risky surgery.

1034
00:56:03,265 --> 00:56:07,035
It's amazing, though. He's am--
He's amazing.

1035
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:18,046
So tell me about Boston.

1036
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,349
They were the best years
of my life.

1037
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:24,586
The food is
really amazing there.

1038
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,254
-Yeah?
-And the harbor.

1039
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:28,789
My uncle would take me
fishing there sometimes.

1040
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:31,393
Sounds like you miss it.

1041
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:32,827
Yeah.

1042
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:34,762
I'm gonna move there
after the Marines.

1043
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,099
Everything's better in Boston.

1044
00:56:40,468 --> 00:56:41,769
Except the girls.

1045
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:45,073
Boston doesn't have you.

1046
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,711
I'm gonna miss you.

1047
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,217
Same.

1048
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,453
I don't know how you did it.

1049
00:57:00,388 --> 00:57:03,191
But somehow,
you became my favorite person.

1050
00:57:07,696 --> 00:57:09,064
Same.

01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,312
-Oh, shit.
-I told you. I'm sorry.

1225
01:04:38,346 --> 01:04:39,714
I did tell you.

1226
01:04:39,747 --> 01:04:41,416
No, no.
Baby, you need a potholder.

1227
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:43,484
-Oh, my God. Shit! -Wait,
you were gonna stick your hand

1228
01:04:43,518 --> 01:04:45,553
in there?

1229
01:04:55,196 --> 01:04:56,865
Hey, baby.

1230
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:00,601
Hey, hey.

1231
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,004
-What was that?
-Are you okay?

1232
01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:03,304
What was that? No, no.

1233
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:04,439
Can you give me
a second, please?

1234
01:05:04,472 --> 01:05:05,506
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-Just give me a second.

1235
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,607
Oh, shit!

1236
01:05:06,641 --> 01:05:09,410
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1237
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:12,246
-Oh, my God. Your hand.
-No, don't worry about my hand.

1238
01:05:12,747 --> 01:05:14,315
Baby, your surgery.

1239
01:05:16,185 --> 01:05:18,020
You okay?

1240
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,955
I think so. I don't know.

1241
01:05:20,788 --> 01:05:22,390
Let me see it.

1242
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:24,692
-Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
-I know. I'm hurt.

1243
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,161
I knew we'd make a mess.

1244
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,663
I'm so sorry.

1245
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:30,531
-It was an accident.
-No. I didn't, I didn't...

1246
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,266
-It was an...
-How did we--

1247
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,335
-What did we do?
-It was an accident.

1248
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:39,942
I'm okay.

1249
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:42,376
God, I'm so sorry.

1250
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,012
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

1251
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:45,080
-Hey. Stop.
-Sorry I'm late.

1252
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:46,148
I'm a disaster, by the way.

1253
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,281
No, here.
I think I got everything.

1254
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:48,549
Yeah, no, no, thank you.

1255
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,085
-Okay.
-How was the wedding?

1256
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,320
-Also a disaster. Uh...
-No.

1257
01:05:52,353 --> 01:05:53,721
It's fine. It's fine.

1258
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,423
-How's a wedding a disaster?
-It was a little, just--

1259
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:56,825
Well, I mean, their marriage is

1260
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:58,793
probably the disaster,
but they're fine,

1261
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,528
they're lovely,
and they deserve each other.

1262
01:06:00,561 --> 01:06:01,830
But the flowers were beautiful?

1263
01:06:01,864 --> 01:06:04,867
Yes, the flowers were
off the char-- I'm so sorry.

1264
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,767
-Hmm?
-I'm so sorry.

1265
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,502
How was your--
how was your surgery?

1266
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:09,805
How did your sweet hand
hold up?

1267
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:11,339
-It was awesome.
-Really?

1268
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:12,607
-Yeah.
-Really?

1269
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,709
Yeah.
There was this moment whe--

1270
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:16,277
Um...

1271
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,378
Allysa and Marshall messed up.

1272
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:19,714
-We're going to... to Root.
-Uh-huh.

1273
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:21,516
The place we went to
with your mom.

1274
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:23,417
Um, there was this moment,
and I...

1275
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:25,053
Well, hold-- Why?

1276
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:26,621
-Why...
-I don't know.

1277
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,656
I know, but I was dying
to try the new place,

1278
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:30,591
-and we've already been there.
-Yeah, but they-they heard

1279
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,360
-how we talked about it and...
-Yeah, but we could just

1280
01:06:32,393 --> 01:06:33,761
-call them.
-No. They're already there.

1281
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,463
They ordered, like,
14 appetizers.

1282
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:36,764
No, I know. Oh, I really
wanted to try the new place.

1283
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:38,066
-You know my sister.
-I know. I'm sorry.

1284
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,600
I know. I'll-- Hey, I will
take you there next week.

1285
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,502
You know I love food.
That's all. That's all it is.

1286
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:42,838
And you know
I'm a creature of habit.

1287
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:44,206
I'll get the same exact thing
that I got last time.

1288
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,606
Okay. Yeah, I mean,
it's perfect. The food--

1289
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,843
The food is so good, so...

1290
01:06:49,211 --> 01:06:51,512
Hey. Hey.

1291
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:52,815
What?

1292
01:06:52,848 --> 01:06:54,582
-Hi.
-Hi.

1293
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:56,384
I'm sorry. It's been a--
it's been a week.

1294
01:06:56,417 --> 01:06:58,786
Um, I don't need to be
complaining to you.

1295
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:01,656
You've been through it.
Um... yeah.

1296
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,358
Tell me.
I want to hear everything.

1297
01:07:04,392 --> 01:07:06,061
-Okay.
-Okay.

1298
01:07:16,637 --> 01:07:18,439
-Oh. -Hi.
-Oh.

1299
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,242
-Hey.
-Hey.

1300
01:07:20,275 --> 01:07:21,676
-Hi. -What's up?
-I'm so sorry we're late.

1301
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:23,111
No, don't-- Just
sit down. Don't worry about it.

1302
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:24,246
Can I have this?
Can I-- Is it okay?

1303
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:25,479
-Oh. Yeah. Of course.
-Thank you.

1304
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:26,647
-We've ordered so much food.
-We're so sorry.

1305
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:28,917
-Um, yeah, it's, it's my fault.
-Oh, baby.

1306
01:07:28,951 --> 01:07:31,320
I didn't-- Ryle told me
something happened,

1307
01:07:31,352 --> 01:07:32,587
-but he didn't tell me...
-What's up?

1308
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,323
-Oh, shit.
-...it was looking like this.

1309
01:07:34,355 --> 01:07:36,490
-Look at you, honey.
-It's fine.

1310
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:37,826
-Doesn't even--
it doesn't even hurt. -Yeah.

1311
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,427
No, it was a mess.
You should have seen it.

1312
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,728
Yeah. I mean, his hand.
I mean, he got hurt, too.

1313
01:07:40,761 --> 01:07:42,231
-So we're-- Yeah.
-No, it's--

1314
01:07:42,264 --> 01:07:43,631
I'm-I'm fine.

1315
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,433
I feel bad. It was...

1316
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:47,102
-Mmm.
-It was a beautiful mess.

1317
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,904
Yeah.

1318
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:50,771
Wait, so, so, dude,
what happened with the surgery?

1319
01:07:50,806 --> 01:07:54,375
Probably the greatest day
of my life.

1320
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,111
27 hours.

1321
01:07:56,144 --> 01:07:57,545
-27 hours?
-Yeah.

1322
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:59,348
Dude, the only thing
I've done for 27 hours

1323
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,448
is day-trade
and play "Call of Duty."

1324
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:01,749
Do you guys have baby names?

1325
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:02,951
Sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt. I...

1326
01:08:02,985 --> 01:08:04,319
And go on a DraftKings bender.

1327
01:08:04,353 --> 01:08:06,121
-Baby names?
-Yeah, sorry.

1328
01:08:06,154 --> 01:08:07,622
-Oh, yeah, um...
-I was, yeah, thinking.

1329
01:08:07,655 --> 01:08:09,358
We're thinking... we're
thinking something strong.

1330
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,425
We're gonna do
big-time authors.

1331
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:13,061
-This riff...
-R.L. Stine.

1332
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:14,795
Judy Blume.

1333
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,164
...is going to be
the demise of our marriage.

1334
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:17,866
-How we doing, folks?
-H.P. Lovecraft.

1335
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,733
Uh, hi.

1336
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:19,968
How are you liking
your appetizers?

1337
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:21,769
Oh, wonderful.
I've had one bite of one thing,

1338
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:23,138
and this is already
my favorite restaurant.

1339
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:25,640
-What'd you go for?
-The, um, brussels sprouts.

1340
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,976
Ah, brussels sprouts.
What about you?

1341
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,378
What do you like?

1342
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,412
Oh, I'm-- I--
Impossible to choose.

1343
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,514
Give my regards to the chef.

1344
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:34,682
Thank you. Appreciate it.

1345
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:35,984
It's actually
my mother's recipe.

1346
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:37,585
-Oh. Oh, my...
-Hmm. That's very beautiful.

1347
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:39,487
-It's my first restaurant.
-Love that.

1348
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,890
Yeah. And I love the
creativity, dude, seriously.

1349
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:43,392
-So, um...
-I'm an entrepreneur as well,

1350
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:44,860
so I get it.

1351
01:08:44,893 --> 01:08:45,861
What's-- what's your-- what's
your deal? What's your thing?

1352
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:47,296
Right now, we're looking

1353
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:48,897
to allocate capital
in local Boston businesses,

1354
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:51,666
and a place like this
would just be amazing.

1355
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:54,502
Not to be too forward,
but what are margins right now?

1356
01:08:54,535 --> 01:08:56,204
I mean, the place is jumping.

1357
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,705
13, 14, 15%?

1358
01:08:57,738 --> 01:08:59,740
I love the story
about your mom.

1359
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:02,777
You could do a Series A
and scale this thing up...

1360
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:06,447
-Honey.
-Did I offend him?

1361
01:09:07,448 --> 01:09:10,551
No, just keep saying
"allocating capital."

1362
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:11,920
I have been holding it
for so long.

1363
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:13,688
I'm gonna go pee really quick.
I'll be right back.

1364
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:16,425
-Do you want me to come with?
-Oh, no, I'm good. I'm good.

1365
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:17,926
-Are you...?
-No, no. You guys keep talking.

1366
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,161
I'll be right back.

1367
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:32,107
Come on.

1368
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,208
What happened?

1369
01:09:35,444 --> 01:09:36,979
Come on, tell me.
What happened?

1370
01:09:37,012 --> 01:09:38,447
Nothing. I-- We-- I...

1371
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,115
We burned his hand, and I fell.

1372
01:09:41,016 --> 01:09:42,317
I know. I know. It's--

1373
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:43,718
It was an accident, though.
It was...

1374
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:45,220
-That was an accident?
-Yes. Y--

1375
01:09:50,491 --> 01:09:52,427
Leave him.

1376
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:54,562
-God.
-You got to leave him.

1377
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:56,932
-I am not your mother, Atlas.
-Leave him. Leave him.

1378
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:00,768
Are you turning into yours?

1379
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,808
-Let me out of here.
-Lily.

1380
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:09,643
Let me out now.

1381
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:11,279
-Lily.
-Stop.

1382
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,886
Wait, what is this?

1383
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:20,088
-Atlas! Stop.
-You touch her again,

1384
01:10:20,122 --> 01:10:21,957
I'll cut your hand off
and shove it down your throat,

1385
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,092
-you piece of shit.
-Stop! Atlas, stop!

1386
01:10:24,126 --> 01:10:25,559
Stop.

1387
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:29,164
-Stop.
-Oh, so this is Atlas.

1388
01:10:29,197 --> 01:10:30,165
Baby, hey.

1389
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:31,599
The homeless boy
you wasted your virginity on?

1390
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,402
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Stop. Stop.

1391
01:10:36,004 --> 01:10:38,273
Guys, stop it! Stop it!

1392
01:10:38,306 --> 01:10:40,842
-Stop it!
-Hey! Hey! Break it up!

1393
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:43,078
-Stop! Stop! No!
-Come on.

1394
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:46,448
-Please! Please, stop! No!
-Get out of my restaurant!

1395
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:47,816
Stop! Let's get out of here.

1396
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:49,750
Get out of my restaurant!

1397
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:52,454
Stop, please, please.
Let's go.

1398
01:10:52,487 --> 01:10:55,524
-Get out!
-Stop it now!

1399
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:00,228
Ryle? Excuse me.

1400
01:11:00,262 --> 01:11:01,729
Uh, Ryle.

1401
01:11:03,532 --> 01:11:05,766
Ryle. Ryle, wait.
Ryle, please, wait.

1402
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,601
What was he doing
in the bathroom, Lily?

1403
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,037
What was he doing
in the bathroom with you?

1404
01:11:09,071 --> 01:11:10,638
He saw my eye,
and I think he saw your hand.

1405
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:11,940
And-and he knows
it was an accident.

1406
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:14,209
And I told him it was
an accident, and he know...

1407
01:11:14,242 --> 01:11:16,644
Lily.

1408
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,382
What?

1409
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,786
I don't--
I don't know him.

1410
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:27,956
I mean, we-we were,
we were kids.

1411
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,991
-I don't know him now.
-Anyone but him.

1412
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:32,626
Anyone but him.

1413
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,895
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1414
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,696
I know you. Anyone but him.

1415
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:42,237
Promise me.

1416
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:45,006
Okay.

1417
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:47,675
-Okay?
-Okay.

1418
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,444
Yeah.

1419
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:51,179
I don't know. I don't...

1420
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:54,516
Okay.

1421
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:56,284
Okay, okay, okay.

1422
01:11:56,318 --> 01:11:58,120
I've never been here before.

1423
01:12:01,256 --> 01:12:02,557
-You have me.
-I...

1424
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:04,226
-You have all of me.
-I know. I know.

1425
01:12:04,259 --> 01:12:05,227
I know. I know.

1426
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,595
So, if I'm not what you want,
you just...

1427
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:08,864
No, no, no, no, you're fine.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1428
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:13,101
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1429
01:12:13,135 --> 01:12:14,836
Stop. Stop.

1430
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:17,205
-I love you, Lily.
-I know. I know.

1431
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:20,308
I know. I know. I know.

1432
01:12:22,544 --> 01:12:24,179
I love you, Lily.

1433
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:27,983
I love you, too.

1434
01:12:35,323 --> 01:12:37,658
No, please stop.
No, please, please.

1435
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,896
Lily! Open the door.

1436
01:12:40,929 --> 01:12:42,663
-You've got to go right now.
-Lily!

1437
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:43,965
-I'm coming!
-Open the door!

1438
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:45,033
You got to go right now.
Put your clothes on, Atlas.

1439
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,535
Who's in there?

1440
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:48,136
He's coming.
Please, come on, Atlas.

1441
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,171
Hey! Open...

1442
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:24,738
-Thank you. Enjoy.
-Yeah.

1443
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:25,840
Thank you for coming by.

1444
01:13:25,874 --> 01:13:27,175
-We appreciate it.
-Of course.

1445
01:13:27,209 --> 01:13:28,243
-Bye.
-Oh, wow.

1446
01:13:28,276 --> 01:13:29,110
-Thank you.
-Hi.

1447
01:13:29,144 --> 01:13:30,645
-Thanks so much for stopping in.
-Yeah.

1448
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:32,280
-It's busy.
-Yeah.

1449
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:36,251
Whew. I think
that's the last of it.

1450
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:37,953
How you doing, mama?

1451
01:13:37,986 --> 01:13:40,655
I'm doing.

1452
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:41,957
I'm doing.

1453
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,291
You in that little dress.

1454
01:13:43,325 --> 01:13:46,394
Do you mind if I...
if I see the baby for a moment?

1455
01:13:46,428 --> 01:13:47,862
Oh, yeah. Have a visit.

1456
01:13:47,896 --> 01:13:51,099
Hi, bubba. How you doing?
You getting big.

1457
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,601
Hey, question.

1458
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:56,037
If, um, we're not allowed to
go back to that restaurant...

1459
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:59,341
-Yeah.
-...why is he allowed to come

1460
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:01,343
to this store?

1461
01:14:05,714 --> 01:14:08,083
-I don't-- Okay.
-Coffee.

1462
01:14:08,116 --> 01:14:09,351
I'm getting coffee.

1463
01:14:09,384 --> 01:14:11,086
Would you like some? Hmm?

1464
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,054
-No, I'm good. Thank you.
-All right.

1465
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:16,124
-Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
-Hi.

1466
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,993
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1467
01:14:18,026 --> 01:14:19,928
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah.

1468
01:14:22,597 --> 01:14:23,797
Hi.

1469
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,001
Hi.

1470
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:28,870
This is incredible.

1471
01:14:29,271 --> 01:14:30,138
Yeah, thanks.

1472
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:33,041
Kind of exactly, uh,
how I imagined it.

1473
01:14:35,277 --> 01:14:36,878
Yeah, yours, too.

1474
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:38,413
Thanks.

1475
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:41,416
Look at us.

1476
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:46,121
So, look, I, um...

1477
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:51,693
I came by the next day
after the fight...

1478
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:54,529
...but he was here, and I-I
just didn't think that was a...

1479
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:55,830
a good idea.

1480
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,534
I just-- I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

1481
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:01,236
-I was...
-Yeah.

1482
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:04,039
...out of my mind and-and
acted like a jackass, and...

1483
01:15:04,072 --> 01:15:05,907
I just feel really bad
and I'm s-- I'm sorry.

1484
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,777
Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good.
It's, um...

1485
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,046
Yeah, it's-- It was
a misunderstanding. So...

1486
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:12,414
Well, I don't--
I don't know.

1487
01:15:12,447 --> 01:15:13,815
I mean, no, it wasn't.

1488
01:15:13,848 --> 01:15:15,383
I don't think it was, but...

1489
01:15:20,422 --> 01:15:23,024
Why are you here now? I gave
you my address months ago.

1490
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:24,359
What are you--
what are you doing?

1491
01:15:24,392 --> 01:15:25,560
I came the next day.

1492
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:35,937
And I drive this street a lot.

1493
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:45,847
Yeah.

1494
01:15:50,452 --> 01:15:51,920
I'm sorry.

1495
01:15:56,658 --> 01:15:58,026
Are you happy?

1496
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:01,930
Yeah.

1497
01:16:03,798 --> 01:16:05,200
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1498
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,335
I couldn't be happier.

1499
01:16:09,604 --> 01:16:10,605
Are you?

1500
01:16:14,175 --> 01:16:15,176
No.

1501
01:16:20,315 --> 01:16:21,349
Sorry.

1502
01:16:34,629 --> 01:16:35,764
That your phone?

1503
01:16:35,797 --> 01:16:37,098
Yeah.

1504
01:16:39,835 --> 01:16:42,036
What are you doing?

1505
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:47,942
That's my number.

1506
01:16:47,976 --> 01:16:49,310
In case you need it.

1507
01:16:52,714 --> 01:16:55,150
Okay, well, I won't, so...

1508
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,751
But thank you.

1509
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:58,153
I hope you don't.

1510
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:10,031
Hey, that, um... that thing

1511
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:12,500
that he said about that--
you know, with us.

1512
01:17:12,534 --> 01:17:13,568
It wasn't...

1513
01:17:14,369 --> 01:17:15,937
It wasn't wasted.

1514
01:17:16,872 --> 01:17:18,106
I know.

1515
01:17:20,308 --> 01:17:21,409
I was there.

1516
01:17:37,192 --> 01:17:38,326
Hi.

1517
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:45,166
-Hey.
-Hey.

1518
01:17:48,069 --> 01:17:50,038
Oh.

1519
01:17:50,071 --> 01:17:51,807
Mmm. That smells good.

1520
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:54,008
Mmm. Thank you.

1521
01:17:57,947 --> 01:17:59,447
Are you happy?

1522
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:04,118
Um...

1523
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:06,387
are you okay?

1524
01:18:07,155 --> 01:18:09,023
Yeah. I'm just...

1525
01:18:09,057 --> 01:18:10,525
I'm just curious.

1526
01:18:15,396 --> 01:18:16,431
I wasn't.

1527
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:20,401
But you... you make me happy.

1528
01:18:21,904 --> 01:18:24,038
Are you happy?

1529
01:18:24,072 --> 01:18:25,773
I mean,
I don't think anyone's happy

1530
01:18:25,808 --> 01:18:28,176
all the time, but, um...

1531
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,979
I don't know if I like
the sound of that.

1532
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:31,947
No, no. It's just, you know...

1533
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:33,816
Of course, I deal with, um,

1534
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:37,820
you know, my stuff and,
you know...

1535
01:18:37,853 --> 01:18:39,087
life and

1536
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,388
-ticking clock and, you know...
-Right.

1537
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:43,157
...all those decisions
that-that women have to...

1538
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:44,827
have to worry
about, but, um,

1539
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,829
I think I'm
an innately happy person.

1540
01:18:46,862 --> 01:18:49,197
It's, um, probably just

1541
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:51,199
a coping mechanism
I learned from my mom.

1542
01:18:51,232 --> 01:18:53,234
-So...
-Your mom?

1543
01:18:56,738 --> 01:18:58,273
My dad used to hit her.

1544
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,684
Shit, I'm so sorry.

1545
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:12,754
You never told me that.

1546
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:16,424
It's not something
people talk about.

1547
01:19:17,826 --> 01:19:19,294
Did he ever hurt you?

1548
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:23,097
No. He nearly
killed Atlas, though.

1549
01:19:28,803 --> 01:19:31,339
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1550
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:32,774
Oh.

1551
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:36,711
Oh, God. I...

1552
01:19:38,981 --> 01:19:40,548
I'm so embarrassed. I...

1553
01:19:41,749 --> 01:19:43,618
That mess at the restaurant.

1554
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,622
I didn't know. That must
have been so hard on you.

1555
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:49,657
Yeah.

1556
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:52,061
Baby, all I want to do
in my life is protect you.

1557
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:53,728
You know that, right?

1558
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:56,297
When you hurt yourself
by accident, when you...

1559
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:59,068
stub your toe, I blame myself.

1560
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,870
It's like it's my fault
that the wall was there.

1561
01:20:01,904 --> 01:20:03,504
Oh, stop.

1562
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:06,240
I am the luckiest goddamn man
on this planet.

1563
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:09,644
And I could clean up.

1564
01:20:09,677 --> 01:20:10,578
Trust me.

1565
01:20:10,612 --> 01:20:12,313
Okay, I'm not trying
to hear about that.

1566
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:13,481
You don't want to
hear about that?

1567
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:15,017
-No.
-Just a little bit?

1568
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,085
No.

1569
01:20:16,117 --> 01:20:17,385
You know,
I'm a ripped neurosurgeon,

1570
01:20:17,418 --> 01:20:18,486
for Christ's sake.

1571
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:19,855
When was the last time
you saw someone

1572
01:20:19,888 --> 01:20:22,290
who looked like me
that wasn't on a daytime soap?

1573
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:24,792
I mean, come to think of it,
yeah, no, I haven't.

1574
01:20:24,827 --> 01:20:26,996
-Yeah.
-And I'm rich.

1575
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:28,696
Oh, and humble.

1576
01:20:30,933 --> 01:20:32,467
We can work on that.

1577
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:35,436
God, I love you.

1578
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:38,539
I know. I love you, too.
That's the problem.

1579
01:20:40,042 --> 01:20:41,142
It's a big problem.

1580
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:42,343
Mm-hmm.

1581
01:20:42,377 --> 01:20:43,979
It's a really big problem.

1582
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,480
Mmm.

1583
01:20:46,949 --> 01:20:48,616
Mmm.

1584
01:21:03,798 --> 01:21:06,501
Stop.

1585
01:21:14,342 --> 01:21:17,278
Look at her.
She's like a little alien.

1586
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:19,580
Yeah, she's perfect.

1587
01:21:24,385 --> 01:21:26,287
Do you want to hold her?

1588
01:21:27,388 --> 01:21:29,825
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I knew it.

1589
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:31,093
Here you go.

1590
01:21:31,126 --> 01:21:33,227
Look at you. Okay.

1591
01:21:33,261 --> 01:21:34,429
-There.
-Hi.

1592
01:21:34,462 --> 01:21:36,531
There we go. Right there.

1593
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:39,168
-Oh, you're so beautiful. Hi.
-Oh, wow.

1594
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,368
Oh.

1595
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:42,470
-You're a mama.
-Yeah.

1596
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:44,907
Oh, my sister's a mama.

1597
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,842
And you're an uncle. Hmm.

1598
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:53,548
Wow.

1599
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:54,716
You did it.

1600
01:21:56,051 --> 01:21:57,086
This is just hormones.

1601
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:59,088
Don't look at me.

1602
01:21:59,121 --> 01:22:00,321
Do you guys want kids?

1603
01:22:00,354 --> 01:22:01,622
-Oh, well...
-No pressure.

1604
01:22:01,656 --> 01:22:03,725
We're not... not putting you
on the spot right now.

1605
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:06,862
I mean, it would be great for
childcare and stuff like that.

1606
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:09,731
I'm not gonna make her
put on a white dress

1607
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:11,599
and have my babies.

1608
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:14,669
Unless she wants to.

1609
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:18,006
Then I-I would marry her
tonight.

1610
01:22:23,644 --> 01:22:25,180
-Oh, shit. He's serious.
-Oh, my gosh.

1611
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:27,782
Ryle, you are...
you are drunk on baby smell.

1612
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:29,650
No, no, no.
I am serious as an aneurysm.

1613
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:31,486
Oh, God. Please don't do
neurosurgeon humor

1614
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:33,521
when you're propos... if...
I mean, if you are.

1615
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:35,590
-Is that... Is this...
-He's going around.

1616
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:36,758
-Oh, my God.
-I mean, if that's...

1617
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:38,326
-No, are you actually...
-Give me the baby.

1618
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:39,660
He's actually... Please stop.
Please stop. Please stop.

1619
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:41,429
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
-No, no. No, no, stop.

1620
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:42,931
-Oh, he's doing it.
-Oh, my God.

1621
01:22:42,965 --> 01:22:44,532
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Okay.

1622
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:45,934
Okay, what...

1623
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:49,171
-Can we just-just...
-Can you get the baby?

1624
01:22:49,204 --> 01:22:51,240
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can
take that. -We have a baby.

1625
01:22:51,272 --> 01:22:53,842
You gorgeous girl.
Here you go, baby.

1626
01:22:53,876 --> 01:22:54,810
You get back down there.

1627
01:22:54,843 --> 01:22:56,845
You get back down there
right this second.

1628
01:23:03,484 --> 01:23:05,386
Will you marry me,
Lily Blossom Bloom?

1629
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:10,491
-Yeah?
-Okay.

1630
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:11,759
This is just...

1631
01:23:11,793 --> 01:23:13,694
-Oh, he did it.
-I'm just...

1632
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:16,165
This is a miracle.

1633
01:23:16,198 --> 01:23:18,000
Oh, thank God.

1634
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:19,567
Oh, my God.

1635
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:23,771
Oh, my...

1636
01:23:28,576 --> 01:23:29,845
But we'll do
a proper wedding one day...

1637
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:31,379
You got married without me.

1638
01:23:31,412 --> 01:23:33,081
And I continue to be
very sorry,

1639
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:35,683
but at some point, you're gonna
have to forgive me.

1640
01:23:35,716 --> 01:23:38,086
-I-I will wear you down.
-My wife will wear you down.

1641
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,420
Not possible.

1642
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:41,123
I don't think you should
ever forgive her. Just saying.

1643
01:23:41,156 --> 01:23:42,257
Oh, okay.
That's enough of that.

1644
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:43,524
Hold on,
can you charge my phone?

1645
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:44,692
I haven't been dreaming

1646
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:46,694
about your wedding day
your whole life.

1647
01:23:46,727 --> 01:23:48,230
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life.

1648
01:23:48,263 --> 01:23:49,730
And I'm sorry,
I just feel cheated.

1649
01:23:49,764 --> 01:23:51,532
I... Yeah, okay.
Got it. Thanks, Mom.

1650
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:53,501
Okay, we're gonna
find a way to move on.

1651
01:23:53,534 --> 01:23:55,636
If I don't get to
watch you walk down the aisle,

1652
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,106
I will not be denied
watching you squirm.

1653
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,473
You want to make it up to me?

1654
01:23:59,507 --> 01:24:01,709
-Yes, please.
-Make me a grandbaby.

1655
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:03,611
No, three. Three.
Make it triplets.

1656
01:24:03,644 --> 01:24:05,613
All right, can you just...
can we move past

1657
01:24:05,646 --> 01:24:08,382
this conversation, please?

1658
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:10,919
You okay?

1659
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,921
What happened?

1660
01:24:12,955 --> 01:24:14,689
Mom, I'll-I'll call you
right back, okay?

1661
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:16,325
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah, no, hang up.

1662
01:24:19,194 --> 01:24:20,595
Hey, what happened?

1663
01:24:25,499 --> 01:24:26,935
Hey, you okay?

1664
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:37,279
I dropped your phone...

1665
01:24:37,312 --> 01:24:38,914
and the case fell off.

1666
01:24:50,192 --> 01:24:51,592
And I found this.

1667
01:24:57,933 --> 01:24:59,500
I called the number.

1668
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:13,115
-It wasn't...
-You promised me.

1669
01:25:13,148 --> 01:25:15,117
-I know.
-I would never lie to you.

1670
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:16,484
I know. It's-it's nothing.

1671
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:19,021
-It's nothing?
-Yeah.

1672
01:25:19,054 --> 01:25:20,521
-Yeah.
-It's nothing?

1673
01:25:20,554 --> 01:25:22,556
Yes. Yes, I promise.

1674
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,027
Yeah.

1675
01:25:27,428 --> 01:25:28,629
Okay?

1676
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:38,506
It's nothing.

1677
01:25:39,174 --> 01:25:40,409
Okay.

1678
01:25:40,441 --> 01:25:41,676
Yeah.

1679
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,451
Ryle.

1680
01:25:51,086 --> 01:25:52,687
Wait, baby, I promise

1681
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,323
I didn't mean to see him.

1682
01:25:54,356 --> 01:25:55,958
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-No, no, no, no.

1683
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:57,692
-Lily, stop!
-I promise. Please. No, it's...

1684
01:25:57,725 --> 01:25:59,061
Please just listen to me.
Please.

1685
01:25:59,094 --> 01:26:01,029
-You promised me, Lily.
-I didn't know he was coming.

1686
01:26:01,063 --> 01:26:01,930
-Stop.
-Just talk to me.

1687
01:26:01,964 --> 01:26:03,231
-Stop. Stop.
-Baby, please just stop...

1688
01:26:03,265 --> 01:26:04,366
-You stop.
-Stop!

1689
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:06,567
Please don't...

1690
01:26:10,272 --> 01:26:12,341
Shh. Hey.

1691
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:13,842
Just try to be still.

1692
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:15,944
Just try to be still.

1693
01:26:19,547 --> 01:26:21,350
It's all done. Shh. I'm here.

1694
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:22,750
-Stop.
-I'm here.

1695
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:26,989
-Hey.
-What... what happened?

1696
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,925
You fell down the stairs.

1697
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:33,128
No, no, no, d-d-don't-don't...

1698
01:26:33,161 --> 01:26:34,997
don't touch it.

1699
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,332
Yeah, you tripped, and...

1700
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:39,633
and I, um...
I-I tried to catch you.

1701
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:42,204
-No, Ryle, no.
-Y-You're okay. You're okay.

1702
01:26:44,139 --> 01:26:45,941
-It hurts.
-Don't-don't-don't-don't...

1703
01:26:45,974 --> 01:26:47,675
I know it hurts. It hurts.
You're okay.

1704
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,845
-Okay.
-You're okay.

1705
01:26:52,314 --> 01:26:53,614
Do you know who you are?

1706
01:26:54,682 --> 01:26:56,418
-Lily Bloom.
-Okay.

1707
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:58,320
Where are you?

1708
01:26:58,353 --> 01:26:59,988
-Our apartment.
-Okay. Who am I?

1709
01:27:01,857 --> 01:27:03,258
My husband.

1710
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:06,495
And what am I doing right now?

1711
01:27:07,262 --> 01:27:08,830
Helping me.

1712
01:27:11,532 --> 01:27:13,701
How many fingers
am I holding up?

1713
01:27:14,369 --> 01:27:16,238
Five.

1714
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:17,439
Five. And now?

1715
01:27:17,472 --> 01:27:19,241
-Two.
-Okay.

1716
01:27:19,274 --> 01:27:20,674
Tell me it's nothing.

1717
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:26,547
Oh, it's nothing.

1718
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:29,117
Yeah, come.

1719
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:31,685
Thank you.

1720
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:39,861
-Am I okay?
-You're okay. You're okay.

1721
01:27:40,228 --> 01:27:41,562

1851
01:34:49,825 --> 01:34:51,659
Please don't do this.

1852
01:34:51,693 --> 01:34:53,428
Please. Please. Please.

1853
01:34:53,461 --> 01:34:54,930
No!

1854
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,122
I don't think I'm showing you
how much I love you.

1855
01:35:21,155 --> 01:35:22,858
Yes, you have.

1856
01:35:22,892 --> 01:35:24,626
No. No, I haven't.

1857

become her.

1860

You're not becoming her.

1861
01:36:35,363 --> 01:36:37,265
Don't even think about that.

1862
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:39,500
Okay?

1863
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:42,503
-Yeah.
-You're not.

1864
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:55,884
Is that what I think it is?

1865
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,488
Yeah.

1866
01:37:05,393 --> 01:37:06,761
I want to tell you something.

1867
01:37:06,794 --> 01:37:08,296
I don't know if
it's the right time, but I...

1868
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:09,865
Sorry for the delay.

1869
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,500
Been really busy tonight.

1870
01:37:13,902 --> 01:37:15,236
So, we have
a certain examination

1871
01:37:15,269 --> 01:37:16,804
for these situations.

1872
01:37:16,839 --> 01:37:18,473
It's called the SANE exam.

1873
01:37:18,506 --> 01:37:19,741
It's completely optional,
of course.

1874
01:37:19,774 --> 01:37:21,209
Oh, I, um, uh...

1875
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:23,478
I w-- He didn't...

1876
01:37:24,947 --> 01:37:26,815
-No, I wasn't-- It's...
-Did he try?

1877
01:37:28,349 --> 01:37:30,752
I don't need the exam.
Thank you. Yeah.

1878
01:37:32,553 --> 01:37:33,922
May I?

1879
01:37:33,956 --> 01:37:35,657
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1880
01:37:40,129 --> 01:37:42,131
-Does this hurt?
-Mm-mm.

1881
01:37:42,163 --> 01:37:44,133
-This?
-Mm-mm.

1882
01:37:44,165 --> 01:37:45,834
No, it's just the skin. Yeah.

1883
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,436
So, usually...

1884
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:50,005
I'd give you an X-ray
on this collarbone

1885
01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:51,073
to make sure that

1886
01:37:51,106 --> 01:37:52,306
-it isn't fractured.
-Mm-hmm.

1887
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:55,443
But given your situation,
we're gonna clean it up,

1888
01:37:55,476 --> 01:37:59,014
and the nurse is gonna come in
and give you a tetanus shot.

1889
01:37:59,048 --> 01:38:01,249
Uh, I-- I don't understand.

1890
01:38:01,282 --> 01:38:03,085
We don't give X-rays
to pregnant women

1891
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:04,853
unless it's vital.

1892
01:38:04,887 --> 01:38:05,954
Okay?

1893
01:38:09,158 --> 01:38:11,093
-Yeah.
-All right. I'll be right back.

1894
01:38:11,126 --> 01:38:12,627
-Okay.
-Okay.

1895
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,851
There's no Cassie, is there?

1896
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:38,352
No.

1897
01:38:40,254 --> 01:38:41,957
No, there isn't.

1898
01:38:45,027 --> 01:38:48,262
It's, uh, it's the place.

1899
01:38:53,936 --> 01:38:57,538
Um... kitchen, living room.

1900
01:38:57,572 --> 01:38:59,975
Um, hey, let me grab you
some clothes.

1901
01:39:10,318 --> 01:39:11,486
Thank you.

1902
01:39:11,519 --> 01:39:13,254
My dad won't even notice
they're gone.

1903
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:18,326
Um, bedroom's all yours.

1904
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:19,727
No, I'm not gonna
take your bedroom.

1905
01:39:19,761 --> 01:39:22,831
No. Please. I have to get up
early for work anyway, so...

1906
01:39:22,865 --> 01:39:25,500
I love that couch.
It's-it's a good couch.

1907
01:39:26,467 --> 01:39:29,171
So, stay as long
as you want.

1908
01:39:29,204 --> 01:39:30,304
Thank you.

1909
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:31,974
Okay. Now, get some rest.

1910
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:35,610
See you tomorrow.

1911
01:40:42,211 --> 01:40:43,411
Hey.

1912
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:44,980
Hi.

1913
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:52,821
I wasn't sure
if you were hungry,

1914
01:40:52,855 --> 01:40:55,824
so I went with
a few fan favorites.

1915
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:04,565
What song do you want
at your funeral?

1916
01:41:07,468 --> 01:41:09,670
If you had to pick one.

1917
01:41:09,704 --> 01:41:11,306
Have you not thought
about this?

1918
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:12,640
What song you're gonna play
at my funeral?

1919
01:41:12,673 --> 01:41:15,844
Yeah. Oh, at my funeral,
I'm thinking

1920
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:18,446
-Creed, "With Arms Wide Open."
-Mm-hmm.

1921
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:20,414
-You know. ♪ With arms wide... ♪
-Yeah.

1922
01:41:20,448 --> 01:41:22,217
-As the casket's being lowered.
-Uh-huh.

1923
01:41:33,061 --> 01:41:34,495
You're gonna be okay.

1924
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,935
It doesn't feel like it.

1925
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:41,937
I know.

1926
01:41:42,803 --> 01:41:43,939
But you are.

1927
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,876
I think it's a little different
this time.

1928
01:41:51,412 --> 01:41:53,382
If I can't even
take care of myself,

1929
01:41:53,414 --> 01:41:55,083
then how am I, um...

1930
01:41:56,385 --> 01:41:59,654
you know, supposed
to take care of a baby?

1931
01:42:14,369 --> 01:42:15,736
The night I went
to that old abandoned house,

1932
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:19,007
I didn't go there because
I needed a place to stay.

1933
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:21,043
I went there to kill myself.

1934
01:42:23,511 --> 01:42:25,479
And I was sitting
on the living room floor,

1935
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:27,983
and I saw you
in your bedroom window.

1936
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,818
The light came on,

1937
01:42:29,851 --> 01:42:31,652
and you poked your head
through that curtain,

1938
01:42:31,686 --> 01:42:35,523
and as soon as I saw your face,
I couldn't do it.

1939
01:42:36,858 --> 01:42:38,393
The next day,
you brought me food.

1940
01:42:38,427 --> 01:42:39,928
You fed me.

1941
01:42:46,667 --> 01:42:48,070
I mean, you saved...

1942
01:42:49,537 --> 01:42:52,540
You saved my life
is what I'm trying to say.

1943
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:56,078
That's who you are.

1944
01:42:56,111 --> 01:42:59,915
And if you decide to keep it,
you are going to be...

1945
01:43:01,283 --> 01:43:03,051
...an amazing mother.

1946
01:43:04,453 --> 01:43:07,189
And that baby is so lucky.

1947
01:43:12,427 --> 01:43:13,962
You've got this.

1948
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:42,190
Uh, Lily.

1949
01:44:16,992 --> 01:44:18,659
If you ever find yourself
in the position

1950
01:44:18,692 --> 01:44:21,729
to love somebody again,
just fall in love with me.

1951
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:30,238
Yeah. Okay.

1952
01:45:06,374 --> 01:45:07,843
I'm so sorry.

1953
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:14,282
I've been watching him
my entire life,

1954
01:45:14,316 --> 01:45:16,184
and I've seen...

1955
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:20,589
...how afraid he is

1956
01:45:20,621 --> 01:45:23,892
of opening his heart
to anyone...

1957
01:45:25,759 --> 01:45:27,695
...ever since he was a kid.

1958
01:45:29,131 --> 01:45:33,801
And I think I felt
that he was dying inside.

1959
01:45:35,837 --> 01:45:38,106
Just dying inside,
little by little...

1960
01:45:40,175 --> 01:45:41,877
...until he met you.

1961
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:47,648
And I'm not making
any excuses, uh...

1962
01:45:49,117 --> 01:45:50,986
I never...

1963
01:45:51,019 --> 01:45:53,889
I never thought
he was capable of this.

1964
01:45:57,893 --> 01:45:59,060
Um...

1965
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:02,864
Would it-- Would it be okay

1966
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,966
if I asked
what happened to Emerson?

1967
01:46:06,201 --> 01:46:07,369
Of course.

1968
01:46:10,839 --> 01:46:13,308
You deserve to know,
and it's our family.

1969
01:46:16,178 --> 01:46:17,678
Um...

1970
01:46:20,515 --> 01:46:22,384
My father had a gun.

1971
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:27,688
Ryle and Emerson were playing
in the house,

1972
01:46:27,721 --> 01:46:30,325
you know,
pretending to be cowboys,

1973
01:46:31,293 --> 01:46:32,827
and they found it.

1974
01:46:34,362 --> 01:46:36,064
And Ryle was six years old.

1975
01:46:36,965 --> 01:46:39,034
He was a six-year-old boy.

1976
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:43,939
He didn't even know
that it was a real gun.

1977
01:46:43,972 --> 01:46:46,441
He thought that
it was pretend...

1978
01:46:47,542 --> 01:46:50,879
...until it was t-- too late.

1979
01:46:53,515 --> 01:46:55,884
-Emerson was our brother...
-I'm so sorry, Allysa.

1980
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:58,019
-...h-his best friend.
-I'm sorry.

1981
01:47:00,922 --> 01:47:02,657
He's never been
the same since.

1982
01:47:02,691 --> 01:47:03,992
Yeah.

1983
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:08,863
To be at that funeral...

1984
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:21,076
I really did
used to love flowers.

1985
01:47:23,345 --> 01:47:25,213
Listen to me.

1986
01:47:25,247 --> 01:47:28,316
As his sister,
I wish more than anything

1987
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:31,353
that you could find a way
to forgive him.

1988
01:47:33,989 --> 01:47:36,191
But as your best friend,

1989
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:39,861
Lily, if you take him back,

1990
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:42,297
I will never
speak to you again.

1991

2081
01:52:25,046 --> 01:52:26,781
There she is.

2082
01:52:26,815 --> 01:52:28,750
Yeah.

2083
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,219
Big old noggin.
You feel that?

2084
01:52:31,252 --> 01:52:33,889
That's her little heel.
You feel that?

2085
01:52:33,923 --> 01:52:36,391
She's kind of stretching.

2086
01:52:36,424 --> 01:52:38,493
Yeah.

2087
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:45,633
Come home.

2088
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:50,371
Look, I won't--

2089
01:52:50,405 --> 01:52:53,141
It will never happen again.

2090
01:52:53,174 --> 01:52:55,476
I promise.
I will-- I will get help.

2091
01:52:57,947 --> 01:52:59,280
Please come home.

2092
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:10,358
-I'm s--
-You're gonna be late for work.

2093
01:54:20,695 --> 01:54:21,897
Come.

2094
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:23,398
You want to join us?

2095
01:54:26,434 --> 01:54:28,236
We got room for one more.

2096
01:54:29,637 --> 01:54:30,873
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

2097
01:54:32,273 --> 01:54:34,175
I know. I got you.

2098
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:35,710
I got you.

2099
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:40,381
-Hey.
-Want to hold her?

2100
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:43,284
Yeah.

2101
01:54:43,317 --> 01:54:45,553
-Here you go.
-Hey.

2102
01:54:46,454 --> 01:54:47,422
Hi.

2103
01:54:47,455 --> 01:54:49,091
Mommy's got you.

2104
01:54:49,124 --> 01:54:50,491
Yeah.

2105
01:54:50,525 --> 01:54:52,360
Still here.

2106
01:54:52,393 --> 01:54:54,462
Mommy's got you.
I know, I know.

2107
01:54:54,495 --> 01:54:55,998
I know.

2108
01:54:56,031 --> 01:54:58,433
Keep her cozy.

2109
01:54:58,466 --> 01:55:01,202
-Oh, hi.
-There we go.

2110
01:55:01,235 --> 01:55:02,670
Hi, beautiful.

2111
01:55:02,704 --> 01:55:04,405
There we go.

2112
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:06,474
-I'm your daddy.
-Yeah.

2113
01:55:07,176 --> 01:55:08,911
You sure are.

2114
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:10,545
Yeah.

2115
01:55:12,346 --> 01:55:14,716
What should we call her?

2116
01:55:14,749 --> 01:55:17,685
I was thinking we could
name her after your brother.

2117
01:55:24,559 --> 01:55:25,693
Emerson.

2118
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:27,662
Yeah. Emerson.

2119
01:55:27,695 --> 01:55:30,732
That way,
we can call her Emmy.

2120
01:55:32,767 --> 01:55:34,435
What do you think?

2121
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:37,538
I think that's the nicest thing

2122
01:55:37,572 --> 01:55:38,907
anyone's ever done for me.

2123
01:55:42,010 --> 01:55:44,545
Thank you.

2124
01:55:47,381 --> 01:55:50,518
It's okay.

2125
01:55:50,551 --> 01:55:52,787
It's okay. Daddy's got you.

2126
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:54,223
Daddy's got you, Emmy.

2127
01:55:56,091 --> 01:55:57,291
Hi.

2128
01:55:58,127 --> 01:56:01,662
Hi, beautiful.
I'm your daddy.

2129
01:56:07,069 --> 01:56:08,803
I'm gonna
keep you safe, Emmy.

2130
01:56:10,271 --> 01:56:11,572
I'm gonna keep you safe.

2131
01:56:20,681 --> 01:56:21,884
I want a divorce.

2132
01:56:24,385 --> 01:56:27,156
Hey. Let's not.

2133
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:28,991
Hey, yes.

2134
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,058
Yeah.

2135
01:56:30,092 --> 01:56:32,393
Yeah.

2136
01:56:34,263 --> 01:56:35,998
It's not for you or me.
It's for her.

2137
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:39,634
Yeah, you know.

2138
01:56:40,701 --> 01:56:41,669
Look at her.

2139
01:56:41,702 --> 01:56:44,239
What if, one day, she, uh...

2140
01:56:44,273 --> 01:56:45,974
she came to you and said,
"My boyfriend hit me"?

2141
01:56:46,008 --> 01:56:47,075
What would you...

2142
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,545
what would you say to her?

2143
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:54,782
Or if she said,
"Daddy, my husband

2144
01:56:54,817 --> 01:56:57,119
"pushed me down the stairs,
but he--

2145
01:56:57,152 --> 01:57:00,621
he said it was an accident,
so it's fine"?

2146
01:57:02,657 --> 01:57:04,625
Or if she said
her husband held her down

2147
01:57:04,659 --> 01:57:06,794
and she begged him to stop,

2148
01:57:06,829 --> 01:57:09,363
but he swore
he'd never do it again?

2149
01:57:12,201 --> 01:57:13,801
What would you tell her?

2150
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:18,506
If the person she loved...

2151
01:57:20,341 --> 01:57:22,343
...was...

2152
01:57:22,376 --> 01:57:24,980
was hurting her,
what would you say to her?

2153
01:57:35,456 --> 01:57:37,391
I would beg her
to leave him.

2154
01:57:39,061 --> 01:57:40,062
Yeah.

2155
01:57:41,529 --> 01:57:43,664
And I'd beg her
never to go back.

2156
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,942
Want to go to your mama?

2157
01:57:53,976 --> 01:57:55,476
You have such a good mama.

2158
01:57:55,509 --> 01:57:57,411
Here.

2159
01:58:00,381 --> 01:58:02,050
I got you, bug. I got you.

2160
01:58:02,084 --> 01:58:03,185
Yes, my love.

2161
01:58:03,218 --> 01:58:04,953
Okay. I'm gonna...

2162
01:58:35,117 --> 01:58:37,019
Yeah.

2163
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,655
There you go, bug.
Mama's got you.

2164
01:58:42,556 --> 01:58:44,192
Mama's got you.

2165
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:47,829
Yeah.

2166
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:50,899
Yeah.

2167
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,903
Stops right here, bubba,
with you and me.

2168
01:58:58,373 --> 01:59:00,075
It ends with us.

2169
01:59:00,108 --> 01:59:02,878
Okay?

2170
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:07,215
It ends with us.

2171
01:59:10,352 --> 01:59:12,453
Yeah. Yeah.

2172
01:59:30,072 --> 01:59:32,407
-Love you.
-Thank you.

2173
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:34,709
Oh, Mama, I love you.

2174
01:59:37,245 --> 01:59:39,081
I'm so proud of you.

2175
01:59:45,686 --> 01:59:47,555
Okay.

2176
01:59:47,588 --> 01:59:49,224
-Okay.
-Okay.

2177
01:59:49,257 --> 01:59:51,426
-Be right back.
-Okay.

2178
01:59:57,232 --> 01:59:59,134
Let's go meet your grandpa.

2179
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,505
Okay.

2180
02:00:14,249 --> 02:00:15,750
Goodbye, Pops.

2181
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:20,922
Okay.

2182
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:26,094
That's enough of that.

2183
02:00:27,896 --> 02:00:29,865
Come on.

2184
02:01:14,509 --> 02:01:17,145
It's also a little scary.

2185
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:13,401
-Hi.
-Hi.

2186
02:02:15,636 --> 02:02:18,039
-How've you...
-Was that your daughter?

2187
02:02:19,107 --> 02:02:20,942
Yeah, that's Emmy.

2188
02:02:20,976 --> 02:02:22,811
I saw you guys before.
I just...

2189
02:02:22,844 --> 02:02:24,613
-Mm-hmm.
-I didn't...

2190
02:02:24,645 --> 02:02:25,981
Yeah.

2191
02:02:27,983 --> 02:02:30,252
-She's beautiful.
-Oh.

2192
02:02:30,285 --> 02:02:31,419
Thanks.

2193
02:02:33,421 --> 02:02:35,924

No.

it's, uh, just us.
