00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,077
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

181
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,545
Kyle, don't go!

182
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,017
Kyle!

183
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,926
It's like a giant strobe light,

184
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,512
burning right to my eyes.

185
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,143
Somehow I can still see.

186
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,866
We know
the dream's the same every night.

187
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,411
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

188
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,835
Children look like burnt paper.

189
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,046
Black.

190
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,632
Not moving.

191
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,387
And then the blast wave hits them.

192
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,773
And they fly apart like leaves.

193
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,525
(Sobs)

194
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,905
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

195
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,995
(Sarah) It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

196
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,957
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

197
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:23,254
On August 29 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

198
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,924
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

199
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,635
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

200
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,847
God! You think you're safe and alive.

201
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,224
You're already dead. Everybody!

202
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,852
Him. You. You're dead already.

203
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,813
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

204
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,983
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

205
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:44,984
Cos I know it happened!

206
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,777
It happened!

207
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,999
(Calmly) I feel much better now.

208
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,960
Clearer.

209
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:08,507
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

210
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,061
It's helped me to have a goal,

211
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,314
something to look forward to.

212
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,565
What is that?

213
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:30,905
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

214
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,658
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

215
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,953
and I could have visitors.

216
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:41,540
Well, it's been six months and...

217
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,586
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

218
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,297
I see.

219
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,259
(Sighs)

220
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:56,555
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

221
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:00,017
Now you think they don't exist?

222
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,436
They don't exist.

223
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,230
I know that now.

224
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,232
But you've told me
on many occasions

225
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,777
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

226
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,156
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

227
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,659
They would have found something
at the factory.

228
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
(Silberman) I see.

229
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,915
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

230
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,545
No. Why would they?

231
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,715
Let's try a new position right there.

232
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,094
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

233
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,805
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

234
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,683
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

235
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:41,976
Mr Dyson?

236
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,855
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

237
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,566
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

238
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,610
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

239
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,655
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

240
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,783
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

241
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,619
Mr Dyson,

242
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,848
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

243
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,041
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

244
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,793
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

245
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,297
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

246
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,673
"Don't ask."

247
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,474
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

248
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,768
Insert key.

249
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,937
Left on three, two, one, turn.

250
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,618
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

251
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,986
There you go.

252
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,266
(Sarah) So,
what do you think, Doctor?

253
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,103
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

254
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,524
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

255
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,068
I know how smart you are.

256
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,819
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

257
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,616
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

258
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,618
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

259
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,829
you'll just try to escape again.

260
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,503
You have to let me see my son.

261
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,964
Please.

262
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,758
Please.

263
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,930
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

264
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,890
If I could just make a phone call...

265
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,018
Afraid not. Not for a while.

266
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,231
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

267
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,733
that you stay here
for another six months.

268
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,822
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

269
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,199
(Silberman choking)

270
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,661
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

271
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,122
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

272
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,551
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

273
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,798
You don't know what you're doing!

274
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,263
Model citizen.

275
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,933
(♪ Rock music blaring)

276
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,195
(Engine roars)

277
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,497
(Tyres screech)

278
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,668
(Car horns honk)

279
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,253
(Crash)

280
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,222
(Girl) You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

281
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,015
He said he was going to the galleria?

282
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,266
Yeah.

283
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,101
The galleria?

284
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,945
(Cacophony of video games)

285
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,182
(Inaudible)

286
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,525
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

287
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,410
(Explosions, gunfire)

288
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,209
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

289
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,919
(Girls) No.

290
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,967
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

291
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,142
- John.
- Not now.

292
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,186
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

293
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,567
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

294
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,694
- Just go.
- Yeah.

295
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,950
I saw that kid...

296
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,285
Hey!

297
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,343
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

298
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,071
Hey!

299
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,244
Get down.

300
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,871
(Gunshot)

301
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,340
(John screams)

302
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,192
Mister, are you all right?

303
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,570
(Camera shutter clicking)

304
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,625
(Engine won't start)

305
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,086
Come on!

306
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,555
(Engine starts)

307
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,669
Goddamn!

308
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,189
(Horns honk)

309
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,438
(Brakes screech)

310
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,623
Agh!

311
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,201
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

312
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,328
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

313
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,761
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

314
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,013
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

315
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:54,059
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

316
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:08,865
Holy shit! You're really real.

317
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,744
I mean...

318
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,793
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

319
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,795
I'm a cybernetic organism:

320
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,548
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

321
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,481
This is intense.

322
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,401
Get a grip, John. OK.

323
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,072
You're not here to kill me.

324
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,201
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

325
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,996
My mission is to protect you.

326
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,707
Yeah? Who sent you?

327
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,001
You did.

328
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,544
35 years from now,

329
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,131
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

330
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,092
Oh, this is deep.

331
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,534
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

332
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:38,204
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

333
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:44,336
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

334
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,672
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

335
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
Where are we going?

336
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,510
We have to get out of the city
immediately

337
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,970
and avoid the authorities.

338
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,432
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

339
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,603
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

340
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,481
- You sure?
- I would.

341
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,827
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

342
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,498
...but I gotta warn them.

343
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,042
Shit! You got a quarter?

344
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,173
(Phone ringing)

345
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,762
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

346
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,181
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

347
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,684
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

348
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,895
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

349
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,565
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

350
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,318
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

351
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,945
I'm making beef stew.

352
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,239
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

353
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,825
- John, where are you?
- (Dog barking)

354
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,786
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

355
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:03,123
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

356
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,666
The dog's really barking.

357
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,234
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

358
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,797
(Thud)

359
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,633
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

360
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,846
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

361
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,223
(John's voice)
I'm right here. I'm fine.

362
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,933
'Are you sure you're all right?'

363
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,936
- (Own voice) What's the dog's name?
- Max.

364
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,772
(John's voice) Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

365
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,442
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

366
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,319
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

367
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,156
Where are you?

368
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,826
Your foster parents are dead.

369
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,823
No, no. I need a minute here.

370
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:23,203
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

371
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,747
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

372
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,749
Get real.

373
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,586
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

374
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,463
No, only an object of equal size.

375
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,091
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

376
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,011
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

377
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,347
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

378
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,016
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

379
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,227
Knives and stabbing weapons.

380
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,301
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

381
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,555
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

382
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,351
He killed
17 police officers that night.

383
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,105
Men with families...

384
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,066
...children.

385
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:40,905
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

386
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:46,202
(Weatherby) Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

387
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,667
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

388
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,752
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

389
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,213
We know this guy's involved.

390
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,260
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

391
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,770
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- (Silberman) Sorry, guys.

392
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,481
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

393
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,192
as time goes on.

394
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,068
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

395
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,947
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

396
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,490
(Weatherby) Sure.

397
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,452
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

398
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,745
(Douglas) Yes, sir.

399
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,457
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

400
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:37,629
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

401
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:43,384
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

402
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,802
running guns.

403
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,847
Then there were some other guys.

404
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,936
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

405
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,228
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

406
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,023
Then she gets busted.

407
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,735
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

408
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,071
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

409
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,950
was all made-up bullshit.

410
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,577
I hated her for that.

411
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,541
But everything she said was true.

412
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,795
She knew.

413
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,049
And nobody believed her.

414
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,719
Not even me.

415
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,515
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

416
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:34,060
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

417
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,478
will be to copy Sarah Connor

418
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,327
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

419
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,357
Great. What happens to her?

420
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,318
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

421
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,488
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

422
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,824
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

423
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,034
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

424
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:54,747
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

425
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,792
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

426
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,336
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

427
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,464
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

428
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:04,673
Let me go!

429
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,890
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

430
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,395
What?

431
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,193
You have to do what I say, huh?

432
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,487
That's one of my mission parameters.

433
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,284
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

434
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,829
Yes!

435
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,626
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

436
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,839
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

437
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:49,469
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

438
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,888
Dipshit?

439
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,933
Put your leg down.

440
00:48:56,142 --> 00:49:00,813
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

441
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,274
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

442
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,110
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

443
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,364
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

444
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,782
Get off me!

445
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,122
- No!
- (Gunshot)

446
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,667
Put the gun down, now!

447
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,046
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

448
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,888
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

449
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,099
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

450
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,978
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

451
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,399
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

452
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,692
You got that?

453
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,237
You just can't go around
killing people.

454
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,445
Why?

455
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,449
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

456
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,658
Why?

457
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,370
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

458
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,879
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

459
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:10,508
And I order you to help me.

460
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,441
(Operator on police radio)

461
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,451
Hm!

462
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,679
(Clattering)

463
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,349
(Clattering fades)

464
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,280
Hi!

465
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:41,534
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

466
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,995
They've been in there for an hour.

467
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,539
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

468
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,043
Oh, here come your friends now.

469
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:01,721
(Buzzer)

470
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,648
(Officer) Well, that was productive.

471
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,821
(Locks door)

472
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:57,109
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- (Gwen) No, thanks.

473
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,861
How 'bout a beer?

474
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,488
Yeah, right!

475
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:28,015
- Hey, I got a full house.
- (Gwen) That's good, Lewis.

476
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,142
Must be my lucky day.

477
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,501
(Thud)

478
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,480
(Groans)

479
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,204
(Yawning) I think you're right
about number 24.

480
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,123
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

481
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,543
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

482
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,725
(Groans) You!

483
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,857
You broke my arm.

484
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,651
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

485
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,404
That's one. Now, don't move.

486
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,078
What are you gonna do?

487
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,750
Why do we stop now?

488
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,797
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

489
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,466
- Right.
- Swear?

490
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,051
What?

491
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,263
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

492
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:59,310
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

493
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,237
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

494
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:12,655
(Gunshots)

495
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,325
(Groans)

496
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,287
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

497
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,415
You crazy bastard!

498
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,963
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

499
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,550
(Guard groaning)

500
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,260
He'll live.

501
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,723
(Engine roars)

502
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:46,607
(Quiet conversation)

503
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,110
Son of a bitch!

504
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,905
Let's try to remain calm.

505
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,091
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

506
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,034
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

507
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,370
(Sarah) Open the door.
(Guard) It ain't gonna happen.

508
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,413
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

509
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,248
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

510
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,792
I don't believe you can do it.

511
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,251
You're already dead, Silberman.

512
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,940
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

513
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:11,715
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

514
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,093
(Buzzer)

515
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,224
Back off!

516
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,725
Get back!

517
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,727
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

518
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,147
Don't move!

519
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,443
- Drop the shit!
- (Silberman) Do it! Do it!

520
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,321
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

521
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,614
Not you!

522
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,324
Open the door.

523
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,579
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

524
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,306
Get her! Get her!

525
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,309
(Alarm blares)

526
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,355
(Alarm blaring)

527
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,084
Sarah!

528
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:32,129
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

529
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,090
Let's go! Open it!

530
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,299
Get the other door!

531
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,553
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

532
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,269
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

533
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,859
(Panting)

534
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:04,786
(Gasps)

535
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,962
No!

536
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,506
(Screams) No!

537
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,552
- No!
- Mom, wait!

538
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,054
Mom!

539
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,230
- Come back here!
- No! No!

540
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,940
No!

541
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,650
- Help her!
- Wait here.

542
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,360
Hurry up!

543
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,529
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

544
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:39,822
Hold her.

545
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,075
He'll kill us all!

546
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,294
(Clank)

547
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,974
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

548
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,981
Come with me, if you want to live.

549
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,400
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

550
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,342
Go.

551
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,261
(Gunshot)

552
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,763
(Gunshot)

553
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,309
(Gunshot)

554
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:54,146
(Gunshots)

555
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,211
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

556
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:26,929
(Thump)

557
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,807
(Gunshot)

558
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,477
Get down.

559
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,397
(Gunshot)

560
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,027
(Gunshot)

561
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,658
(Gunshots)

562
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:51,787
No! Mom!

563
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,628
(Gunshots)

564
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:07,844
(Tyres screech)

565
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,306
Out of the car!

566
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,641
(Gunshot)

567
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,892
Right now!

568
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,377
Go!

569
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:51,847
I'm out.

570
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,225
(Gunshot)

571
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,564
- Come on.
- Here.

572
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:05,193
(Terminator) Reload.

573
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:16,121
Last one!

574
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,880
(Terminator) Hang on.

575
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,491
Ready!

576
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,414
John!

577
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,131
Here, drive.

578
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,470
(Gunshot)

579
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,812
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

580
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,189
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

581
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:11,736
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

582
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,366
Cool.

583
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,663
Come here.

584
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,421
I said I was OK.

585
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,341
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

586
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,595
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

587
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,263
You almost got yourself killed.

588
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,224
What were you thinking?

589
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,769
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

590
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,313
Do you understand?

591
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:50,692
You're too important.
Do you understand?

592
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,696
But...

593
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,118
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

594
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:03,705
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

595
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,547
What's wrong with your eyes?

596
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,051
Nothing.

597
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,355
So, what's your story?

598
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:34,653
(Sirens wail, radios crackle)

599
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:39,991
You OK?

600
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,618
Fine.

601
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:46,623
Say, that's a nice bike.

602
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,772
(John) Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

603
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,987
(Hissing)

604
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,575
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

605
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,619
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

606
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:30,542
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

607
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,793
Correct.

608
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,801
Does it hurt when you get shot?

609
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,681
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

610
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,977
John, help me with the light.

611
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,187
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

612
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:54,858
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

613
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,570
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

614
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,489
120 years with
my existing power cell.

615
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,451
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

616
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:09,622
So you can be...
you know, more human?

617
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:12,042
Not such a dork all the time?

618
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,382
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

619
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,635
hat Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

620
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:27,432
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

621
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,017
No.

622
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,520
Can we reset the switch?

623
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:54,584
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

624
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:02,091
Do it.

625
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,394
Now open the port cover.

626
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:17,857
Pull to break the seal.

627
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:25,365
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

628
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:31,204
You can now access the CPU.

629
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,082
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

630
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,835
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

631
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:39,795
Pull.

632
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,835
Can you see the pin switch?

633
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,670
No!

634
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,340
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

635
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:28,136
"It", John, not "him".

636
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:31,306
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

637
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,725
Listen to me. Listen.

638
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,269
We're better off on our own.

639
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,023
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

640
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:42,567
Maybe.

641
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,779
I don't trust it.

642
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,948
But he's my friend, alright?

643
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,410
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

644
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,747
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

645
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,541
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

646
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,794
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

647
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:09,135
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

648
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,278
Alright, play it your way.

649
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,788
Was there a problem?

650
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,373
No problem.

651
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,292
None whatsoever.

652
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,491
(Engine starts)

653
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,452
Are we learning yet?

654
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,427
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

655
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,182
Just head south.

656
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,192
Keep it under 65.

657
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,029
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

658
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:56,743
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

659
01:14:56,951 --> 01:15:00,371
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

660
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,749
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

661
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:06,753
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

662
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:11,090
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby."

663
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,718
(Monotone) <i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

664
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,471
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

665
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,474
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

666
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:24,103
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

667
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,940
That's great. See? You're getting it.

668
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,067
<i>No problemo.</i>

669
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,487
(Truck horn blasts)

670
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,622
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

671
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,165
I'll give you half.

672
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,292
Mom!

673
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,045
Get some food.

674
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,508
No sense of humor.

675
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:01,182
And that's another thing:

676
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,017
lighten up a bit.

677
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:08,106
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

678
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:09,816
Smile once in a while.

679
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,401
Smile?

680
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,112
Yeah. You know, smile.

681
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,488
Watch.

682
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,284
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

683
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,662
Gimme a break.

684
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,666
Okay. Bad example.

685
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:30,503
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

686
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:51,816
That's good.

687
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:55,194
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

688
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,911
Want some of my fries?

689
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:15,798
Do you need any help?

690
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,507
No.

691
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,385
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

692
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:21,053
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

693
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:30,104
We're not gonna make it, are we?

694
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:34,025
People, I mean.

695
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:39,030
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

696
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,825
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

697
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,912
(Woman) Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

698
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:52,376
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

699
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:56,047
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

700
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,090
(John) Who is that?

701
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,427
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

702
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,349
Why him?

703
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,810
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

704
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,269
of microprocessor.

705
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,273
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

706
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,442
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

707
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:17,902
of military computer systems.

708
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,697
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

709
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,241
becoming fully unmanned.

710
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:26,577
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

711
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:29,163
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

712
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:32,667
The system goes on-line
on August 4 1997.

713
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,795
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

714
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,714
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

715
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:43,094
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

716
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:46,597
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

717
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,142
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

718
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,854
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

719
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,107
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

720
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,568
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

721
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,570
will eliminate its enemies over here.

722
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,280
Jesus!

723
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,020
How much do you know about Dyson?

724
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,330
I have detailed files.

725
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,375
want to know everything.

726
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:19,380
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

727
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,518
Miles!

728
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,960
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

729
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,171
This thing is kicking my ass.

730
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:04,383
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

731
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,513
I can't. I'm on a roll.

732
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:26,614
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

733
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,324
I know. You told me.

734
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,327
It thinks and learns like we do.

735
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:34,205
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

736
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:38,417
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

737
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:42,380
Why is that so important?

738
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,091
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

739
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,677
I'm going crazy here.

740
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,138
Baby, I am this close.

741
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,224
Come here.

742
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:59,397
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

743
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:02,817
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

744
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,154
Meet the pilot.

745
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:11,909
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

746
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,830
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

747
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,332
But it doesn't love you like we do.

748
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:29,176
I'm sorry. Really.

749
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:33,514
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

750
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:38,269
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

751
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,134
Wait in the car.

752
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,264
(Wind howling)

753
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,571
Enrique!

754
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,115
(In Spanish) Are you here?

755
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,147
(In English)
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

756
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:58,098
(Continues in Spanish)
And you... are always like a snake.

757
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,017
(Laughs)

758
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:02,228
(In Spanish) It's great
to see you, Connor!

759
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:03,516
I told you I would be back.

760
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:06,398
(Enrique) I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

761
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:07,607
Jolanda!

762
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,861
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

763
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:14,198
- Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i>
- What's up?

764
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,116
(Continues in Spanish)
Who's this big guy?

765
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:21,288
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

766
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,332
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

767
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,960
Uncle Bob, huh?

768
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:29,046
(Laughing) OK. OK!

769
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:31,691
(Continues in Spanish) How are you?

770
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:35,010
How are you?
You've grown so much.

771
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,720
(In English) Drink?

772
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,268
Uncle Bob?

773
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,356
(Enrique) Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

774
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:50,109
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

775
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,028
(Laughing) Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

776
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,739
(Indistinct dialogue in Spanish)

777
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,074
I just came for my stuff.

778
01:23:57,283 --> 01:23:59,743
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

779
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,912
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

780
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,623
Now, Enrique!

781
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,461
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

782
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:32,776
One thing about my mom...

783
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,739
...she always plans ahead.

784
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,291
Excellent.

785
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,015
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

786
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,060
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

787
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,187
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

788
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:11,315
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

789
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,234
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

790
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,114
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

791
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,456
See, I grew up in places like this,

792
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,459
so I thought
that's how people lived:

793
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,380
riding around in helicopters,

794
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:37,007
learning how to blow shit up.

795
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:43,597
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

796
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,434
The other kids were into Nintendo.

797
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:03,742
Are you ever afraid?

798
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,285
No.

799
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,749
Not even of dying?

800
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:12,918
No.

801
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,844
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

802
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,722
No.
I have to stay functional

803
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,016
until the mission is complete.

804
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,564
Then it doesn't matter.

805
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:37,609
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

806
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,836
That's definitely you.

807
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,225
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

808
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:14,104
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

809
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:17,483
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

810
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,861
Mom screwed it up, of course.

811
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,113
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

812
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,699
and me being this world leader.

813
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:30,496
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

814
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:33,999
Here.

815
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:39,463
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

816
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:44,259
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

817
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,722
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

818
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:50,808
Man!

819
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,812
He hasn't even been born yet.

820
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,524
It messes with your head.

821
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,779
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

822
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:14,164
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

823
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:19,545
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

824
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,171
She denies it totally, of course,

825
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,174
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

826
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,930
Why do you cry?

827
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,850
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

828
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:35,519
I don't know. We just cry.

829
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,814
You know, when it hurts.

830
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:50,117
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

831
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,287
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

832
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,913
- Get it?
- No.

833
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,122
(Engine starts)

834
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:57,875
All right, my man!

835
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:01,295
<i>- No problemo.</i>
- Give me five.

836
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,757
Just put out your hand, like this.

837
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:10,846
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

838
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,098
(Slap) All right!

839
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:15,184
(Groans)

840
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:18,353
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

841
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,606
Five low.

842
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,316
(Laughs) Too slow.

843
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,613
I'm just kidding. One more time.

844
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,907
(Slap) Good. Now try it. Good!

845
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,867
Now do me. Give me five.

846
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,579
(Sarah) 'Watching John
with the machine,

847
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,956
it was suddenly so clear.

848
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:41,126
'The Terminator would never stop.

849
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:45,005
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

850
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:48,634
'never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him

851
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,136
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

852
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:56,892
'It would always be there

853
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:01,647
'Of all the would-be fathers

854
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:06,193

856
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,934
(Dogs barking, children laughing)

857
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:49,486
(Jolanda in Spanish)
Come here, darling.

858
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:53,532
(Baby laughs)

859
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,121
(Muted)

860
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,374

01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,668
(Muted)

862
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,465
Hey, let's try this one.

863
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,388
There we go.

864
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,154
(Muted)

865
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:18,533
(Children scream)

866
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:27,667
(Screaming)

867
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:06,665
(Laughter)

868
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,038
(Enrique) She said you go south
with him like you planned.

869
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,250
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

870
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:52,210
Mom, wait!

871
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,394
"No fate".

872
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,939
"No fate, but what we make."

873
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,735
My father told her this.

874
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:24,326
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

875
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:30,749
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

876
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,585
The future's not set.

877
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,214
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

878
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:41,927
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

879
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,096
Oh, shit!

880
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,098
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

881
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:50,685
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

882
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,771
She's gonna blow him away.

883
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,856
Come on! Let's go!

884
01:34:55,065 --> 01:34:56,733
Let's go! Come on!

885
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:10,497
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

886
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:14,459
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

887
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:19,172
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

888
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,758
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

889
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:23,677
I don't care!

890
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,679
Haven't you learned anything yet?

891
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,056
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

892
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:33,770
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

893
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:37,065
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

894
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,192
We hurt. We're afraid.

895
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:46,032
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

896
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:26,323
(Woman) Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

897
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,533
(Boy) Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

898
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:48,053
Danny, your time is up.

899
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,930
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

900
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:54,017
(Typing)

901
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:20,794
Danny!

902
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,880
Ugh!

903
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:28,051
(Automatic gunfire)

904
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:36,309
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

905
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:39,062
Miles?

906
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:44,234
Miles!

907
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,736
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

908
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:55,870
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

909
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:57,205
Run!

910
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:59,040
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

911
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,478
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

912
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:24,190
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

913
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,069
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

914
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,029
Get out of the way.

915
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,823
Don't hurt him!

916
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:35,076
Get on the floor now!

917
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:39,831
Just let the boy go.

918
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,876
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

919
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,545
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

920
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:47,881
- It's all your fault!
- What?

921
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,091
I'm not gonna let you do it.

922
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:09,861
Shhh!

923
01:39:14,115 --> 01:39:15,325
Shhh.

924
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,562
(John) Shit! We're too late!

925
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:49,776
Check them.

926
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:56,991
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

927
01:39:57,951 --> 01:39:59,494
Look at me.

928
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,456
I almost...

929
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,583
I almost...

930
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,171
(Sobbing)

931
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:19,430
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

932
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:22,725
I promise.

933
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:31,776
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

934
01:40:34,863 --> 01:40:36,656
I love you, John.

935
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:40,660
I always have.

936
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,955
I know.

937
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,463
Deep penetration.

938
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:54,007
(Moaning)

939
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:56,009
No shattered bone.

940
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:59,012
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

941
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:13,109
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

942
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:20,450
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

943
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,633
Oh, God! No!

944
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:46,935
(Miles cries out)

945
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:51,397
(Tarissa) Oh, my God!

946
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:02,158
Oh, my God.

947
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,827
Now, listen to me very carefully.

948
01:42:07,246 --> 01:42:10,625
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

949
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:14,879
(Sarah) 'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

950
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:18,675
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

951
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:21,928
'The history of things to come.

952
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,597
'It's not every day that you find out

953
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:28,184
you're responsible
for three billion deaths.

954
01:42:28,393 --> 01:42:30,979
'He took it pretty well.'

955
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,983
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

956
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:46,077
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

957
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:52,458
How were we supposed to know?

958
01:42:54,544 --> 01:42:56,170
Yeah!

959
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:57,880
Right.

960
01:42:58,798 --> 01:43:01,884
How were you supposed to know?

961
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:05,680
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

962
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:10,101
Men like you thought it up.

963
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:16,941
You think you're so creative.

964
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:20,194
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

965
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:23,990
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

966
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,451
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

967
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,036
Mom!

968
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:32,623
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

969
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:34,872
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

970
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,711
But I thought...

971
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,758
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

972
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:45,511
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

973
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,389
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

974
01:43:48,598 --> 01:43:52,185
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

975
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:55,396
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

976
01:43:56,481 --> 01:44:00,318
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

977
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:04,947
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

978
01:44:05,782 --> 01:44:08,618
Everything. I don't care.

979
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:11,620
The chip.

980
01:44:12,038 --> 01:44:13,678
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

981
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:15,291
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

982
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,935
It must be from
the other one like you.

983
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:21,339
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

984
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:24,133
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

985
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:26,552
Those lying motherfuckers.

986
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:28,429
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

987
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:30,765
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

988
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:32,350
but it gave us ideas,

989
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:35,436
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

990
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,690
All my work was based on it.

991
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,567
It must be destroyed.

992
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,864
Can you get us in? Past security?

993
01:44:47,073 --> 01:44:49,992
I think so, yeah. When?

994
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:55,038
Now?

995
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:01,921
(Sarah) 'The future,
always so clear to me,

996
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:05,049
'had become
like a black highway at night.

997
01:45:05,258 --> 01:45:10,805
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

998
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:50,761
(Miles) Hi. Er... Carl, right?

999
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,353
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

1000
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:55,765
Hi!

1001
01:45:56,017 --> 01:45:57,894
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

1002
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,272
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

1003
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,482
I need written authorisation...

1004
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:08,404
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

1005
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,917
(Miles) Come on. It's OK.

1006
01:46:22,335 --> 01:46:23,775
It takes two keys to open the vault.

1007
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,504
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

1008
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:28,382
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

1009
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,260
Gibbons?

1010
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:39,185
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

1011
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:42,730
Gibbons!

1012
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:45,524
Oh, shit.

1013
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,903
(Beep)

1014
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:56,494
(Silent alarm)

1015
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:05,544
My card should access this.

1016
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:06,796
(Buzz)

1017
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,048
(Buzz)

1018
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,384
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

1019
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,428
The silent alarm's been tripped.

1020
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:23,354
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

1021
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:27,149
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

1022
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:29,819
No.

1023
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:34,699
We go all the way. OK?

1024
01:47:36,993 --> 01:47:40,663
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

1025
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,311
I think it's that guy from the mall.

1026
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:43,498
It is!

1027
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:45,793
It's him and the woman.

1028
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:49,964
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

1029
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,803
(Miles) I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

1030
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:00,266
(Buzz)

1031
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,643
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

1032
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:09,859
John, fire in the hold!

1033
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:26,709
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

1034
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:29,712
(Alarm blaring)

1035
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,344
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

1036
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,097
Put this on.

1037
01:48:54,362 --> 01:48:56,614
(Sarah) All right, let's get to work.

1038
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:21,472
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

1039
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:26,185
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

1040
01:49:26,519 --> 01:49:28,437
Suspect 1 is white, female,

1041
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:31,649
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

1042
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:34,485
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

1043
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,278
Suspect 2: white, male...

1044
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:44,620
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

1045
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,831
Everything behind my desk.

1046
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:49,083
All the processors on my left.

1047
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,585
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

1048
01:50:05,391 --> 01:50:06,767
Could I...

1049
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:08,811
Excuse me...

1050
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:13,149
Could I borrow that thing?

1051
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:24,910
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

1052
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:33,210
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

1053
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:37,089
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

1054
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:29,975
All right!

1055
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,810
7-2-5-6.

1056
01:51:32,019 --> 01:51:33,187
(Beep)

1057
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:34,395
Yes!

1058
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,402
Easy money.

1059
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,533
Uh-oh.

1060
01:51:49,245 --> 01:51:51,538
Oh, shit! Not good.

1061
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:52,915
Not good!

1062
01:51:56,752 --> 01:52:00,005
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

1063
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:02,466
One more barrel, two more minutes.

1064
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:09,348
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

1065
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,809
Piece of cake.

1066
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:13,435
- We got company.
- Police?

1067
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,855
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

1068
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,983
Go. I'll finish here.

1069
01:52:20,442 --> 01:52:21,735
Come on.

1070
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:26,115
- I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

1071
01:52:29,243 --> 01:52:30,494
Trust me.

1072
01:52:43,924 --> 01:52:45,801
(Loudspeaker) 'You at the window!

1073
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,971
'Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!'

1074
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:53,726
- Holy shit!
- That's a damn mini-gun!

1075
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,375
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

1076
01:53:18,584 --> 01:53:19,960
Go! Go! Go!

1077
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:09,051
Fire!

1078
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,112
We go same time, to the left.

1079
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,906
One, two, three, go.

1080
01:54:42,835 --> 01:54:45,379
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

1081
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:56,723
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

1082
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,435
Hold your fire!

1083
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:27,337
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

1084
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,469
Time to go. Now.

1085
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:36,472
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

1086
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:39,641
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

1087
01:56:04,249 --> 01:56:06,668
Mom! Mom!

1088
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:46,250
Aagh!

1089
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:48,293
(Bullets flying)

1090
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,338
Shit!

1091
01:56:53,715 --> 01:56:56,593
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

1092
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:07,770
Get down!

1093
01:57:14,903 --> 01:57:16,154
Here.

1094
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:34,673
(Laboured breathing)

1095
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:44,683
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

1096
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:52,232
Fall back! Everybody out!

1097
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:54,192
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

1098
01:58:02,326 --> 01:58:03,452
(Gasping)

1099
01:58:30,354 --> 01:58:32,074
(Police radio) 'We got a war zone
down here!

1100
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:52,292
(Ding)

1101
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:05,514
Shut your eyes.

1102
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:07,224
(Gas fizzing)

1103
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,981
Stay here. I'll be back.

1104
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:25,117
Get down on the floor, face down!

1105
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:29,413
Down on the floor now!

1106
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:33,250
OK, drop him!

1107
01:59:55,689 --> 01:59:57,149
(Men cry out)

1108
02:00:11,747 --> 02:00:12,956
Agh!

1109
02:00:46,364 --> 02:00:48,283
(Choking, spluttering)

1110
02:00:53,288 --> 02:00:55,040
Here, hold this.

1111
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:05,300
(Engine starts)

1112
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,137
I think it's him!

1113
02:01:11,515 --> 02:01:12,974
Holy shit!

1114
02:01:28,615 --> 02:01:29,615
Go!

1115
02:02:08,572 --> 02:02:09,656
Shit!

1116
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:24,129
Get out.

1117
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:28,091
Aagh!

1118
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:47,277
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

1119
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:48,904
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1120
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:50,614
All right.

1121
02:03:04,836 --> 02:03:07,130
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

1122
02:04:05,063 --> 02:04:06,272
Yeah!

1123
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:10,318
John! Stay down!

1124
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,429
- Aagh!
- Mom!

1125
02:05:18,595 --> 02:05:19,595
Hello?

1126
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,645
Goddamn! You all right...?

1127
02:05:35,195 --> 02:05:37,155
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1128
02:05:39,657 --> 02:05:41,409
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1129
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:44,536
Agh!

1130
02:05:45,455 --> 02:05:46,664
Are you hurt?

1131
02:05:59,511 --> 02:06:03,306
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

1132
02:06:04,015 --> 02:06:05,015
Hurry!

1133
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,857
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1134
02:06:13,608 --> 02:06:16,611
Come on! Go!

1135
02:06:22,742 --> 02:06:24,619
What the hell...?

1136
02:06:31,084 --> 02:06:33,253
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1137
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:36,548
Here. This'll work.

1138
02:06:42,846 --> 02:06:44,597
He's gaining.

1139
02:06:46,558 --> 02:06:49,352
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1140
02:06:49,561 --> 02:06:51,604
I can run faster than this!

1141
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:03,241
Coming up, to the right.

1142
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:07,245
Watch it! Watch it!

1143
02:07:30,185 --> 02:07:32,105
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1144
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,362
Take the off-ramp.

1145
02:07:51,414 --> 02:07:52,414
Shit!

1146
02:07:56,252 --> 02:07:57,252
Hold on!

1147
02:08:43,132 --> 02:08:44,132
Don't stop!

1148
02:08:52,684 --> 02:08:53,851
Go straight!

1149
02:08:55,937 --> 02:08:57,397
- Look out!
- Duck!

1150
02:09:12,662 --> 02:09:14,163
Get the hell outta here!

1151
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,797
Get outta here! Let's go!

1152
02:09:23,006 --> 02:09:24,257
(Alarm blaring)

1153
02:09:57,915 --> 02:09:59,834
(Cracking)

1154
02:10:07,717 --> 02:10:09,135
(Shattering)

1155
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,168
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

1156
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:44,754
(Gunshot)

1157
02:11:03,398 --> 02:11:05,817
(Groans)

1158
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:33,260
We don't have much time.

1159
02:11:56,325 --> 02:11:57,325
Let's go.

1160
02:11:58,411 --> 02:11:59,954
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

1161
02:12:00,163 --> 02:12:02,123
Come on! Get up!

1162
02:12:16,012 --> 02:12:17,430
(John) Hand me the shotgun.

1163
02:12:22,393 --> 02:12:24,520
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1164
02:12:25,605 --> 02:12:27,231
Hurry!

1165
02:12:30,943 --> 02:12:32,445
Come on, Mom.

1166
02:12:39,035 --> 02:12:41,245
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

1167
02:13:11,567 --> 02:13:13,194
This way. Come on!

1168
02:13:42,807 --> 02:13:45,351
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1169
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:46,686
(John) Go back.

1170
02:13:55,027 --> 02:13:57,154
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1171
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,240
John, you've got to go now.

1172
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:01,450
- John!
- Go! Now!

1173
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:02,994
No!

1174
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:17,902
(Sarah) Get up the steps.

1175
02:15:19,904 --> 02:15:21,072
Go on.

1176
02:15:27,536 --> 02:15:29,538
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

1177
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,147
No!

1178
02:16:04,198 --> 02:16:06,409
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1179
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:10,413
Grab it. Go. Go!

1180
02:16:21,048 --> 02:16:24,051
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

1181
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:25,720
Come on!

1182
02:16:26,637 --> 02:16:28,222
Mom!

1183
02:16:28,431 --> 02:16:30,599
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1184
02:17:06,677 --> 02:17:08,095
Agh!

1185
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:14,726
Call to John.

1186
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:17,772
No!

1187
02:17:18,314 --> 02:17:19,523
I know this hurts.

1188
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:22,985
- Ugh!
- Call John.

1189
02:17:40,419 --> 02:17:42,338
Call to John now.

1190
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:45,758
Fuck you!

1191
02:18:48,863 --> 02:18:51,073
(Whirring)

1192
02:20:50,025 --> 02:20:52,069
(Clatters)

1193
02:20:57,574 --> 02:21:01,120
(Sarah) John? John!

1194
02:21:02,496 --> 02:21:04,707
John? Help!

1195
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:08,836
John!

1196
02:21:12,631 --> 02:21:14,299
John?

1197
02:21:16,635 --> 02:21:17,970
John!

1198
02:21:20,097 --> 02:21:21,306
John.

1199
02:21:22,266 --> 02:21:23,767
John.

1200
02:21:26,353 --> 02:21:27,980
- Mom.
- Help me.

1201
02:21:29,273 --> 02:21:31,025
Help me.

1202
02:21:32,568 --> 02:21:33,569
Help me.

1203
02:21:33,777 --> 02:21:34,903
Out of the way, John!

1204
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:39,490
Shoot!

1205
02:21:50,127 --> 02:21:51,253
(Gunshot)

1206
02:21:54,214 --> 02:21:55,215
(Gunshot)

1207
02:22:05,642 --> 02:22:06,935
(Click)

1208
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,693
(Click)

1209
02:22:23,118 --> 02:22:24,536
Mom!

1210
02:22:34,296 --> 02:22:35,756
Get down!

1211
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,051
(Gunshot)

1212
02:22:45,015 --> 02:22:47,935
(Distorted speech)

1213
02:22:55,776 --> 02:22:57,945
(Screams)

1214
02:23:00,948 --> 02:23:02,699
(Unearthly screams)

1215
02:23:07,496 --> 02:23:08,956
No!

1216
02:24:10,142 --> 02:24:12,352
Get up. Come on.

1217
02:24:14,563 --> 02:24:16,106
Holy shit!

1218
02:24:16,315 --> 02:24:17,983
I need a vacation.

1219
02:24:26,283 --> 02:24:28,660
(Furnace bubbling)

1220
02:24:32,497 --> 02:24:36,168
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

1221
02:24:39,713 --> 02:24:41,298
Will this melt in there?

1222
02:24:44,551 --> 02:24:46,136
Yes. Throw it in.

1223
02:24:51,016 --> 02:24:52,016
<i>Adiós!</i>

1224
02:24:53,894 --> 02:24:56,063
And the chip.

1225
02:25:07,449 --> 02:25:08,951
(Fizz)

1226
02:25:10,535 --> 02:25:11,954
It's over.

1227
02:25:14,498 --> 02:25:15,540
No.

1228
02:25:19,086 --> 02:25:20,462
There's one more chip.

1229
02:25:25,467 --> 02:25:27,427
And it must be destroyed also.

1230
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:34,476
Here.

1231
02:25:34,685 --> 02:25:38,689
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1232
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:45,862
No.

1233
02:25:47,155 --> 02:25:48,155
No.

1234
02:25:51,326 --> 02:25:53,704
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1235
02:25:53,912 --> 02:25:55,914
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

1236
02:25:56,123 --> 02:25:58,000
- It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

1237
02:25:58,208 --> 02:26:00,669
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

1238
02:26:00,877 --> 02:26:03,630
- I must go away, John.
- No!

1239
02:26:04,297 --> 02:26:05,382
No, wait.

1240
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:08,343
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1241
02:26:09,511 --> 02:26:11,555
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1242
02:26:12,014 --> 02:26:13,557
It has to end here.

1243
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:18,061
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

1244
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:19,771
I order you not to go!

1245
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:28,071
I know now why you cry.

1246
02:26:30,574 --> 02:26:32,743
But it's something I can never do.

1247
02:27:07,861 --> 02:27:09,446
Goodbye.
