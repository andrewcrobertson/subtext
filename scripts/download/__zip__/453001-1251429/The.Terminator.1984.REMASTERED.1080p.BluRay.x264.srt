1
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,835
(engine whirring)

2
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,020
(electrical fizzling)

3
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,025
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

4
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,280
(electrical fizzling)

5
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,041
What the hell...?

6
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,515
Hey, my turn.

7
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,902
Hey, what's wrong
with this picture?

8
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,907
(laughing)

9
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,912
Nice night for a walk, eh?

10
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,960
Nice night for a walk.

11
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:39,298
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

12
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,008
Nothing clean. Right.

13
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,220
I think this guy's
a couple of cans short of a six-pack.

14
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:49,058
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

15
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,726
Fuck you, asshole.

16
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,316
(grunting)

17
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,696
(groaning)

18
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,004
(siren wailing)

19
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,678
(helicopter passing overhead)

20
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,723
(man groaning indistinctly)

21
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,144
(electrical fizzling)

22
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,788
(moaning)

23
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,368
(helicopter passing overhead)

24
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,459
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

25
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,045
(indistinct police radio chatter)

26
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,588
(man) See that guy?

27
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:43,839
Hold it right there.

28
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,841
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it!

29
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,927
- Go!
- (siren wailing)

30
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,681
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

31
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,479
(police siren wailing)

32
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,778
(tires screech)

33
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,561
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

34
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,521
- Thursday.
- What year?

35
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,697
(siren wailing)

36
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,037
He's got my gun. Let's go.

37
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,253
(panting)

38
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,220
(sirens wailing in distance)

39
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,708
(indistinct police radio chatter)

40
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,359
(police sirens wailing)

41
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:18,762
(siren wailing)

42
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,631
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

43
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,094
Hi. I'm late.

44
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,680
So am I.

45
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,184
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

46
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,901
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

47
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,446
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

48
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,657
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

49
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,535
- (woman) Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly-beef?

50
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,371
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

51
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,623
- Ah!
- Oh!

52
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,542
I'm so sorry.

53
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,588
This isn't real leather, is it?

54
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,053
(man) Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

55
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,225
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

56
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,777
(man) The 12-gauge auto-loader.

57
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,783
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

58
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,495
The .45 long slide with laser sighting.

59
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,957
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

60
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,418
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

61
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,420
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

62
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,088
You can't miss.

63
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,094
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

64
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,888
Hey, just what you see, pal.

65
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,432
The Uzi nine millimeter.

66
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,227
You know your weapons, buddy.

67
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,563
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

68
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,776
So which will it be?

69
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,446
- All.
- I may close early today.

70
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,950
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

71
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,120
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

72
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,022
(tires screech)

73
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,942
(man) Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

74
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:04,405
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

75
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,740
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

76
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,659
(woman speaks indistinctly on phone)

77
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:12,621
(man) Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

78
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,546
(woman continues speaking on phone)

79
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,195
(dog barking)

80
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,051
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

81
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,108
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

82
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,653
Sarah, come here.
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

83
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,327
So incredible. You're not gonna
believe this. Sit, you're going to love this.

84
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,453
Sh!

85
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,748
- What?
- ...compiled from several witnesses.

86
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,084
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,

87
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,587
brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.

88
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,547
You're dead, honey.

89
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,399
(fizzling)

90
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,110
(engine starts)

91
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,304
(rumbling)

92
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,490
(groaning)

93
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,951
- (gasping)
- (man on radio) ...if you're into sound,

94
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:05,455
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

95
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,835
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

96
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,421
We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...

97
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,899
(rock music plays on headphones)

98
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,321
Sorry.

99
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,329
(phone rings)

100
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,169
Hello?

101
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,381
(man on phone) First I'm gonna rip
the buttons off your blouse one by one,

102
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,969
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

103
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:06,850
And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans of finch by inch.

104
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,770
(laughs) Ginger, it's Matt.

105
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,857
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

106
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,277
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.

107
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,737
Who is this?

108
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,199
God. Sarah?

109
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,700
(giggles)

110
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,119
Jesus. I'm sorry.

111
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,080
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

112
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,707
Sure.

113
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,876
Oh! (humming)

114
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,045
it's the creep.

115
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,714
Hello?

116
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:41,301
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

117
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,178
(yelling)

118
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:48,350
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

119
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,603
Ed.

120
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,941
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

121
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,611
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

122
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:03,615
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

123
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,575
You know, these work.

124
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,621
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

125
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,457
Sent over from the Valley division
this afternoon.

126
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,711
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

127
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,880
Look at the name, Ed.

128
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,218
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

129
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,096
You're kidding me.

130
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,849
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

131
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:33,353
- A one-day pattern killer. Hm.
- I hate the weird ones.

132
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,818
- So...
- (both laugh)

133
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,613
Better than mortal man deserves.

134
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:55,250
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

135
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,793
I thought you did.

136
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,670
(answering machine rewinding)

137
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,886
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

138
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,221
You mind your mother.

139
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,979
(man) Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

140
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,399
Looks like I won't be able to make it
tonight. Just can't get out of it.

141
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:24,321
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up
to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.

142
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,492
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

143
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,121
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

144
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,207
I'll live.

145
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,460
I'll break his kneecaps.

146
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,548
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

147
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,760
God. it's disgusting.

148
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,556
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

149
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,643
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

150
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,521
(gasps)

151
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,815
Damn it, Matt.

152
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,347
(engine revving)

153
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,147
(car engine starts)

154
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,333
- Oh, shit.
- (man) Lieutenant!

155
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,004
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

156
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,007
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

157
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,800
(reporters clamoring)

158
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,731
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hm.

159
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,816
I put a cigarette out in it.

160
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,320
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

161
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,781
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

162
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,117
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

163
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,494
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

164
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,205
Give me a cigarette.

165
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,087
(phone ringing)

166
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,342
(Ginger on machine) Hi, there.

167
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,179
(laughs) Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

168
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:58,975
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

169
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,520
- (turns up volume of music)
- (pop music plays)

170
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,815
Same shit.

171
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,237
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

172
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:16,659
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

173
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,622
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

174
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,957
Maybe make these jackals work for us
for a change.

175
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:27,670
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

176
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,423
Well, how do I look?

177
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,885
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

178
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,181
This just in. Police have announced
the name of the victim

179
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:42,393
in the second of two execution style
murders which took place today.

180
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,356
Incredibly, the names
of the two victims are virtually identical.

181
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:51,069
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead...

182
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,030
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise Connor...

183
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,782
Don't touch it!

184
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:02,413
Police are refusing to speculate on
the similarity between the shooting deaths

185
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,668
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

186
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:10,213
We'll have more on
this late-breaking story as it comes in.

187
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,299
(reporter continues talking)

188
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,951
(muffled rock music plays)

189
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,787
(loud music plays)

190
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,640
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

191
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:46,100
Hey, $4.50.

192
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,950
(rock music continues)

193
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,474
(woman) You have reached

194
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,559
the Los Angeles Police Department
emergency number.

195
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,270
All lines are busy.

196
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,523
If you need a police car sent out to you,
stay on the line.

197
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,485
(indistinct police radio chatter)

198
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,719
(pop music plays over headphones)

199
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,794
(screams, gasps)

200
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,172
Pugsley! Shoo!

201
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,966
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

202
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,021
Whoa!

203
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,608
Don't make me bust you up, man.

204
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,196
(music playing over headphones)

205
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,532
(singing)

206
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,501
(grunting)

207
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,716
(screams)

208
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,551
(shrieks)

209
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,985
(gasping)

210
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,335
(phone rings)

211
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:02,964
(Ginger on machine) Hi, there.
Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.

212
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,008
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

213
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:10,138
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

214
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,099
- Wait for the beep.
- (beeping)

215
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,268
(Sarah) Ginger, this is Sarah.
Pick up if you're there.

216
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:21,274
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

217
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:26,362
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

218
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,657
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

219
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:33,536
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

220
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:37,957
The number here is 555-9175.

221
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,042
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

222
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,478
(man) It's her.

223
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,981
Sarah Connor? it's Lieutenant Traxler.

224
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,401
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

225
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,070
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

226
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:12,074
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- Yeah, I know it. it's on Pico.

227
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,785
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

228
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,831
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

229
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,375
You're in a public place,
so you'll be safe till we get there.

230
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,836
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

231
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,923
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

232
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,259
(loud music continues)

233
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,990
(woman) Hey, that guy didn't pay.

234
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,285
(groaning)

235
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,870
(rock music fades out)

236
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,424
(crowd screaming)

237
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:13,923
(gasping)

238
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:30,022
(crowd screaming)

239
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,694
Come with me if you wanna live.

240
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:44,829
Come on!

241
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,290
(grunting)

242
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,479
(mechanical whirring)

243
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:31,876
(gasps)

244
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:36,547
(screams)

245
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,231
(tires screeching)

246
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,696
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

247
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:05,201
Suspect vehicle: late model
gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

248
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,703
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

249
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,665
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

250
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,043
Hold it!

251
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,296
Ah!

252
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,591
(indistinct radio chatter)

253
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,102
Hold on.

254
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:47,743
Are you injured? Are you shot?

255
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:51,664
(shrieking)

256
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,669
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

257
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:00,381
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

258
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:01,966
Do you understand?

259
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,595
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Please don't hurt me.

260
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,265
(tires screeching)

261
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,685
(horn honks)

262
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,448
I'm here to help you.

263
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:31,203
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

264
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,080
You've been targeted for termination.

265
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,964
(indistinct radio chatter)

266
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,967
(voice of officer) This is one-L-19.

267
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,636
Westbound on Olympic,
approaching Overland.

268
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,769
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

269
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:59,648
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

270
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,193
This isn't true. How could that man
just get up after you...

271
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,738
it's not a man. A machine.

272
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:09,783
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

273
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,245
(tires screeching)

274
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,962
A machine? Like a robot?

275
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:26,634
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

276
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,595
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

277
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,889
- (siren wailing)
- (tires screeching)

278
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,141
Get your head down!

279
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,187
All right, listen.

280
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:24,733
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

281
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,988
Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy
combat chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

282
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:33,784
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

283
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:38,038
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

284
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,749
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

285
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,209
I gotta ditch this car.

286
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,011
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

287
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,638
But these are new. They look human.

288
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:58,434
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

289
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,312
I had to wait till he moved on you
before I could zero him.

290
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:07,943
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

291
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,156
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

292
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,702
Are you saying it's from the future?

293
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,954
One possible future.

294
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:23,250
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

295
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,628
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

296
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,922
- Right.
- Right.

297
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:42,478
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

298
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:46,482
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

299
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,402
That Terminator is out there.

300
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,239
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

301
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:59,119
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear,

302
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:05,167
and it absolutely will not stop...
ever... until you are dead.

303
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,221
Can you stop it?

304
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,810
(sighs) I don't know.

305
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,939
With these weapons, I don't know.

306
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:45,124
(woman over police radio) All units.

307
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,751
Ford suspect vehicle has been found
in a parking structure...

308
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,927
(indistinct radio chatter)

309
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:35,674
Reese, why me?

310
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,303
Why does it want me?

311
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:48,103
There was a nuclear war.

312
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:52,900
A few years from now...

313
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,364
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

314
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,870
...it's gone. Just gone.

315
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:07,623
There were survivors.

316
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,792
Here, there.

317
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,047
Nobody even knew who started it.

318
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:22,471
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

319
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:25,766
Defense network computers.

320
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:29,102
New, powerful...

321
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:34,524
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

322
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:39,738
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

323
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,660
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

324
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:49,456
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

325
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:52,876
Extermination.

326
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,642
Did you see this war?

327
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,644
(tires screeching)

328
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,029
(grunts)

329
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:25,993
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

330
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,204
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

331
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:32,374
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

332
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:36,295
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

333
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:40,716
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

334
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,053
This was burned in by laser scanner.

335
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:53,562
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

336
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:55,897
Loading bodies.

337
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:59,735
The disposal units ran night and day.

338
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:02,779
We were that close
to going out forever.

339
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:09,745
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

340
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,830
To storm the wire of the camps.

341
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:15,292
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

342
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:19,671
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

343
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,092
His name was Connor. John Connor.

344
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:28,722
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

345
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,153
(engine turning over)

346
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,212
(tires screeching)

347
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,263
(gunshot)

348
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,599
(gunfire)

349
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,499
Drive!

350
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,883
Reese!

351
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:29,885
Reese!

352
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:41,730
(sirens wailing)

353
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:51,281
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

354
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:54,284
(officer) You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

355
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:58,455
Get out of the car.

356
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:04,419
Drop to your knees.

357
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,214
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

358
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:40,455
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

359
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,627
Listen, are you sure it's them?

360
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:48,588
(sobbing) I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

361
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,633
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

362
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,347
(sobbing) Ginger.

363
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:02,394
- Kiddo.
- Sarah...

364
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:05,730
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

365
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:09,943
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

366
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,195
Yeah, I guess so.

367
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:17,826
- You're a doctor?
- (yawning) Criminal psychologist.

368
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:22,205
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

369
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,826
(gears whirring)

370
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:50,919
(Silberman) So you're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?

371
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,467
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

372
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,720
That's the year 2027?

373
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,972
(Reese) That's right.
Then I was assigned...

374
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:06,768
- This is fucking great.
- ...under John Connor.

375
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:10,021
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built...

376
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,732
- (pager beeping)
- God damn. Sorry.

377
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:16,236
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

378
00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:18,363
I see.

379
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:24,411
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

380
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:27,789
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

381
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:29,958
A sort of retroactive abortion?

382
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,668
(chuckles)

383
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:35,088
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

384
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,757
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

385
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,260
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

386
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:42,971
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

387
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:47,225
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

388
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:51,813
We'd won. Taking out Connor then
would make no difference.

389
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,774
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

390
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:58,153
Is that when you captured
the lab complex and found...

391
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,988
What is it called?

392
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:02,323
The time displacement equipment?

393
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,536
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

394
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:09,581
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

395
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:11,583
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

396
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:14,169
I can't.

397
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:21,259
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

398
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,096
It's just him and me.

399
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:30,411
(gears whirring)

400
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:12,370
It's just him and me.

401
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,001
(Silberman) Why didn't you
bring any weapons?

402
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,420
Something more advanced.

403
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:23,548
Don't you have ray guns?

404
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:27,385
- (chuckles) Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

405
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,429
(Reese) You go naked.

406
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:31,931
Something about the field generated
by a living organism.

407
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,142
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

408
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:35,977
I didn't build the fucking thing.

409
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:40,899
(Silberman) OK, OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...?

410
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,484
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

411
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:47,030
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

412
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,991
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

413
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:53,620
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

414
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:58,124
(Silberman) Why were
the other two women killed?

415
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,918
(Reese) Most records
were lost in the war.

416
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,670
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

417
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:06,257
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

418
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,510
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

419
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:12,513
- (Silberman) Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

420
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,642
I have answered your questions.
Now I have to see Sarah Connor.

421
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:19,771
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

422
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,773
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

423
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,483
Shut up!

424
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,861
You still don't get it, do you?

425
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:32,116
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

426
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,035
You can't stop him.

427
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:37,830
He'll reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out!

428
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,500
- Doc.
- Let go of me!

429
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,421
Sorry.

430
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,220
(sighs) So Reese is crazy?

431
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,890
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

432
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:02,188
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

433
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:04,482
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

434
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,859
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

435
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,695
Feel that. Go ahead.

436
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,575
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

437
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:17,412
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

438
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,163
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

439
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,748
- Here.
- Thank you.

440
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,920
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

441
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:28,423
Be at least an hour before your mother
gets here from Big Bear.

442
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,676
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

443
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:36,097
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

444
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,894
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

445
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,022
Thank you.

446
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,988
- Good night.
- Good night.

447
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:53,740
(buzzer sounds)

448
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:00,955
(pager beeping)

449
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,798
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

450
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,134
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

451
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,427
Where is she?

452
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:18,181
It may take a while. if you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

453
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,235
I'll be back.

454
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:11,275
- Ah!
- (indistinct shouting)

455
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:22,161
Let's go, let's go!

456
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:23,663
(gunfire)

457
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,042
Stay here.

458
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,253
(gunfire)

459
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,392
Let's get outta here!

460
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,769
(indistinct shouting)

461
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,860
(gunfire)

462
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:09,625
Watch him.

463
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,754
(grunting)

464
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,273
(gunfire continues)

465
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:03,471
(indistinct shouting)

466
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,819
Ed...

467
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:21,030
Hey!

468
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:48,516
Sarah!

469
01:02:50,518 --> 01:02:51,852
Reese.

470
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:56,941
(Reese) This way.

471
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,919
(tires screeching)

472
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:40,318
(man on radio) KFLB news time 4:36.

473
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:44,280
Top story of the hour: the largest
single law enforcement mobilization

474
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:47,033
in California history
is currently underway.

475
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,786
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

476
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:55,750
Take this.

477
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:00,546
All right,
let's get this off the road.

478
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,414
- You cold?
- Freezing.

479
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,632
(shuddering)

480
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:50,554
Reese?

481
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:56,185
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

482
01:04:56,352 --> 01:05:00,648
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

483
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,319
White light.

484
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,115
Pain.

485
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:16,664
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

486
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,500
I caught one back there.

487
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:23,838
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

488
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:28,175
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

489
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:33,013
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

490
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,278
Jesus.

491
01:05:47,445 --> 01:05:50,322
See? it passed right through the meat.

492
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:52,116
(groans) This is gonna make me puke.

493
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,661
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

494
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:59,290
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

495
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,710
He's about my height.

496
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,382
He has your eyes.

497
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:13,304
What's he like?

498
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:17,766
You trust him.
He's got a strength.

499
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,353
I'd die for John Connor.

500
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:27,902
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

501
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:33,824
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?

502
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:36,744
John never said much about him.

503
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,413
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

504
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:43,125
I don't wanna know.

505
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,129
So was it John that sent you here?

506
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,381
I volunteered.

507
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:54,428
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

508
01:06:55,513 --> 01:07:02,353
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

509
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,605
prepare from when he was a kid.

510
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,815
When you were in hiding before the war.

511
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:14,365
(laughs) You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

512
01:07:14,532 --> 01:07:16,408
- It's driving me crazy.
- (groans)

513
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:23,040
Are you sure you have the right person?

514
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,251
I'm sure.

515
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:29,129
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

516
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:35,803
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

517
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:42,726
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

518
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,353
Any of it.

519
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:51,860
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

520
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,906
"'Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

521
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,200
I can't help you
with what you must soon face,

522
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,661
except to say the future is not set.

523
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:03,330
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

524
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:06,000
You must survive or I will never exist."'

525
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,794
That's all.

526
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,299
It's a good field dressing.

527
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:16,343
You like it?

528
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,512
It's my first.

529
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:25,185
(Reese) Get some sleep.
It'll be light soon.

530
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,691
OK.

531
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:43,287
Talk to me some more.

532
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,083
About what?

533
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:51,420
Tell me about
where you're from.

534
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:55,382
All right.

535
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:01,805
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

536
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:05,893
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

537
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:13,067
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

538
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:16,779
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

539
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:19,281
The Terminators were the newest.

540
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:20,532
The worst.

541
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,419
(man over radio) Traversing
your sector in search mode.

542
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,172
750 meters north of your position.

543
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,261
Let's go.

544
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:30,686
- (Reese) Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

545
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,989
(indistinct radio chatter)

546
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,627
(imitating gunfire)

547
01:10:58,172 --> 01:11:01,633
(woman coughing)

548
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:20,527
(woman sobbing)

549
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,397
(dog barking)

550
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:04,071
(man) Terminator!

551
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,077
(screaming)

552
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,751
(woman shrieks)

553
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:23,799
Ah!

554
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,928
- (dog whimpering)
- (screaming)

555
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:17,477
(dog barking in distance)

556
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:23,650
I was dreaming about dogs.

557
01:13:24,902 --> 01:13:27,279
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

558
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:30,908
Your world is pretty terrifying.

559
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:13,533
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

560
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,119
(knocking)

561
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:19,289
(mechanical whirring)

562
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,126
Fuck you, asshole.

563
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:33,011
(mechanical whirring)

564
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,814
God damn.

565
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,316
(Sarah) Thank you.

566
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:47,985
(horn blares)

567
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,240
Is this enough?

568
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:57,077
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

569
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:04,918
- (man) I'm coming.
- We need a room.

570
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,087
- (man) All right.
- With a kitchen.

571
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:08,714
Do you have one with a kitchen?

572
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:27,607
I am dying for a shower.

573
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:31,403
We should check your bandage, too.

574
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:34,656
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

575
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:40,537
Keep this.

576
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,983
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

577
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,319
(mother) But I need
to know where to reach you.

578
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:17,616
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?

579
01:16:17,783 --> 01:16:20,535
I am worried sick here.

580
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:24,456
OK. OK, here's the number.

581
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:26,833
- (Sarah) You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

582
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,673
It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.

583
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,592
- Got it?
- I've got it.

584
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:39,930
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

585
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:41,848
I love you, Mom.

586
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,229
(mother's voice)
I love you, too, sweetheart.

587
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:01,076
(man) Tiki Motel.

588
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:02,536
(normal voice)
Give me your address there.

589
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:07,874
(Sarah) What have we got?

590
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:17,134
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

591
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,927
What's for dinner?

592
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:22,722
- Plastique.
- Mm. That sounds good.

593
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,266
What is it?

594
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:28,728
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

595
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,772
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

596
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,786
Make sure there's none on the threads.

597
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:48,415
Like this.

598
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:52,169
Screw the end cap on.

599
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,630
Very gently.

600
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,677
You must've had a fun childhood.

601
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,765
That's good.

602
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:09,769
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

603
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,200
(Sarah) He'll find us, won't he?

604
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:27,704
(Reese) Probably.

605
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,933
It'll never be over, will it?

606
01:18:56,358 --> 01:18:58,360
Look at me. I'm shaking.

607
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:04,658
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

608
01:19:05,742 --> 01:19:09,663
No, I'm not.

609
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:23,677
Kyle, the women in your time,

610
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,929
what are they like?

611
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,100
Good fighters.

612
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:32,310
That's not what I meant.

613
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,314
Was there someone special?

614
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:39,901
Someone?

615
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,696
A girl, you know.

616
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,573
No.

617
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:49,995
Never.

618
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,206
Never?

619
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:01,548
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

620
01:20:04,426 --> 01:20:06,511
So much pain.

621
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:12,225
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

622
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:14,644
So you feel nothing?

623
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:22,736
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

624
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,448
I didn't know why at the time.

625
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:33,747
It was very old... torn, faded.

626
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:43,590
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

627
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:47,886
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

628
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:51,556
I memorized every line...

629
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:54,934
...every curve.

630
01:20:58,605 --> 01:21:00,523
I came across time for you, Sarah.

631
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:06,738
I love you. I always have.

632
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:26,466
I shouldn't have said that.

633
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:58,391
Think fast.

634
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:00,351
(both chuckle)

635
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:01,895
(dog barking)

636
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:23,750
(gun clicks)

637
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:29,941
Trade places.

638
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:44,289
(Reese) Faster! Drive faster!

639
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,682
(horn blares)

640
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:24,454
- (gunfire)
- (gasping)

641
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,919
(screams)

642
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,383
Kyle! Oh, my God.

643
01:25:58,404 --> 01:25:59,697
(Sarah screams)

644
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,908
(screams)

645
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:11,459
(Reese groaning)

646
01:26:11,626 --> 01:26:12,960
Kyle.

647
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:26,057
(truck horn blaring)

648
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:29,102
- Whoa!
- Son-of-a-bitch!

649
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,814
(tires squealing)

650
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,285
You stay here.

651
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:11,436
Let's get outta here.

652
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:16,357
Get out.

653
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:36,461
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

654
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:47,555
Kyle, come on.

655
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:51,559
Help me! Get out. Get out.

656
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,609
(tires squealing)

657
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:18,002
Don't stop. Run!

658
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,719
(Reese) Sarah!

659
01:30:32,762 --> 01:30:33,638
Kyle.

660
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:42,229
Kyle. Kyle...

661
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,068
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

662
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:07,880
(Sarah) No!

663
01:31:08,381 --> 01:31:09,715
No!

664
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:50,006
(panting)

665
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:06,897
Wait.

666
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:13,362
What are you doing?

667
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,408
Cover, so he can't track us.

668
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:23,039
(machinery whirring)

669
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:30,296
Come on! Come on.

670
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:34,133
- No, Kyle! Come on!
- (grunting)

671
01:32:34,884 --> 01:32:36,635
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

672
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:52,151
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

673
01:32:52,485 --> 01:32:54,653
On your feet!

674
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:56,030
Move it!

675
01:33:46,497 --> 01:33:49,458
(loud mechanical whirring)

676
01:34:08,144 --> 01:34:09,812
(Sarah) Get back. Go back.

677
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,140
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

678
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:47,600
Run!

679
01:34:51,437 --> 01:34:52,396
Run!

680
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:55,149
(Reese) Come on, motherfucker.

681
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:39,276
(grunts)

682
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,784
(shrieks)

683
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:08,097
(yelping)

684
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:50,306
No.

685
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:58,856
(screams)

686
01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:50,467
You're terminated, fucker.

687
01:38:51,343 --> 01:38:52,886
(mechanical whirring)

688
01:38:57,057 --> 01:39:00,394
(fizzling)

689
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:27,463
(shuddering)

690
01:39:33,218 --> 01:39:35,846
(sirens approaching)

691
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,902
Kyle.

692
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:54,865
(indistinct radio chatter)

693
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:14,927
(Sarah) Tape seven.
November 10. Where was I?

694
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:19,723
What's most difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

695
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:24,436
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

696
01:40:24,603 --> 01:40:28,357
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

697
01:40:59,555 --> 01:41:03,016
(both speaking Spanish)

698
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:06,812
Fill her up. (speaks Spanish)

699
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:13,610
(Sarah) Should I tell you
about your father?

700
01:41:13,777 --> 01:41:16,029
Boy, that's a tough one.

701
01:41:17,573 --> 01:41:22,077
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

702
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:27,082
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

703
01:41:27,249 --> 01:41:30,335
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

704
01:41:34,006 --> 01:41:35,882
I suppose I will tell you.

705
01:41:37,718 --> 01:41:39,511
I owe him that.

706
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:44,266
Maybe it'll help if...

707
01:41:44,433 --> 01:41:49,855
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

708
01:41:51,523 --> 01:41:53,942
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

709
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:01,533
(speaking Spanish)

710
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,667
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

711
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:13,712
He is ashamed to ask you
for five American dollars for this picture.

712
01:42:13,879 --> 01:42:17,299
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

713
01:42:17,466 --> 01:42:20,218
Pretty good hustle, kid.

714
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:22,971
(speaking Spanish)

715
01:42:27,184 --> 01:42:29,895
(boy speaking Spanish)

716
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:33,649
(speaking Spanish)

717
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:38,111
What did he just say?

718
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:40,947
He said there's a storm coming in.

719
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:47,245
I know.

720
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:50,957
(wind howling)

721
01:43:01,009 --> 01:43:03,220
(thunder crashes)
