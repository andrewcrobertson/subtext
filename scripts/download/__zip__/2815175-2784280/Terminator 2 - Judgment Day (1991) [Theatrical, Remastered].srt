I swear, I have had it with that goddamn kid.

51
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,907
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

52
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:37,914
Would you get off your butt and help me?

53
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,837
- Todd!
- What?

54
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,292
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

55
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,424
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

56
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,971
- Come on!
- John!

57
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,308
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

58
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:04,152
She's not my mother, Todd.

59
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,389
This next patient is interesting.

60
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,058
I've been following the case for years.

61
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,262
A 29-year-old female,

62
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,229
diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.

63
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,480
The usual indicators: depression, anxiety,

64
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:47,234
violent acting out, delusions of persecution.

65
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:57,031
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.

66
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,084
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

67
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:04,296
which looked human, of course,
was sent back through time to kill her.

68
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:05,623
That's original.

69
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:08,550
And also, that the father of her child

70
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,595
was a soldier sent back to protect her.

71
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,093
- No?
- He was from the future too.

72
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:19,100
The year 2029, if I remember correctly.

73
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,180
And here we are.

74
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:23,061
Morning, Sarah.

75
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,365
Good morning, Dr Silberman. How's the knee?

76
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:35,152
Fine, Sarah.

77
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:41,538
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

78
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:43,710
Repeated escape attempts...

79
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,140
Let's move on, shall we?

80
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:59,976
Lewis, I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

81
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:03,272
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

82
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,831
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?

83
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:31,959
That's right, Officer. What's he done now?

84
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:35,512
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

85
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:38,431
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

86
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:42,136
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

87
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,441
You gonna tell me what this is about?

88
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:49,518
I just need to ask him a few questions.

89
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,983
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

90
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,444
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

91
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:00,370
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

92
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,493
Has that got something to do with this?

93
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,754
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

94
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,674
Thanks for your cooperation.

95
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,420
Please insert your stolen card now.

96
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,687
PIN number.

97
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:30,101
- Hurry up. This is taking too long.
- Go, baby. Go, baby.

98
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,153
All right!

99
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,857
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

100
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:39,489
From my mom. My real mom, I mean.

101
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:43,781
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

102
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

103
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,002
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

104
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:52,752
All right. Easy money. Come on!

105
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,378
Yes! Piece of cake.

106
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:05,765
- Is that her?
- Yes.

107
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,020
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

108
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:13,853
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, okay?

109
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:18,110
She tried to blow up a computer factory,
but she got shot and arrested.

110
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,783
No shit.

111
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,907
She's a total loser.

112
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:25,705
Come on. Let's go spend some money.

113
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:44,804
It's like a giant strobe light

114
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:47,261
burning right through my eyes.

115
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:53,726
Somehow, I can still see.

116
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:01,571
Oh, God.

117
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:08,332
We know the dream's the same every night.

118
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,873
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

119
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,292
Children look like burnt paper.

120
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:21,511
Black.

121
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:24,089
Not moving.

122
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,852
And then the blast wave hits them.

123
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:40,235
And they fly apart like leaves.

124
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:47,367
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

125
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,460
It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.

126
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:57,415
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

127
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:02,719
On August 29, 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

128
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:06,382
Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock

129
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,093
is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?

130
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,312
God! You think you're safe and alive.

131
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,685
You're already dead. Everybody!

132
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:17,314
Him. You. You're dead already.

133
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:20,271
This whole place, everything you see is gone!

134
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,448
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

135
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,242
Cos I know it happened! It happened!

136
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:39,460
I feel much better now.

137
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,417
Clearer.

138
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:47,974
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

139
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:59,526
It's helped me to have a goal,

140
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:02,779
something to look forward to.

141
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,026
What is that?

142
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:10,371
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

143
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:13,119
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

144
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:16,418
and I could have visitors.

145
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:21,002
Well, it's been six months and...

146
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,044
I was looking forward to seeing my son.

147
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:27,755
I see.

148
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:36,021
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

149
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:39,475
Now you think they don't exist?

150
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:41,902
They don't exist.

151
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,695
I know that now.

152
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,693
But you've told me on many occasions

153
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:49,242
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

154
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,614
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

155
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,120
They would have found something
at the factory.

156
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:58,327
I see.

157
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:02,381
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

158
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:07,010
No. Why would they?

159
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,172
Let's try a new position right there.

160
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:14,556
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

161
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,262
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

162
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,141
Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...

163
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,440
Mr Dyson?

164
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:25,316
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

165
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,026
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

166
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:31,076
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

167
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:34,121
You have to sign for the... Er... it.

168
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:37,245
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.

169
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,081
Mr Dyson,

170
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,128
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

171
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,502
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

172
00:22:44,717 --> 00:22:47,255
Well, if you know where "it" came from.

173
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,759
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

174
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,134
"Don't ask."

175
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:00,939
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

176
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:03,228
Insert key.

177
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:06,403
Left on three, two, one, turn.

178
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:12,067
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

179
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:13,447
There you go.

180
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,731
So, what do you think, Doctor?

181
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,560
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

182
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:50,985
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

183
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,525
I know how smart you are.

184
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,243
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

185
00:23:57,498 --> 00:24:00,081
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

186
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:04,286
I think if I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

187
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,968
You have to let me see my son.

188
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,421
Please.

189
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,219
Please.

190
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,388
He's in great danger. He's naked without me.

191
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,347
If I could just make a phone call...

192
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:27,480
Afraid not. Not for a while.

193
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,696
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

194
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:34,194
that you stay here for another six months.

195
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,779
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

196
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:45,119
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

197
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:47,579
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

198
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:51,875
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

199
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:57,255
You don't know what you're doing!

200
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,724
Model citizen.

201
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:45,686
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

202
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:47,480
He said he was going to the galleria?

203
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:48,727
Yeah.

204
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,559
The galleria?

205
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,982
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

206
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:56,666
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

207
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,376
No.

208
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:04,425
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

209
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,607
- John.
- Not now.

210
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:15,652
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

211
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:21,028
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

212
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:23,155
- Just go.
- Yeah.

213
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,407
I saw that kid...

214
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:30,743
Hey!

215
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,807
Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!

216
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,531
Hey!

217
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,706
Get down.

218
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:26,654
Mister, are you all right?

219
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:45,547
Come on!

220
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:27,135
Goddamn!

221
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:08,659
Okay. Time out. Stop the bike.

222
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:10,790
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

223
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:27,227
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

224
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,475
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

225
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,525
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

226
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:48,332
Holy shit! You're really real.

227
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:52,210
I mean...

228
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:59,252
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

229
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,257
I'm a cybernetic organism:

230
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,010
living tissue over metal endoskeleton.

231
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,943
This is intense.

232
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,867
Get a grip, John. Okay.

233
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:28,531
You're not here to kill me.

234
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:32,663
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

235
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:35,462
My mission is to protect you.

236
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:38,165
Yeah? Who sent you?

237
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:40,458
You did.

238
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,010
35 years from now,

239
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:45,589
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

240
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:48,551
Oh, this is deep.

241
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:53,684
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

242
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,359
Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.

243
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:03,486
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

244
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,823
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

245
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:09,697
Where are we going?

246
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:13,117
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

247
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,583
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

248
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:20,757
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

249
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:23,631
- You sure?
- I would.

250
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:36,981
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

251
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,652
...but I gotta warn them.

252
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:43,196
Shit! You got a quarter?

253
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,909
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

254
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:57,335
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

255
00:37:57,546 --> 00:37:59,833
- Are you guys okay?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's okay.'

256
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:03,042
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

257
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:06,720
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

258
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,469
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

259
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:11,095
I'm making beef stew.

260
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,393
Something's wrong. She's never this nice.

261
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:15,971
John, where are you?

262
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,933
What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?

263
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:22,269
Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!

264
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:23,820
The dog's really barking.

265
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:26,114
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

266
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:32,579
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

267
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,815
Could he already be there?

268
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:39,373
- Honey, are you okay?
- I'm right here. I'm fine.

269
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,079
'Are you sure you're all right?'

270
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:44,087
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

271
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,927
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfie?

272
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,596
I can hear him barking. Is he okay?

273
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,470
Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.

274
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,302
Where are you?

275
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:58,972
Your foster parents are dead.

276
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:37,970
No, no. I need a minute here.

277
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:42,354
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

278
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,901
Anything it samples by physical contact.

279
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:46,899
Get real.

280
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:50,733
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

281
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,613
No, only an object of equal size.

282
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:55,241
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

283
00:39:55,456 --> 00:39:57,493
It can't form complex machines.

284
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,665
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

285
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,163
It doesn't work that way.

286
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:04,167
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

287
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:06,374
Knives and stabbing weapons.

288
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,634
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

289
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:13,213
at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.

290
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,638
He killed 17 police officers that night.

291
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,388
Men with families...

292
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:24,357
...children.

293
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:30,196
These were taken at a mall in Reseda today.

294
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:35,489
Miss Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

295
00:40:37,665 --> 00:40:41,955
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

296
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,035
That the foster parents have been murdered.

297
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:46,497
We know this guy's involved.

298
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:51,551
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

299
00:40:55,933 --> 00:41:02,055
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

300
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:06,475
She's grown more and more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

301
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:08,356
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

302
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:12,235
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

303
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,782
Sure.

304
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,736
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

305
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,035
Yes, sir.

306
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,744
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

307
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:26,920
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

308
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:32,668
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

309
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,086
running guns.

310
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:37,139
Then there were some other guys.

311
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:39,090
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

312
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,519
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

313
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:46,310
Then she gets busted.

314
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:50,018
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

315
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:56,233
It's like everything I'd been brought up
to believe was all made-up bullshit.

316
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,865
I hated her for that.

317
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,825
But everything she said was true.

318
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,078
She knew.

319
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,333
And nobody believed her.

320
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,010
Not even me.

321
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,798
Listen, we gotta get her out of there.

322
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:23,351
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

323
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:26,471
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

324
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,647
Great. What happens to her?

325
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,602
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

326
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,779
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

327
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,107
Negative. It's not a mission priority.

328
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:39,318
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

329
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:44,039
Goddamn it! What's your problem? Damn it!

330
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,084
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

331
00:42:47,294 --> 00:42:49,627
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

332
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,751
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

333
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:53,878
Let me go!

334
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:02,175
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

335
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,682
What?

336
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:13,484
You have to do what I say, huh?

337
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:15,779
That's one of my mission parameters.

338
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:20,567
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

339
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:24,120
Yes!

340
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,917
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

341
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,130
- You okay, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

342
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:38,756
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

343
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:41,179
Dipshit?

344
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:45,217
Put your leg down.

345
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:50,101
- Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

346
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:52,558
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

347
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:55,393
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

348
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:58,651
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douche bag?

349
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,073
Get off me!

350
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,406
No!

351
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,954
Put the gun down, now!

352
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,334
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

353
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:23,179
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

354
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,382
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

355
00:44:27,728 --> 00:44:30,266
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

356
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:33,690
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

357
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,984
You got that?

358
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:38,528
You just can't go around killing people.

359
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:39,604
Why?

360
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:42,736
What do you mean, why? Cos you can't.

361
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:43,782
Why?

362
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:46,657
Because you just can't. Trust me on this.

363
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:56,170
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

364
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:59,796
And I order you to help me.

365
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:26,567
Hi!

366
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:30,822
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

367
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:33,278
They've been in there for an hour.

368
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:35,830
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

369
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:40,326
Oh, here come your friends now.

370
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:01,935
Well, that was productive.

371
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,393
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

372
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:48,144
How 'bout a beer?

373
00:48:48,363 --> 00:48:49,774
Yeah, right!

374
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:17,306
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

375
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:19,429
Must be my lucky day.

376
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,487
I think you're right about number 24.

377
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:47,414
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.

378
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:49,834
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:06,812
You!

380
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,144
You broke my arm.

381
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,942
There are 215 bones in the human body.

382
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:17,691
That's one. Now, don't move.

383
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:25,365
What are you gonna do?

384
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,037
Why do we stop now?

385
00:52:32,379 --> 00:52:36,089
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

386
00:52:36,299 --> 00:52:38,757
- Right.
- Swear?

387
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,335
What?

388
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:43,547
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

389
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:48,593
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

390
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:59,521
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

391
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:07,571
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

392
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:10,706
You crazy bastard!

393
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,247
Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.

394
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:22,543
He'll live.

395
00:53:37,402 --> 00:53:39,394
Son of a bitch!

396
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,192
Let's try to remain calm.

397
00:53:42,407 --> 00:53:44,194
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

398
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,321
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

399
00:53:46,536 --> 00:53:48,653
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

400
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:50,704
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

401
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,532
It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.

402
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,083
I don't believe you can do it.

403
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:55,535
You're already dead, Silberman.

404
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:57,165
Everybody dies. You know I believe it.

405
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,999
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

406
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:09,515
Back off!

407
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:11,012
Get back!

408
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:13,015
I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!

409
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,434
Don't move!

410
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:20,735
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

411
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,608
Get in the office. On the floor, face down.

412
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:24,904
Not you!

413
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:26,607
Open the door.

414
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,863
On the floor. Hold it open. Face the wall!

415
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:50,590
Get her! Get her!

416
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,371
Sarah!

417
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:21,420
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

418
00:55:22,424 --> 00:55:24,381
Let's go! Open it!

419
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:25,378
Get the other door!

420
00:55:27,012 --> 00:55:28,844
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

421
00:55:34,394 --> 00:55:36,556
Let's go around! Come on! Move it!

422
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:03,249
No!

423
00:56:03,465 --> 00:56:04,797
No!

424
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:09,844
- No!
- Mom, wait!

425
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:11,341
Mom!

426
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:20,517
- Come back here!
- No! No!

427
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:22,230
No!

428
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:23,933
- Help her!
- Wait here.

429
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:25,643
Hurry up!

430
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,819
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

431
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:29,112
Hold her.

432
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:32,361
He'll kill us all!

433
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,257
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

434
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,267
Come with me if you want to live.

435
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:05,691
It's okay, Mom. He's here to help. It's okay.

436
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,626
Go.

437
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:06,494
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

438
00:58:21,436 --> 00:58:22,768
Get down.

439
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,077
No! Mom!

440
00:58:59,224 --> 00:59:00,590
Out of the car!

441
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,179
Right now!

442
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:29,664
Go!

443
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,134
I'm out.

444
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,847
- Come on.
- Here.

445
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:54,481
Reload.

446
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,412
Last one!

447
01:00:12,547 --> 01:00:14,163
Hang on.

448
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:41,774
Ready!

449
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:48,705
John!

450
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:57,414
Here, drive.

451
01:01:51,104 --> 01:01:53,096
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

452
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,476
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

453
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:01,024
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

454
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,657
Cool.

455
01:02:09,414 --> 01:02:10,950
Come here.

456
01:02:17,088 --> 01:02:18,704
I said I was okay.

457
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:22,633
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

458
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:25,878
God damnit! You have to be smarter than that.

459
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:27,554
You almost got yourself killed.

460
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,515
What were you thinking?

461
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,053
You cannot risk yourself, even for me.

462
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:35,604
Do you understand?

463
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:39,980
You're too important. Do you understand?

464
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:43,979
But...

465
01:02:45,825 --> 01:02:49,409
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

466
01:02:50,788 --> 01:02:52,996
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

467
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:01,830
What's wrong with your eyes?

468
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,342
Nothing.

469
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:17,641
So, what's your story?

470
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:29,278
You okay?

471
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:30,905
Fine.

472
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,914
Say, that's a nice bike.

473
01:03:57,939 --> 01:04:00,056
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

474
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:10,866
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

475
01:04:11,077 --> 01:04:13,911
I have detailed files on human anatomy.

476
01:04:14,872 --> 01:04:19,833
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

477
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:21,080
Correct.

478
01:04:27,426 --> 01:04:29,133
Does it hurt when you get shot?

479
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:33,555
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain".

480
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:38,056
John, help me with the light.

481
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:40,103
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

482
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:44,729
Good. If you can't pass for a human,
you're not much good to us.

483
01:04:44,944 --> 01:04:47,903
How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.

484
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,777
120 years with my existing power cell.

485
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,826
Can you learn stuff that
you haven't been programmed with,

486
01:04:54,036 --> 01:04:55,698
so you can be...

487
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:01,284
...you know, more human,
and not such a dork all the time?

488
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:07,380
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

489
01:05:07,592 --> 01:05:11,302
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

490
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,128
Cool.

491
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:46,078
Are we learning yet?

492
01:05:59,101 --> 01:06:02,060
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

493
01:06:05,983 --> 01:06:07,815
Just head south.

494
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:17,826
Keep it under 65.

495
01:06:18,037 --> 01:06:20,654
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

496
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:26,369
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

497
01:06:26,587 --> 01:06:30,001
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

498
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,378
You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>

499
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:36,382
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

500
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:40,716
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby."

501
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:43,343
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

502
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:46,104
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

503
01:06:46,315 --> 01:06:49,103
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

504
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:53,733
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

505
01:06:54,657 --> 01:06:56,569
That's great. See? You're getting it.

506
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:58,696
<i>No problemo.</i>

507
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:15,213
Want some of my fries?

508
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:29,014
- Need any help?
- No.

509
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:32,601
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

510
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,652
I did! I came round here and I got you!

511
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:38,528
No, you didn't!

512
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,527
We're not gonna make it, are we?

513
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:45,572
People, I mean.

514
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:50,578
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.

515
01:07:51,756 --> 01:07:54,373
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

516
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:57,460
Break it up before
I wring both of your necks.

517
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:03,932
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

518
01:08:04,143 --> 01:08:07,602
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

519
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:09,638
Who is that?

520
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:12,975
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

521
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,896
Why him?

522
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:21,817
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

523
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:25,821
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

524
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,450
Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier
of military computer systems.

525
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:33,249
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

526
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:34,796
becoming fully unmanned.

527
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:38,125
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

528
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:40,711
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

529
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:44,219
The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.

530
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:47,346
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

531
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:50,269
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

532
01:08:50,481 --> 01:08:54,646
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

533
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,153
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

534
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:01,698
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

535
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:04,401
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

536
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,658
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

537
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:10,115
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

538
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:12,121
will eliminate its enemies over here.

539
01:09:12,336 --> 01:09:13,827
Jesus!

540
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:18,419
How much do you know about Dyson?

541
01:09:20,678 --> 01:09:22,419
I have detailed files.

542
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:25,547
I wanna know everything.

543
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:30,936
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

544
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,166
Wait in the car.

545
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:21,603
Enrique!

546
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:24,155
Are you here?

547
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,922
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

548
01:10:43,344 --> 01:10:44,939
And you...

549
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:49,186
are always like a snake.

550
01:10:51,268 --> 01:10:53,260
It's great to see you, Connor!

551
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:54,515
I told you I would be back.

552
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,438
I knew you would. It's good to see you.

553
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:58,481
Jolanda!

554
01:10:58,692 --> 01:11:01,901
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

555
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:05,230
- Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i>
- What's up?

556
01:11:05,449 --> 01:11:07,156
CONTINUES IN SPANISH) Who's this big guy?

557
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:12,329
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

558
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:14,371
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

559
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,996
Uncle Bob, huh?

560
01:11:17,586 --> 01:11:20,078
Okay. Okay!

561
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:22,546
How are you?

562
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:26,047
How are you? You've grown so much.

563
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:27,753
Drink?

564
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:33,300
Uncle Bob?

565
01:11:34,395 --> 01:11:38,389
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

566
01:11:38,607 --> 01:11:40,745
Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.

567
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,568
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

568
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:48,107
I just came for my stuff.

569
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:50,783
I need clothes, food and one of your trucks.

570
01:11:50,995 --> 01:11:52,952
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

571
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:55,655
Now, Enrique!

572
01:11:56,709 --> 01:12:00,498
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

573
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,813
One thing about my mom...

574
01:12:25,654 --> 01:12:27,771
...she always plans ahead.

575
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:39,290
Excellent.

576
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:53,676
This is my best truck I got,
but the starter motor's gone.

577
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:55,678
You got time to change it out?

578
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:58,931
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

579
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:05,896
See, I grew up in places like this,
so I just thought that's how people lived,

580
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:10,606
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.

581
01:13:15,496 --> 01:13:17,112
That's definitely you.

582
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:31,342
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks,

583
01:13:31,553 --> 01:13:35,217
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

584
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:38,596
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

585
01:13:39,561 --> 01:13:41,974
Mom screwed it up, of course.

586
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:44,226
She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day

587
01:13:44,441 --> 01:13:46,808
and me being this world leader.

588
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:51,605
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

589
01:13:54,034 --> 01:13:55,115
Here.

590
01:13:56,161 --> 01:14:00,576
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

591
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:05,377
Yeah, I guess. When I'm, like, 45, I think.

592
01:14:06,672 --> 01:14:09,836
I sent him back through time to 1984.

593
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:11,917
Man!

594
01:14:13,637 --> 01:14:15,924
He hasn't even been born yet.

595
01:14:17,683 --> 01:14:19,640
It messes with your head.

596
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,888
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

597
01:14:31,864 --> 01:14:35,278
Mom and him were only together for one night.

598
01:14:35,492 --> 01:14:40,658
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

599
01:14:40,873 --> 01:14:45,287
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

600
01:14:49,548 --> 01:14:51,039
Why do you cry?

601
01:14:52,176 --> 01:14:53,963
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

602
01:14:54,178 --> 01:14:56,636
I don't know. We just cry.

603
01:14:57,598 --> 01:14:59,931
You know, when it hurts.

604
01:15:06,231 --> 01:15:11,226
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

605
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:14,404
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

606
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:16,426
- Get it?
- No.

607
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:18,991
All right, my man!

608
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:22,412
<i>- No problemo.</i>
- Give me five.

609
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,870
Just put out your hand, like this.

610
01:15:28,253 --> 01:15:31,963
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

611
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:34,011
All right!

612
01:15:37,137 --> 01:15:39,470
Okay, that's good. Up high! High five!

613
01:15:40,599 --> 01:15:41,715
Five low.

614
01:15:42,634 --> 01:15:44,125
Too slow.

615
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:48,722
I'm just kidding. One more time.

616
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:51,024
Good. Now try it. Good!

617
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:52,976
Now do me. Give me five.

618
01:15:54,696 --> 01:15:56,688
'Watching John with the machine,

619
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:59,069
it was suddenly so clear.

620
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:02,243
'The Terminator would never stop.

621
01:16:02,454 --> 01:16:06,118
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

622
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:09,747
'never shout at him or get drunk and hit him

623
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:12,249
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

624
01:16:13,298 --> 01:16:18,009
'It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.

625
01:16:19,763 --> 01:16:22,756
'Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,

626
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:27,310
'this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

627
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:32,728
'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

628
01:17:05,767 --> 01:17:10,603
Come here, darling.

629
01:18:10,374 --> 01:18:12,582
Hey, let's try this one.

630
01:18:17,964 --> 01:18:19,500
There we go.

631
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:08,152
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

632
01:20:08,366 --> 01:20:11,359
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

633
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:13,319
Mom, wait!

634
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:30,511
"No fate".

635
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:34,056
"No fate, but what we make."

636
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:37,844
My father told her this.

637
01:20:40,857 --> 01:20:45,443
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

638
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:51,862
Never mind.
Now, okay, the whole thing goes...

639
01:20:52,077 --> 01:20:54,694
The future's not set.

640
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:58,327
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

641
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:03,037
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

642
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:06,213
Oh, shit!

643
01:21:06,424 --> 01:21:08,211
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

644
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:11,794
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

645
01:21:12,013 --> 01:21:13,879
She's gonna blow him away.

646
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:15,965
Come on! Let's go!

647
01:21:16,184 --> 01:21:17,846
Let's go! Come on!

648
01:21:28,613 --> 01:21:31,606
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

649
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:35,569
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

650
01:21:35,787 --> 01:21:40,282
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

651
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,867
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

652
01:21:43,086 --> 01:21:44,793
I don't care!

653
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:46,792
Haven't you learned anything yet?

654
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:49,169
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

655
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,803
Danny, I told you to go to bed.
I'm not kidding.

656
01:21:58,018 --> 01:22:01,261
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

657
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,946
Danny, your time is up!

658
01:22:12,157 --> 01:22:14,945
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

659
01:22:43,688 --> 01:22:44,895
Danny!

660
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:00,404
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

661
01:23:02,123 --> 01:23:03,159
Miles?

662
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,331
Miles!

663
01:23:08,546 --> 01:23:10,833
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

664
01:23:18,056 --> 01:23:19,968
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

665
01:23:20,183 --> 01:23:21,299
Run!

666
01:23:21,518 --> 01:23:23,134
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

667
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:44,580
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

668
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:48,284
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

669
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:52,167
Get down on the floor, bitch. Get down now!

670
01:23:52,382 --> 01:23:54,123
Get out of the way.

671
01:23:54,342 --> 01:23:55,924
Don't hurt him!

672
01:23:57,637 --> 01:23:59,173
Get on the floor now!

673
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:03,932
Just let the boy go.

674
01:24:04,144 --> 01:24:06,978
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

675
01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:09,646
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

676
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:11,975
- It's all your fault!
- What?

677
01:24:12,193 --> 01:24:14,185
I'm not gonna let you do it.

678
01:24:32,839 --> 01:24:33,955
Shhh!

679
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:39,426
Shhh.

680
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:08,656
Shit! We're too late!

681
01:25:12,879 --> 01:25:13,869
Check them.

682
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:21,085
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

683
01:25:22,055 --> 01:25:23,591
Look at me.

684
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,557
I almost...

685
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:29,681
I almost...

686
01:25:39,489 --> 01:25:43,529
It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.
We'll figure something out. Okay?

687
01:25:45,495 --> 01:25:46,827
I promise.

688
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:55,874
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

689
01:25:58,967 --> 01:26:00,754
I love you, John.

690
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:04,762
I always have.

691
01:26:06,224 --> 01:26:08,056
I know.

692
01:26:14,524 --> 01:26:16,561
Deep penetration.

693
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:20,106
No shattered bone.

694
01:26:20,321 --> 01:26:23,109
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

695
01:26:34,043 --> 01:26:37,207
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

696
01:26:40,508 --> 01:26:44,548
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

697
01:26:57,609 --> 01:27:00,727
Oh, God! No!

698
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:15,495
Oh, my God!

699
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:26,252
Oh, my God.

700
01:27:26,471 --> 01:27:28,929
Now, listen to me very carefully.

701
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:34,719
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

702
01:27:34,938 --> 01:27:38,978
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

703
01:27:39,192 --> 01:27:42,776
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

704
01:27:42,987 --> 01:27:46,025
'The history of things to come.

'It's not every day that you find out
you're responsible for three billion deaths.

706
01:27:52,497 --> 01:27:55,080
'He took it pretty well.'

707
01:27:56,501 --> 01:27:59,084
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

708
01:28:05,593 --> 01:28:10,179
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

709
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:16,552
How were we supposed to know?

710
01:28:18,648 --> 01:28:20,264
Yeah!

711
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:21,974
Right.

712
01:28:22,902 --> 01:28:25,986
How were you supposed to know?

713
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:29,781
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.

714
01:28:29,993 --> 01:28:34,203
Men like you thought it up.

715
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:41,039
You think you're so creative.

716
01:28:41,254 --> 01:28:44,292
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

717
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:48,091
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

718
01:28:48,303 --> 01:28:50,545
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

719
01:28:50,763 --> 01:28:52,129
Mom!

720
01:28:53,099 --> 01:28:56,718
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

721
01:28:56,936 --> 01:28:58,893
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

722
01:28:59,105 --> 01:29:00,812
But I thought...

723
01:29:02,025 --> 01:29:05,860
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

724
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:09,609
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

725
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:12,487
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

726
01:29:12,702 --> 01:29:16,286
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

727
01:29:16,497 --> 01:29:19,490
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

728
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:24,420
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

729
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:29,045
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

730
01:29:29,886 --> 01:29:32,720
Everything. I don't care.

731
01:29:34,724 --> 01:29:35,510
The chip.

732
01:29:36,142 --> 01:29:37,678
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

733
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:39,385
They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

734
01:29:39,604 --> 01:29:40,845
It must be from the other one like you.

735
01:29:41,064 --> 01:29:45,434
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

736
01:29:45,651 --> 01:29:48,234
They told us not to ask where they got it.

737
01:29:48,446 --> 01:29:50,654
Those lying motherfuckers.

738
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:52,527
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

739
01:29:52,742 --> 01:29:56,444
I mean, it was smashed, it didn't work,
but it gave us ideas,

740
01:29:56,662 --> 01:29:59,530
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

741
01:30:01,793 --> 01:30:03,785
All my work was based on it.

742
01:30:04,003 --> 01:30:05,665
It must be destroyed.

743
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:10,966
Can you get us in? Past security?

744
01:30:11,177 --> 01:30:14,090
I think so, yeah. When?

745
01:30:18,142 --> 01:30:19,098
Now?

746
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:26,019
'The future, always so clear to me,

748
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:34,903
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

749
01:31:10,361 --> 01:31:14,856
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

750
01:31:16,617 --> 01:31:18,449
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

751
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,701
Hi!

752
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:21,987
...take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.

753
01:31:22,206 --> 01:31:25,370
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

754
01:31:25,585 --> 01:31:27,577
I need written authorisation...

755
01:31:28,796 --> 01:31:32,506
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

756
01:31:43,478 --> 01:31:45,014
Come on. It's okay.

757
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:49,606
It takes two keys to open the vault.
They have to be turned simultaneously.

758
01:31:49,817 --> 01:31:52,480
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

759
01:31:54,113 --> 01:31:55,354
Gibbons?

760
01:31:58,618 --> 01:32:03,283
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

761
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,824
Gibbons!

762
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:09,622
Oh, shit.

763
01:32:27,605 --> 01:32:29,642
My card should access this.

764
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:35,478
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

765
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:38,526
The silent alarm's been tripped.

766
01:32:44,664 --> 01:32:47,452
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

767
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:51,251
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

768
01:32:52,505 --> 01:32:53,916
No.

769
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:58,797
We go all the way. Okay?

770
01:33:01,097 --> 01:33:04,761
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

771
01:33:04,976 --> 01:33:06,387
I think it's that guy from the mall.

772
01:33:06,602 --> 01:33:07,513
It is!

773
01:33:07,728 --> 01:33:09,890
It's him and the woman.

774
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:14,066
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

775
01:33:16,654 --> 01:33:19,897
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

776
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:26,741
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

777
01:33:32,003 --> 01:33:33,960
John, fire in the hold!

778
01:33:46,142 --> 01:33:50,807
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

779
01:33:58,112 --> 01:34:00,445
You have to wait until the gas clears.

780
01:34:03,075 --> 01:34:04,191
Put this on.

781
01:34:18,466 --> 01:34:20,708
All right, let's get to work.

782
01:34:42,114 --> 01:34:45,152

- Primer cord is set.

- Remote control.

you have to...

- Ready.

- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

821
01:40:08,315 --> 01:40:11,274
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:18,907
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

- You got it?
- Yeah.

- It's him.

Goddamn! You all right...

852
01:50:06,831 --> 01:50:08,788
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

853
01:50:11,294 --> 01:50:13,035
- Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

854
01:50:17,091 --> 01:50:18,298
Are you hurt?

855
01:50:31,147 --> 01:50:34,936
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

856
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:36,482
Hurry!

857
01:50:41,657 --> 01:50:44,491
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

858
01:50:45,244 --> 01:50:48,237
Come on! Go!

859
01:50:54,378 --> 01:50:56,244
What the hell...

860
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,882
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

861
01:51:06,891 --> 01:51:08,177
Here. This'll work.

862
01:51:14,482 --> 01:51:16,223
He's gaining.

863
01:51:18,194 --> 01:51:20,982
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

864
01:51:21,197 --> 01:51:23,234
I can run faster than this!

865
01:51:33,584 --> 01:51:34,870
Coming up, to the right.

866
01:51:37,546 --> 01:51:38,878
Watch it! Watch it!

867
01:52:01,821 --> 01:52:03,562
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

868
01:52:11,455 --> 01:52:12,991
Take the off-ramp.

869
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:23,836
Shit!

870
01:52:27,888 --> 01:52:28,753
Hold on!

871
01:53:14,769 --> 01:53:15,555
Don't stop!

872
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,481
Go straight!

873
01:53:27,573 --> 01:53:29,030
- Look out!
- Duck!

874
01:53:44,298 --> 01:53:45,789
Get the hell outta here!

875
01:53:51,764 --> 01:53:54,427
Get outta here! Let's go!

876
01:55:11,635 --> 01:55:13,797
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

877
01:56:03,896 --> 01:56:04,852
We don't have much time.

878
01:56:27,962 --> 01:56:28,748
Let's go.

879
01:56:30,047 --> 01:56:31,583
Come on, Mom. We gotta get outta here.

880
01:56:31,799 --> 01:56:33,756
Come on! Get up!

881
01:56:47,648 --> 01:56:49,059
Hand me the shotgun.

882
01:56:54,029 --> 01:56:56,146
Put your weight on me, Mom.

883
01:56:57,241 --> 01:56:58,857
Hurry!

884
01:57:02,579 --> 01:57:04,070
Come on, Mom.

885
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:12,879
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

886
01:57:28,063 --> 01:57:29,850
This way. Come on.

887
01:57:41,285 --> 01:57:43,823
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

888
01:57:44,038 --> 01:57:45,154
Go back.

889
01:57:53,505 --> 01:57:55,622
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

890
01:57:56,258 --> 01:57:57,715
John, you've got to go now.

891
01:57:57,926 --> 01:57:59,918
- John!
- Go! Now!

892
01:58:00,137 --> 01:58:01,469
No!

893
01:59:14,753 --> 01:59:16,369
Get up the steps.

894
01:59:18,382 --> 01:59:19,543
Go on.

895
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:28,006
Come on, Mom. I got you. Come on.

896
01:59:53,625 --> 01:59:54,411
No!

897
02:00:02,676 --> 02:00:04,884
Grab the chain. Grab it.

898
02:00:06,263 --> 02:00:08,880
Grab it. Go. Go!

899
02:00:19,526 --> 02:00:22,519
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

900
02:00:22,738 --> 02:00:24,195
Come on!

901
02:00:25,115 --> 02:00:26,697
Mom!

902
02:00:26,909 --> 02:00:29,071
Mom! Mom! Mom!

903
02:01:05,155 --> 02:01:06,566
Agh!

904
02:01:12,204 --> 02:01:13,115
Call to John.

905
02:01:15,123 --> 02:01:16,239
No!

906
02:01:16,792 --> 02:01:17,999
I know this hurts.

907
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:21,460
- Ugh!
- Call John.

908
02:01:38,897 --> 02:01:40,809
Call to John now.

909
02:01:42,943 --> 02:01:44,229
Fuck you!

910
02:04:56,052 --> 02:04:59,591
John? John!

911
02:05:00,974 --> 02:05:03,182
John? Help!

912
02:05:05,937 --> 02:05:07,303
John!

913
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:12,771
John?

914
02:05:15,113 --> 02:05:16,445
John!

915
02:05:18,575 --> 02:05:19,782
John.

916
02:05:20,744 --> 02:05:22,235
John.

917
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:26,447
- Mom.
- Help me.

918
02:05:27,751 --> 02:05:29,492
Help me.

919
02:05:31,046 --> 02:05:32,036
Help me.

920
02:05:32,255 --> 02:05:33,371
Get out of the way, John.

921
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:34,455
Shoot!

922
02:06:18,218 --> 02:06:19,629
Mom!

923
02:06:29,396 --> 02:06:30,853
Get down!

924
02:07:02,596 --> 02:07:04,053
No!

925
02:08:05,241 --> 02:08:07,449
Get up. Come on.

926
02:08:09,663 --> 02:08:11,199
Holy shit!

927
02:08:11,414 --> 02:08:13,076
I need a vacation.

928
02:08:27,597 --> 02:08:31,261
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

929
02:08:34,813 --> 02:08:36,395
Will this melt in there?

930
02:08:39,651 --> 02:08:41,233
Yes. Throw it in.

931
02:08:46,116 --> 02:08:46,947
<i>Adiós!</i>

932
02:08:48,993 --> 02:08:51,155
And the chip.

933
02:09:05,635 --> 02:09:07,046
It's over.

934
02:09:09,597 --> 02:09:10,633
No.

935
02:09:14,185 --> 02:09:15,551
There's one more chip.

936
02:09:20,567 --> 02:09:22,524
And it must be destroyed also.

937
02:09:28,199 --> 02:09:29,565
Here.

938
02:09:29,784 --> 02:09:33,778
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

939
02:09:39,419 --> 02:09:40,955
No.

940
02:09:42,255 --> 02:09:43,041
No.

941
02:09:46,426 --> 02:09:48,793
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

942
02:09:49,012 --> 02:09:51,004
No, it'll be okay. Stay with us.

943
02:09:51,222 --> 02:09:53,088
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

944
02:09:53,308 --> 02:09:55,766
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

945
02:09:55,977 --> 02:09:58,720
- I must go away, John.
- No!

946
02:09:59,397 --> 02:10:00,478
No, wait.

947
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:03,433
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

948
02:10:04,611 --> 02:10:06,648
No, don't do it! Don't go!

949
02:10:06,913 --> 02:10:08,649
It has to end here.

950
02:10:09,991 --> 02:10:13,155
I order you not to go! I order you not to go!

951
02:10:13,369 --> 02:10:14,860
I order you not to go!

952
02:10:21,419 --> 02:10:23,160
I know now why you cry.

953
02:10:25,673 --> 02:10:27,835
But it's something I can never do.

954
02:11:02,961 --> 02:11:04,543
Goodbye.
