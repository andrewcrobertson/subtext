1
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:09,087
What the hell? Goddamn
son of a bitch...

2
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,155
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,101
What the hell?

4
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,823
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:25,794
Me.

6
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:29,866
Come on.

7
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:33,004
Hey, what's wrong
with this picture?

8
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,113
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,886
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:55,441
Washday tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,310
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:00,429
I think this guy's a couple
cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:01,907
Your clothes.

14
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,726
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,187
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:40,169
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:45,375
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,844
She's always after me.

19
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:50,046
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:54,711
Hey, buddy. Did you just
see a real bright light?

21
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:58,430
See that guy?

22
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,716
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,753
- Hey! I said hold it!
- Go!

24
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,790
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:55,604
- What day is it? The date!
- 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:58,007
- What year?!
- What?

27
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,855
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:41,393
<i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>

29
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:09,649
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:15,221
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,507
So am I.

32
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:03,368
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

33
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,793
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

34
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,934
Yes, sir.

35
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:15,663
- OK, who gets the burly beef?
- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,966
- I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries.
- He gets the barbecued beef.

37
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,752
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly beef?

38
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,405
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

39
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:24,506
Aah!

40
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:28,812
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

41
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,932
This isn't real leather, is it?

42
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,283
This special sucks.

43
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,822
Nice going, kid. Ought
to give you the tip.

44
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:44,761
Look at it this way... in a hundred
years, who's going to care?

45
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,703
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

46
00:13:57,106 --> 00:14:00,877
That's Italian. You
can go pump or auto.

47
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,597
The .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

48
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:08,150
These are brand-new. We just
got them in. That's a good gun.

49
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:11,387
Just touch the trigger, the beam
comes on, and you put the red dot

50
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:14,206
where you want the bullet
to go. You can't miss.

51
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,559
Anything else?

52
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:20,062
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

53
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,164
Just what you see, pal.

54
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,183
The Uzi 9mm.

55
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:30,822
You know your weapons, buddy. Any one
of these is ideal for home defense.

56
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,876
So, uh... which will it be?

57
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,094
All.

58
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,663
I may close early today.

59
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:43,268
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

60
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,354
You can't do that.

61
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,039
Wrong.

62
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,217
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

63
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:19,956
Listen, I need you to come pick
me up. My bike just broke down.

64
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:23,425
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

65
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:28,647
Hey, man, you got a
serious attitude problem.

66
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,453
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

67
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,267
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

68
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:42,637
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

69
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,518
It's so incredible. You're
not gonna believe this.

70
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,602
Sit down. You are
going to love this.

71
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,446
- Shh!
- What?

72
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:54,013
<i>Has been compiled

73
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:57,219

103
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,693
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

104
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,694
Ed.

105
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,033
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

106
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,803
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

107
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:19,807
shot six times at less than ten
feet. Large caliber weapon.

108
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,441
You know, these work.

109
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:24,544
What's this?

110
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:28,148
Dead girl 2, sent over from
Valley Division this afternoon.

111
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:34,739
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
- Look at the name, Ed.

112
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:39,660
Sarah Louise... Connor.
Is this right?

113
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:42,396
You're kidding me.

114
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,166
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over the place.

115
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,056
A one-day pattern killer.

116
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,445
I hate the weird ones.

117
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:55,609
So...

118
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,413
Better than mortal man deserves.

119
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:11,158
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

120
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,993
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

121
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,367
<i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>

122
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:21,857
There you are, young man.

123
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:26,415
- You mind your mother.
<i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>

124
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:31,462
<i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
Uh, something's come up,</i>

125
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,964
<i>and it looks like I won't
be able to make it tonight.</i>

126
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:37,501
<i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm
really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>

127
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:40,504
<i>Call you in a day or so,
OK? Sorry. Bye.</i>

128
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:45,375
That bum. So what if
he has a Porsche?

129
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:48,847
He can't treat you like this. It's
Friday night, for Christ's sake!

130
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:51,982
I'll live.

131
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,551
I'll break his kneecaps.

132
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,289
Well... Pugsley still loves
me, don't you, baby?

133
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:03,093
God. It's disgusting.

134
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,713
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
- OK.

135
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:09,916
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will. You, too.

136
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,002
OK.

137
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,890
Damn it, Matt!

138
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,064
Oh, shit.

139
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,932
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings

140
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,236
occurred in the same order as
their listings in the phone book?

141
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,538
Now, what can I tell you
guys? No comment.

142
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,407
But, lieutenant, we've
got two murders...

143
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:38,921
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,857
I put a cigarette out in it.

145
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,461
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine.

146
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,903
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

147
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:49,432
There's no answer at the door, and
the apartment manager's not home.

148
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:50,308
Call her.

149
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,517
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

150
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:54,629
Give me a cigarette.

151
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:06,899
<i>Hi there.</i>

152
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:12,371
<i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to
a machine, but don't be shy, it's OK.</i>

153
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:21,697
Same shit.

154
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:27,369
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called
the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

155
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:32,607
I hate these press cases,
especially the weird press cases.

156
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:36,729
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

157
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,264
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

158
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:43,519
If I can get on the tube by eleven
o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

159
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:45,121
Well...

160
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,307
- How do I look?
- Like shit, boss.

161
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,775
Your mama.

162
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:51,145
Lieutenant!

163
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:54,330
<i>This just in. Police have
announced the name of the victim</i>

164
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:58,317
<i>in the second of two execution-style
murders which took place today.</i>

165
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,788
<i>Incredibly, the names of the two
victims are virtually identical.</i>

166
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,935
<i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann
Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>

167
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,028
<i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i>
- Can we change this?

168

This is 1-L19. I got a
hit-and-run felony.

246
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:21,365
Suspect vehicle... late model gray
Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

247
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,801
He's really moving, punching
lights all the way.

248
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:28,189
I'm going to need an ambulance
at 7th and Broadway right now.

249
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:30,358

252
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,441

253
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:03,489
Are you injured? Are you shot?

254
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,292
No!

255
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:12,297
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

256
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:16,636
Don't move unless I say. Don't
make a sound unless I say.

257
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:18,338
Do you understand?

258
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:22,558
- Do you understand?!
- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.

259
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:44,530
I'm here to help you. I'm
Reese, Sergeant Techcom,

260
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:49,418
DN38416, assigned to protect you.
You've been targeted for termination.

261
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:58,144
<i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>

262
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:03,882
This is 1-L19. Westbound on
Olympic approaching Overland.

263
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:11,668
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

264
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:15,347
No, but you will. It's very
important that you live.

265
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:19,417
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...

266
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,888
He's not a man. A machine.

267
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:26,339
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.

268
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,635
A machine?

269
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:41,186
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

270
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:43,033
A cybernetic organism.

271
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:45,992
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

272
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,512
Get your head down!

273
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:38,693
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

274
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:43,364
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

275
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:47,185
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

276
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:49,620
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

277
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:54,109
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

278
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:55,677
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...

279
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:58,914
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.

280
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,140
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.

281
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,776
But these are new.
They look human...

282
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:14,863
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

283
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,833
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

284
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:24,498
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

285
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:28,585
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

286
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:35,433
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

287
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:39,021
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

288
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,158
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

289
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,411
- Right.
- Right.

290
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:56,838
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

291
00:42:57,106 --> 00:42:58,590
Don't do that again.

292
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:01,093
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

293
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:05,748
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.

294
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,020
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

295
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:15,324
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.

296
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:19,061
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!

297
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:21,913
Until you are dead.

298
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,242
Can you stop it?

299
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,930
I don't know.

300
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:43,518
With these weapons, I don't know.

301
00:43:59,652 --> 00:44:02,572
<i>All units. All units. Gray Ford
suspect vehicle's been found</i>

302
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,240

303
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:48,566
Reese.

304
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,620
Why me?

305
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,674
Why does it want me?

306
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:04,249
There was a nuclear war...

307
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:08,253
A few years from now.

308
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,324
All this...

309
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:15,895
This whole place. Everything.

310
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:18,129
It's gone.

311
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:21,467
Just gone.

312
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:23,736
There were survivors.

313
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:26,355
Here. There.

314
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,960
Nobody even knew who started it.

315
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,030
It was the machines, Sarah.

316
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:41,436
- I don't understand.
- Defense network computers.

317
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,841
New... powerful...

318
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:50,846
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.

319
00:45:51,214 --> 00:45:56,467
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

320
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:01,691
Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,
not just the ones on the other side.

321
00:46:02,758 --> 00:46:05,661
Decided our fate in
a microsecond...

322
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:08,997
extermination.

323
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:25,512
Did you see this war?

324
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:40,677
No. I grew up after it...

325
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:43,981
In the ruins. Starving...

326
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,400
- Hiding from HKs.
- HKs?

327
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:51,521
Hunter-killers. Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

328
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:57,012
Most of us were rounded up, put
in camps for orderly disposal.

329
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,531
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

330
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,741
Some of us were
kept alive... to work...

331
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:16,062
Loading bodies. The disposal
units ran night and day.

332
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,500
We were that close
to going out forever.

333
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:25,839
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

334
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:31,712
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.

335
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,883
He turned it around. He brought
us back from the brink.

336
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:40,094
His name was Connor. John Connor.

337
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:42,222
Your son, Sarah.

338
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:45,292
Your unborn son.

339
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:36,353
Drive!

340
00:49:43,178 --> 00:49:46,245
Reese!

341
00:50:04,032 --> 00:50:07,533
No, Reese! No! No!
No! They'll kill you.

342
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:10,954
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands now!

343
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:15,058
Get out of the car!

344
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,598
Drop to your knees!

345
00:50:20,965 --> 00:50:23,733
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

346
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:54,063
Sarah...

347
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,734
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

348
00:50:59,402 --> 00:51:04,424
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...
maybe I should look at the bodies.

349
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:07,327
No. They've been identified,
and there's no doubt.

350
00:51:07,395 --> 00:51:09,562
Oh, God.

351
00:51:09,564 --> 00:51:11,231
God!

352
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:13,400
Ginger!

353
00:51:16,637 --> 00:51:18,071
Sarah.

354
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:21,742
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

355
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,795
I want you to tell him
everything that Reese told you.

356
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:28,432
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

357
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,735
You're a doctor?

358
00:51:32,203 --> 00:51:35,856
- Criminal psychologist.
- Is Reese crazy?

359
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:38,353
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

360
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:07,246
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

361
00:53:08,682 --> 00:53:14,120
With the 132nd, under
Perry. From '21 to '27.

362
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:19,041
- That's the year 2027?
- That's right. And I was assigned...

363
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,710
This is fucking great.

364
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:23,098
The last two years
under John Connor.

365
00:53:23,124 --> 00:53:26,432
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for...

366
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:28,951
Oh, damn. Sorry.

367
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:32,321
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdine systems.

368
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:33,823
I see.

369
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:40,363
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy,

370
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,083
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived,

371
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,452
a sort of retroactive abortion?

372
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:49,254
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

373
00:53:49,322 --> 00:53:52,081
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

374
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,060
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.

375
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:56,245
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

376
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:59,215
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

377
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:03,536
It had no choice. Their
defense grid was smashed.

378
00:54:03,603 --> 00:54:07,757
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

379
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:11,110
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

380
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:15,064
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?

381
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:18,234
Uh... the time
displacement equipment?

382
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:22,605
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

383
00:54:22,772 --> 00:54:26,075
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

384
00:54:26,242 --> 00:54:28,260
How are you supposed get back?

385
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:29,954
I can't.

386
00:54:31,632 --> 00:54:33,633
Nobody goes home.

387
00:54:35,135 --> 00:54:41,174
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.

388
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:28,780
It's just him and me.

389
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:36,304
Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?

390
00:56:36,372 --> 00:56:39,308
Don't you have ray guns?

391
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:41,142
Ray guns.

392
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,745
Show me a piece of
future technology.

393
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:48,055
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

394
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:50,285
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

395
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:54,623
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- OK, OK. But this...

396
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:58,227
- Cyborg, if it's metal...
- Surrounded by living tissue!

397
00:56:58,295 --> 00:56:59,478
Oh. Right, right...

398
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:03,281
This is great stuff. I could
make a career out of this guy.

399
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:06,216
You see how clever this part is? How
it doesn't require a shred of proof?

400
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:10,288
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant.

401
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,974
Why were the other
two women killed?

402
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,169
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

403
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:21,077
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.

404
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:24,744
They just knew the city. The
Terminator was just being systematic.

405
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:28,583
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...
- Look, you have heard enough!

406
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:32,143
I have answered your questions!
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

407
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:35,597
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

408
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:37,666
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here?

409
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,501
- Reese...
- Shut up!

410
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:42,637
You still don't get it, do you?

411
00:57:42,805 --> 00:57:46,240
He'll find her.
That's what he does!

412
00:57:46,308 --> 00:57:50,045
That's all he does!
You can't stop him!

413
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:54,284
He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!

414
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:57,068
- Doc.
- Let... let go of me!

415
00:58:00,722 --> 00:58:02,090
Sorry.

416
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:10,648
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...

417
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:12,383
He's a loon.

418
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:16,155
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

419
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:20,625
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll
stop a twelve-gauge round.

420
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:25,371
This other individual must have been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.

421
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:29,066
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

422
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:31,753
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand

423
00:58:31,821 --> 00:58:34,651
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...

424
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,191
- You see this scar?
- Here.

425
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,726
Thank you.

426
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:42,214
There's a couch in this other room. Why don't
you stretch out and try to get some sleep?

427
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,762
It'll be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

428
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:47,753
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

429
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:52,073
Well, it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

430
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:58,247
You'll be perfectly safe. We got
thirty cops in this building.

431
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:00,481
Thank you.

432
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,489
- Good night.
- Good night.

433
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:24,813
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

434
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,998
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

435
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:29,678
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

436
00:59:29,704 --> 00:59:32,462
- Where is she?
- Look, it may take a while...

437
00:59:32,488 --> 00:59:34,792
if you want to wait, there's
a bench over there.

438
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:47,646
I'll be back.

439
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:16,475
What the hell was that?

440
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:27,085
Gunshot!

441
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:38,765
- What is it, terrorists?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

442
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,920
Stay here.

443
01:00:58,584 --> 01:00:59,640
Let's get out of here!

444
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,647
- Come on! Come on!
- He's got an automatic weapon!

445
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,275
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

446
01:01:17,904 --> 01:01:19,954
What the hell happened
to the lights?

447
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,027
Watch him.

448
01:01:46,499 --> 01:01:49,384
Automatic weapons!
Lock and load! Let's go!

449
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:18,945
Fire! Fire!

450
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:34,962
Ed.

451
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:37,198
Hey!

452
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:05,109
Sarah!

453
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:08,062
Reese!

454
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,418
This way.

455
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:56,401
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

Take this.

461
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:17,281
All right, let's get
this off the road.

462
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:51,882
- You cold?
- Freezing.

463
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:07,181
Reese...

464
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:10,384
You got a first name?

465
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:11,868
Kyle.

466
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:16,607
Kyle... what's it like
when you go through time?

467
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,278
White light.

468
01:05:23,915 --> 01:05:25,483
Pain.

469
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:32,439
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

470
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:35,543
I caught one back there.

471
01:05:37,111 --> 01:05:40,247
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

472
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:44,218
- We got to get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

473
01:05:44,386 --> 01:05:47,221
What do you mean,
forget it? Are you crazy?

474
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,707
Take this off.

475
01:06:01,453 --> 01:06:02,935
Jesus.

476
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:05,538
See, it passed right
through the meat.

477
01:06:06,006 --> 01:06:10,794
Oh, this is going to make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?

478
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:11,949
What?

479
01:06:11,975 --> 01:06:15,999
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

480
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:18,852
He's about my height.

481
01:06:22,506 --> 01:06:24,608
He has your eyes.

482
01:06:27,846 --> 01:06:29,847
What's he like?

483
01:06:30,114 --> 01:06:34,252
You trust him. He's got a strength.

484
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,938
I'd die for John Connor.

485
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:44,344
Well... at least now I know
what to name him.

486
01:06:44,712 --> 01:06:47,103
I don't suppose you
know who the father is,

487
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:50,025
so I won't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.

488
01:06:50,068 --> 01:06:52,502
John never said much about him.

489
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,639
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait!

490
01:06:57,475 --> 01:06:59,343
I don't want to know.

491
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:03,513
So, was it John that sent you here?

492
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:05,549
I volunteered.

493
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:07,917
Why?

494
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:13,457
It was a chance to meet the
legend... Sarah Connor.

495
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:18,512
Taught her son to fight, organize,

496
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,898
prepare from when he was a kid.

497
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:23,417
When you were in hiding
before the war...

498
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:30,490
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

499
01:07:30,558 --> 01:07:33,193
- It's driving me crazy.
- Aah!

500
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:38,766
Are you sure you have
the right person?

501
01:07:39,134 --> 01:07:40,801
I'm sure.

502
01:07:41,469 --> 01:07:44,907
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

503
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:51,879
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

504
01:07:54,916 --> 01:08:00,271
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this
honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

505
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:08,228
Your son gave me a message to
give to you. Made me memorize it.

506
01:08:09,196 --> 01:08:12,283
"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.

507
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:17,021
I can't help you with what you must soon face
except to say that the future is not set.

508
01:08:17,022 --> 01:08:19,674
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

509
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:24,613
You must survive, or I will
never exist". That's all.

510
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:30,000
It's a good field dressing.

511
01:08:30,919 --> 01:08:34,956
You like it? It's my first.

512
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:41,761
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

513
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:46,933
OK.

514
01:08:57,461 --> 01:08:59,562
Talk to me some more.

515
01:09:02,566 --> 01:09:04,202
About what?

516
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:07,970
Tell me about where you're from.

517
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:11,741
All right.

518
01:09:13,277 --> 01:09:17,947
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.

519
01:09:18,015 --> 01:09:22,187
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

520
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:29,742
But they're not too bright. John
taught us ways to dust them.

521
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:33,145
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

522
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:36,749
The Terminators were the
newest... The worst.

523
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,444
<i>Traversing your sector
in search mode.</i>

524
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:51,680
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

525
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:54,884
<i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>

526
01:09:56,452 --> 01:09:58,020
Let's go.

527
01:09:58,187 --> 01:10:00,004
<i>Intercept. Over.</i>

528
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,609
<i>There are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.</i>

529
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:09,015
<i>Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid
contact. We'll get them later.</i>

530
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:11,367
<i>Roger, echo leader.</i>

531
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:21,093
<i>- Sector niner, what's your status?
- Situation normal.</i>

532
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:40,412
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

533
01:10:43,049 --> 01:10:46,835
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

534
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,392
<i>Any infiltrators at
the shopping mall?</i>

535
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:59,298
<i>No problem. They were clean. We're
cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>

536
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:03,652
<i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.</i>

537
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:20,212
Terminator! Terminator!

538
01:13:37,356 --> 01:13:39,791
I was dreaming about dogs.

539
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:43,329
We use them to spot Terminators.

540
01:13:44,596 --> 01:13:47,265
Your world is pretty terrifying.

541
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:29,708
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?

542
01:14:37,317 --> 01:14:39,635
Fuck you, asshole.

543
01:14:58,254 --> 01:15:00,155
Goddamn!

544
01:15:00,923 --> 01:15:02,691
Thank you.

545
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:09,264
Uh, is this enough?

546
01:15:09,932 --> 01:15:13,236
Yeah, it's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.

547
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:21,143
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

548
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:23,079
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

549
01:15:23,612 --> 01:15:25,413
Do you have one with a kitchen?

550
01:15:37,476 --> 01:15:39,212
Mmm.

551
01:15:40,879 --> 01:15:43,415
I am dying for a shower.

552
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:47,436
We should check your bandage, too.

553
01:15:48,103 --> 01:15:50,839
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

554
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:57,112
Keep this.

555
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:26,225
No, I can't tell you where I am,
mom. I was told not to say.

556
01:16:26,226 --> 01:16:28,425
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>

557
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:31,872
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

558
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:36,176
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>

559
01:16:36,769 --> 01:16:38,604
OK.

560
01:16:39,772 --> 01:16:42,707
- OK, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

561
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:46,418
<i>It's 408-555...</i>

562
01:16:46,444 --> 01:16:48,636
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.

563
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:50,962
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.

564
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:52,916
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

565
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:57,655
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more
right now. I love you, mom.</i>

566
01:17:01,393 --> 01:17:03,994
I love you, too, sweetheart.

567
01:17:16,223 --> 01:17:19,426
<i>- Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

568
01:17:22,213 --> 01:17:23,780
What have we got?

569
01:17:27,218 --> 01:17:28,935
Mothballs.

570
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,680
Corn syrup.

571
01:17:31,823 --> 01:17:35,059
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

572
01:17:35,827 --> 01:17:38,862
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.

573
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,464
What is it?

574
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:44,901
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

575
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:47,138
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

576
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,119
Make sure there's
none on the threads.

577
01:18:02,987 --> 01:18:04,655
Like this.

578
01:18:06,491 --> 01:18:08,526
Screw the end cap on.

579
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:12,295
Very gently.

580
01:18:14,465 --> 01:18:17,501
You must've had a fun childhood.

581
01:18:20,471 --> 01:18:22,172
That's good.

582
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:26,977
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.

583
01:18:37,521 --> 01:18:39,722
He'll find us, won't he?

584
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,027
Probably.

585
01:19:01,744 --> 01:19:04,097
It'll never be over, will it?

586
01:19:12,407 --> 01:19:14,843
Look at me. I'm shaking.

587
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:21,032
Some legend, huh? You must
be pretty disappointed.

588
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,602
No. I'm not.

589
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:36,179
Kyle...

590
01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:41,751
The women in your time...
what are they like?

591
01:19:43,955 --> 01:19:45,890
Good fighters.

592
01:19:46,257 --> 01:19:48,358
That's not what I meant.

593
01:19:50,561 --> 01:19:52,662
Was there someone special?

594
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:59,268
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.

595
01:20:00,371 --> 01:20:01,938
No.

596
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:06,159
Never.

597
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:09,362
Never?

598
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:17,771
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

599
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:22,859
So much pain.

600
01:20:23,961 --> 01:20:28,666
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

601
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:30,884
So you feel nothing?

602
01:20:35,974 --> 01:20:39,042
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.

603
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:45,815
I didn't know why at the
time. It was very old...

604
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:50,253
Torn... faded.

605
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:59,797
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.

606
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,953
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.

607
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:07,914
I memorized every line,

608
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,365
every curve.

609
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:17,464
I came across time for you, Sarah.

610
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:23,020
I love you. I always have.

611
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:42,539
I shouldn't have said that.

612
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:15,648
Think fast!

613
01:24:44,754 --> 01:24:46,455
Trade places!

614
01:24:57,183 --> 01:25:00,636
Faster! Drive faster!

615
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:51,720
Kyle!

616
01:25:52,387 --> 01:25:54,022
Oh, my God!

617
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:29,375
Kyle.

618
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:45,624
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

619
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:02,825
You stay here.

620
01:27:26,266 --> 01:27:28,200
Let's get out of here.

621
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:32,971
Get out.

622
01:27:49,523 --> 01:27:52,775
Kyle. Come on, get up.

623
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:00,828
He's coming.

624
01:28:00,854 --> 01:28:03,719
Kyle? Come on!

625
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:08,276
Help me! Get out! Get out!

626
01:28:08,602 --> 01:28:10,174
Get out!

627
01:28:19,435 --> 01:28:21,019
Come on!

628
01:28:27,076 --> 01:28:28,927
Faster!

629
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:34,816
Don't stop! Run!

630
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:48,416
Sarah!

631
01:30:48,884 --> 01:30:50,535
Kyle!

632
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:58,960
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

633
01:31:00,196 --> 01:31:03,381
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

634
01:31:22,985 --> 01:31:24,536
No!

635
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:26,538
No!

636
01:32:21,727 --> 01:32:23,528
Wait!

637
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:33,304
- What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.

638
01:32:43,232 --> 01:32:48,069
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

639
01:32:49,205 --> 01:32:53,158
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.

640
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:54,760
Get up!

641
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:08,940
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!

642
01:33:09,007 --> 01:33:12,560
On your feet! Move it!

643
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:26,217
Back. Go back.

644
01:35:00,303 --> 01:35:02,571
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

645
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,172
Run!

646
01:35:07,643 --> 01:35:09,211
Run!

647
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:11,563
Come on, motherfucker.

648
01:37:04,476 --> 01:37:06,760
No, no.

649
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:07,063
You're terminated, fucker.

650
01:40:04,654 --> 01:40:06,223
Kyle.

651
01:40:08,327 --> 01:40:14,280
<i>6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super
Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i>

652
01:40:27,161 --> 01:40:30,997
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

653
01:40:31,965 --> 01:40:36,269
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

654
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:40,891
But I guess I have a while yet before you're
old enough to even understand these tapes.

655
01:40:40,959 --> 01:40:45,096
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.

656
01:41:15,543 --> 01:41:18,979
<i>- Gasolina, por favor.
- ¿Cuánto?</i>

657
01:41:19,447 --> 01:41:23,550
<i>- Llena el tanque.</i>
- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>

658
01:41:27,187 --> 01:41:32,359
Should I tell you about your
father? Boy, that's a tough one.

659
01:41:33,661 --> 01:41:38,499
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

660
01:41:40,267 --> 01:41:42,966
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

661
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:46,839
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

662
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:55,682
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.

663
01:41:57,985 --> 01:42:00,521
Maybe it'll help if...

664
01:42:00,588 --> 01:42:05,526
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...

665
01:42:07,595 --> 01:42:10,164
We loved a lifetime's worth.

666
01:42:13,801 --> 01:42:17,121
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo pena decirle</i>

667
01:42:17,122 --> 01:42:22,492
<i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>

668
01:42:23,026 --> 01:42:26,962
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...

669
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:30,400
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,

670
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:33,270
but if he doesn't, his
father will beat him.

671
01:42:33,438 --> 01:42:35,472
Pretty good hustle, kid.

672
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:39,209
<i>- Cuatro
- Sí, sí.</i>

673
01:42:40,177 --> 01:42:41,578
<i>Gracias.</i>

674
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,081
