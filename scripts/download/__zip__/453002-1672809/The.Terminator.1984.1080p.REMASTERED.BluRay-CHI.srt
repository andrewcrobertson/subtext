It can't be reasoned with.

- Mmm, that sounds good.

640
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:44,901
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

- A girl. You know.

No.

You just disconnect it.

John Connor gave me a

Torn... faded.

You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.

672
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,953
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.
